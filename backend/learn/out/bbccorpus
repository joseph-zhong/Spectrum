Frequently considered the song that rescued his solo career and made Robbie the household name artist he is today, Angels is a towering, incredible ballad. Written at a low point, the song was reportedly written in just 20 minutes with Robbie's longtime songwriting collaborator Guy Chambers.

Sharpen your pencils. Now Theresa May has her prize from the Commons, getting the Article 50 bill (she never wanted) through with no major changes, it makes its way to the red and gold end of the Palace of Westminster, to the Lords.

The first debate is set for 20 February. More than 140 Peers have already put their names down to speak. But at that stage there probably won't be a vote. A week later the thornier more detailed committee stage begins. Then the last certain stage, the third reading and report is scheduled for 7 March.

If it all goes according to the government's plan, which sources say is "hugely unpredictable", it would allow Theresa May to stick to her timetable and push the button for exit talks to start the next week, once the Bill has been rubber-stamped by the other Palace. (It's daft in this business to make too many predictions, but I'd put a fiver on that happening on Wednesday 15 March.)

The government will have a bumpier ride in the Lords after a grumpy process in the Commons. The Lords is dramatically different because the government most certainly does not have a majority among peers. And, it is the Lords' express purpose to scrutinise and if needed, improve draft laws before sending them back along the corridor to the Commons.

Overnight a government source suggested that the Lords had better jolly well let the Brexit bill go through, or else. Despite the sabre-rattling though, the atmosphere in the Lords is less febrile than that language might suggest.

Downing Street this morning tried to dampen down the aggressive briefing. And one source in the Lords described the threat as "total BS" - I'll leave you to work that out.

The main opposition leader, Baroness Smith, has made it plain on several occasions that although the Lords may try to tweak the Bill, Labour, broadly, has no intention of trying to block it. Her modus operandi is to "hold to account, not hold to ransom".

The Liberal Democrats are more intent on making changes in the Lords, for it is there they can wield power, rather than in the Commons. But unless they have the support of Labour too, there is a limit to how much trouble they can cause.

The chatter suggests the Lords will push for concessions from the government over the rights of EU citizens to stay here, reporting the progress of negotiations regularly to Parliament and maybe on a final "meaningful vote" for both Houses on the deal.

It will be up to the government to decide whether to tweak the bill slightly as they did in the Commons or risk some defeats. Insiders predict it is likely the Lords may end up sending back the bill to the Commons once, as "ping pong" to force the government to make a change or two. But even senior Lib Dem sources don't expect hostile stand-offs for weeks on end.

The Lords will make their voices heard, there is no question about that and the Article 50 bill could run into trouble.

It would be wrong to suggest that ministers don't anticipate a tricky time. But today at least, whatever the sabre-rattling from some parts of government, this historic piece of legislation looks likely to be the subject of a few skirmishes in the Lords, rather than an apocalyptic battle.Although many countries are saddled with stereotypes, in Switzerland’s case they’re dead on.

The alpine nation really is highly efficient. And meticulously punctual. Clean, too. For chronically tardy, resolutely inefficient (not to mention slovenly) people like myself, a visit to Switzerland yields a cocktail of emotions: awe, relief and a dash of irritation.

For the Swiss, punctuality is not merely a nicety, a bonbon in the buffet of life. It is a source of deep contentment. The Swiss, it seems, subscribe to the German philosopher Schopenhauer’s definition of happiness as “an absence of misery”. They derive genuine joy from the fact that life unfolds on time and in a highly efficient manner.

Whenever I visit Switzerland, I go through several stages of punctuality reaction. At first it delights me, especially if I’m coming from neighbouring Italy or France with their rather more flexible approach to timekeeping. By contrast, life in Switzerland is sturdy and dependable, like a Saint Bernard dog. If someone says they will meet me at 2 pm, they arrive at 2 pm not 2:05 (or 1:55, for that matter). I like this. For a while.

Then it annoys me. The extreme punctuality strikes me as a kind of stinginess, and I find myself agreeing with the English writer Evelyn Waugh who said that “punctuality is the virtue of the bored.”

That is unfair though, and finally, invariably, I come to appreciate Swiss punctuality for what it is: a deep expression of respect for other people. A punctual person is a considerate one. By showing up on time – for everything – a Swiss person is saying, in effect, “I value your time and, by extension, I value you.”

It’s no coincidence that the Swiss are the world’s watchmakers. Which came first – the precise timekeepers or the precise people? Hard to say, but the result is the same: a nation where the trains – and everything else – really do run on time. Then there are the toilets.

“Have you seen our public toilets?” asked Dieter, a Swiss doctor, over an afternoon beer in Geneva. “They are very clean.” He’s right. Swiss toilets are indeed clean, as is everything else too. In some countries it would be suicidal to drink the tap water. In Switzerland it is fashionable to do so; the water comes from natural springs.

How to explain this cleanliness and punctuality? No one knows for sure. But a popular theory is that, historically, it stems from the unforgiving, mountainous terrain. Either you planted your crops on time and harvested them promptly or, well, you starved.

Punctuality, sadly, is a dying art in many parts of the world. Mobile phones are partly to blame. We feel less compelled to arrive on time if we can always text to say we’re running a few minutes late. I don’t sense that is happening in Switzerland, though.

Susan Jane Gilman, an American author who has lived in Geneva for the past 11 years, recounted with awe how she’s “never had a taxi that arrived late, that wasn’t there exactly when it said it would be”. She marvelled at how, for instance, when she’s ordered a new refrigerator, the company gives her a precise two-hour window for delivery – and sticks to it.

Switzerland has changed her. Once a “chronically late person”, Gilman is now meticulously punctual. “I feel a greater respect for people’s time,” she said, sounding very Swiss.

The flip side, though, is that when she visits New York, her hometown, she is annoyed by the relative lack of punctuality: the bus that is 15 minutes behind schedule or doesn’t show up at all, the friends who saunter into a restaurant 30 minutes late. “My friends will say ‘Suze hon, this isn’t Switzerland, relax. They’ll hold our table.’ But I’ve gotten anal. I get annoyed if people are late.”

Punctuality is not without its drawbacks. For one thing, it creates a kind of bunching effect. Coffee shops in Swiss cities tend to be crowded at 4pm every day because everybody takes their coffee break at exactly 4pm. In apartment buildings, residents must abide by a strict weekday schedule for use of the laundry room.

Extreme punctuality also creates an expectation, and if that expectation is not met, disappointment ensues. On those rare occasions that things do not function smoothly, the Swiss get flustered – and angry. Recently, the country was thrown into a tizzy with the disturbing news that only 87.5% of the trains run by the federal railroad arrived within three minutes of their scheduled time, shy of their 89% target.

But perhaps that frustration has some merit. After all, Switzerland has some fierce competition when it comes to punctuality. In Japan, the Shinkansen bullet trains make the Swiss railroads look downright tardy. The average annual delay? Thirty six seconds.

The Story of Life has been produced in collaboration with Sir David Attenborough, BBC Earth and ideas and innovation company AKQA.The blue whale is, famously, the largest animal to ever live.

Think for a minute what that means. According to some estimates, there are about 7.7 million animal species alive today, and who knows how many more have lived on Earth since the first animals appeared about 650 million years ago.

Those species include elephants, whale sharks, polar bears, tyrannosaurs, and titanosaurs – all species with a reputation for large size. But not one of them is, or was, as large as the blue whale.

How did these leviathans get so record-shatteringly big? There are a number of ways to look at this question.

Back in 2011, a team of scientists looked at the size and age of fossils and ran a series of computations to determine the maximum rate of evolution in mammals. They learned that it has taken about five million generations for whales to increase their body mass 5,000 times.

Something really, really small aided whales in their journey to getting really, really big

The fossil evidence suggests that some land animals take about twice as long to go through the equivalent amount of bulking up. So not only did whales get big, but they did so extraordinarily quickly.

"We think there are two key reasons why whales can evolve big size faster than other mammals," says lead author Alistair Evans, an evolutionary biologist at Monash University in Australia.

"The first is because they live in water their body doesn't have to hold up their weight, so there's a lot less stress on a big body in water than there is on land." In other words, physics played a big role here.

But there was also something else, says Evans. Something really, really small aided whales in their journey to getting really, really big.

Blue whales are baleen whales: they belong to the Mysticeti, a suborder of whales that can filter tiny organisms out of the sea with their bristly baleen mouth combs. The earliest baleen whales evolved about 38.8 million years ago, when the filter-feeders first diverged from the toothed whales.

Gigantism may have evolved independently in baleen whales up to four times

You might expect that these early Mysticeti were giants, similar to modern species like the blue whale.

But according to a study published in October 2016, the suborder's most recent common ancestor was no more than 5m in length. That is not even half the length of your average school bus, the universally-accepted comparison measurement for Things That Are Big.

Clearly, something must have happened to select for larger Mysticeti between then and now. Even the pygmy right whale, the smallest of the living baleen whales, can grow up to 6m long.

In fact, according to lead author Cheng-Hsiu Tsai, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Japan, gigantism may have evolved independently in baleen whales up to four times.

That means gigantism is not a fluke, but a trend.

Compared to the rest of the whales, baleen whales are much more likely to grow huge. Of course, plenty of other species of baleen whale both large and small have emerged and disappeared over the last 38.8 million years, but looking at the ones that remain should tell us something about what works for these whales.

There are several reasons why an animal would tend towards gigantism. Superior size is generally a good way to ward off predators, compete for mates, endure periods of resource scarcity, and conserve heat. Staying warm is extremely important for aquatic creatures.

A few tens of millions of years before baleen whales got started, Earth's seas were emptied of most species

But there are also problems associated with being colossal. Namely, how do you find enough fuel to feed an engine that big? And that brings us back to baleen.

When the Mysticeti evolved these long, keratinous filters, they gained access to a superabundant new food source, says Evans.

Instead of having to spend energy hunting a single prey item like a fish or seal, energy that could be wasted if it escapes, the baleen whales simply glide through dense clouds of krill like aquatic combine harvesters, swallowing up to 457,000 calories in one gulp.

Animals with this ability would also have been more suited for long, trans-global migrations, which some scientists believe may explain why larger whales survived while countless smaller species disappeared over the millennia.

But there is one final contributor to blue whale gigantism that cannot be overlooked. A few tens of millions of years before baleen whales got started, Earth's seas were emptied of most species.

"Think of this: the large, marine reptiles in the Mesozoic essentially occupied the similar niche as the most successful aquatic mammals," says Tsai.

If something – most likely a comet or asteroid – had not come along and removed all of these marine monsters from the equation about 66 million years ago, then the blue whale's ancestors might never have established a foothold in the oceans at all.

I think it's unlikely that the largest animals we know of are at the maximum

Similarly, once the mammals were there, they were able to exploit the niches formerly locked down by giant sea-dwellers like plesiosaurs and mosasaurs.

It is also important to remember that a similar deus ex machina could just as easily await the blue whale. It took millions of years of evolution to build the world's largest animal, a feat owed as much to its habitat and lifestyle as to its origin story. Then, in fewer than 100 years, humans hunted these behemoths to the edge of extinction.

It has been illegal to hunt blue whales since 1966 and, thanks to this protection, blue whale populations are generally on the rise. However, there is some evidence to suggest that climate change will alter Earth's oceans in ways that are not very favourable for krill. That means the blue whale's continued survival is anything but certain.

If they can stick around, blue whales and their kin may continue to get even bigger.

"I think it's unlikely that the largest animals we know of are at the maximum, either on land or in the sea," says Evans.

None of us will be around to see it, of course. But given the rates of evolution Evans estimates whales are capable of, it is entirely possible that the largest animal to ever live has not even been born yet.

Donald Trump came into office promising to change the face of American politics and transfer power "back to the people".

After four weeks in the White House, he said "incredible progress" had been made, having signed some two dozen executive actions and put his signature to several bills.

He also fired his scandal-hit national security adviser and an acting attorney general, who defied his seven-nation travel ban, which later suffered an appeals court defeat.

So what has President Trump achieved so far? In the weeks and months to come, we'll be tracking the progress he makes on his agenda and how it is received by the American public.

What executive actions has Trump taken?

One way President Trump is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders and memoranda, which allow him to bypass the legislative process in Congress in certain policy areas.

I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done President Trump, 16 February

He wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege, quickly moving to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, cut business regulations and push ahead with completing the construction of two controversial pipelines.

While it may appear that President Trump has been signing executive actions at an unprecedented rate, he has signed less than President Obama did during the same period in office.

Mr Trump has used many of these actions to deliver on some of his campaign promises, but many of his promises cannot be fulfilled by executive action alone.

For example, his first executive order was designed to limit the effect of the Affordable Care Act, better know as Obamacare, but his promise of repealing and replacing it can only be enacted by Congress.

In-depth: The executive actions Trump has taken

What are presidential executive orders?

How are his approval ratings?

When Mr Trump took the oath of office on 20 January he did so with the lowest approval rating of any incoming president.

He dismissed those polls as "rigged" but the strength of the opposition to him was evident when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets the day after his inauguration.

Most presidents begin their term with strong approval numbers, but President Trump has bucked that trend. While both George W Bush and Barack Obama were enjoying approval numbers in the 60s after one month in office, Mr Trump is around the 40% mark.

Donald Trump: Unchained and unapologetic

Mr Trump won the election with low approval numbers so it's unsurprising they're still low, but the scandal over his team's contacts with Russia and his controversial travel ban have kept them falling.

Do the numbers matter? Maybe not, for now. Republicans control both the House and Senate so in theory he can pursue his legislative agenda without worrying about his ratings - as long as he keeps his Republican colleagues on side.

But if his ratings stay low or fall further, expect some dissenting voices to emerge in the party as Republicans start to worry about midterm elections in 2018.

For now though, there are signs that many of Mr Trump's supporters are happy with his progress - some we spoke to in Pennsylvania said he was doing "a fabulous job". You can hear their views here.

Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake

How and why did Trump's key adviser resign?

How is the economy faring under Trump?

When Barack Obama became president in 2009, the US was in the midst of its worst recession since the 1930s, with the economy shedding 800,000 jobs in his first month.

But after a few dips later that year, the US economy saw its longest ever period of job creation. In total, 11.3 million jobs were created under President Obama.

President Obama and the tale of US jobs

Despite those strong numbers, President Trump described the economy as a "mess" and said he had "inherited many problems" from his predecessor.

He has vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become "the greatest jobs president... ever". We'll track the monthly jobs report to see what progress he makes.

President Trump has cited the strong stock market as a sign that his policies are already having an effect, saying there has been a "tremendous surge of optimism in the business world".

The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes all closed at record highs on 15 February in a partial sign at least that investors were encouraged by Mr Trump's planned infrastructure projects, deregulation and tax cuts.

But the president will need to avoid the backlash that followed his ban on immigrants coming into the US from seven mainly Muslim countries if he wants the stock market to continue hitting new highs.

All of the three major indexes fell slightly after Mr Trump's controversial executive order caused protests at airports across the country - and Silicon Valley lashed out at the president as well.

Latest news on the US economy

Has Trump moved to cut illegal immigration?

Immigration was President Trump's signature issue during the election campaign and he signed two executive orders on 25 January designed to fulfil his promises.

The first declared that the US would build a "physical wall" or similar "impassable physical barrier" - to the delight of all of those Americans who spent 2016 chanting: "Build the wall!"

It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay it, although he has repeatedly insisted that the US will recoup the costs from the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise.

There is already some 650 miles of fencing along the border, but we'll monitor what progress President Trump makes in turning it into what he has called the "Great Wall".

Who is going to pay for Trump's border wall?

Mr Trump's second executive order on border security said 10,000 more immigration officers would be hired to track down illegal immigrants - but extra funds will need to be signed off by Congress before this can happen.

His talk of a crackdown on illegal immigrants makes it sound as if they had an easy ride under President Obama, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest the opposite is true.

Between 2009 and 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals - leading some to label President Obama the "deporter-in-chief".

At one point, Mr Trump pledged to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - but he backed away from that after the election.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has launched a series of raids across the country since Mr Trump was elected, but it's still too early to say if deportation arrests have increased.

Has Trump started a new deportation drive?

Is arrest of 'dreamer' a sign of things to come?

What has been done on healthcare?

Healthcare was an early test for President Trump and the Republican Party.

President Obama's Affordable Care Act helped more than 20 million previously-uninsured Americans to finally get health cover - but Mr Trump said he would act quickly to "repeal and replace" it.

While the Republican-controlled Congress has started efforts to repeal what's know as Obamacare, it is unclear whether they will try to replace it completely or just repair elements of it.

Can Obamacare be repealed?

US patients await Obamacare's fate

The scheme has faced several problems along the way and premium hikes in 2016 helped the Republicans frame it as a failure during the election campaign.

But a report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that 18 million people could lose their insurance within a year if Congress repealed parts of it without having a new system in place.

Senior Republicans have said legislation to replace it will be unveiled in March.Image caption The mobile site works on a range of devices and screen sizes

Classrooms are noticeably more hi-tech these days - interactive boards, laptops and online learning plans proliferate, but has the curriculum actually changed or are children simply learning the same thing on different devices?

Some argue that the education this generation of children is receiving is little different from that their parents or even their grandparents had.

But, in a world where artificial intelligence and robots threaten jobs, the skills that this generation of children need to learn are likely to be radically different to the three Rs that have for so long been the mainstay of education.

The BBC went along to the Bett conference in London in search of different ways of teaching and learning.

School robots

Image caption Pupils taught Pepper to dab

A stone's throw from the Excel, where Bett is held, stands a new school that is, according to its head Geoffrey Fowler, currently little more than a Portakabin.

Despite this, the London Design and Engineering university technical college - which caters for 14- to 19-year-olds - was massively oversubscribed when it opened its doors for the first time in September.

The 180 pupils lucky enough to have got a place have had a very different experience of the curriculum in the 12 weeks since they joined.

One group have designed from scratch a virtual reality environment that takes viewers on a journey around an Ethiopian village as part of a project to highlight the work of the charity Water Aid.

Another has spent the term teaching Pepper - the school has two of SoftBank's human-looking robots - how to make a variety of moves, including the dab currently beloved of children around the country.

Image caption Geoffrey Fowler (far right) showed off Pepper, with some of his pupils, teachers and industry partners at the Bett conference

A third group are heading off this weekend on an unusual skiing trip. Travelling with them will be 11 Nao robots, which the pupils plan to teach how to ski.

The school - which sets no homework, relying instead on pupils wanting to get on with their projects in their own time - is, according to Mr Fowler, "inspiring children to be part of a new type of learning".

While other schools may see the projects listed above as fun "add-ons" to the core curriculum, Mr Fowler thinks it has to be embedded within it.

Sixth-formers work on what is called an extended project qualification, which is the equivalent of half an A-level.

The school works with a range of industry sponsors, including the University of East London, Thames Water and Fujitsu, all of which offer input into the types of skills they would like to see children learn to equip them for the workplace as well as offering apprenticeships.

There are 48 university technical colleges (UTC) in England currently - and the scheme has proved controversial.

One set up in East London in 2012 closed after just two years, having failed to attract enough pupils, while another in Bedfordshire was branded inadequate by Ofsted.

Some head teachers seem to be resisting the idea of the vocational style of education, barring UTCs from recruiting pupils from their schools.

But statistics suggest that pupils attending UTCs have just as good results if not better than those in more conventional schools.

It is something James Culley, head of computer science at the school, sees for himself every day.

"I have never seen students learn so quickly," he told the BBC.

Drone lessons

Lots of primary schools are now convinced of the importance of learning to code.

As well as lessons devoted to it, after-school code clubs proliferate as do DIY computers such as the BBC's Micro Bit and the Raspberry Pi.

Tynker, a company that has already brought its coding-through-games philosophy to 60,000 schools in the US, recently launched a new project - teaching coding through drone lessons.

Hundreds of schools in the US have taken up the idea and it is now preparing to launch in the UK.

Schools typically buy between six and 12 drones via Tynker's partnership with drone maker Parrot and can then download Tynker's free set of drone lessons.

Children learn to make drones do back-flips, as well as more complex idea such as drones working together as a team.

It would take, you may think, a rather brave teacher to commit to flying drones in the classroom, but Josie McKay, a Fourth Grade teacher at Towne Meadow Elementary School in Indiana has no such qualms.

"Over the last month, I have seen their confidence build as they went from coding their drone to hover off of the floor to flying their drone around the room without crashing into any obstacles," she says.

"Each week these students develop new and more challenging goals for themselves, work together, and code their drone accordingly.

"The excitement on their faces when they achieve their goal, especially when it is completed in a short amount of time, is infectious."

The drones come with a range of safety features, including a "classroom mode" that means they take off extra slowly.

Children cannot take command of each other's drones, and there is an automatic stop button if inquisitive fingers come in proximity with the drone's blades.

Tynker founder and chief executive Krishna Vedati told the BBC: "Our goal is not to create programmers but to offer coding as a life skill."

Alternative reality

Picture a classroom where, instead of handouts or text books, all pupils learn from their own headset - entering a virtual reality world to learn about the French revolution, or interacting with a hologram of the solar system to learn about space.

According to Lenovo's global education specialist, Sam Morris, there are huge benefits from learning this way.

"We see AR and VR as the next frontier," he says.

"Early usage has suggested the devices engage pupils intently in tasks, improve group interactions and the ability to adapt to multiple disciplines."

Microsoft was at Bett showing off HoloLens - its recently released "mixed reality" headset.

It has worked in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University to develop a hologram of the human body that can be dissected and bones, organs and veins viewed in detail.

It is also working with education provider Pearson to develop other educational resources for the device.

The developer edition of HoloLens currently sells for £2,719 which makes even buying one headset out of the reach for most cash-strapped schools.

"The declining cost of VR and AR devices will be critical to driving mass adoption in education," says Mr Morris.After a top 10 hit with What I Might Do, DJ Ben Pearce had to quit music for six months after anxiety and depression made him "shake, throw up and sweat".It is one of the iconic photographs of the 20th Century, an image that is synonymous with love and with Paris, the city of romance. Its name is Le Baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville (The Kiss by the Hôtel de Ville) and an exhibition at the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin is currently displaying it alongside another hundred or so pictures by the great French photographer Robert Doisneau.

“People like my photos because they see in them what they would see if they stopped rushing about and took the time to enjoy the city,” Robert Doisneau used to say. It is very true, however, perhaps surprisingly, his most famous picture was staged, says Francine Deroudille, Robert Doisneau’s daughter and co-curator of the exhibition, as she reveals the story behind Le Baiser de l’Hôtel de Ville to BBC Culture.

“The picture was taken in the spring 1950. My father’s agent had pitched a series on ‘the lovers of Paris’ to American publications and Life magazine had commissioned it,” Deroudille explains.

Truth here lies in the beauty of the impulse and a spontaneity that is closely linked to the French spirit and its capital city

At the time, image rights were already protected by law and a cautious Robert Doisneau preferred to use friends or young actors to feature in some of his commissioned reportage, in order to avoid legal issues. One afternoon in March 1950, Doisneau went out into the streets of Paris with young actor friends and just let them be: they walked, held hands, talked, and kissed, with Doisneau never far behind. “His models weren’t models in the sense that they didn’t pose. Doisneau was simply catching them flirting and kissing, in a very natural way, ” says Deroudille.

The result, a kiss caught at the corner of rue du Renard and rue de Rivoli right across from the city’s town hall, feels like the best of Doisneau: a suspended moment whose beauty is known only to the lovers and the photographer. Around them, indifferent Parisians walk, hardly noticing the young couple; cars shoot by and people seated at a café (now a shoe shop) speak animatedly.

But, we, sharing Doisneau’s gaze, stop in our tracks in front of this picture: the immediacy of it, the young bodies’ movement and the place and time, Paris, 1950, cast a spell on the viewer. Who cares about authenticity? The sentiments showed in the picture are authentic. Truth here lies in the beauty of the impulse and a spontaneity that is closely linked to the French spirit and its capital city.

“At the time, American magazines were very keen on Paris stories, especially stories covering the life in Paris streets where people behaved much more freely than anywhere in America. Even in New York’s streets, couples weren’t seen kissing, and certainly never with such carefree abandon,” says Francine Deroudille.

However, after it was shot, and published in Life Magazine, the picture remained just one of many in the very large Doisneau portfolio (today totalling 450,000 negatives, and managed by his two daughters Francine and Annette). Doisneau himself didn’t think it such an extraordinary picture.

“He thought it was well composed but nothing more” says his daughter. “And then, 30 years later, in the early 1980s, a young publisher suggested to publish it again, in poster format. Doisneau wasn’t convinced but all the young people at the Rapho agency where he worked were so enthusiastic that he accepted.” The success was instant and global. How did Doisneau explain his picture’s sudden and universal success? “We all realised that it represented a perfect fantasy. It encapsulates the world’s view of Paris as the city of love and freedom.”

‘A humanist photographer’

Robert Doisneau’s photographs are intimately associated with Paris at a time when the city was the world capital of arts and culture. “He was in awe of Paris and his love never faltered until his death in 1994,” says Deroudille. Doisneau documented Paris’s evolution from the 1930s up to the late 1980s; he saw and often welcomed both social and architectural changes. “Paris has this intrinsic beauty which touches everyone who visits or lives here. Paris has this ability of making you happy, it certainly made him very happy,” reveals Deroudille.

Doisneau wasn’t the only one fascinated by Paris’s grandeur and its myriad small pleasures. Eugène Atget, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Brassaï, André Kertész, Willy Ronis, Robert Capa, among many others, have made Paris the most photographed city of the 20th Century. Their pictures have shaped the world’s perception of the city, enhancing and enchanting the reality. Decades later, we still see Paris as a place where mystery and charm take you by surprise at almost every corner.

Paris streets, in which Parisians lived day and night to escape small, shabby and decrepit lodgings, offered the best of theatre

Much of Doisneau’s work came out of commissions from newspapers and magazines, but he always used his assignments as opportunities to catch moments that interested him personally. With his Rolleiflex, he photographed building facades, interiors, river banks, children playing, passers-by, wedding couples.

“He felt comfortable everywhere, in the poor areas and the posh districts of Paris. What he enjoyed most was to show all the facets of Paris even if he had a particular fondness for Paris’s children and its working class,” says Deroudille. Often referred to as a ‘humanist photographer’, Doisneau’s pictures focused on people by making the private and the personal visible. For decades, Paris streets, in which Parisians lived day and night to escape small, shabby and decrepit lodgings, offered the best of theatre. “Parisians don’t live as much in the streets as they used to, however, cafés’ terraces, the habit of walking and ‘flâner’, the concentration of shops such as bakeries and food markets, mean that the spirit remains and continues to fascinate visitors,” says Francine Deroudille.

But what would Doisneau make of today’s photography? Of selfies and Instagram fads? “He would have loved to see that photography had become accessible to all. However, [I] am sure he would have been aghast by the selfie culture which, in many ways, is a vain obsession with the self to the detriment of a wider view,” says Deroudille.

Doisneau, a modest man, valued empathy with others, simplicity, and above all, spontaneity.

Scientists who spent years listening to the communication calls of one of our closest ape relatives say their eavesdropping has shed light on the origin of human language.

Dr Adriano Reis e Lameira from Durham University recorded and analysed almost 5,000 orangutan "kiss squeaks".

He found that the animals combined these purse-lipped, "consonant-like" calls to convey different messages.

This could be a glimpse of how our ancestors formed the earliest words.

The findings are published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.

"Human language is extraordinarily advanced and complex - we can pretty much transmit any information we want into sound," said Dr Reis e Lameira.

"So we tend to think that maybe words evolved from some rudimentary precursor to transmit more complex messages.

"We were basically using the orangutan vocal behaviour as a time machine - back to a time when our ancestors were using what would become [those precursors] of consonants and vowels."

Building blocks

Media caption Prof Serge Wich tells Radio 4's Today about the potential link between our own language and orangutans

The team studied kiss squeaks in particular because, like many consonants - the /t/, /p/, /k/ sounds - they depend on the action of the lips, tongue and jaw rather than the voice.

"Kiss squeaks do not involve vocal fold action, so they're acoustically and articulatory consonant-like," explained Dr Reis e Lameira.

In comparison to research into vowel-like primate calls, the scientists explained, the study of consonants in the evolution of language has been more difficult. But as Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, a lead author in the study, said, they are crucial "building blocks" in the evolution of language.

"Most human languages have a lot more consonants than vowels," said Prof Wich. "And if we have more building blocks, we have more combinations."

The scientists recorded and analysed 4,486 kiss-squeaks collected from 48 animals in four wild populations.

With thousands of hours of listening as the apes communicated, the researchers found that the animals embedded several different bits of information in their squeaks.

The team compared this to how we might use more than one word to convey the same meaning - saying "car" but also "automobile" and "vehicle"

"They seemed to make doubly sure that the message was received, so they would send the same message with different [kiss squeak combination] signals,"

The scientists say their study suggests that, rather than a concerted effort to form complex words, it might have been this "redundancy" - forming different sounds that had the same meaning, in order to reinforce a message - that drove early language evolution.

Dr Reis e Lameira added: "It's a way of making sure you don't end up in a game of Chinese whispers."

A telephone used by Adolf Hitler during World War Two is to be auctioned in the US this weekend.

The red phone, which has the Nazi leader's name engraved on it, was found in his Berlin bunker in 1945.

Soviet soldiers gave it to British officer Sir Ralph Rayner as a souvenir shortly after Germany surrendered.

Auction house Alexander Historical Auctions says bidding in Chesapeake City, Maryland, will start at $100,000 (£80,567).

It hopes that the phone, which is being sold by Sir Ralph's son Ranulf, can fetch as much as $300,000.

Auction house official Bill Panagopulos said the phone was a "weapon of mass destruction", as it was used by Hitler to give orders that took many lives during the war, the Associated Press reports.Tim Harford: Why the falling cost of light matters

Four weeks. Twenty-eight days. It feels like 280 days. I feel 280. If Donald Trump is exhausting even the news-hungry political journalists, I wonder what he is doing to the rest of the world.

For the first three weeks I started the day repeating a mantra, "watch what he does, not what he says." I've discarded that notion. What Mr Trump says and how he says it is an important part of his presidency. His rhetoric, both in person and Twitter, appeals to his supporters. It's new and fresh and irreverent. But one day it could also be his undoing. He is increasingly losing respect among key Republicans, and he needs them to govern effectively.

Media caption Trump's busy first month in 90 seconds

This is my fourth American administration and we've never seen anything like it for sheer non-stop drama. Lewinsky was a daily feast of slightly prudish titillation, but it was one story line, and in the end it was just sex. 9/11 was far more serious and scary, and the ramifications lasted far beyond that fateful morning. But in a way it was a more conventional (though nonetheless horrifying) story of geopolitics and ideology. We journalists knew how to cover them both.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John McCain has been a Republican critic of Trump

Sometimes now, I admit, I'm at a loss. There is so much to say and think, and even feel, about the Trump administration that I find myself curiously stuck for words.

What's the most important story here? Is the psychodrama of a president who is both fantastically confident and oddly insecure, who publicly lashes out those who offend him and rewards those who please him? Is it the hard right turn he plans for America? Is it Russia, the curious crush Donald Trump seems to have on Vladimir Putin and what that might mean for global security? Is it America's allies, floundering in the face of this unpredictability?

Four long long weeks ago, we speculated that this may become a normal presidency, hemmed in by the restrictions of US institutions and the customs of US political tradition. We were wrong, again.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor

Yes, Mr Trump has seen his agenda slowed, either by the structures of government or the realities of diplomacy. On five major national and international issues. he has either rowed back or been checked.

In a long overdue phone call with Xi Jinping he gave up toying with the one China policy.

In a conversation with a top EU official, members of his administration said Mr Trump would not tear up the Iran nuclear deal even though, in the President's words, it is the worst deal America has ever made.

In a statement the White House urged the Israelis to stop building new settlements in the West Bank.

A judge in Seattle and an appeals court in San Francisco have halted his immigration ban, at least for now.

Repealing Obamacare "on day one" did not happen - a recognition that without a replacement the slogan was just that, a slogan.

That's how government functions. Even this White House, with its ambition of rapid change, has been forced to bow somewhat to business as normal. Especially on foreign policy, there is actually little difference today between the Obama and Trump policies.

Media caption Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job'

But in other more profound ways this administration is anything but normal - which is precisely what Mr Trump's voters wanted.

For a start, the president himself breaks the rules. He berates allies (Australia, Mexico,) praises despots (notably, and most worryingly, Putin) and he has dropped the filter of "behaving presidentially." His Twitter attacks on the press, the intelligence services and individual Senators feel more schoolyard than Oval Office.

There is so much personal drama in his early morning tirades that I wake up anxious wondering who is it today and what does it all mean? But his supporters didn't send him to Washington to play nice. All the polls suggest they still really like what they see.

Media caption Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from?

That his White House acts like some medieval court is not really so unusual. Jockeying for power has been a long tradition of US administrations. But it doesn't usually play out on the front pages of the newspaper. It also doesn't usually lead to the firing of one senior official within the first month and his potential replacement turning down the job because he fears being tainted by the dysfunction.

Whatever the president may say, that is not normal and it is not a well-oiled machine.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Candidate Trump met with Mexican president Pena Nieto during the campaign

Then there's the issue of what to believe. We've never seen an administration where one official says one thing publicly and the president says another. On the two state solution, the firing of General Flynn and Russian interference in the election, this week alone saw a string of public contradictions.

It is hard to see how this is sustainable. A lot is not getting done because of the administration chaos. There is still no tax reform bill, no Obamacare replacement, no infrastructure spending plan - all things he planned to do immediately.

It is also hard to see how it ends. President Trump appears to like the chaos theory of government and it fits his narrative of change.

Four weeks in, his approval ratings are not great but they're not disastrous. The most reliable national poll, by one of the few truly non-partisan organisations left in America, Pew Research, has him at 39%. That's lower than his predecessors at this stage but it's not through the floor.

In twenty years in Washington, I've never heard so much talk of the possibility of a President not finishing his term, even in the late 90s at the height of Clinton's Lewinsky scandal. But for that to happen there are only two options, Mr Trump would have to resign or be impeached. For the moment neither of those look at all likely.Stephen Port killed four young gay men in East London within fifteen months, yet the police failed to link the deaths until weeks after the fourth murder. What went wrong?

The story of how police repeatedly allowed a serial murderer to slip through their fingers.

Stephen Port date-raped and murdered four young gay men in East London within fifteen months and dumped all four bodies within a few hundred metres of each other.

Yet Barking and Dagenham police failed to link the deaths, until weeks after the fourth one. The film tells the story through eyes of the families of Port’s victims, unpicking how the police failed to properly investigate each of the deaths in turn. The police’s assumptions that these young gay men had died from self-inflicted overdoses of chem-sex drugs allowed Port to continue raping and killing innocent young men.

The film unravels Port’s sinister character and modus operandi. Port was motivated by a desire to satisfy his lust for abusive drug fuelled sexual encounters. He found all his victims through gay dating and social media sites, using multiple online profiles.

Barking and Dagenham police’s failings have led to huge anger amongst the families of Port’s victims. Some have accused the police of institutional homophobia, and asked if officers would have investigated more thoroughly, had four young women turned up dead within such a small radius.

The Met police have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over their handling of the case and will not comment on specific allegations until the IPCC investigation is complete.Anna LeBaron's father, Ervil, was the leader of a polygamous cult responsible for more than 20 murders. The killings continued even after his death thanks to a hit list he had left behind. Here Anna speaks for the first time about how she escaped from the cult - and her hope to "redeem" the LeBaron name.

"We were taught to live in awe of him as God's prophet, as the one true prophet on Earth."

There is a note of incredulity in Anna LeBaron's voice as she describes her childhood. She speaks slowly and deliberately, as though she can hardly believe it herself.

"We were taught that we were celestial children, having been born from the prophet Ervil LeBaron. And we believed it. Even though we were treated so poorly we still believed we were celestial children."

Anna says she can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times she was in the same room as her father. Yet the power Ervil LeBaron had over his followers, which included his 13 wives and more than 50 children, was absolute.

"He used fear to manipulate and control people," she says. "We were absolutely afraid of not doing what we were told. And we didn't have a voice."

Anna has found her voice now. At 48, she shows no outward sign of the traumatised childhood she vividly describes in her new memoir The Polygamist's Daughter.

Even from the grave, he was able to control people and their actions

Anna LeBaron was born in Mexico in what she would later learn was a cult hideout. Separated at an early age from her mother, Ervil's fourth wife Anna-Mae Marston, she grew up on the run from the law.

Shuttled from one overcrowded safe house to the next, she slept on filthy foam mattresses and scavenged for food in dustbins with the other cult children and Ervil's "sister wives".

"We were taught that we were being persecuted because we were God's chosen people and that the world outside didn't understand us," she says.

"That was how they used to explain all the moving in the middle of the night and staying ahead of the law."

Image copyright Anna LeBaron Image caption Anna LeBaron in her early teens with brother Eddie - before she ran away

The children were used as unpaid labour in the domestic appliance repair shops that were the cult's main source of income - forced to scrub grease and grime from rusty ovens and refrigerators for 12 hours a day during school holidays.

"I watched siblings of mine receive horrific beatings for any type of attitude," Anna recalls. "And these are young kids. They're kids. How much work can you really get out of a 10-year-old, or an 11-year-old, really? You can get work out of them if you are beating them."

The children were not cut-off entirely from the outside world. They were allowed to go to school, though they were not allowed to talk about what happened at home, and were "taught to lie" Anna says.

The girls were the lowest of the low in the cult's pecking order.

"It was a patriarchy, for sure. And the young girls were groomed to become wives of polygamist men that already had wives. We were groomed to accept that and to know that that's where we were headed, when we became of marriageable age."

Marriageable age, in the LeBaron family, was 15, she says. "So when I escaped at age 13 I escaped by the skin of my teeth!"

Ervil LeBaron - the 'Mormon Manson'

Image copyright AP

Ervil Morrell LeBaron was the founder of the Church of the Lamb of God, an offshoot of the Mormon religion

He had 13 wives and more than 50 children

To his followers, he was the One Mighty and Strong Prophet, sent to Earth to purify the Mormon faith

Dubbed the Mormon Manson by the media, he is thought to have ordered the murders of dozens of people

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints expelled him in the 1950s because he practised polygamy, which it had abandoned in 1890

Anna did not know it at the time but her father - a powerful, charismatic figure, who at 6ft 4in towered over most of his disciples - was wanted by the FBI and the Mexican police for a string of murders on both sides of the border.

He rarely got involved in the violence himself but ordered his followers to kill anyone - including one of his own wives and two of his children - who challenged his position as God's representative on Earth or who threatened to leave the cult and complain to the authorities.

His followers believed he was receiving his instructions directly from God, having inherited the mantle of prophet from his father Alma Dayer LeBaron.

"When you are so convinced that someone is right, that you are willing to do anything - and even if you disagree, if you are so afraid to voice that disagreement and you just go and do it - that's the ultimate control," Anna says. "And he had that. People did what he said. To their own detriment."

Image copyright Anna LeBaron Image caption Ervil LeBaron with fourth wife Anna Mae Marston

But Ervil did not have a monopoly on divine revelations. Three of his brothers had, at one time or another, claimed to be God's sole representative on Earth.

Ervil had initially been a follower of his older brother Joel but the pair clashed over Ervil's money-making schemes, including a plan to transform Los Molinos, the modest Mexican settlement where the sect's 200 or so followers had set up home, into a beach resort.

Joel kicked Ervil out of his Church of the Firstborn of the Fullness of Time in 1970. So Ervil started his own sect, the Church of the Lamb of God, and set about eliminating his rivals - starting, in 1972, with Joel.

Using the long-abandoned Mormon doctrine of "blood atonement" which sanctions the killing of sinners to cleanse them of evil, Ervil could claim he was doing his ever-growing list of victims a favour by allowing them to enter Heaven.

God would reveal to Ervil the next victim and he would hand-pick a team of disciples to carry out the hit. The murder plots grew increasingly sophisticated, involving wigs and theatrical make-up, and back-up squads in case the initial plan failed. Refusing to follow Ervil's command was not an option.

"People defied it and many of them paid for that with their lives. And it wasn't until after he died that it kind of started to break up and that power was lost," says Anna.

"However, even from the grave, he was able to control people and their actions and that is just mind-blowing - that from the grave he was able to do that."

Image copyright Anna LeBaron Image caption Anna Mae Marston looking happy with some of her children

Ervil had managed to evade justice in the Mexican courts over the murder of Joel and a deadly commando-style raid on Los Molinos, where the population were stubbornly refusing to accept him as their new prophet.

He was eventually captured by Mexican police and handed over to the FBI in 1979, in circumstances that have never been fully explained. He was later jailed for life for orchestrating the murder of Rulon C Allred, the leader of a polygamous sect in Utah who had rejected Ervil's demands for money and recognition.

Ervil died in Utah State Prison in 1981, after suffering a seizure. But his reign of terror was far from over.

A bloody battle for the succession ensued, with Ervil's chief henchman, Dan Jordan, making an early play for the mantle of prophet - a terrifying prospect for Anna, who had suffered under the tyrannical regime in his Denver repair shop.

Anna was now was living in Houston with her mother, half-sister Lillian and Lillian's husband, Mark Chynoweth, who also ran an appliance store.

Lillian and Mark had been among the most fanatical of Ervil LeBaron's followers but after he was jailed they began to drift away from the cult, joining a Christian church and rejecting his polygamous creed.

When Dan Jordan arrived in Houston to order Anna and her mother to return to Denver with him, the 13-year-old Anna rebelled.

"I could not believe that my mother had been talked back into going back to Denver when we were experiencing a life in Houston that was the most normal I had ever experienced.," she says. "We had lived in the same house for about a year - the longest I had ever lived anywhere - and we were eating food that was purchased in grocery stores. And we were paid to work. We could save up money."

She realised that this might be the best chance she would get to take control of her life.

"It was now or never. And the feelings that I had inside, that bitterness and the injustices that we had experienced, left me with a very strong feeling about not wanting to go back."

Image copyright Anna LeBaron Image caption Sisters - and sister-wives - Ramona and Faye LeBaron

She could not have escaped without the help of Lillian, who hid her away in a motel room until her mother had returned to Denver with Jordan.

Anna describes Lillian and Mark as the "heroes" of her story, for taking her in and giving her a chance to change the trajectory of her life.

But their life together would not last. What they didn't know was that in prison Ervil had drawn up a hit list of 50 people he regarded as traitors, buried away in a final, rambling theological tract - The Book of the New Covenants - and that Mark's name was on it.

After Dan Jordan was murdered in an apparent "blood atonement", Mark revealed that he and Jordan had been among a group of followers who had refused to carry out Ervil's orders to bust him out of prison "guns blazing" and so there was a good chance he would be targeted next.

The 38-year-old refused to go into hiding. He opted instead to turn his suburban home into a fortress, but it wasn't enough.

At 4pm on 27 June 1988, he was shot numerous times as he sat in his office chair at Reliance Appliances.

At almost exactly the same time, Mark's brother Duane, owner of another Houston repair shop, was shot dead, along with his eight-year-old daughter Jennifer.

And 200 miles away in Irving, Texas, another of Ervil's former disciples, Eddie Marston - Anna's half-brother - was gunned down next to his pick-up truck within five minutes of the first three killings.

The Four O'Clock murders, as they became known, shocked America. Someone - most likely one of Ervil LeBaron's sons - was working their way through his hit list. The murders took place on the 144th anniversary of the death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church.

Anna did her best to comfort Lillian and her six children, while dealing with her own fears.

"I don't think I was a personal target, however, I knew that if something happened, and I happened to be in the way, that I could also be killed. So it was a very frightening time. We were under police protection and it was just scary."

Mark Chynoweth had been the closest thing to a father figure in Anna's life, and she is close to tears as she talks about his death. As a teenager, she read about cult atrocities he had taken part in but insists that was not the man she knew.

"Mark was a kind man. He was generous. And I don't believe for one minute that had he grown up in a normal family setting that he would have done any of the things that he was accused of, on his own.

"He was kind and loving. He was a good father to his children and losing him was very difficult, under the circumstances that we lost him."

When you are the prophet, how much help do you actually think you'll need?

In 1997, Anna's half-brother Aaron LeBaron, who had emerged from the succession battles as the One Mighty and Strong prophet, was sentenced to 45 years in prison for orchestrating the Four O'Clock murders. Four other cult members were also jailed for their part in the killings.

By this point, Anna had made a decisive break from what remained of the cult, finding the strength to go away to college and attempt to build an independent life.

She married David, her childhood sweetheart from Houston, who had joined the Marine Corps, and they started a family.

She was determined to break free from polygamy, which she believes leads women to "numb" their emotions.

"I don't believe it's a natural relationship," she says. "Most women will struggle, having to share their husband or their significant other."

It is not a view shared by her mother, with whom she remains in contact, and who stayed loyal to Ervil to the bitter end.

"My Mom still believes in the practice of polygamy as taught by [Mormon founder] Joseph Smith and still lives in a group that practises that, so that is a little bit difficult to process - how that can be something she sticks with even after all the devastation and the damage that it caused to her own children."

Anna battled depression after the death of Lillian Chynoweth, who committed suicide following her husband's murder in 1998.

At first she coped with the trauma of losing so many loved ones by pretending it had happened to someone else. It would take years of painful therapy for her to finally "acknowledge that these experiences are part of my past".

She now believes her father suffered from some form of mental illness for most of his adult life.

"It is sad to me that he was experiencing these things and not able to reach out and get the help he needed. But, of course, when you are the prophet, how much help do you actually think you'll need?"

Ervil's madness, if that's what it was, cast a long shadow over Anna and her siblings.

The book was only closed on the Four O'Clock Murders in 2011, when after 20 years on the run Jacqueline Tarsa LeBaron became the sixth former cult member to be jailed for taking part in the plot.

But Anna is convinced that the blood-letting is now, finally, at an end.

"I have five grown children and if me telling my story was to put me in any danger, or anybody that I loved and cared about, I would never have done this at all. I believe that is 100% in the past and there is no danger at all for me."

Media caption Anna LeBaron on how she escaped her father's polygamous cult

She hopes that by telling her story, in The Polygamist's Daughter, she can "help restore relationships in our family, instead of continuing to bring more separation and more fear".

In one passage, she describes a reunion with her half-brother Robert, who shot dead Duane Chynoweth and his eight-year-old daughter. Robert, who was just 17 at the time of the killings, received a reduced sentence for testifying against other family members.

"As I embraced my long-lost brother," she writes, "the emotion I had held inside for years came out in floods of tears."

And despite everything, Anna says she is "very proud" of her family.

"Even people that were involved in some of the most horrific things that happened have gone on to become caring, kind, loving, productive members of society, that just want good in the world," she says.

She hopes that the book's publication will help to "redeem the LeBaron name," which remains one of the most infamous in American criminal history.

But it is also an attempt to reassert her own identity, for so long suppressed by the cult and her father's malevolent legacy.

"Even though that life could have crushed who I am, in my spirit, in my soul, that has not been the last story," she says.

"So I kind of get to have the final word here, in saying, 'This is who I am.'"

The Polygamist's Daughter, by Anna Le Baron with Leslie Wilson, is published on 21 March

When Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard agreed to a date with a student after losing a Twitter wager, it had the hallmarks of a one-off event.

But in love, as in tennis, there is always room for surprises.

Talking about her evening with 20-year-old John Goehrke, Ms Bouchard called him a "gentleman" and declared it "awesome!"

Asked by a reporter if there would be a second date, she answered: "For sure!"

The saga behind the original date has charmed millions as it played out online, starting amid the drama of the US Super Bowl.

While the Atlanta Falcons were 21-0 ahead, Ms Bouchard predicted their victory on Twitter.

But when New England Patriots fan Mr Goehrke bet her a date that his team would triumph, she gamely accepted.

The Patriots duly mounted a nail-biting comeback in the game's dying minutes.

Ms Bouchard, 22, clearly a woman of her word, met the University of Missouri student in New York on Wednesday to watch a basketball game - and tweeted a picture with him en route.

"Just met my 'Super Bowl Twitter Date' John. On our way to the @BrooklynNets game!" she wrote.

The Montreal native had secured prime courtside seats for the encounter, where the Brooklyn Nets took on the Milwaukee Bucks.

Ms Bouchard is a one-time Wimbledon finalist who is currently 44th in the world tennis rankings.

The signs were good when she shared a photo of Mr Goehrke kissing her cheek at the evening's end.

And when US news site TMZ asked how the date had panned out, she answered: "He picked me up at my hotel, like a gentleman, and we came over here. He got me a nice little gift. We enjoyed the game courtside, and he's a normal fan!"

The Brooklyn Nets lost the basketball 129-125. But the dating game, it seems, was a win for all concerned.

Eugenie Bouchard is not the first famous face to prove a good sport in the romance stakes.

In 2011, actress Mila Kunis accompanied a US serviceman, Sgt Scott Moore, to a Marine Corps Ball in North Carolina after he asked her to be his date via a YouTube video.

The same trick worked on Justin Timberlake, who joined Cpl Kelsey de Santis at a Marine Corps ball in Virginia - and called it "one of the most moving evenings" of his life.

Apa ada unsur baru dalam berita yang sedang kita garap? Kalau bukan berita baru, apa ada cara baru untuk mengemasnya? Bagaimana kiat mengemas berita? Itulah yang dijawab oleh wartawan keamanan BBC, Frank Gardner.

Pertanyaan yang selalu diajukan para wartawan ketika menggarap berita adalah bagaimana mengemas berita, sehingga berita menjadi lebih menarik dan berbeda dari yang lain.

Di video ini, kami meminta wartawan keamanan BBC, Frank Gardner, untuk berbagi pengalaman bagaimana mengemas berita.

Ia mengatakan langkah pertama adalah mencari tahu: apa beritanya? Apa ada unsur baru? Kita akan melanjutkan memberitakan jika kita menemukan hal yang baru.

“Kita tak semestinya menggarap berita karena kita merasa kita harus melakukannya,” kata Gardner.

Hal lain yang harus kita pikirkan adalah, apa ada cara baru untuk mengemasnya?

Inilah yang disebut sebagai orisinalitas.

Makanya, kita akan selalu membahas gambar apa yang akan kita pakai dan siapa narasumber yang akan melengkapi berita.

Tapi yang paling penting, menurut Gardner, adalah apakah wartawan yang bersangkutan memang tertarik melaporkan berita tersebut.

“Jika kita tertarik, maka secara alamiah ketertarikan ini, antusiasme ini akan bisa dirasakan oleh para pemirsa dan mereka pada gilirannya akan ingin tahu lebih jauh soal berita kita,” kata Gardner.

Berita-berita yang menarik biasanya yang terkait dengan kejadian, ada sesuatu yang nyata, yang memang terjadi.

Tapi, ini bukan jaminan untuk bisa menarik perhatian audiens. Kita memerlukan gambar yang bagus.

“Jangan terlalu banyak memberikan gambaran dengan kata-kata, seperlunya saja untuk mengantarkan alur berita,” kata Gardner.

Hal penting lain adalah jangan membebani audiens dengan terlalu banyak informasi.

Prinsip ini harus kita perhatikan saat kita menambahkan grafik ke berita kita.

“Kadang reporter yang paling banyak tahu adalah yang paling buruk. Itu karena dia memberi pemirsa terlalu banyak informasi,” katanya.

The Facebook founder's manifesto blurs the edges between business and politics. In a 21st Century of technology giants, the two will become increasingly intertwined.Siem Reap has become one of the world’s tourism darlings over the past years, ranked in 2015 as the second best spot on the planet to visit according to Trip Advisor, outmuscling luminaries like Prague, London, and Istanbul.

Travellers flock here to see the historical Khmer jungle temples of Angkor Wat, but the busloads of foreigners arriving each day has not been entirely positive, with lack of infrastructure to cope with the crowds, traffic jams and damage to temples.

Fortunately, Beng Mealea, a hidden-away jungle temple that invokes the earlier, less-discovered days of Angkor, gives plenty of hope to the Indiana Jones in all of us.

Beng Mealea, which lies about 40km east of the main group of Angkor temples, is administered by the Apsara Authority, the governmental agency that oversees Angkor. But it is not considered part of the Angkor complex, and a separate admission ticket is needed – though the US$5 entry fee is a bargain compared to the US$37 presently asked for a one-day entrance to Angkor.

Coming out here feels miles removed from the trinket-lined roads leading into the more famous temple complex, where long lines form for buses, taxis and tuk tuks to enter under the bas-relief–covered gates. Until recently, Beng Mealea could only be accessed via a potholed, dusty road that was all but impassable during the rainy season. The road has been sealed over the past few years – although it’s still preferable to travel via private car than tuk tuk, as the journey can be bumpy.

The route passes men in krama (the traditional Khmer scarf) pedalling their bicycles, farmers on their oxcarts heading into the fields and children playing by the roadside. Although tour agencies have started to add Beng Mealea to some of their itineraries, the one-hour journey from Siem Reap deters many visitors – not to mention that most tourists barely have enough time during their visit to cover the temples at Angkor.

Built in the same architectural style as Angkor, Beng Mealea is presumed to have also been constructed during the reign of King Suryavaraman in the 12th Century, which makes it more than 900 years old. But although historians presume it to be related to the famous temples, little is known about the origins of the eerie, crumbling site. Hindu and a few Buddhist motif carvings have been uncovered, but few other indications of religion – or any inscriptions that might give away who built it – have been discovered.

Despite all this, Beng Mealea is an incredibly special place to visit. Composed of a series of galleries and libraries built around a central sanctuary and surrounded by a massive moat, the site looks as though an earthquake has struck it. Large stone bricks are all that remain of the tall buildings that once stood here, and nature has run riot. Strangler figs wrap around walls, moss grows out of every pore and crumbling blocks covered in lush, ultra-verdant vegetation have tumbled into one another.

But this forgotten, haunted look is precisely part of its appeal. On my last visit to Beng Mealea, I encountered an Indian couple crawling hand in hand through a tunnel of fallen blocks, agape when they emerged to find a towering temple wall crawling with vines above them. They told me it was their honeymoon, and covered in sweat and dust, they were glowing as if they’d just walked down the aisle.

Come in the early morning (before 9 am) to have Beng Mealea to yourself. A raised walkway, which mostly traverses areas around the outer moat, has been constructed recently for visitors to walk around the temple. But this route misses much of what makes Beng Mealea special, as the most impressive spots are hidden in the jungle.

Instead, ask to be guided by one of the entry staff, who, for a small tip, will lead you into the centre of the ruins. You’ll spend the next few hours clambering over verdant blocks and columns – through seemingly dead-end passages – and emerging out from stone chimneys to find temple areas smothered in tree roots and Ramayana carvings completely entwined by branches.

Inside the main sanctuary, where the most intact structures are found, large columned windows are taken over by vegetation. When I was there, a couple of kids tiptoed along the tottering blocks with their parents gingerly following, watching every step. It would be easy to twist an ankle or far worse here.

Ta Prohm, the famed jungle temple at Angkor, used to be like this. If you got there at sunrise, you were pretty much guaranteed to have the place to yourself. These days, however, Ta Prohm is an endless sea of tour bus passengers, with long queues forming at the most photogenic spots where the roots intertwine around temple columns. Due to both nature and human impact, many of the temples now have metal braces and supports on them, and access to some areas is forbidden.

Invariably, the same pitfalls may eventually change Beng Mealea; but for now, its location and access act as a wonderful deterrent to all but the most adventurous. Even better yet, the forces of nature will likely win out in the end, as the jungle consumes the temple, wrapping it up and keeping Beng Melea as mysterious as ever.

Яркая жизнь и ранняя смерть Тары Палмер-Томкинсон

Тара Палмер-Томкинсон, одна из самых знаменитых светских львиц Британии, звезда реалити-шоу и крестница принца Чарльза, в среду была найдена мертвой в своей квартире на западе Лондона. Палмер было 45 лет, большую часть из которых она провела под пристальным вниманием папарацци.It takes nearly five minutes for the lift to reach the foot of the mineshaft. The ride down is solemn and quiet, the silence broken only by the gentle clanking of the cage on its vertical tracks. Light from the torches hanging around our necks sways across the lift’s floor as we descend.

At the bottom, we pass a few old carts that used to ferry iron ore back and forth through these dim, rust-coloured tunnels. The Konrad mine in Salzgitter, Germany, produced iron for more than a century, from 1867 to 1976. Over the years its labrynth was extended to depths up to 1,300m (4,300ft) below street level. But the disused mine now has new role – one that could last hundreds of thousands of years.

If all goes to plan, in five years Konrad’s tunnels will become home to more than 300,000 cubic metres (10,000,000 cubic ft) of radioactive waste from Germany’s nuclear power stations – roughly half of all the nuclear waste Germany has ever produced. Buried deep underground, the material will be left to slowly decay. But not everyone is happy with the idea. Locals have been campaigning against the plans since they were first sketched out in the 1970s – and they haven’t given up yet.

The problem of what to do with nuclear waste has confounded us ever since we fired up the first nuclear reactors more than 60 years ago. Some of the radioactive elements produced in nuclear reactors take decades to decay. Others – like plutonium-239, neptunium-237 and iodine-219 – can linger for thousands of years. For many, burying it deep underground in secure containers is probably our best option. Finland recently approved a plan to do this on the rocky island of Olkiluoto and South Korea has already begun interning nuclear waste from some of its power plants in huge underground storage rooms at Gyeongju in the south-east of the country. But no one knows exactly how these repositories will fare over millennia.

Burying nuclear waste deep underground is probably our best option

Geologist Johannes Schneider brings our vehicle – a kind of open-topped tour van – to a halt and jumps out. In the darkness, a huge mining machine is illuminated by our torches. “We cut about four metres in 24 hours at present,” says Schneider, gesturing towards its fearsome teeth. “After two metres, the machine stops and then we have to reinforce the rock. The miners put mesh wire onto the rock and press roof bolts in to tighten it.”

Despite Konrad’s sprawling network of existing tunnels, the mine is being extended to house the waste. Some passages are being enlarged to make room for the machinery that will move the waste into place. The old mine is also getting a refit. Miners are installing new ventilation systems in an effort to keep the red dust – which covers everything – at bay. The mine will have subterranean workshops too, where the machinery used down here can be serviced. He also points out the toilets, which decompose another sort of waste on-site.

To get the mine ready for the first shipment of nuclear waste in 2022, hundreds of miners are working seven-hour shifts underground. Each worker carries a torch and a self-rescue kit that will supply oxygen for an hour or two if there is an emergency, such as a fire. As groups pass each other they say “Glück auf!”– an old German miners’ saying that means, roughly, “good luck”. At the entrance to the tunnels there is also a shrine to Saint Barbara, who is said to watch over miners, artillerymen and those who work with explosives.

To get government approval, the process of filling the mine with radioactive material has had to be outlined in detail. Over the course of a few decades, trains and trucks will deliver nuclear waste that has been compressed and sealed in special containers. The containers will be brought underground via one of Konrad’s existing mineshafts and then moved to their final resting place in one of the many tunnels by human-operated machines. The containers will be stacked in piles and sealed off every 50m (164ft) by a wall of concrete. The space behind these walls will be back-filled with yet more concrete as the tunnels are gradually packed with waste.

By chance, the year that Konrad is expecting its first delivery is the year Germany’s remaining nuclear power stations will be shut down. Germany has toyed with abandoning nuclear power for some time and Angela Merkel’s government finally decided to do so in 2011, following the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. Even so, waste from the decommissioned plants – and contaminated material from the buildings – will remain radioactive for many thousands of years.

The Konrad mine has been pegged as a potential repository for nuclear waste since the mid-1970s. But a licence to store such material here was only granted in 2007 and there have been delays since. Containment was supposed to have begun already, but has been pushed back nearly 10 years. A government spokeswoman explains that this is because some of the shafts required reconstruction to make them safe.

The delay has had knock-on effects. In 2014, barrels of nuclear waste destined for Konrad that were in temporary storage at a decommissioned power plant were found to be corroded. They are being kept in concrete-walled pits not intended for long-term storage. Costs are also mounting. It is estimated that Germany’s Office for Radiation Protection – a government agency – is spending more than 3.4 bilion euros (£2.9bn) converting Konrad into a repository and moving waste into it, and more delays would only increase that sum.

Konrad was picked partly because it is an unusually dry mine, thanks to a 400m (1300ft) thick layer of clay that seals off the mine from groundwater. One of the greatest fears about storing radioactive waste underground is that seeping water could gradually erode containment vessels and carry radioactive material up to the surface. Even if the process took thousands of years it could still be disastrous.

“There is some moisture here,” admits Schneider as he points out a row of bright white stalactites. But they are largely made of salt and he says saline solutions are less mobile than fresh water underground. Those involved in the project believe it would take at least 300,000 years for this moisture to rise to the surface. By then, the waste’s radioactivity should be harmless.

Show of opposition



The village of Bleckenstedt lies a two-minute drive away from Konrad’s main entrance. Bright yellow oil drums, painted to look like canisters of radioactive material, sit at the side of the road and in people’s gardens. It’s just one way that a handful of the village’s roughly 600 residents have chosen to show their opposition to the neighbouring mine’s transformation into a nuclear waste dump. There are also signs from anti-nuclear marches on display and an elaborate mural painted on a barn door that warns about the dangers of radiation.

One resident is unhappy because he bought an apartment a decade ago, before Konrad was granted the licence for nuclear waste storage. He claims the value of his property has since fallen to a third of what it was. He believes the German government should compensate locals for the effect on property value. Another local tells me she is worried about something going wrong in the mine. “We see what happened in Asse,” she says.

Asse II, just 25km away, is the name of another former mine – and perhaps Germany’s biggest nuclear waste mishap. It is home to 126,000 barrels of radioactive material that were dumped there in ramshackle piles between 1967 and 1978. Radioactive brine was found to be leaking in the mine some years later and this became public knowledge in 2008. No one knows exactly what to do about the problem. In theory, the waste from Asse II could be brought to the new repository, says Konrad’s spokeswoman. But Konrad’s current licence does not allow for this.

Rosemarie Streich, who has lived in Bleckenstedt her whole life, invites me in to her house. Now in her 80s, Streich recalls joining protests about Konrad back in the 1970s. She still attends demonstrations today. “Obviously, I am aware that it has to be stored somewhere and maybe it has to be here,” she says. “But the problem is how it came about.” She doesn’t feel those behind the project have always been transparent with residents about the risks involved. She thinks that the protests have had an effect, however – by delaying the project.

Home to 126,000 barrels of nuclear waste, the Asse II mine is leaking radioactive brine

That’s also the opinion of Ludwig Wasmus, a local farmer, and Ursula Schönberger, a political activist. Wasmus was born here and quickly became part of the anti-Konrad movement. “It was kind of natural,” he says. Schönberger is originally from Munich, but has been taking part in anti-nuclear demonstrations for 35 years. Today, her daughter is with her. “The next generation,” Schönberger says.

Wasmus and Schönberger are members of a committee opposing the Konrad repository that was founded following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster – 2017 is its 30th anniversary. The organisation now has a small building in Bleckenstedt that serves as a meeting place and anti-nuclear information centre. The walls are plastered with leaflets and posters – including one with a picture of the higgledy-piggledy pile of barrels in Asse II.

They both feel that Konrad has been foisted upon them without consultation. “If we inspected all the different sites and we came to the conclusion that Konrad is actually the safest place, I would have trouble not agreeing with that,” says Schönberger. The problem is that it’s all been presented as a done deal, says Wasmus. “They just picked this one spot, this is it.”

One of their concerns is that Germany has far more nuclear waste than can be stored at Konrad, which suggests that another site will have to be found to hold the rest. “We will have two regions that are contaminated,” says Schönberger. “It makes no sense.”

“The movement will continue,” says Wasmus. “We still believe we can avoid Konrad and actually stop it.”

The German authorities are sticking with their plan, however. Everyone, including the protestors, agrees that something must be done to store nuclear waste safely for the long term. But storing it underground means gaining the acceptance of whoever lives nearby. In the UK, for example, that battle is very much ongoing, and no such repositories have yet been approved.

Beneath Bleckenstedt, the miners continue their work. The tunnels of Konrad, snaking for miles below the surface, will soon be ready to receive a huge portion of Germany’s nuclear waste. The only visible sign that it’s there might be the high security facility above ground – and the yellow oil drums.

You think you know your seven continents? Think again, as there's a new contender hoping to join that club.

Say hello to Zealandia, a huge landmass almost entirely submerged in the southwest Pacific.

It's not a complete stranger, you might have heard of its highest mountains, the only bits showing above water: New Zealand.

Scientists say it qualifies as a continent and have now made a renewed push for it to be recognised as such.

In a paper published in the Geological Society of America's Journal, researchers explain that Zealandia measures five million sq km (1.9m sq miles) which is about two thirds of neighbouring Australia.

Image copyright GNS

Some 94% of that area is underwater with only a few islands and three major landmasses sticking out above the surface: New Zealand's North and South Islands and New Caledonia.

You might think being above water is crucial to making the cut as a continent, but the researchers looked at a different set of criteria, all of which are met by the new kid in town.

elevation above the surrounding area

distinctive geology

a well-defined area

a crust thicker than the regular ocean floor

The main author of the article, New Zealand geologist Nick Mortimer, said scientists have been researching data to make the case for Zealandia for more than two decades.

"The scientific value of classifying Zealandia as a continent is much more than just an extra name on a list," the researchers explained.

"That a continent can be so submerged yet unfragmented" makes it useful for "exploring the cohesion and breakup of continental crust".

So how then to get Zealandia into the canon of continents? Should text books authors get nervous again? After all, just a few years ago, Pluto got kicked off the list of planets, changing what had been taught in schools for decades.

There is in fact no scientific body that formally recognises continents. So it could only change over time if future research accepts Zealandia on par with the rest so that eventually we might be learning about eight, not seven, continents.Video

¿Por qué el tiempo parece pasar más rápido a medida que nos hacemos mayores?

Tic-tac, tic-tac... ¿Tienes la sensación de que el tiempo pasa muy rápido o más bien los minutos se te hacen eternos? ¿El año no terminaba nunca cuando estabas en el colegio y ahora te parece que vuela? La explicación está en la forma en que percibimos el tiempo.When Nazi forces reached Leningrad in the summer of 1941, rather than risk the lives of thousands of soldiers battling fierce Soviet resistance, the generals chose instead to blockade the city. It left Leningrad’s three million residents almost completely cut-off from the outside world for 900 days.

During those terrible months, some 800,000 people died of starvation and disease or were killed by German bombs and artillery shells.

Finally, on 27 January 1944, Soviet forces broke through the German lines, opening a corridor to the devastated city. In support of those troops, hundreds of aircraft attacked German ground positions to secure the airspace above the battlefield.

Our Red Army now needs Il-2 aircraft like the air it breathes, like the bread it eats – Josef Stalin

The next day, as the Germans were being driven back further, one of those planes – an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik (Attacker) ground-attack aircraft – ditched in a lake south of the city. The crew survived but the aircraft was lost – one of dozens destroyed in the battle.

Seventy years later, that plane has surfaced on the other side of the world.

“This was recovered from the lake in the early 1990s,” says James Stemm, the director of aircraft restoration at the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona. “It was bought by a US gentleman but he passed away, so his family donated it to us.”

Known as the “flying tank”, in total some 36,000 single-engine Sturmoviks were built – the greatest number of any military aircraft in history – and this is one of only a dozen survivors. It is surprising there aren’t more, it was one of the Soviet Union’s most important aircraft of World War 2. So important, in fact, that in an angry letter to armament factories in 1941 Stalin emphasised how vital the Il-2 was to the war effort: “Our Red Army now needs Il-2 aircraft like the air it breathes, like the bread it eats,” he wrote.

Although the Sturmovik at Pima has spent half a century rotting at the bottom of a lake, the bulk of this rare aircraft is remarkably preserved. That is thanks, in no small part, to its unusual structure.

“Its design is unique,” says Stemm, as we examine the bath-like rusted central section of the aircraft, propped up on a stand in the museum’s restoration hangar. “The part around the cockpit and engine is thick steel plate rather than aluminium – it’s more like a boiler than an airplane.”

The chances of getting hurt doing this particular job was very high – John Stemm, Pima Air and Space Museum

This armour offered protection to the pilot during the aircraft’s low and slow attack runs at the front line of the battlefield. The Sturmovik would have flown barely 20 metres (70 ft) off the ground – firing its machine guns and cannons or dropping bombs and rockets.

“The chances of getting hurt doing this particular job was very high,” says Stemm. “Virtually everyone could shoot at you – from an infantry man with a rifle to anti-aircraft guns, all the way up to heavy guns.”

Although the bulk of the front and central sections of the fuselage are armoured, protecting the 12-cylinder engine and pilot, the tail section and wings were both made of wood. “This was done to save strategic materials and reduce the weight of the aircraft so it could carry more weapons,” says Stemm.

The first Sturmoviks came off the production line in 1939 and, at 11 metres long, were designed for a single male or female pilot (women combat pilots were not unusual). When they were flown in battle in the early months of the war, however, it was soon discovered that they were vulnerable to fighter attack from the rear.

“So they did a field modification,” says Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Magazine from the Royal Aeronautical Society in London. “They cut a hole in the rear fuselage, put a fabric seat in there for a rear gunner – who was often the mechanic – and he or she fired out of the back to protect it.”

Being appointed a rear gunner on a Sturmovik, with only thin wood to protect you from shells, bullets and shrapnel, was not a popular assignment. Nor often a lengthy one. There are reports that, given the high rate of attrition, many gunners were recruited from the gulags.

“The Soviet mindset was to get the aircraft into action,” says Robinson. “The aircrews had minimal training and lives were thrown into the battle. Although the gunners were vulnerable, it was considered a price worth paying.”

“They suffered heavy losses,” says Stemm. “Around 12,000 were shot down by the Germans.” That is one of the reasons so few of these aircraft survive today.

This is one of the aircraft that helped win the war – John Stemm

Nevertheless, Stalin was right; the aircraft more than proved its worth. Flying in formation, squadrons of Sturmoviks supported ground assaults – destroying even the most heavily protected tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles. The planes were also used to bomb airfields and attack ships.

One tactic military strategists developed for the aircraft was the “circle of death” where a group of Sturmoviks would encircle a target at a safe altitude. On a command, each plane in succession would peel away and dive towards the ground to attack, before returning to the circle. The procedure continued until the target was destroyed or ammunition exhausted.

“This is one of the aircraft that helped win the war,” says Stemm. But when the war was over, most of the planes were scrapped – superseded by the development of combat jets. The last Sturmovik flew in combat during the Korean war in 1950. There is only one still flying today but that lacks the original engine. (Curiously, it was also recovered from a lake and ended up in the US – you can see it here.

The basic design, however, lives on. “It proved to be so effective, it was adopted by the Americans,” says Stemm.

“A heavily armoured ground attack aircraft carried on with the American A10 Thunderbolt, which is still flying today,” he says. “It’s really the same idea, the A10 is the Sturmovik’s descendent.” The Russians also have a similar jet – the Su-25 – which can perhaps claim an even more direct lineage with the Sturmovik.

The museum is even building an exact copy of the machine gun and swivel mount for the rear gunner position

At the Pima Air and Space Museum, the original Sturmovik – last seen in one piece ditching into a lake near Leningrad in 1944 – is coming back together. Although parts of the aircraft are suitable for flight, it is currently being restored for display only.

A new wooden tail section and wings have been completed, the propeller straightened and an original engine restored. The museum is even building an exact copy of the machine gun and swivel mount for the rear gunner position. It is hoped to put the completed aircraft on display in the summer.

When listing the planes that helped to win World War 2, Soviet aircraft are often neglected. The Sturmovik deserves as much recognition as the Spitfire, Lancaster or B-17 Flying Fortress in defeating the Nazis. “From an historic standpoint and because there are so few surviving,” says Stemm, “it’s a very important aircraft to preserve.”

Do you really need someone to tell you what to do at work?

Three years ago, Swedish software consultancy Crisp decided that the answer was no.

The firm, which has about 40 staff, had already trialled various organisational structures, including the more common practice of having a single leader running the company.

Crisp then tried changing its chief executive annually, based on a staff vote, but eventually decided collectively that no boss was needed.

Yassal Sundman, a developer at the firm, explains: "We said, 'what if we had nobody as our next CEO - what would that look like?' And then we went through an exercise and listed down the things that the CEO does."

The staff decided that many of the chief executive's responsibilities overlapped with those of the board, while other roles could be shared among other employees.

"When we looked at it we had nothing left in the CEO column, and we said, 'all right, why don't we try it out?'" says Ms Sundman.

Image caption The firm has detailed etiquette rules for its meetings

Crisp holds four-day meetings for all staff two to three times a year. They are used to making decisions on issues that affect everyone, such as an office move, but workers are encouraged to make decisions themselves at other times.

It also still has a board - a legal requirement - and this can be used as a last resort to resolve issues if something is not working.

Henrik Kniberg, an organisational coach at the firm, argues that not having to ask a boss for decisions on projects or budgets means the firm can respond faster.

"If you want to get something done, you stand up and start driving that," he says.

Yet Mr Kniberg stresses that not having to ask permission does not remove the need for staff to discuss issues or bounce ideas off each other.

Because they are all in charge, workers are more motivated, he argues. Crisp regularly measures staff satisfaction, and the average is about 4.1 out of five.

Image caption Crisp's Yassal Sundman says the chief executive's responsibilities are shared out

The company is set up like a family, says Mr Kniberg. While nobody tells anyone exactly what to do, the unspoken understanding is that you don't mess up the house.

But what if the rest of the staff feel that one worker has made a terrible decision?

Ms Sundman says that is okay. "At least you did the thing that was right in the moment - and then we can have a discussion about it. You can explain why it is that you thought this was a good way, and actually you might get everybody else to think the same way."

Ultimately, the firm hopes that its way of working could inspire other companies to emulate the "Crisp DNA".

Image caption Crisp staff all have an equal say in how the firm is run, they tell CEO coach Steve Tappin

Although Crisp's move may seem radical, plenty of companies have trialled a similar arrangement. One of the best-known is online shoe and clothing retailer Zappos, which is owned by Amazon.

In 2013 the firm adopted a new management structure called "holacracy", which was intended to eliminate workplace hierarchy and foster collaboration.

However, almost a fifth of Zappos staff subsequently departed, with chief executive Tony Hsieh admitting that "self-management is not for everyone".

While there is a growing trend for flatter organisational structures - meaning fewer middle managers and bosses - most of the more radical experiments are taking place in small start-ups.

As well as employing fewer people, such firms do not have the long corporate history that can make major changes much more difficult to implement.

Drew Houston, founder of online file-sharing service Dropbox, does not believe a leaderless structure can work in larger firms because it would be too chaotic.

The main risk, he says, is that staff will encroach into each other's areas of responsibility, making them less efficient.

"Often infinite freedom like that can be pretty disorientating. It doesn't always feel good, because you no longer know what you're supposed to do, what's important and you're bumping up against other people," Mr Houston says.

Similarly, Meg Whitman, chief executive of technology giant Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), firmly believes that companies need a leader.

"You've got to have the accountability, because if people in your organisation don't know what they're doing and how it affects the customers, then you've got a disconnect problem," she says.

Image copyright Hewlett Packard Enterprise Image caption HPE boss Meg Whitman says companies must have a leader to make decisions

However, HPE has tackled one problem that hinders many big companies: the time it takes to make decisions.

"We tended to let decisions sit for way too long a time," Ms Whitman says. "So we now have a little saying at Hewlett Packard Enterprise: you've got to escalate a decision or a challenge and you have to resolve it in 48 hours."

CEO coach and author Steve Tappin says even if firms are sceptical of companies that don't have a single boss, it is worth paying attention to the likes of Crisp.

"Many businesses may not want to go as far as getting rid of their chief executive, but there are valid lessons to be learnt from radical companies like Crisp," he says.

This feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin, and by series producer Neil Koenig, for the BBC's CEO Guru series.Gold hunt over picture clues under way

An official watchdog in Germany has told parents to destroy a talking doll called Cayla because its smart technology can reveal personal data.

The warning was issued by the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), which oversees telecommunications.

Researchers say hackers can use an unsecure bluetooth device embedded in the toy to listen and talk to the child playing with it.

But the UK Toy Retailers Association said Cayla "offers no special risk".

In a statement sent to the BBC, the TRA also said "there is no reason for alarm".

The Vivid Toy group, which distributes My Friend Cayla, has previously said that examples of hacking were isolated and carried out by specialists. However, it said the company would take the information on board as it was able to upgrade the app used with the doll.

But experts have warned that the problem has not been fixed.

The Cayla doll can respond to a user's question by accessing the internet. For example, if a child asks the doll "what is a little horse called?" the doll can reply "it's called a foal".

Media caption Rory Cellan-Jones sees how Cayla, a talking child's doll, can be hacked to say any number of offensive things.

A vulnerability in Cayla's software was first revealed in January 2015.

Complaints have been filed by US and EU consumer groups.

The EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Vera Jourova, told the BBC: "I'm worried about the impact of connected dolls on children's privacy and safety."

The Commission is investigating whether such smart dolls breach EU data protection safeguards.

In addition to those concerns, a hack allowing strangers to speak directly to children via the My Friend Cayla doll has been shown to be possible.

The TRA said "we would always expect parents to supervise their children at least intermittently".

It said the distributor Vivid had "restated that the toy is perfectly safe to own and use when following the user instructions".

Privacy laws

Under German law, it is illegal to sell or possess a banned surveillance device. A breach of that law can result in a jail term of up to two years, according to German media reports.

Germany has strict privacy laws to protect against surveillance. In the 20th Century Germans experienced abusive surveillance by the state - in Nazi Germany and communist East Germany.

The warning by Germany's Federal Network Agency came after student Stefan Hessel, from the University of Saarland, raised legal concerns about My Friend Cayla.

Mr Hessel, quoted by the German website Netzpolitik.org, said a bluetooth-enabled device could connect to Cayla's speaker and microphone system within a radius of 10m (33ft). He said an eavesdropper could even spy on someone playing with the doll "through several walls".

A spokesman for the federal agency told Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily that Cayla amounted to a "concealed transmitting device", illegal under an article in German telecoms law (in German).

"It doesn't matter what that object is - it could be an ashtray or fire alarm," he explained.

A father who praised "the benefits of formula milk" saw his one-week-old son taken into council care, a court heard.

Medical staff had told Kirklees Council of the man's "unorthodox views" about feeding including the need to sterilise bottles and social workers later removed the baby from the hospital.

Care chiefs then "misled" a family court and falsely claimed the parents "agreed" to the child's removal.

A High Court judge has now ordered the council to pay the family £11,250.

The baby was returned to the parents, who cannot be named for legal reasons, more than two months after being taken.

Read the latest live news updates from across West Yorkshire here

The High Court heard the mother suffered from minor mental health problems and other difficulties and the father had in the past been aggressive to others, but staff at the special care baby unit had no child protection concerns.

However, Mr Justice Cobb said medics had expressed worries about the couple's ability to care for the baby.

The father had, among other things, "expressed unorthodox views about the need for sterilisation of bottles and the benefits of formula milk".

'Human rights breached'

Kirklees Council persuaded a family court to approve the baby being taken into emergency care as he was about to be discharged from hospital.

Mr Justice Cobb said the council had "misled" the family judge, wrongly claiming the parents had been "given notice" of the hearing and had "agreed" to the child being taken.

The boy was placed in the care of relatives and returned to his parents about 10 weeks later.

Finding in favour of the family, Mr Justice Cobb said in the year since being returned to his parents the boy had thrived.

He added: "There is no doubt in my mind, indeed it is admitted, that Kirklees Council breached the human rights of a baby boy and his parents.

"I am satisfied that the breaches were serious. The separation of a baby from his parents represents a very serious interference with family life."

He awarded the mother, father and the infant £3,750 each in damages.

Kirklees Council said in a statement: "The court and parties accepted that the council was correct to issue these proceedings, but mistakes were made which resulted in the court awarding the family compensation."Drama series.

The live-action remake of Disney's classic Mulan now has a director and her name is Niki Caro.

You may not recognise her, but she is very quickly climbing the Hollywood ladder, having directed films such as Whale Rider (2002) and the soon-to-be released The Zookeeper's Wife.

Her new role at the helm of Mulan will make the New Zealander only the fifth woman to direct a movie budgeted at over $100m (£80.2m).

And, money aside, the pressure on the new Mulan is high - fans are watching very closely to see how Disney is managing the project.

Which is understandable, because the original animated film was a firm staple in the movie diet of anyone who was under 14 when it came out.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Niki Caro has previously directed Whale Rider and The Zookeeper's Wife

The original Mulan grossed $304m (£244m) worldwide when it was released in 1998.

It tells the story of a young Chinese girl who who learns that her weak father is to be called upon to join the army.

Worrying that he would never survive the hardship of war, she disguises herself and joins in his place.

In September, 18 years after it was released, Disney announced Mulan would be the latest film to receive a live-action remake.

The studio has also given The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast non-animated makeovers recently.

Image copyright REX/Shutterstock Image caption Ming-Na Wen voiced the character of Fa Mulan in the original film

Fans are watching with interest to see who is being hired to star and work on the film, which features mostly Chinese characters.

Disney have made clear they intend to shoot the Mulan remake in China, with a mostly Chinese cast.

A petition calling on Disney not to "whitewash" the film by casting white actors has attracted more than 111,000 signatures.

Who is Niki Caro?

The writer and director was born in 1967 in Wellington, New Zealand

Her first feature film as a director, Memory and Desire, was released in 1998

Caro's other directorial credits include Whale Rider and The Zookeeper's Wife, which stars Jessica Chastain

Mulan won't be the first time Caro has worked with Disney, as she previously directed 2015's McFarland, USA

There have been a number of recent high-profile movies which have been criticised for hiring an actor who is of a different race to the character they're playing.

Matt Damon recently denied his casting in The Great Wall had robbed a Chinese actor of the role.

The Hollywood-Chinese co-production, directed by Zhang Yimou, features a predominantly Chinese cast, but Damon was given the lead part.

Nina, the biopic of singer Nina Simone, also sparked complaints after lead actress Zoe Saldana's skin was made slightly darker on screen.

Her casting as Simone was criticised when it was announced in 2012, with the singer's daughter suggesting she was "not the best choice".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The story has previously been made into a dance stage show, The Legend of Mulan

Prior to Niki Caro's appointment as director of the new Mulan, the only woman to direct a Disney project budgeted at more than $100m was Ava DuVernay.

She's currently directing the fantasy adventure A Wrinkle in Time, which is released next year.

Outside of the Disney bubble, DuVernay is also the first black woman to direct a movie with a $100m budget in film history.

It's an industry-wide problem: Hollywood has notoriously few female directors.

Only one - Kathryn Bigelow - has won an Oscar for best director, while just 7% of the directors of the top 250 films of 2016 were women, according to Variety.

Could Niki Caro's appointment as the director of Mulan be a small step towards seeing more women behind the camera?

It was all part of a spur of the moment plan to get access to the backstage area.

"We were all the way at the back near the bar and I wanted to see them closer," Adam tells Newsbeat.

"Everyone on the top balcony was looking all smug, so I just went for it."

The 17-year-old from Crewe says his friends weren't keen on him trying it, for fear he'd be thrown out.

"They said if I got kicked out then they weren't coming with me."

But he went for it anyway, changing the band's Wikipedia page to say that he was the cousin of lead vocalist Kiaran Cook.

"That was the only thing I could think of that I had any kind of control over, because anyone can edit Wikipedia."

And the bouncer on the entrance to the VIP area fell for it and let him through.

Adam wasn't that keen though and soon rejoined his friends

"I didn't see the band as they were getting ready to go onstage.

"The support band were on at the time so I was just stood there with all their friends and family."

Not that he would have approached the band if he'd seen them.

"I was worried the bouncers would figure it out and see me as a threat."

He says the band do know about it

"They've not mentioned anything on any of their social media pages, but someone tagged all four of the band members on my status and I think one or two of them liked that."

"And then The Sherlock's page commented on the Lad Bible saying 'fair play to him' - so obviously they've seen it but they've not come out and referenced it specifically."

But the band have actually been in touch with the BBC.

"Fair play to the lad, we found it very funny and he put some good thought into it. Even funnier that his plan worked. Good effort!"

Adam isn't the first, and probably won't be the last, to try this stunt.

Newsbeat reported on a man who did a very similar thing in 2015 to see the duo Peking Duk in Australia.

He changed their Wikipedia page to say he was the step-brother of one of the performers and actually ended up having a beer with them.

In fact they were pretty impressed.

Adam hadn't seen the story and says he has no idea where he got the idea from but judging from the comments on his Facebook status there are many more people planning to give this a go.

It's an unusual way to get close to your forefathers, but it works for Christian Fuchs.

The walls of his elegant apartment overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Lima's bohemian Barranco district are covered with paintings of his aristocratic European and Latin American ancestors.

But if you look closer, you soon realise that many of the portraits are, in fact, photographs of the 37-year-old himself, dressed up as his relatives.

It all started when Fuchs was 10 years old.

Image caption Fuchs's great-great-great-great-grandfather led a distinguished military career and participated in the Peruvian war of independence

His mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she died five years later. His father left the family, remarried and disappeared.

Fuchs and his brother and sister were brought up by their paternal grandparents.

"I grew up with portraits and objects that had been in my family for up to five generations," he explains.

"As a child I looked at the portraits and played with them. If I didn't know the names of the characters, I invented them. I remember watching them for hours and feeling that they were watching me back. Sometimes I would talk to them, and eventually that led to my reinterpretations of them."

I began to think, 'Considering we share the same genes, could I actually look like her?'

Fuchs's grandmother, Catalina del Carmen Silva Schilling, played a very important part in all of this. Born in Chile of German ancestors, she too was brought up by her grandparents.

"She would tell me stories about our relatives from Chile and Germany, and I learned to look at things through her eyes," Fuchs says.

"It was magical. She told me about relatives like my granny's great-grandmother, Marie Schencke, who also came from Germany. Her family brought electricity to the Chilean town, Osorno."

Years later Fuchs went to university to study law, but after a few months working as a lawyer he quit to become an artist and found himself once again gazing at the portraits.

Image caption Fuchs's great-great-great-great-grandmother, Luise Friederike Charlotte Eleonora Chee, was his first recreation

"I was looking at one of the family portraits from 1830 of Eleanora, my grandmother's great-great-grandmother" he says.

"I began to think, 'Considering we share the same genes, could I actually look like her?' That afternoon I went to the hairdresser and got them to put my hair up in ringlets. I thought it was a cool idea for a new project."

The process of reinterpreting his ancestors can take many months.

Fuchs reads their letters and talks to relatives about them. He takes photos of their portraits to a local tailor who tries to imitate the garments - some of which date back to the 18th Century - as faithfully as possible, and to a jeweller who creates replicas of the jewellery.

Dressing up as a woman can be especially problematic Fuchs says, and not only because he finds the corsets very uncomfortable.

"It's complicated because I have to wax," he says, "and I have tons of hair."

Image caption It took Fuchs's great-great-grandfather Carl Schilling three months to sail from Germany to Chile. He lived there until his death in 1923 aged 93

Making up his face can also take between three and five hours, depending on the character.

Fuchs says that his most difficult project was recreating "the family's patriarch" Carl Schilling, his grandmother's great-grandfather, who arrived in Chile as a 19-year-old in 1850, on a boat full of German immigrants.

"He went down south to work as an estate manager for an aristocratic family called Buschmann and ended up marrying their daughter, Johanna," says Fuchs.

"At first my family thought I was strange, but now they really like the paintings and want to find out more about their relatives

"Carl was a real character. He learned the native language so he could talk to the indigenous Mapuche people, and he was one of the founders of the German school in Osorno - one of the oldest German schools in the world."

To become his great-great-great-grandfather Fuchs had to grow a beard. It was slow work - taking more than a year - and when it was finally long enough to be dyed white he had a severe allergic reaction to the chemicals.

But Fuchs says that he knew the transformation had been a success when on a trip to the bank he was asked if he wanted to join the special queue for elderly people.

Image caption Fuchs's great-great-great-great-grandmother Dona Natividad Martinez de Pinillos Cacho y Lavalle. Her brother-in-law was President of Peru, Luis Jose de Orbegoso

Although the finished works look very much like paintings they are, in fact, digital photographs taken under very bright lighting, which makes Fuchs's made-up skin appear very pale, almost like porcelain.

The photographs are then printed on matt, cotton paper and, as a final touch, Fuchs displays them in frames which are appropriate to the period in which the person he is recreating lived.

He exhibits and sells his recreations to art collectors around the world, but for him the project is primarily a means to help him connect with his past.

"At first my family thought I was strange," Fuchs says, "but now they really like the pieces and want to find out more about their relatives."

Media caption Christian Fuchs tells Outlook how he is transforming himself into one of his ancestors, Dorothea Viehmann.

Fuchs is currently working on transforming himself into his great-great-great-great-great-great-aunt, Dorothea Viehmann, who was born in Kassel, Germany, in 1755.

The daughter of an innkeeper, she heard many tales from the guests at her father's tavern. The Priest of the Huguenot church introduced Viehmann to the Brothers Grimm, and with that her work as a muse began.

Most of Viehmann's tales were subsequently published in the second volume of the Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales.

To achieve a good likeness, make-up artist Juan Diego Peschiera painstakingly applies layer upon layer of liquid latex to Fuchs's face.

"The eyes are the most difficult part of the face to do," he explains.

Image caption Fuchs's great-great-great-grandfather Eulogio Elespuru y Martinez de Pinillos lived in Paris for many years

"Wrinkles go in different directions, so we have to make the latex go in different directions to create that effect. If we do it in just one layer it looks fake, so we need to build up lots of different layers. At first I apply alcohol-based make-up and then the liquid latex, it's translucent and you can see all the different capillaries under the skin."

Fuchs has recreated 11 ancestral portraits so far and has many more in mind, including Queen Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots, and William Shakespeare. Fuchs believes they are all distantly related to him and plans to confirm that using a genetic genealogy website.

But there is one very special person he would particularly like to transform himself into, his grandmother, Catalina del Carmen.

Carmen, who was like a mother to Fuchs, died just after Christmas and he is still grieving.

"It will be really hard to do her justice," he says, "she was so pretty and had a much smaller nose than me, but I definitely want to try."

But in a quiet corner of Sai Kung district, about 25km northeast of Central, a tiny island offers a rare peek into the past. Affectionately nicknamed “Ghost Island”, Yim Tin Tsai is lush and green – and peppered with decomposing homes.

The island was once home to a thriving Hakka community, a clan that migrated from northern China centuries ago. They settled on the empty island and built salt pans to earn a living. In fact, Yim Tin Tsai means “Little Salt Pan” in Cantonese. When the salt pans shut down more than 100 years ago due to rising competition from Vietnam and China, most residents turned to farming, fishing and husbandry.

At its peak in the 1940s, it’s thought that there were anywhere between 500 and 1,200 people living on the island. But in the 1960s, more and more families left to access education beyond the village’s primary school, moving to Kowloon or further afield to the UK.

The last of the villagers on Yim Tin Tsai emigrated by the 1990s, and, in the years following, Yim Tin Tsai lay empty, with entire homes left to deteriorate.

But, for a handful of villagers, the island represented something special – a unique side of Hong Kong’s history and culture that shouldn’t be forgotten.

New beginnings

If travellers visited Yim Tin Tsai a decade ago, they’d have found nothing but overgrown weeds, crumbling houses and dusty brown fields. That’s exactly what village representative Colin Chan saw when he returned to the island after 40 years.

“I came back here searching to recover something that felt lost,” Colin said. “I found the island was in decay, and I was very upset. This is the place I grew up. This is my father’s home, and his father’s home.”

Chan’s forefathers settled the island more than 300 years ago. An eighth-generation villager, he lived in Yim Tin Tsai until he was seven, relocating to Sai Kung and later to the UK to further his education.

“As a child, I remember running all over the mountains,” he said. “I miss that village feeling. I can't find that in other places in Hong Kong ­– but it still exists here.”

In 1999, Colin was elected as village representative and began what would become a lifelong mission: to resurrect the island. For the first few years, he focused on building a network of villagers from around the world, hoping to create a like-minded community of descendants and volunteers who would help to rebuild Yim Tin Tsai in a sustainable way.

Real momentum began in 2003 when the Catholic Church canonised Josef Freinademetz, an influential missionary who lived among the villagers for a stint in the 1800s. After the news broke, Catholics from all over the world earmarked the little island for pilgrimages, and Colin wanted to ensure they arrived with a warm welcome.

A living museum

Together with a committee of about 10 former villagers, Colin raised money to build a visitor centre for travellers. In 2004, a charitable foundation donated funds through the Catholic Church to renovate the island’s historical chapel. Originally built in 1890 by Catholic missionaries, it’s one of the oldest of its kind in Hong Kong.

Simple and elegant, the egg-white chapel features radiant stained-glass windows and an intimate prayer hall. A few rows of wooden pews face a minimalist altar, dressed up in red and gold accents. In 2005, Unesco Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation honoured the chapel with an award of merit.

Motivated by the recognition, the villagers organised a regular ferry schedule to enable travellers to reach the island, and set out to showcase the village’s unique history. They built a heritage trail, renovated Hakka ancestral homes, created a homewares and ceramics museum, and even started an organic farm that sits at the foot of the church.

“I want to make the island like a living museum,” Colin said. “Ten years ago, people weren’t really thinking about heritage and preservation. They wanted to make money and build high rises. But now people are taking notice.”

Salt of the Earth

After a string of successful renovations, the committee turned their focus to the island’s old salt pans. What was just a dusty dirt field a decade ago is now a fully functioning salt pan, complete with an educational visitor centre that explains each step of the salt production process.

In 2015, the resurrected salt fields earned a Unesco distinction for conserving this industrial Hong Kong heritage, estimated to date back more than 2,000 years.

Today the salt pans sparkle in the sunlight, surrounded by graceful mangrove trees. They don’t produce enough salt to be commercially viable, but as the only functioning salt pans in Hong Kong, they act as a nostalgic link to the past.

“Recreating the salt fields makes me really happy because it brings me closer to my ancestors,” said Rosa Chan, an island tour guide and eighth-generation villager. “It’s very fulfilling to be able to do the same thing that our families did centuries ago.”

Rosa lived on the island until she was 13, and then moved to Kowloon City to continue her studies. Later she moved to the UK with her family until she retired.

“When I came back to Hong Kong, I felt like it was my responsibility to help out,” she said. “When I first returned, everything was broken. And the plants were overgrown. The grass scratched my legs.”

Her family moved away when she was young in search of a better life, but for Rosa, that life is right here on the island. “I feel at home in nature,” she said. “I love to catch crabs, go fishing – the nature brings me here. I can’t do these things in Kowloon.”

These days, she visits the island twice a week from her home in Kowloon to tend to the gardens and give tours. There are plenty of guests to welcome: the less than 1sqkm island saw nearly 34,000 visitors in 2016, most of whom came to learn about the salt pans, explore the heritage trail, hike around the island or simply find a quiet place to meditate.

Walking through the village, visitors get a sense of the community that once was, thanks to the rows of beautifully crumbling homes with traditional Hakka-style slate roofs and tiled facades. And even though many of the village houses are still run-down and desolate, Rosa doesn’t skip past the broken windows.

“When people come here, I am more than happy to show the ruined houses,” she said. "Because it tells all the history. It’s part of our story."

The wife of Zimbabwe's 92-year-old President, Robert Mugabe, has said that he is so popular that if he died, he could run as a corpse in next year's election and still win votes.

Grace Mugabe, 51, was addressing a rally of the governing Zanu-PF party.

Mr Mugabe has governed Zimbabwe since the end of white-majority rule in 1980 following a bitterly fought war.

His wife, who has often professed her undying loyalty to her husband, has assumed an increasingly high profile.

"One day when God decides that Mugabe dies, we will have his corpse appear as a candidate on the ballot paper," Mrs Mugabe told the rally in Buhera, south-east of the capital Harare.

"You will see people voting for Mugabe as a corpse. I am seriously telling you - just to show people how people love their president."

President Mugabe has been backed by his party to stand again in next year's election, but recently cut back on his public engagements.

Grace Mugabe has warned contemporaries of Mr Mugabe from the guerrilla war era that they are not in a position to replace him because they likewise would be too old.

"Anyone who was with Mugabe in 1980 has no right to tell him he is old. If you want Mugabe to go, then you leave together. You also have to leave. Then we take over because we were not there in 1980," she said, gesticulating towards herself.

Last September, the president was rumoured to have died after he reportedly cut short his attendance of an AU summit to fly to Dubai for a health check.

Mr Mugabe later joked about the rumours, saying he indeed died but was only resurrected.Media caption The woman using blockchain technology to prove where food comes from

Jessi Baker thanks her mother for the inspiration to start her company, Provenance.

Set up just a few years ago, Provenance says it is lighting a fire under the retail world.

The company is based around an app which allows retailers and customers to see where a product comes from, from its origins to its point of sale.

"Behind every product is a complex chain of people and places and that's a really important part of why people buy things," Ms Baker explains.

"Provenance is all about making that information transparent to shoppers but also to businesses all along the supply chain."

Jessi and Jenny

Image copyright Jessie Baker Image caption Jessi Baker with her mother Jenny who inspired her business

But it began with her mother Jenny.

"She's a pioneer of conscious consumption," Ms Baker says.

"She raised me, my brother and sister, to care about what we eat and buy, but also helped us understand from an early age where things come from.

"For a long time, I think most of our meals came from under one mile from our home in Wiltshire, vegetables from the garden and animal products from our neighbour's farm."

While training to be a manufacturing engineer, Ms Baker visited dozens of supply chains to see how different products were sourced and created. But the breakthrough came in 2013, when she was studying for a PhD in computer science and started to look into the emerging blockchain technology.

"You can think of a blockchain," Ms Baker says, "as a shared data system that everyone can use in order to be able to trust information. What it's allowed us to do is to have a shared system of record that nobody can tamper with and everybody can see."

Provenance uses this technology to log and store every stage of a supply chain in a way that anyone can access.

Student project to global ambition

Image caption Provenance has staff in four countries around the world

Now the company, which started as a part-time interest while Ms Baker was studying, has become a full-time business. She has put her PhD on hold, as she's busy running a company with 10 staff based in four countries: the UK, the US, France and Germany.

"We have no physical things apart from our laptops," Ms Baker points out. "So we can move the team wherever we want to around the world."

The company started out working with small brands and, in July 2016, signed its first commercial client, the UK's fifth largest food and grocery retailer, the Co-op. Provenance is now helping the Co-op track fresh products through its supply chains.

Image caption Customers can check the supply chain of a product on their phones in a shop using Provenance

"We've attracted lots of pioneering food and drinks businesses," Ms Baker says.

"It's as much about reassuring businesses that they are selling things that are correct and trustworthy as it is about consumers being able to understand that as well."

Fishy business

Image caption Provenance is built to tackle fraudulent claims about the ethical sourcing of products such as fish

Provenance's first victory for sourcing ethical products came with a humble fish.

In early 2016 in Indonesia, Provenance tracked the first fish on the blockchain.

Working with a non-governmental organisation to certify a socially sustainable catch of fish, the company in effect created a digital passport for the fish.

Provenance has now set up partnerships with tagging, DNA scanning and digital imaging companies to strengthen the connections between physical products and their digitised claims.

As well as fish, Provenance now tracks other foods, such as eggs and dairy. It says that lots of products, not just food, can be tracked and sourced in this way.

Blockchain beginnings

Image caption Chris Haley of Nesta says that blockchain technology is still immature

But Ms Baker admits that there are still some issues with the scaling up of the technology.

"We're on the bleeding edge of a new technology and occasionally having to wait for it to get developed a bit more in order to be able to develop on top of it," she says.

Another problem is the reputation of blockchains.

"The main challenge for Provenance is that it's being built upon a technology that is relatively immature," says Chris Haley, an analyst from innovation specialist, Nesta.

Media caption Karishma Vaswani takes a look at blockchain and explains how it works

"There are still some risks that are unclear, but we're beginning to see blockchains being used in really quite a wide variety of applications. It is potentially a much simpler way of transacting." he says.

But Ms Baker has a long-term vision.

"We are disruptive and we're trying to disrupt the industry for good." she says.

"The ultimate goal of Provenance is that one day it will be impossible to buy a product that compromises your health and morals. Businesses that have very opaque supply chains and are not taking active steps to make them transparent should really fear us."Các đơn vị an ninh, tình báo của Anh: GCHQ, MI5, MI6

Phóng viên cần đảm bảo không nhầm lẫn giữa ba đơn vị tình báo khác nhau của Anh: GCHQ, MI5 and MI6.

Chúng ta dễ bị nhầm lẫn giữa ba đơn vị tình báo Anh khác nhau, gồm GCHQ, MI5 và MI6. Học viện Báo chí BBC sẽ giúp bạn 'hóa giải' những sai lầm này.

Ngạn ngữ xưa có câu: "Những người biết thì không nói, những người nói thì không biết."

Đó không phải là một quy tắc tồi khi ta nhìn vào những câu chuyện về ngành an ninh, tình báo. Tất nhiên là không tính trường hợp bạn có những mối liên hệ ở cấp cao nhất.

Ngay cả khi đó, bạn cũng hiếm khi nêu rõ nguồn cung cấp tin cho mình và phải sẵn sàng chấp nhận chuyện những gì bạn tường thuật dựa trên cơ sở nguồn tin bí mật sẽ bị giới chức bác bỏ thẳng tay.

GCHQ

GCHQ thu thập tin tức tình báo từ các hoạt động thông tin liên lạc trên toàn cầu. Đây chính là hậu duệ của những người chuyên làm công tác giải mật mã trong thời chiến tại Bletchley Park.

GCHQ cung cấp cho các cơ quan thuộc chính phủ và quân đội các tín hiệu tình báo (SIGINT - signals intelligence) thu thập được qua việc theo dõi toàn bộ các thông tin liên lạc điện tử và các hệ thống thông tin khác, bao gồm cả internet.

Mục tiêu là nhằm hỗ trợ cho việc ra quyết định của chính phủ trong các lĩnh vực như an ninh quốc gia, các chiến dịch quân sự và cho việc thực thi pháp luật.

Đồng thời, GCHQ chịu trách nhiệm đảm bảo tình trạng cài 'bọ' nghe lén không xâm nhập được vào các hệ thống thông tin liên lạc của chính phủ Anh. Do vậy, cơ quan này tuyển dụng các chuyên gia trong lĩnh vực an ninh và mã hóa.

Mục tiêu là nhằm bảo vệ hệ thống trực tuyến của chính phủ khỏi sự xâm nhập từ bên ngoài.

GCHQ cũng có nhiệm vụ bảo vệ cơ sở hạ tầng quốc gia (nước, điện, hệ thống liên lạc, v.v...) không bị bên ngoài làm xáo trộn và gây gián đoạn.

GCHQ chịu trách nhiệm trước Ngoại trưởng, nhưng không phải là đơn vị thuộc Bộ Ngoại giao Anh.

MI5

MI5 có trụ sở chính tại tòa nhà Thames House, nơi từng là trụ sở của ICI bên dòng sông Thames ở khu vực Millbank của London.

Mục tiêu hoạt động của cơ quan này được quy định tại Đạo luật Hoạt động An ninh 1989 như sau: "Bảo vệ an ninh quốc gia và cụ thể là bảo vệ trước các mối đe dọa phản quốc, khủng bố và phá hoại, trước các hoạt động của các điệp viên nước ngoài và trước các hành động nhằm lật đổ hoặc làm suy yếu nền dân chủ nghị viện qua các biện pháp chính trị, nghiệp đoàn hoặc bạo lực, và bảo vệ sự lành mạnh của nền kinh tế Anh quốc."

MI5 có khoảng 3.800 nhân viên. Bộ trưởng Nội vụ chịu trách nhiệm về hoạt động của cơ quan này.

MI6

Đây là lãnh địa của James Bond. Hoặc ít ra đó cũng là điều hầu hết các phóng viên cho là vậy.

Theo nội dung ghi trên trang web của mình thì Cơ quan Tình báo Mật (SIS - Secret Intelligence Service), hay được biết đến nhiều hơn với tên gọi MI6, đem đến cho chính phủ Anh khả năng theo dõi âm thầm trên toàn cầu nhằm bảo vệ an ninh quốc gia và kinh tế Anh.

Những thứ mà SIS quan tâm đến là chủ nghĩa khủng bố, buôn lậu ma túy, phổ biến vũ khí có sức phá hủy hàng loạt và gây bất ổn khu vực.

MI6 từng kín tiếng tới mức chưa bao giờ cơ quan này được nhắc đến một cách chính thức. Sự tồn tại của nó bị chối biến, hoặc ít nhất cũng là không được thừa nhận. Cho đến tận 1994 cơ quan này mới được đề cập công khai.

Hiện đây vẫn là một tổ chức vô cùng bí mật. Giám đốc là người duy nhất được chính thức nêu công khai danh tính, và thường được nhắc tới với bí danh 'C', chữ cái viết tắt theo tên của giám đốc đầu tiên, Mansfield Cumming.

Trụ sở chính của SIS là một địa điểm nổi tiếng ở London, nằm bên bờ nam sông Thames, gần cầu Vauxhall.

Hồi 2006, MI6 lần đầu tiên đã cho phép thực hiện một cuộc phỏng vấn giữa các nhân viên đang tại nhiệm với Colin Murray trong chương trình phát thanh BBC Radio 1.

Giọng nó của hai nhân viên tham gia cuộc phỏng vấn (một nam giới, một phụ nữ) đã được làm biến dạng đi vì lý do an ninh.

Họ đã làm giảm nhẹ bớt những ánh màu rực rỡ mà mọi người thường nghĩ về cơ quan an ninh này. Họ nói họ chủ yếu làm công tác thu thập tin tình báo.

Cơ quan này thậm chí còn quảng cáo công khai việc tuyển ứng viên trong những ngày này.

What does this mean for the future of work?Image copyright Getty Images

Four weeks. Twenty-eight days. It feels like 280 days. I feel 280. If Donald Trump is exhausting even the news-hungry political journalists, I wonder what he is doing to the rest of the world.

For the first three weeks I started the day repeating a mantra, "watch what he does, not what he says." I've discarded that notion. What Mr Trump says and how he says it is an important part of his presidency. His rhetoric, both in person and Twitter, appeals to his supporters. It's new and fresh and irreverent. But one day it could also be his undoing. He is increasingly losing respect among key Republicans, and he needs them to govern effectively.

Media caption Trump's busy first month in 90 seconds

This is my fourth American administration and we've never seen anything like it for sheer non-stop drama. Lewinsky was a daily feast of slightly prudish titillation, but it was one story line, and in the end it was just sex. 9/11 was far more serious and scary, and the ramifications lasted far beyond that fateful morning. But in a way it was a more conventional (though nonetheless horrifying) story of geopolitics and ideology. We journalists knew how to cover them both.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John McCain has been a Republican critic of Trump

Sometimes now, I admit, I'm at a loss. There is so much to say and think, and even feel, about the Trump administration that I find myself curiously stuck for words.

What's the most important story here? Is the psychodrama of a president who is both fantastically confident and oddly insecure, who publicly lashes out those who offend him and rewards those who please him? Is it the hard right turn he plans for America? Is it Russia, the curious crush Donald Trump seems to have on Vladimir Putin and what that might mean for global security? Is it America's allies, floundering in the face of this unpredictability?

Four long long weeks ago, we speculated that this may become a normal presidency, hemmed in by the restrictions of US institutions and the customs of US political tradition. We were wrong, again.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor

Yes, Mr Trump has seen his agenda slowed, either by the structures of government or the realities of diplomacy. On five major national and international issues. he has either rowed back or been checked.

In a long overdue phone call with Xi Jinping he gave up toying with the one China policy.

In a conversation with a top EU official, members of his administration said Mr Trump would not tear up the Iran nuclear deal even though, in the President's words, it is the worst deal America has ever made.

In a statement the White House urged the Israelis to stop building new settlements in the West Bank.

A judge in Seattle and an appeals court in San Francisco have halted his immigration ban, at least for now.

Repealing Obamacare "on day one" did not happen - a recognition that without a replacement the slogan was just that, a slogan.

That's how government functions. Even this White House, with its ambition of rapid change, has been forced to bow somewhat to business as normal. Especially on foreign policy, there is actually little difference today between the Obama and Trump policies.

Media caption Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job'

But in other more profound ways this administration is anything but normal - which is precisely what Mr Trump's voters wanted.

For a start, the president himself breaks the rules. He berates allies (Australia, Mexico,) praises despots (notably, and most worryingly, Putin) and he has dropped the filter of "behaving presidentially." His Twitter attacks on the press, the intelligence services and individual Senators feel more schoolyard than Oval Office.

There is so much personal drama in his early morning tirades that I wake up anxious wondering who is it today and what does it all mean? But his supporters didn't send him to Washington to play nice. All the polls suggest they still really like what they see.

Media caption Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from?

That his White House acts like some medieval court is not really so unusual. Jockeying for power has been a long tradition of US administrations. But it doesn't usually play out on the front pages of the newspaper. It also doesn't usually lead to the firing of one senior official within the first month and his potential replacement turning down the job because he fears being tainted by the dysfunction.

Whatever the president may say, that is not normal and it is not a well-oiled machine.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Candidate Trump met with Mexican president Pena Nieto during the campaign

Then there's the issue of what to believe. We've never seen an administration where one official says one thing publicly and the president says another. On the two state solution, the firing of General Flynn and Russian interference in the election, this week alone saw a string of public contradictions.

It is hard to see how this is sustainable. A lot is not getting done because of the administration chaos. There is still no tax reform bill, no Obamacare replacement, no infrastructure spending plan - all things he planned to do immediately.

It is also hard to see how it ends. President Trump appears to like the chaos theory of government and it fits his narrative of change.

Four weeks in, his approval ratings are not great but they're not disastrous. The most reliable national poll, by one of the few truly non-partisan organisations left in America, Pew Research, has him at 39%. That's lower than his predecessors at this stage but it's not through the floor.

In twenty years in Washington, I've never heard so much talk of the possibility of a President not finishing his term, even in the late 90s at the height of Clinton's Lewinsky scandal. But for that to happen there are only two options, Mr Trump would have to resign or be impeached. For the moment neither of those look at all likely.The man who came up with "demonetisation" on whether India did it right.There have been times when Nick Heilmann has looked around his hometown and wondered if there’s a single person there who thinks the way he does.

In August, when the US presidential election came down to two candidates, neither of whom he liked, Heilmann and his family decided to move from the US state of Indiana to Victoria, Canada. When he told friends and family about his plan to move, many wondered if he was abandoning his country.

“I’m very much against nationalism,” he says of his thinking on moving from one country to another. “You were lucky enough to be born on one side of an imaginary line that some politician drew on a map. How does that make you more special?”

You were lucky enough to be born on one side of an imaginary line. How does that make you more special?

The move wasn’t difficult for Heilmann, logistically or emotionally. He already works from home in his job as a senior gameplay engineer for San Francisco-based game developer Kixeye Inc. And he says his soon-to-be home in British Columbia aligns more closely with his left-leaning ideals.

It’s not a new concept, the idea of moving somewhere that’s more fitting with how you think or the way you want to live your life. But in this era of telecommuting, and as companies spread wider across the globe, it has become much easier.

After the Brexit vote and the election of President Trump, many more people than normal have considered leaving their “passport” countries, according to Grace Garland, head of public relations for Movehub, a site that offers advice and help to people relocating overseas.

In the wake of these political outcomes, Movehub saw an immediate increase in traffic from people considering moving from the UK and the US. Most dramatically, Movehub saw a 1,000% increase in traffic to pages with information on how to become a citizen of the European Union, and a 5,000% increase in searches on moving to Canada from several US states, including Virginia, Florida, and New Jersey.

The site has also seen a marked increase in people seeking to be contacted by relocation companies, a sign that they’re increasingly considering a move or committing to relocation. After Trump’s inauguration, for instance, Movehub saw a 36% increase in people from the US requesting to be contacted by moving companies.

They’re not just dreaming about moving away… they are actually taking the first steps

“They’re not just researching and dreaming about moving away,” Garland says. “They are actually taking the first steps.” Typically, those who ask to be contacted by a moving company actually begin negotiating a move 70% of the time. But for the past six months, Movehub’s average has been over 85%.

Movehub found that most people were looking to move to countries with more liberal or progressive politics. In response, it produced a world map detailing the most liberal nations. Topping the list: Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.

Making a statement

Leaving the UK before Brexit is something many are considering, in part as a way to maintain the sense of being European, and not just British. A native of England, Clare Fenwick always considered herself a citizen of Europe, so she left London last autumn as part of a wider plan to make sure she could continue to travel freely throughout the continent.

Now she’s working on a PhD at Leiden University in the Netherlands, studying migration in Europe.

“It’s not so much about living in a place with people who think like me, but in a country with people who are interested in the concept of solidarity,” Fenwick wrote in an email to BBC Capital. “If people are really unhappy with the political trajectory of their country then they should consider making a move abroad.”

Not just politics

It’s easy to think that the polarised political climates in so many countries across today’s world are the main cause for people choosing to cross borders indefinitely.

But this recent trend actually has as much or more to do with technology, says Joe Peppard, a professor at the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin. A decade ago, moving to a country that aligns more with your personal or political beliefs or lifestyle preferences typically meant finding an office job there first.

Since 2005, the number of people working from home has more than doubled, according to GlobalWorkplaceAnalytics.com. Employees of the world’s Fortune 1000 companies now spend half their time, on average, away from their desks. Companies across the globe are scrambling to accommodate remote workforces.

Sometimes it’s possible to dictate your own terms

For an employee with the desire to move countries but not to upset their working life or career altogether, the barriers to relocation are shrinking left and right. Say you want to leave Germany because of objections to its lenient immigration laws, or flee Greece over austerity measures, and have the means to do so, it may now be easier than ever before.

“Sometimes it’s possible to dictate your own terms,” Peppard says.

Peppard says there’s no telling how many workers or entire companies, particularly in the West, will move for political or ethical reasons in the next few years, as national debates over globalism make some countries more insular and others more open. It may be a phenomenon that’s more talked about than a reality, he says, or it could be the start of a global trend.

“Technology has meant people are not tied to an office the ways they have been,” says Peppard, himself a native of Ireland who splits his time teaching in Germany and Australia. “It’s an entire shift in the mindset of demarcation.”

Staying home instead

While some are moving to new countries for a better personal fit, others are declining offers to work overseas for the same reasons.

Michelle Reilly has seen this more and more in her role as managing director of the London-based contract management company 6CATS. Her company does significant business in the Middle East, and, says Reilly, this way of thinking is most prominent for US workers considering a move to Middle Eastern countries, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Some prospective hires have expressed concerns that the US’s recent attempts to ban immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries will make them pariahs when travelling to Arab nations.

Lately, she’s had workers decline job offers for these reasons. Many of these reticent potential hires are seasoned expats who have already spent considerable time overseas, Reilly says.

“For a long time now, it was widely accepted that people travelled around the world without borders for new jobs, but that seems to be eroding,” Reilly said. “We’re seeing big changes in the way people are thinking about moving to new countries.”

We’re seeing big changes in the way people are thinking about moving to new countries

In reality, most immigrants will be welcome when moving internationally. Most people in countries across the globe are willing to accept newcomers as citizens, according to a new Pew Research Center study. People in most nations think immigrants can become citizens and fit in to their new country, just like native-born people.

Reilly is considering a move outside the UK before Brexit comes into effect because she fears it will be more complicated for her company to do work in European Union countries unless it relocates to one. Ireland or Spain, places that align more closely with Reilly’s ideal of globalisation over nationalism, top the list.

“Our first choice is Ireland because there is no language barrier, but Spain sure is sunnier,” Reilly says.

A plume of "tropical air" is expected to sweep across parts of the UK over the weekend, bringing unseasonably mild temperatures, says BBC Weather.

Forecaster Steve Cleaton said: "Through the weekend, increasingly mild air of tropical origin will be steered across the UK by westerly winds."

Temperatures are expected to peak on Monday, with highs of 17C in some parts.

The record temperature recorded for a day in February was 19.7C in 1998.

The mild weather will be enjoyed across much of England, east Wales, eastern Scotland and eastern parts of Northern Ireland. In western and northern parts, the weather is likely to be more rainy and cloudy.

The rise could see the UK enjoy higher temperatures than parts of southern Europe, including the Balearic islands of Menorca and Majorca.

Our forecaster said the unusually high temperatures were the result of mild and moist air and a meteorological phenomenon called the Foehn effect.

Google is planning to bring artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to the Raspberry Pi.

The low-cost credit-card sized computer is widely used by schools and the maker community for programming devices.

Google has asked makers to complete a survey about what smart tools would be "most helpful".

And it suggests tools to aid face and emotion recognition, speech-to-text translation, natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

Google has previously developed a range of tools for machine learning, internet of things devices, wearables, robotics and home automation.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation said the new tools could enable makers "to build even more powerful projects".

"Google is going to arrive in style in 2017. The tech titan has exciting plans for the maker community," said the foundation in its blog.

A Google spokeswoman told the BBC: "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing more open source machine learning tools with the community - stay tuned for more this year."

Eben Upton, founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, told the BBC: "It's fantastic to see Google getting closer to the maker community.

"I'm particularly excited about the prospect of connecting Raspberry Pi to some of the machine learning work coming out of Google DeepMind in London, allowing us to build smart devices that interact in the real world."

In 2015, the Raspberry Pi became the most popular British computer ever made.

More than 10 million have now been sold.

The Pi, which was originally manufactured in Wales, has been adopted by school children, programmers and inventors around the world.

Two people are killed as California is hit by flash floods from its biggest storm in years.The wolves stare right at me. When I look back, their yellow-grey eyes seem to pierce straight through my flesh. They are only a dozen feet away, pacing on long legs and bobbing their heads curiously.

There is the sound of chanting, and a woman with jet-black hair lights a bundle of sage and waves the smoke over me. I try to forget the carnivores just steps away and train my gaze on the high priestess in front of me. The chanting grows louder. She places a deerskin medicine bag around my neck, crooning in a long-forgotten tongue.

The smoke passes over my limbs, face and chest. The wolves slow their steps, as curious at the procession as I was. One of them yelps: excited, or maybe nervous. I am being given access to a special circle, something few are allowed to join.

Suddenly, the wolf mother stops chanting. "You have a native soul," she says in English, dabbing my forehead with her thumb.

The sun is down, the sage burned to ashes, and the ceremony complete. Tonya Littlewolf Carloni laughs. A male wolf with a black coat stretches his nose to the sky and howls. The pack follows in melancholy refrain.

Fables depict the howl of wolves as a signal of danger and evil. But as they sing in harmony, Tonya closes her eyes and smiles. For a long moment, we stand there listening, as if transported to prehistory. Finally she turns to me, her blue-green eyes sparkling.

"They accept you as their brother," she says. "Now you're a Chiricahua Mescalero Apache."

It is June 2016, and I am visiting Wolf Mountain Sanctuary: a dusty compound of chaparral, tumbleweed and scrub nestled in a high desert valley a few hours' drive from Los Angeles, California. It is late evening, but the temperature is still around 40C. Looking up, there are mountains everywhere: a panorama of rocky peaks dotted with green pines and touched with snow from the midriffs up. We could be anywhere in the south-west.

Shanta weighed two pounds and was so malnourished she had to be bottle-fed

Tonya is testy when it comes to her exact location. She would not reveal it to me until I was on the highway and had got lost twice. But she has reason to be wary. The neighbours have not always been welcoming. Giving out an address, even a phone number, invites trouble. In the past, people have thrown rocks, tried to break in and free the wolves, or even to poison them. That is why there is so much chain-link, and why Tonya is edgy.

The animals here are not wild hunters, "and they're not pets," Tonya says emphatically. They are rescues. "They couldn't survive on their own."

Many are not full-blooded wolves. Most are wolf-hybrids, containing either dog or coyote parentage.

They are the abused, the abandoned, and they can be scary from afar. They are huge and muscular, with inquisitive eyes and probing snouts that sniff everything. It is easy to be intimidated, until you see how gentle they can be.

Tonya strokes the ivory coat of Shanta, who came here in 2002 when she was 14 days old, rescued from a breeder who could not sell her. Shanta weighed two pounds and was so malnourished she had to be bottle-fed. I expect her to be fearful of me, the newcomer. But she lets me pet her, and licks my face when I come close.

Some, like Shanta and her brother Wakinyan, come from breeders looking to cash in on the dream pet. Others are rescues from the film business. All are born in captivity, so they can never be released. That is the sad part.

"They're too used to getting fed," says Tonya. "They've never seen the wild. They'd be killed after one day in the wild. That's why they can't go back. I'd rather them run free and be happy. They're happy here, it's just, I don't like them being in a cage."

It is strange to see an animal known for its freedom locked up. Wolves are known to have territories that can span as much as 1,000 square miles. Here they are forced into small enclosures. It is hardly solitary confinement, but they are still deprived of their natural freedom.

Still, I ask myself: surely this is better than the alternative? A life in captivity must be better than certain death. That is the rationale Tonya seems to take, and it is one that begins to win me over.

Wolves have been extinct in California for nearly a century. That changed in 2011 when a radio-collared male travelled 2,500 miles south into the golden state. Telemetry tracking showed that he ended up finding a mate and settling in Oregon, but since then there have been almost a dozen sightings here.

Wolves once had the largest distribution of any land mammal besides us

Since 2015 there have been reports of a pack on the border. A few other loners have been spotted in north-eastern California: they drift in from Oregon, which is home to around 100 wolves.

Even this handful of wolves was enough to create tension: over a perceived uptick in livestock deaths, and over the danger to people. Sensing this, in 2015 California's Department of Fish and Wildlife penned a 311-page draft plan centring on non-lethal management. The aim is to re-educate people, persuading them to accept big bad wolves in their neighbourhoods, and teaching them what to do if they meet one.

It was not always like this.

Wolves once had the largest distribution of any land mammal besides us. As many as two million wolves roamed throughout North America. They are almost all gone now, killed by humans.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 listed the grey wolf as protected

"There had never been a killing like it," Barry Lopez wrote in his 1978 book Of Wolves and Men. Lopez called the killing a "pogrom", a sort of interspecies genocide.

Fuelled by a mix of fear and superstition, the US government has sanctioned and bankrolled a host of brute-force tactics. Lopez claims that the government has resorted to arsenic, strychnine, cyanide, shooting wolves down from planes and helicopters, and even dynamiting den sites with cubs.

Millions died, and not just wolves. Poisons intended for wolves ended up killing coyotes, foxes, raccoons, eagles, hawks and prairie dogs.

De-wolfing the West was in its own way a fulfilment of Manifest Destiny. Like the American Indian, the wolf was seen as a threat to law and order, a menace to be controlled – in practice, annihilated.

Today, few exist in the contiguous states.

There are the descendants of the original 41 Canadian and Montana wolves released in Yellowstone in 1995-1997; a few hundred that have spilled over into neighbouring Wyoming and Montana; a handful of packs in the Rockies; a few thousand in the Great Lake states of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan; a scattering in the north-west; and a trickle in Maine and the north-east, down from Ontario.

Wolves account for less than 4% of all cattle deaths in the US

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 listed the grey wolf as protected. But that actually means each state is responsible for managing its own wolves. Some have stringent protections, others do not.

For instance, in Alaska the wolf population is considered strong, so there is no protection and wolf season is year-round. That is no good for the animal's long-term health. Retired park officials there say the constant barrage has begun to chip at numbers.

In practice, the key issue is how hunters and farmers react to the wolves. Ranchers still hold major sway over many of the rural areas where wolves live, and they essentially have carte blanche. If they believe the wolves are a threat to their livestock, they are likely to kill them.

The irony is that wolves are actually not a terrible scourge of cattle. Disease and predation from coyotes, cougars, bears and others far outranks wolf killings. According to the National Agricultural Statistic Service, wolves account for less than 4% of all cattle deaths in the US.

What's more, if a rancher shoots a wolf he may exacerbate the problem. For instance, killing a wolf can destabilise its pack, leading young and inexperienced wolves to resort to easier targets – like livestock.

The fact is, wolves remain polarising. Some still see them as demons. Others view them as symbols of the wild, important for restoring the balance of nature, so they support reintroduction and breeding programs.

We get a lot of wolves from people who think wolves make good pets. They don't

That is why there has been a renewed push by conservation groups to buoy their status following the federal government’s 2015 decision to decline their endangered reclassification. Those petitions even include stripping the wolf of its federal endangered status, which only grants nominal national protection and exposes the animal to the fickle policies of individual states.

But while wolves remain rare in the wild, in the wilds of the Internet they are everywhere. A cursory Google search unleashes a trove of "wolves" for sale. Many are more dog than anything else, but even a splash of wild blood is too much for city life. Like other exotic animals that look cute as babes but terrifying full-grown, many end up abandoned and abused.

"We get a lot of wolves from people who think wolves make good pets," says Tonya. "They don't."

But saving these castaways is a hugely difficult task.

There are three main problems with running a wolf sanctuary. Aside from the fact that people do not trust wolves, it is expensive and closely regulated.

Tonya has 10 wolves at her sanctuary, each weighing over 100 pounds. That is a lot of mouths to feed.

We had to get an insurance policy of $3 million

In the wild, wolves fast up to 2 weeks when prey is scarce, and gorge as much as 20lb in one sitting. Here, they are fed daily on red meat, chicken, turkey and vegetables: a menu that costs a whopping $1,500 a week. Tonya also has to pay for water, power, staff, grounds and enclosure maintenance, fencing, construction and landscaping: using nothing but visitor donations.

Then there is the red tape.

Lorin Lindner runs the Lockwood Animal Rescue Center in Frazier Park, California, which is home to a pack of wolves. Because the Center is an accredited sanctuary, the animals cannot be bred or sold, and the paperwork is immense. "US Fish and Wildlife permit, California Fish & Game permit, Department of Agriculture permit, conditional use permit from the county of Ventura, which took two years and $200,000," Lindner says. "And we had to get an insurance policy of $3 million. It's very hard."

Similarly, Wolf Mountain has a restricted species permit from California's Department of Fish and Wildlife, and a resident exhibiting permit, according to its public information officer Andrew Hughan. "We make scheduled annual inspections, but any facility can be inspected at any time," he wrote by email. Typically, permits are renewed every three years.

Clearly, only someone as single-minded as Tonya could have created Wolf Mountain.

Tonya is half-Apache, half-Sicilian. She calls herself a "fiery mutt".

In the 1950s, her mother gave her up for adoption and planned to sell her to a white family in Beverly Hills. But Tonya's grandfather kidnapped her and took her back to the reservation in New Mexico. She says she grew up "in two worlds".

She shows me pictures of Jada Pinkett Smith and her daughter Willow at the sanctuary

"My grandfather had a wildlife refuge, like a rescue," she remembers. "And I hung out with the cougars and the wolves. One compound was a cougar and a wolf. They grew up together and they were best friends. And my grandfather taught me everything about the wolves, to make sure I protect them in the wild and captivity, and that's what I've been doing most of my life. It's my summons in life."

At the age of two, Tonya got a pet wolf that helped protect her: she was picked on for being a half-breed. Her bond with wildlife began there.

In her youth Tonya was beautiful. Before she set up the sanctuary in 1985, she worked as an actress and model, and performed on-camera with her wolves for years.

Hollywood has never been too far away. She shows me pictures of Jada Pinkett Smith and her daughter Willow at the sanctuary, and actors from Mr. Robot and Sons of Anarchy. Animated and live-action productions have either filmed her wolves directly, or taken photographs in order to use their likenesses.

Tonya runs the sanctuary with a coterie of 19 adopted children, 20 grandchildren and seven great-grandkids from two biological children. She says she hates people, but I am not convinced.

Her wolves spend time with combat veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder

Sure, she barks orders and all her kids jump to, but her true feelings are obvious as I interact with the wolves, which she calls her "brothers and sisters". She bends over backwards to be accommodating, and it does not feel like she is putting on airs. The more she reveals, the more it is clear how much she does like people, despite how often she has been burned by them.

We trade stories. I tell her about my trips to the Arctic, Africa and Nepal. Tonya stares at me and suddenly tells me my soul is native, "an old spirit of the native world." I smile bashfully: I grew up fascinated with native culture, memorising the dialogue to Dances with Wolves.

The next thing I know, she is giving me a cleansing sage ceremony as the wolves howl. I have been adopted. "You're just one of the special ones," she says. "We did the ceremony so you could feel your ways on your travels through life. And you walk with the wolf spirit and the animals now. Because you always have, but never knew. It’s not a coincidence we met."

Meeting the wolves has been an overwhelming experience for me, and I am not alone in that.

Tonya often takes wolves to schools so that children can learn what they are like. Her wolves also spend time with combat veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Counter-intuitively, spending time with wolves may help alleviate PTSD: Lindner's wolves also regularly interact with ex-military personnel.

These vagabond wolves are actually ambassadors, ready to win hearts and minds with a nuzzle and a few licks. They cannot breed or live in the wild, but they are still helping their species.

Some will lick your face and smell you, and it feels like some big, somewhat nervous dog

"Socialised grey wolves, ambassador wolves, have been very helpful for a long time to help people see wolves in a public light," says Mike Phillips, executive director of the Turner Endangered Species Fund.

Phillips has spent decades spearheading recovery programs for red wolves in North Carolina, Mexican wolves in the Southwest and, most famously, grey wolves in Yellowstone. Few have been as instrumental in restoring wolves.

Phillips calls breeding programs a necessary evil and despises the idea of captive wolves, but he acknowledges the value of sanctuaries as vehicles for education. The issue, he says, is that hardly anyone understands wolves.

"Wolves are not the great big marauding monsters some people would have you believe," Phillips says. "Ambassador wolves help demystify that idea. But it can push in either direction. Some will lick your face and smell you, and it feels like some big, somewhat nervous dog. That's not a fair portrayal of wolves either. If they're not the devil, they're also not your pet."

However, Tonya and her wolves may not serve as ambassadors for much longer.

Tonya is now 64. She has recently come through a battle with cancer; a cancer she says was in part healed by her animals. And Wolf Mountain is in crisis.

The problem is that this Californian valley is too hot for wolves. They are used to colder climates.

If animal services say it's a wolf, once it gets into a shelter, they have to destroy them

Some of the wolves are also old, and sick. One, Denali, recently had a tumour in his leg and the leg had to be amputated. Now he gets around on three legs and a wheel: Tonya's daughter says he might be the first tripod wolf.

Visitors do come, but not enough to cover the sanctuary's running costs.

The unspoken fear is that Tonya might have to give up her pack to the state. That would mean having them put down, as animals dumped at shelters and deemed to be wolves are routinely destroyed.

"If animal services say it's a wolf, once it gets into a shelter, they have to destroy them," says Lindner. She estimates that 1,000 are killed this way every year in California.

So Tonya is now trying to move the entire Sanctuary to a different state.

Her first idea was to head to Montana, but then she quickly turned her attention to Colorado and New Mexico. "I'm looking for foreclosures," she says. "One farmer and his wife, they're foreclosing and I'm trying to get the money ready so I can get it. They're alfalfa growers. It's enough land that they can do the alfalfa, feed the cattle, and we get the rest."

By September 2016, Tonya has zeroed in on this farm in Colorado. It has a stream, and a half acre on which her wolves can run. They would not be free, but the fences would be harder to see.

I don't like seeing wild animals in compounds

However, moving will be hugely difficult. Traveling is expensive and stressful for the animals, so they need help. "We have to have a vet on staff that rides with them in the airplane, and I have to ride," says Tonya. "I don't like to fly." She also needs a lot of paperwork to cross state lines with endangered cargo.

The price tag is massive. "It's gonna cost me about $10 million," she says matter-of-factly.

As of February 2017, a GoFundMe page with a goal of $300,000 is woefully short: by $295,000. Still, Tonya remains upbeat. She has over 600,000 likes on Facebook, a deep email list and some savings.

"If everyone gave 20 dollars," she calculates, before trailing off. "It's all about money. We'll do it."

At time of publication, it is still up in the air what will happen to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, and if and when Tonya and her family will move. Doing so will be painstaking and expensive. Still, she has survived being orphaned and abandoned, survived cancer. Maybe she can beat the odds one last time.

"I've been doing this all my life with wolves and the wildlife," she says by phone in early October 2016. "I'm gonna move, the wolves are gonna move. I've got to do this dream before I die. I've got to."

We'll doctor them up, and they'll go back to the wild where they came from, if they can

Then her mood lightens and and begins describing her new home. "They'll have a natural habitat with a stream going through their fence," Tonya says. "I don't like seeing wild animals in compounds. When I move, they'll have enough room to run."

Tonya even has plans to expand. "There will be 35 wolves going with me, two cougars and two bobcats," she says. "They'll be rescues from all over the world."

She also wants to set up a rehabilitation centre for injured wild animals. "We'll doctor them up, and they'll go back to the wild where they came from, if they can."

I still find it hard to see wolves cooped up in cages, but until and unless Tonya can pull off the move, it is either that or death. Besides, the wolves here are a bridge between humanity and the rest of nature. They help us get a clearer look at our brothers and sisters on four legs.

They are not the big bad wolf and, as Phillips said, they are also not a pet. They are something in between.

A handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Earth, Culture, Capital, Travel and Autos, delivered to your inbox every Friday.Eight out of 10 people around the world consider themselves religious. That figure shows that, while in many countries religion is not as dominant as it once was, it still has a huge influence on us.

What does that mean for the environmental movement? Does a belief in God or the supernatural make people more or less likely to take care of animals and the environment?

It is easy to make up stories to answer this question. You might say that many religions push the idea that the world will soon come to an end, in which case surely they encourage a "let it burn" ethos: what does it matter if the rainforest gets cut down, if the Rapture is next week? But just as plausibly, you might point out that many religions are big on kindness, and some such as Jainism even forbid killing animals. This should nudge their followers towards caring for the natural world.

But these are just stories. What does the science of human behaviour tell us?

Let's start with Christianity. Writing in the high-profile journal Science in 1967, historian Lynn White proposed that Christian religions undermine wildlife conservation by advocating a domination ethic over nature. Because the Bible talks about "dominion" over nature, White argued that Christianity teaches its followers that "it is God's will that man exploit nature for his proper ends".

Christian fundamentalists were less willing, and Catholics more willing, to financially support the environment

This was, to say the least, controversial. Other historians and theologians have argued that White was misreading the Bible, and that the text actually implies that we have a duty of care towards nature. Perhaps more to the point, White offered no evidence about the attitudes or behaviours of actual Christians.

In 2013, researchers tackled that question by asking whether there was a relationship between a country's main religion and the number of important biodiversity areas it contained. They found that Christian countries, particularly Catholic ones, tended to have more areas set aside for nature than other countries.

However, this does not mean White was completely wrong. Other studies suggest that conservative Christians really are less environmentally friendly than other denominations.

In a study published in 1993, priest and sociologist Andrew Greeley looked at how much Americans were willing to spend on conserving the environment. He found that Christian fundamentalists were less willing, and Catholics more willing, to financially support the environment. This suggests that it is not whether a person is Christian, but rather what type of Christian they are, that influences their behaviour towards nature.

It also seems that people's attitudes towards the environment can be affected by the way Christianity interacts with other religions.

In her PhD thesis, undertaken whilst at the University of Kent in Canterbury, UK, Emma Shepheard-Walwyn looked at how Kenyans felt about sacred sites. These are places of biological and spiritual significance, created and maintained by communities who adhered to a traditional faith.

A shift away from more traditional faiths could be bad for nature

Shepheard-Walwyn found that "some of the Christian people interviewed felt the forests should be destroyed as they are associated with the traditional faith, which they believe to be evil."

One Christian interviewed said that "tradition is now witchcraft". Others described the sacred sites as places associated with demons and superstition.

This suggests that conflicts between opposing faiths could influence how people feel about protected areas. In particular, a shift away from more traditional faiths could be bad for nature.

In a study published in 2006, Leela Hazzah of Lion Guardians showed that Maasai who had converted from a traditional faith to become evangelical Christians had a higher intent to kill lions than those that kept their traditional faith. "These converted Protestants did not have very positive attitudes towards national parks or wildlife either," says Hazzah.

Christianity can play a part in how, and indeed whether, we think about nature

Because the Maasai are not exposed to much television or other media, they look to their pastors for information about the world. If a pastor does not include positive stories about nature in their sermons, the churchgoers would not get any guidance on how to be environmentally friendly.

The evangelical churches also ran religious events, sometimes a week long, which pastoralists were invited to attend. That meant no one was around back at the homestead to protect the livestock from predators. Two pastoralists lost 35 cows during one such event. When Hazzah asked them why they left their livestock unattended for so long, one man replied: "There is no need to return home when I am in the house of God. He will protect my livestock from danger".

All this suggests that Christianity can play a part in how, and indeed whether, we think about nature. So how do other religions compare?

A study published in August 2016 analysed Indian people's attitudes towards large carnivores. It found that Buddhists tended to have more positive attitudes towards carnivorous animals than Muslims.

Given Buddhism's reputation for avoiding all harm to animals, this may not come as a surprise. However, the findings are not quite as straightforward as they first appear.

Religious practitioners and leaders... have a potentially important role in conserving nature

The more often a Buddhist undertook religious activities, the more likely it was that they had a more positive attitude towards wolves and snow leopards. In other words, the link between Buddhism and pro-environment attitudes was only apparent for the more deeply religious Buddhists.

As with the study of American Christians, the key issue is not whether or not a person is religious, but rather the form their religion takes: in this case, how devoted they are to it.

These findings mean that conservationists must frame their messages differently depending on the audience, says lead author Saloni Bhatia of the Nature Conservation Foundation in Mysore, India. "We must stress environmental stewardship with Muslim communities and religious leaders, while the idea of human-wildlife interdependence would resonate more strongly with the Buddhist communities and leaders."

In other words, conservationists need to integrate their ideas into religious thinking. "Religions, and certainly the versions of Islam and Buddhism that we have studied, seem to have well-developed philosophies towards nature and wildlife," says Bhatia. "Religious practitioners and leaders therefore have a potentially important role in conserving nature."

But instead, conservationists and religious leaders have largely grown apart.

Shepheard-Walwyn believes conservationists have mostly ignored religion because of "the false belief that science and religion don't mix, and that to be a good scientist you cannot engage with religion, because they feel religious people apply less rigorous science to their work."

She also thinks there are problems with the ways conservationists and religious individuals talk about nature. The two parties are not, so to speak, singing from the same hymn sheet.

The sheikhs spread the information to their community and, as devout Muslims, the fishermen listened

However, some groups are trying to bridge this divide.

The Alliance for Religions and Conservation (ARC) is a secular body that helps faith leaders to create environmental programs based on their faith's core beliefs and practices.

One of their most successful projects is based on an island off the coast of Tanzania. Fishermen there had been using dynamite as a quick and easy way to bring in the day's catch. But this method of fishing is very damaging, destroying coral and killing immature fish and turtles.

Local conservation organisations tried to educate the fishermen on the harms of dynamite fishing, but this fell on deaf ears. The government then banned the practice, but again the fishermen took no notice. Then ARC stepped in.

ARC members realised that all the fishermen were Muslim, and that the local sheikhs had a lot of influence in the community. So they showed the sheikhs passages in the Koran that promote pro-environmental behaviour, and told them that dynamite fishing goes against these teachings. The sheikhs spread the information to their community and, as devout Muslims, the fishermen listened.

In Tanzania they have created an Islamic eco-village for orphans

One local fisherman, interviewed in the Christian Science Monitor in 2007, said: "I've learned that the way I fished was destructive to the environment. This side of conservation isn't from the mzungu ["white man" in Swahili], it's from the Koran."

ARC was not the only organisation involved with the fishermen. Another key party was the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences (IFEES).

Its founder Fazlun Khalid started the organisation in the 1980s because of his passion for nature. After studying theology at university, Khalid concluded that Islam is intrinsically environmentalist.

But he also noticed that Muslims had lost their connection with nature, because like so many other people they had become preoccupied with wealth. So he set up IFEES to show Muslims the core teachings of the Koran that convey an environmentalist ethic.

In Indonesia, a country rich in biodiversity but under threat from development, IFEES is working with schools to restore the rainforests.

Similarly, in Tanzania they have created an Islamic eco-village for orphans, where they are establishing renewable energy plants and recycling projects. "This eco-village was built based on the practices of the prophet on how to manage natural resources," says Khalid.

Conservationists can learn a lot from religion about how to engage people and build support

Khalid believes that there is a new global religious movement building, which is keen to embrace nature. "Faith-based organisations played a key role in the recent climate change negotiations, and IFEES were cornerstones in the creation of the Islamic Declaration on Climate Change," he says.

There is some tentative evidence that this sort of approach can work.

A 2013 study in Indonesia showed that incorporating conservation messages into Islamic sermons increased both public awareness and levels of concern. "Since then, Indonesia [has] issued its first fatwas [rulings on Islamic law] prohibiting illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching," says lead author Jeanne McKay of the University of Kent.

Beyond that, ARC argues that conservationists can learn a lot from religion about how to engage people and build support. After all, religions are famously good at garnering lots of followers all devoted to a common cause.

ARC says that, first and foremost, religions are great at telling compelling stories that can inspire and inform. They also tend to celebrate what we already have, rather than focusing on what we have lost. Conservationists may want to heed their example.

Incorporating conservation messages into Islamic sermons increased both public awareness and levels of concern

When we read stories about the environment, we can be confronted with narratives of doom and gloom about how yet another species is closer to extinction or how we have destroyed even more wilderness. This is all factually correct, but research suggests that stories with a positive framing are better at motivating people to act than stories with a negative framing. In other words, feel-good stories can be very powerful.

"Using faith-based approaches can prove to be a positive way forward, and indeed has the potential to gain far-reaching benefits rather than staying confined to a conventionally science-based approach," says McKay.

It would be silly to downplay the environmental crisis we are facing. But in order to solve it, conservationists may need to harness the power of hope and optimism, just as the world's religions do.

The change of year is a good time to look back and also forward. In the BBC News Online product team in recent weeks we have been reflecting on a year in which we delivered a number of innovative product features to the audience while also planning an exciting event to kick off 2013: our first Connected Studio for News which begins on January 21.

Pages from BBC News Online

With the delivery of our brand new responsive design website, our coverage of events such as the Diamond Jubilee and the US Presidential elections, 2012 was a huge success in News for what we call our 'Four Screen strategy'.

In the UK alone we saw a 28% increase in weekly unique browsers to our websites and applications, the number of tablets accessing our product more than trebled following a massive increase during Christmas week and there has been a 50% increase via smartphones.

Considering that one-third of our users are now not using a desktop PC it is essential that we continue to deliver great experiences across all devices from phones to connected TVs - not only in 2013 but beyond.

This is where Connected Studio comes in.As the world becomes more connected, the number of people living outside their home country is on the rise – more than 244 million globally, estimates the United Nations, up more than 40% since 2000.

But as increasing numbers of people venture to new jobs and opportunities, what makes expats happy in their new hometown?

To find out, the global community network InterNations recently conducted their annual Expat Insider survey of more than 14,000 expats from 191 countries, asking residents to rate 43 different aspects of life abroad, from friendliness of locals and family life to affordability and work-life balance. The survey then graded countries according to how well they scored across all these indexes.

We talked to residents in the top-ranking countries to find out what exactly makes their adopted country so special.

Taiwan

A welcoming culture with warm people, along with the creature comforts of Western living, makes adjusting to life in Taiwan easy for most expats – especially since locals are always willing to help.

“I was surprised and humbled by the extent many Taiwanese locals were so openly welcoming, from showing patience when I jumbled up my Mandarin to going out of their way to help when I was in a bind,” said Monica Mizzi, originally from Australia, who runs the local events and culture blog Typing to Taipei. “Most expats congregate in Taipei, where more people speak English and transportation is easy,” she added.

Within the city itself, new expats tend to live in Tienmu. “It’s a sprawling ‘foreigner district’ with a more suburban feel, further removed from the MRT system,” explained Lizzie Gerock, originally from Oklahoma City, who now volunteers as an InterNations Consul in Taipei. Gerock, who’s been living in Taipei for several years, resides in the downtown district of Xinyi and “loves having access to shopping, restaurants, exhibitions, street performers, movies.”

While the city is affordable compared to other Asian capitals, living like a local goes a long way to keeping costs low.

“Buying anything foreign like appliances, food, clothes or shoes can be pricey,” said Karen Farley, an InterNations member originally from Canada. Prospective residents should also realise that having a Western-style large kitchen with oven is rare; most are small with a toaster oven or microwave.

That said, Taipei has “ridiculously delicious cuisine,” according to Mizzi, from the night market vendors to beef noodle chains to upscale Japanese restaurants, all of which can often be more affordable than eating at home.

Malta

Warm weather and proximity to Europe are the big draws for this Mediterranean nation. The climate leads to a slower pace of life, so prospective residents should get ready to relax instead of rush.

“Some shops have a ‘siesta’ early in the afternoon, and many people notice slow service at the restaurants,” said Silvia Di Felice, an InterNations Consul originally from Rome. “I remember sitting at a table around 8 pm once and leaving at midnight! We only had a starter and one main. Not all restaurants are like that, but be prepared; it's a relaxed approach to work.”

The towns of Saint Julian’s and Sliema, both located on the eastern coast, draw people who want to be near restaurants and nightlife. For those looking for more a more country, laidback lifestyle, Di Felice recommends the capital Valletta; Naxxar, 12km northwest of Valletta; and Birgu, 9km south of Valletta.

The country has plenty of big cultural events to offer, such as the International Arts Festival and the Valletta Film Festival, along with a plethora of festivals focused on local food – Festa Frawli (Strawberry Feast) being Di Felice’s top tip. The wine festivals in particular are too numerous to count. “I already have two favourite local wines here in Malta: a lovely white Cittadella and a red Caravaggio Merlot,” Di Felice said.

While Malta’s foreigner-friendly tax system is appealing to many expats (with no tax on capital gains earned from overseas and other preferential treatment), rent can be high. “Locals tend to charge foreign people a little bit more, so you need to spend some time doing your research in order to find the best deals,” Di Felice explained.

Ecuador

Friendly people, affordable healthcare and tasty, cheap food are just a few reasons as to why expats love living in Ecuador, according to the survey. Plus, the country’s diverse cities give expats a multitude of options.

“The beauty of Ecuador is the variety,” said Hagai Gat, an InterNations ambassador, originally from Israel who now lives in Guayaquil. “The people who come to retire in Ecuador often look for a lower cost of living, so the coastline, the southern part of Ecuador and Ambato [a city 150km south of Quito] will fit this type of expat. In the case of business-minded or outgoing expats, Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca are the cities to live in.” The bigger cities do come at a cost, Gat warned, with higher prices for rent and eating out.

Those with stronger language skills can venture further afield. “Here in Atuntaqui [100km north of Quito], a town of about 20,000, we are essentially the only expats and we like it that way,” said Bill Hagan, originally from Kansas City and a guide for travel start-up Your Local Cousin. “However Cotacachi is 15 minutes away in private vehicle, so if we want to interact with other expats or enjoy North American cuisine, we can.”

Mexico

Much like Malta, Mexico draws many expats initially for its warm weather, but welcoming locals and a culture rich in traditions and food keeps residents happy over the long haul.

“Mexico is an amazing country rich with thousands of years of history and culture, fantastic beaches, wonderful archaeological sites and colonial cities,” said Samira Hosseini, an InterNations ambassador originally from Iran, who now lives in the city of Monterrey, 150 miles west of the Texas border. “In particular, the diverse and colourful cuisine of Mexico is hard to resist.”

Expats here also rave about how locals go out of their way to make them feel included. Hosseini has a friend who moved to a similar sized European city at the same time, but she didn’t get invited out, leaving her feeling isolated in her new surroundings. “I was exhausted too, but it was because of having too many friends and being invited to too many parties that I couldn’t resist!” Housseini said. “I did not feel a single day of loneliness in Mexico.”

Many Western expats seek out beach towns like Tulum on the Gulf Coast or Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific Coast, but Mexico City, in the central part of the country, is truly the country’s mecca.

“Mexico City is as metropolitan as it gets,” said InterNations ambassador Biokrobo Samson Wokoma, originally from Nigeria. He recommends expats live in Mexico City’s central neighbourhoods of La Condesa, La Roma, Escandon and Napoles, which are affordable and have easy access to restaurants, bars and clubs. They area also close to the Metro-bus, Metro-train and Eco-bicycle systems for easy commuting to the rest of the city, and most residents have at least a working knowledge of English, making assimilation easier.

Plus, as an added perk, expats can usually find a little piece of home in Mexico City. “Expats can often find restaurants that serve their home delicacies and spots that mark foreign festivities like Oktoberfest,” Wokoma said.

While still much more affordable than other Western capitals, Mexico City is the one of the more expensive areas in Mexico. Still, Wokoma says it’s easy for families to live comfortably at around 16,000 pesos a month, even in the capital.

New Zealand

The country’s stunning natural beauty draws people from across the world, and with easy access to both cities and beaches, expats usually adopt the local relaxed lifestyle.

“I initially moved to New Zealand [with] my parents, but I have lived overseas since then and returned because I missed the laidback lifestyle and kind and friendly people and environment,” said Purva Bhatnagar, an InterNations Ambassador who grew up in Hong Kong and Singapore. She notes that a typical Kiwi works 8:30 am to 5 pm, never overtime, and enjoys meals and weekend activities, like house parties, road trips or “tramping” (Kiwi slang for hiking), with their family.

For the most metropolitan experience, Bhatnagar suggests Auckland, which she describes as “the New York of New Zealand”. Wellington is a little less populated, but as the capital has an abundance of government, education and technology jobs. Tourist hub Queenstown is popular with those who want to enjoy the natural surroundings to the fullest, or with people in the services industry.

The trade-off for the laidback lifestyle can be a relatively lower salary compared to the cost of goods (especially for housing in bigger cities like Auckland and for fresh produce). Still, travel, outdoor activities and healthcare remain inexpensive compared to the rest of the world.

It's been nearly a year since Microsoft's Satya Nadella proclaimed "bots are the new apps".

Yet despite the promise of a revolution in how we interact with services and companies online, progress has been utterly miserable - the vast majority of chatbots are gimmicky, pointless or just flat out broken.

But this week I was given great cause for optimism, in the form of Alec Jones, a 14-year-old from Victoria, Canada.

For the past six months, Alec been working on Christopher Bot, a chatbot that helps students keep track of homework they've been given over the course of a week.

To set things up, a student shares his or her schedule with Christopher Bot, and from then on it will send a quick message at the end of each lesson asking if any homework had been set.

"Do you have homework for maths?" it asked 30-year-old me pretending to be a child for the sake of this piece.

"Yes!" I replied.

"Your teacher needs to chill out on the homework," came the auto-response, adding, "what homework do you have?"

"Algebra :-("

"Ok, got it."

Image caption The chatbot takes answers in from messages and adds it to a homework schedule

Through this interface, I'm able easily insert "algebra" - urgh - into a weekly schedule that I can then refer back to at any point to see what I need to get done.

Once I complete a piece of homework, I tell Christopher Bot, and it congratulates me, automatically removing the homework from my list of things to do. The best bit? The bot keeps quiet during the holidays.

Chatbot promise

What makes me so impressed by this is that, of all the experiments I've seen so far, it is the first time a chatbot has genuinely been the best way to tackle a problem.

Other chatbots are a lesser experience of something else. The CNN news chatbot, for example, is worse at giving you the news than any of CNN’s other products.

And popular weather bot Poncho, while cute and well-branded, has a habit of telling me it's about to rain five minutes after water started falling on my head.

But Christopher Bot shows the potential for producing a service that is completely at home within chat - removing the need for students to access some extra tool to keep track of what needs doing, and interacting in a way that (slightly) lessens the unavoidable chore of homework.

"I wanted it to not just sound like a robot," Alec told me.

"I wanted it to sound kind of like my friends would. If you get homework, everyone always just shakes their heads and says 'that sucks'."

And it does this within an app his friends are already likely using (though perhaps Snapchat would be a more useful place for it, one day).

In short, it's a product those companies banking on chatbots being a winner should seek to emulate.

Allo allo

It's extremely difficult, for now, to measure the success of chatbots. Ad industry magazine AdAge noted that: "Bot analytics and bot-building software companies all have shortcomings, largely because this technology is in its infancy.

"Few benchmarks exist, especially when trying to compare data across platforms."

So without data, we can't say what's working just yet - though there are some clues to what isn't.

Google's AI-powered messaging app Allo, since being launched to much fanfare last year, has failed to make even a minor dent in a messaging app market dominated by Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger.

Image copyright Google Image caption Google's artificial-intelligence-enhanced chat app runs on Android and iOS

And that's because there's no compelling reason to bother with Allo. None of its features - like asking it for directions - provide enough of a benefit beyond what you'd get from just tapping in your request the "old fashioned" way. Users have an incredibly short fuse for chatbots not working exactly as we expect.

Most big companies are missing the point, Alec told me. "There are a lot of chatbots made by these big companies that are supposed to help you interact with their service more and give you more functionality," he said.

"But it feels like they just saw this new platform, bots, and thought 'oh that's cool, people are looking at these now, let's build a bot'.

"It feels like they've just made a compromised version of what they're actually trying to build."

Usefulness

Earlier this week, Alec's bot was shared on Product Hunt, a website I profiled recently, where it gained rave reviews and a fair share of feature requests.

"You're solving a problem many students have," read one reply.

Media caption Speaking in 2016, Mark Zuckerberg said bots offered advantages over using dozens of specialised apps

"Fellow 14 year old here," began another. "Great job man! That's sick that you’re my age and made such a cool and useful product. Awesome!"

Like any good developer, Alec has aspirations to build on the what he’s made - he wants to make it work for people in the working world, too.

But first he feels Facebook and others must do more to prove the usefuless of chatbots to people.

"I think that the real problem is that not enough people on Facebook who aren't 'techies' don't know what a bot is, and then they don't use it. More people need to know what a bot is," he said.

When Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage in front of his developers last year, he said he was opening up Messenger so that anybody could make great apps. I bet he didn’t think it would be a 14-year-old who would show him how it’s done.

But regardless of the sausage’s fame, it seems that Germans can’t get enough of the döner kebab.

The nation of 82 million people consumes two million kebabs a day, according to Gürsel Ülber, spokesman for the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in Europe (ATDiD). Safe to say, the thinly sliced meat – cooked on a vertical spit, wrapped in pita or flatbread and topped with salad – overrules the sausage-duo as a preferred fast-food option; a prominent symbol of the cultural and economic influence of Turkish immigration on German society.

Kadir Nurman and Mehmet Aygun are the two men credited for its invention in Berlin nearly 50 years ago. Both were part of the Gastarbeiter, a wave of guest workers brought in from Southern and Eastern Europe to boost West Germany’s post-war economy. And that they did, paving the way for a 200,000-strong workforce today.

Although there’s a lot of speculation as to the real story – with Aygun claiming he invented the snack a year before Nurman at his shop, Hasir, in 1971 – the ATDiD have formally given the honour to Nurman.

According to Ülber, Nurman sold Germany’s first döner kebab from his little stall across from Bahnhof Zoo in West Berlin back in 1972. What was traditionally grilled meat served with rice, salad and pita was transformed into a sandwich for hard-working and busy Germans to eat on the go, with both men claiming to have had the idea to put the meat inside the pita bread.

But irrespective of who first took the reins, both men set the foundation for what is today a €4bn trade in Germany, turning over a whopping 400 tonnes of meat a day and helping turn this much-loved street snack into a major staple of the German diet.

ATDiD reveals there are around 40,000 kebab shops across Germany, with Berlin leading the pack at 4,000, astonishingly more than Turkey’s most populous city, Istanbul, according to Visit Berlin. The German capital is closely followed by Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart.

There are around 40,000 kebab shops across Germany, with Berlin leading the pack at 4,000, astonishingly more than Turkey’s most populous city, Istanbul.

The street-food snack so beloved that in 2011 a clever bunch of German university students even created a solution to “kebab breath”: Papa Turk is a drink made from ginger, parsley, mint and lemon that is claimed to neutralise the garlicky aftertaste.

But why is it so popular?

“Because it tastes so good,” as Ülber simply put it. “In your hand, you hold all the good ingredients. You have good protein and salads.”

But it’s not just the taste, large portions or affordability – costing anywhere between €4.50 to €14. What seems to have struck a chord is the ease with which it can be adapted.

Nurman’s creation involved only beef. But over time and due to the availability of different meats, the döner took a new turn to include chicken, lamb and turkey as well as different breads and extra toppings. Every eatery adds its own touch.

“Variations like iskender kebab (thinly cut grilled lamb, tomato sauce, pita bread, melted sheep butter and yogurt), adana kebab (hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer) and koefte (a meatball including parsley and mint) have also become popular with customers,” said Evren Demircan, co-owner of World of Kebap in Stuttgart.

But it is the classic beef döner that has got Demircan’s customers hooked. He sells about 500 a week. On weekends that doubles.

To find out what all the fuss was about, I headed to Germany, where I quickly realized how wrong I was to consider it just a late-night snack for hungover party-goers.

As I walked through the Frankfurt’s thriving financial district, I was amazed to see just how many choices there were for eating it, from fancy restaurants to little cafes fitted with beautiful Turkish décor. As the lunch-time rush kicked in on a busy Friday afternoon, locals, business people and tourists alike flocked to their nearest kebab eatery, happily waiting in long lines for a satisfying feed.

While some opted for mixed grilled plates or koefte, I went straight for the serious stuff: a large beef döner at Nazar Kebap Haus (Schäfergasse 38). As I gripped the pita and took my first bite, the chilli sauce and yoghurt-garlic dressing oozed from the bottom. It was amazingly fresh and flavoursome, with the combination of juicy meat, sauces and crunchy salad definitely living up to the hype.

It seemed to me that the Turks have been hugely successful in managing to keep the dish’s legacy alive while also adapting it to the competitive and ever-evolving food world. And as the largest ethnic group of non-German origin in the country (Berlin boasts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey) their döner kebab has served as an important vehicle in not only servicing the economy and satisfying locals, but has helped forge a bond between the two cultures.

For many Turkish immigrants, the döner has come to represent opportunity. And even after nearly five decades, with different generations keeping the döner legacy alive, the pioneers are never forgotten.

“Of course, we thank Kadir and Mehmet. Not only did they invent the kebab but they laid the groundwork for the whole industry and in turn many people’s livelihood,” Demircan said. “Many industries have profited from the döner trade.”

Eating too much fat can make you put on weight and lead to heart disease - especially if you eat too much of the wrong kind of fat, such as the omega-6 fats found in many processed foods. But now it seems sausages, pastries and cakes are even worse for men than they are for women.

A recent study measured how the two sexes responded when they spent a week eating large amounts of these foods and how it affected their ability to control blood sugar levels. I wanted to test this diet myself, and in order to compare my response to that of a man I persuaded the person behind the research, Dr Matt Cocks of Liverpool John Moores University, to join me.

Before we started, our body fat was measured and our blood sugar levels recorded. We were given glucose monitors to wear to keep track of our blood sugar throughout the week.

Image caption The food which Zoe had to eat during the week

Zoe's typical day on the high fat diet

Breakfast: Three eggs, 30g cheddar cheese, 60g chorizo, 10g butter

Lunch: 10g butter, cheese and onion roll, pork pie, two cheese strings

Dinner: 150g pork belly, 30g cheddar cheese, 60g coleslaw, three hash browns

Snacks: Can of cola, 30g nuts

In order to have an impact in just one week, our diet contained about 50% more calories than we would normally eat. A typical evening meal included a couple of sausages, some hash browns, a few slices of bacon, and a lump of cheese.

Twice during the week, Matt and I also drank a sugary drink to introduce sugar into our blood stream. This mimics what happens when we eat carbohydrates which our bodies break down into sugars. The glucose monitors would be able to show us whether the diet was affecting our ability to clear this sugar from our blood.

When we looked at the results we saw that, like the women in Matt's study, my ability to control my blood sugar levels didn't get any worse on the diet. Matt, however, got 50% worse at clearing glucose from his blood.

The same trend was apparent in Matt's research, where on average men got 14% worse at controlling their sugar levels.

"One of the first steps towards type 2 diabetes is poorer control of glucose," says Matt. "So what we're seeing here, is that I've really lowered my control of sugar, and if I continued with that for a long time, that would probably progress me to type 2 diabetes."

The diet Matt and I undertook was extreme but in the real world the same processes will be happening to a lesser extent in people who regularly over consume unhealthy fats.

So what can men do about it?

The best advice is to eat a balanced diet but exercise can also help.

"If you have a meal and then you exercise, then you're going to start to burn that meal," says Matt. "So say you eat a very high fat meal or a sugary meal, you can start to remove the negative effects by going for a walk afterwards."

A sports editor in Belarus has kept a promise to eat his own newspaper after incorrectly predicting the fortunes of a local ice hockey team.

Vyacheslav Fedorenkov, who writes for the major Belarusian sports paper Pressball, had said that Dinamo Minsk wouldn't make it to the play-offs in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), an international league dominated by Russian teams. But the team proved him wrong, leaving Mr Fedorenkov to eat his words.

He arrived at Minsk Arena's press centre with a copy of the paper, a bowl of soup to make it more palatable and a can of fizzy pop, the Naviny.by website reports. Unfortunately he was a bit short on soup, so only managed to eat half of the pages.

Mr Fedorenkov was in good spirits despite his unappetising meal, jokingly telling reporters: "I would do anything for my favourite team". But he added that he would think twice before making any similar commitments in the future. "I will be frank with you lads," he said. "Don't joke like this and don't make such promises, because they are pretty difficult to deliver."

The was no pressure on the journalist from Dinamo Minsk, but team coach Craig Woodcroft was still impressed with the effort, telling Naviny.by: "I will remember his deed every time I enter this room."

In the Paris suburbs, youth sits idle. Young men chat and smoke. Some deal drugs. Most days are spent like this.

But today the talk is still about the alleged sexual assault on one of their friends, 22-year-old Theo, a young black man, who was brutalised by police.

A truncheon, they say, rammed into his backside, leaving him hospitalised for two weeks.

Image caption Eleanor says she was in disbelief when she heard the details of what had happened to her brother

I meet his sister Eleanor, behind the graffiti-covered building where the assault is said to have taken place.

"They pulled him around the side to make sure the cameras couldn't see it," she says.

"Everyone here knows where the CCTV cameras are, and he tried to get to a place where they could see him. But the police - there were four of them - they pulled him back.

"I was afraid. I was afraid to see how he is and what they had done."

Eleanor says she was in disbelief when she heard the details of what had happened. Her elder brother told her it was rape.

"'Rape?' I said. 'What are you talking about?'

"I started to cry because I was so shocked. But after that I knew I had to be strong."

'The state is enemy'

Attacks by police, residents here say, are pretty common.

But this provoked real anger. Protests erupted across the French capital - cars were burned and property destroyed.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Theo (left) was last week visited in hospital by French President Francois Hollande

Mejdi is 27 and was born on the estate. He rides up and down on his BMX, but is keen to stop and talk.

"If there is no charge for rape," he warns, "people here will go mad."

"Nothing changes here. I was here in 2005 during the massive protests - they came back and tried to clean the place up. But you don't change anything with a coat of paint. Work, hope. We have none of that."

He - like many here - is bright and well informed. He knows what the problems are - but is despondent that no-one seems to want to solve them.

An air of boredom and hopelessness hangs over this place.

For the young men here, the state is the enemy.

Police cars drive up and down the roads, through column after column of social housing. Groups of young men shout "rapists" as they go by.

Image caption Franco says banlieue youths "have to fight" for justice

Local activist Franco, from the anti-negrophobia league, says the anger is justified.

"The expression of their anger is the consequence of this first violence against Theo. This violence is a system, and this keeps us in a place where we cannot progress.

"When there is no justice, we have to fight to have it."

Theo's ordeal is part of a bigger cycle of violence that keeps on spinning. Youth vs police; black vs white; haves vs have nots. And communities left behind.

Fabien is also from the anti-negrophobia group.

"What the police are trying to do right now is not protecting us," he says.

"They want us to just shut up. They don't want us to express in any shape or form. They are just here to shut us down.

"We have to come and ask for justice. We have to acknowledge that this injustice is particular to a certain type of people. Coloured, minority, black, Arab - whatever you want. We are the most exposed to the systemic racism of the French state."

Theo himself appealed for calm from his hospital bed. His sister is also keen to stress her commitment to peace.

"We speak because we trust in justice," she says. But she knows what's in store if that justice isn't seen to be done.

"If not, there will be more anger, for sure," Eleanor says.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The wounds of the atrocities are still raw in Bosnia

Bosnia will next week ask the UN's top court to review its ruling which cleared Serbia of genocide in the 1990s, Bosnia's Muslim leader has said.

Bakir Izetbegovic, a member of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, said the appeal would be launched before a 10-year deadline expired on 26 February.

Bosnian Serb officials warned the move would trigger a new political crisis.

In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for genocide.

The ICJ found only one act of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war - the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in the town of Srebrenica in 1995.

It was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.

The ICJ also ruled that Serbia had violated international law by failing to prevent the killings.

'Bad' move

On Friday, Mr Izetbegovic said the appeal would be submitted by Bosnia-Herzegovina's legal representative.

"Everyone needs the truth, even those who oppose it, a truth that will be written by international judges, experienced and impartial," he said.

But Bosnian Serb officials said such a move could not be made without consensus within the country's presidency, where a Bosnian Serb and a Bosnian Croat take the other two seats.

Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik also urged ethnic Serb politicians to challenge the legitimacy of any appeal.

In Serbia, Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic described Mr Izetbegovic's announcement as "bad" for relations between the two countries.

Politicians from Bosnia's two semi-independent entities - the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska - have often clashed, triggering political crises.

На Би-би-си решили перевести историческую речь Черчилля на русский язык и передать в эфир для радиослушателей в СССР.

Эта трансляция положила начало русскоязычному вещанию Британской вещательной корпорации (Би-би-си).

Самое начало

С тех пор в руководстве Внешней службы (как тогда называлась Всемирная служба Би-би-си) все активнее стали звучать споры о целесообразности регулярного вещания на русском языке.

Противники утверждали, что в СССР не интересуются новостями из Великобритании и что там мало у кого есть коротковолновые приемники. К тому же после трансляции перевода речи Черчилля советские дипломаты, аккредитованные в Лондоне, "мягко" дали понять, что Москва не видит смысла в передачах такого рода.

В итоге регулярное вещание Британской вещательной корпорации на русском языке началось лишь пять лет спустя, после знаменитой Фултонской речи Черчилля о "железном занавесе".

24 марта 1946 года в 19:45 по московскому времени Соня (Бетти) Хорсфолл провела первую программу, подготовленную Русской секцией Би-би-си.

В тот информационный бюллетень вошли сообщения о переговорах между Ираном и СССР о выводе советских войск, об объявленной Советским Союзом эвакуации из Маньчжурии, о предстоящей сессии Совета Безопасности ООН и о прибытии в Индию британской правительственной делегации для переговоров о самоуправлении.

Вторая половина передачи состояла из легкой музыки.

Вещание Би-би-си на русском языке всегда велось в соответствии с принципами, сформулированными создателем Би-би-си лордом Ритом: "информировать, просвещать, развлекать".

Image caption Анатолий Гольдберг был олицетворением "джентльменского" стиля Би-би-си

Поскольку Би-би-си не рассматривала себя в качестве альтернативы внутреннему вещанию в СССР, в программах на русском не делалось особого акцента на событиях в России. Основное внимание в передачах уделялось жизни в Великобритании.

В этом заключалось коренное отличие русскоязычного вещания Би-би-си от, например, американского радио "Освобождение" (позже - радио "Свобода"), которое изначально было заметно политизировано и уделяло основное внимание сообщениям о советской России.

Впрочем, без острых моментов не обошлось. Так, в 1949 году на волнах Би-би-си выступил бывший глава временного правительства России Александр Керенский. В своей речи он, по сути, призвал к восстанию, что сразу же вызвало протест Кремля.

Ранее, в январе 1948 года, британское правительство распорядилось о проведении политики антикоммунистической пропаганды, и тогдашний глава Восточноевропейской службы Би-би-си инициативу поддержал. Позднее вместе с сотрудниками британского внешнеполитического ведомства он выделил те слои советского общества, которые в принципе могли бы проявить нелояльность к существовавшему режиму: заключенные трудовых лагерей, стиляги и студенты, низкооплачиваемые рабочие, представители нацменьшинств и верующие - и предложил прямо или косвенно поощрять их настроения.

24 апреля 1949 года СССР впервые начал глушить передачи Би-би-си.

Би-би-си предприняла ответный шаг, договорившись с другими западными радиостанциями, прежде всего с "Голосом Америки", и начала передавать свои программы с таким расчетом, чтобы они выходили в одно и то же время, но на разных частотах. Эта тактика сработала. Эффективной работы глушилок удалось добиться только в Москве, Ленинграде и еще нескольких крупных городах.

Би-би-си оставалась самой умеренной и непредвзятой из всех западных радиостанций, вещавших на СССР.

Одной из наиболее заметных фигур на Русской службе того времени был Анатолий Гольдберг. Для многих слушателей его размеренный спокойный голос на протяжении почти 40 лет олицетворял дух Русской службы Би-би-си. В Москве Гольдберга в свое время заклеймили как шпиона и запретили ему приезжать в СССР.

С 1950-х годов глушение программ Би-би-си превратилось в своего рода барометр отношений между Москвой и Лондоном. Оно то прекращалось, то возобновлялось.

В годы хрущевской оттепели в эфир вышла еженедельная передача поп-музыки, ставшая предтечей очень популярной рок-программы, созданной позже Севой Новгородцевым. Ее вел Антоний (Энтони) Кэш, сопровождавший программы забавными частушками.

В это же время Би-би-си начала организовывать викторины. Сначала в качестве призов разыгрывались книги о Великобритании, а в 1965 году победителям особенно сложной викторины была предложена двухнедельная поездка в Великобританию. Пришли сотни писем. Но двум победителям из СССР выехать так и не дали.

После 1968 года в проведении викторин вообще не стало смысла.

Скрытность и неоперативность российских СМИ давала иностранным вещателям значительное преимущество. Так, в 1964 году Би-би-си задолго до советских журналистов сообщила об отстранении от власти Хрущева. К тому же слушатели Би-би-си смогли услышать анализ этого события и реакцию мира на смену кремлевского руководства.

Сквозь шум глушилок

Перелом произошел в конце 1960-х годов, когда в СССР активизировалась деятельность диссидентов. Русская секция Би-би-си стала уделять все больше внимания событиям, происходящим в Советском Союзе.

Image caption Важной частью эфира Русской службы были музыкальные передачи

В 1967 году был отмечен так называемый "мятеж интеллектуалов": в эфире Би-би-си прозвучали призывы Солженицына и Вознесенского к отмене цензуры; подробные отчеты о суде над Синявским и Даниэлем и протесты против плохого обращения с Даниэлем в лагерях; сообщения о бегстве Светланы Аллилуевой; трансляция отрывков из ее книги "20 писем к другу".

В 1970-е подобные передачи стали неотъемлемой частью вещания Би-би-си. Когда Солженицын приехал на Запад после его изгнания советскими властями, первое интервью он дал Русской службе Би-би-си. В 1982 году он своим голосом записал "Один день Ивана Денисовича". Трансляция повести была приурочена к 20-й годовщине ее публикации.

Одновременно еще актуальнее стала борьба с глушилками. Если до введения войск Варшавского договора в Чехословакию глушение то прекращалось, то возобновлялось, то после пражских событий 1968 года советские глушилки заработали с новой силой.

Наиболее активно глушение осуществлялось в городах. В сельской местности оно было менее эффективно. Поэтому в ходе подготовки программы передач на выходные редакторы особое внимание уделяли повторам лучших материалов за неделю. Расчет был прост: в выходные многие выбирались за город, на дачи, где глушилки работали слабее.

Как правило, русскоязычные программы Би-би-си повторяли по три раза в неделю, чтобы люди в СССР могли их услышать хотя бы раз.

Глушение прекратилось лишь 21 января 1987 года и ознаменовало начало нового этапа в истории Русской службы Би-би-си.

Если раньше программы представляли собой в основном одноголосое радиочтение, пробивавшееся сквозь помехи, то теперь появилась возможность готовить полнозвучные передачи, сопровождаемые музыкой, внестудийными записями, эффектами.

Когда осенью 1987 года в эфир начала выходить музыкальная программа Севы Новгородцева "Севаоборот" и радиогазета "Аргумент", Русская служба зазвучала так, как обычно звучат передачи внутреннего вещания Би-би-си.

Перестройка

Примерно тогда же на Русской службе начали подумывать о более активном вовлечении аудитории в процесс подготовки и выпуска программ. И если раньше слушатели в редакцию только писали, то теперь в эфир стали давать их телефонные звонки.

В 1988 году на вопросы слушателей Русской службы Би-би-си в прямом эфире отвечала премьер-министр Маргарет Тэтчер. Тогда поступило более 800 звонков из СССР, 15 из них прошли в эфир.

В конце 1980-х было решено, что Русской службе Би-би-си нужен корпункт в Москве. В 1988 году удалось арендовать комнату в одном из госучреждений на Ильинке, неподалеку от Кремля. Оборудование корпункта было скромным: один магнитофон, одна телефонная линия, к которой был подключен телефон и факс. О прямом вещании из этого корпункта не могло быть и речи: все материалы перегонялись по телефону в Лондон на запись.

Уже позднее, после переезда в полноценный офис, Русская служба Би-би-си начала вести прямое вещание как из Лондона, так и из Москвы.

Московское бюро

Image caption На закате перестройки в СССР отправился красный дабл-деккер Русской службы Би-би-си

В советские и постсоветские годы в Москве на Садовой-Самотечной улице существовала также небольшая студия Би-би-си, которой пользовались коллеги с англоязычной службы, однако и она была не приспособлена для регулярных выходов в прямой эфир и студийной работы.

Подходящее помещение для Русской службы нашлось в начале 1990-х в гостинице "Рэдиссон-Славянская", где наконец были оборудованы две полноценные радиостудии.

Со временем качество сигнала и каналов связи выровнялось настолько, что появилась возможность осуществлять не только прямые включения, но и самостоятельное вещание из Москвы.

В 1995 году в прямом эфире Русской службы Би-би-си из московской студии впервые прозвучала 15-минутная информационная программа "К этому часу", объединившая в себе выпуск новостей, обзоры российской и британской прессы, а также материалы корреспондентов. Затем появился "Брифинг" - утренняя передача, которая стартовала как 45-минутка, а потом переросла в двухчасовую программу.

С 2000 года из Москвы начала выходить и дискуссионная программа "Радиус", которая первоначально в течение нескольких лет транслировалась из Лондона.

Обновление эфира

В течение почти трех десятилетий, начиная с 1970-х, основной информационной программой в сетке вещания Русской службы считалась радиохроника текущих событий "Глядя из Лондона", состоявшая, главным образом, из предзаписанных материалов, подготовленных лондонской редакцией. Однако с каждым годом становилось все более очевидным, что подобная концепция вещания все меньше соответствует запросам целевой аудитории.

С запуском трехчасовой программы "Утро на Би-би-си", которая в 2004 году впервые вышла в эфир из нового московского бюро на улице Бахрушина, началось кардинальное обновление вещания Би-би-си на русском языке.

Значительную часть программы составили материалы на близкую слушателям внутрироссийскую тематику, а также по основным международным темам дня, сопровождавшиеся комментариями экспертов, интервью и дискуссиями в прямом эфире.

Важнейшим элементом "Утра на Би-би-си" стал непосредственный контакт команды журналистов с аудиторией: слушатели получили возможность звонить в прямой эфир и высказывать собственное мнение по самым насущным темам дня.

В 2007 году на смену радиохронике "Глядя из Лондона" пришла двухчасовая информационно-аналитическая программа "Вечер на Би-би-си", в которой воплотилась идея одновременной работы в прямом эфире двух ведущих - из Лондона и из Москвы.

В марте 2009-го впервые вышла в эфир новая полуторачасовая программа Русской службы "Пятый этаж", в которой по субботам и воскресеньям ведущий вместе с гостями подводит итоги прошедшей недели, обсуждая самые разные темы, начиная от политики и культуры и заканчивая новостями спорта.

Тематические программы

Одним из важнейших элементов вещания Русской службы Би-би-си были тематические передачи, регулярно выходившие в эфир практически со времени основания службы вплоть до марта 2009 года.

Image caption В течение многих лет в эфире Русской службы выходило культурное обозрение Зиновия Зиника "Вест-Энд"

К ним относились и музыкальные программы, и сериал "Семья Львовых", рассказывавший о быте британцев, и литературные чтения произведений, которые не могли быть опубликованы в СССР, - Солженицына, Войновича, Зиновьева, Синявского и других.

Помимо регулярных радиожурналов - о жизни в Великобритании, о культуре, о книжных новинках, о религии, и конечно, о музыке, - на Русской службе создавались передачи о людях, событиях, исторических эпизодах, которые были известны советскому радиослушателю.

Тематические передачи представляли собой уникальный сплав русской просветительской традиции и разработанной на Би-би-си формы тщательно продуманного монтажа разных голосов и разных точек зрения.

Первоначально такие передачи переводились с английского, но с 1970-х годов все чаще и чаще их готовили сами сотрудники Русской службы.

Среди самых известных авторских тематических программ, выходивших много лет на волнах Русской службы Би-би-си, - "Бабушкин сундук" Сэма Джонса, "Вест-Энд" Зиновия Зиника, "Открытая музыка" Александра Кана и "Английский клуб" Натальи Рубинштейн и Лиз Барнс.

Авторская программа Севы Новгородцева "Севаоборот", дебют которой пришелся на 1987 год, в последний раз прозвучала в прямом эфире в 2005 году, а затем, до начала 2009-го, выходила в повторах.

В феврале 2003 года в расписании передач Русской службы появилась новая программа Севы Новгородцева "БибиСева", сменившая "Рок-посевы", просуществовавшие 26 лет. Однако, в отличие от "Посевов", акцент в "БибиСеве", выходящей с подзаголовком "Новости с человеческим лицом", делается не на музыке, а на самых важных и любопытных общественно-политических новостях дня.

Частоты и партнеры

В течение десятилетий Би-би-си вещала на русском языке главным образом в коротковолновом диапазоне.

После распада СССР появилась возможность организовать в России вещание на средних и ультракоротких волнах, значительно повысив таким образом качество звучания программ.

В начале 1990-х годов Русская служба Би-би-си арендовала средневолновые частоты 1260 Кгц в Москве и Петербурге и 666 Кгц в Екатеринбурге, передачи на которых последний раз вышли в эфир 26 марта 2011 года.

В 2006 и 2007 годах информационные программы Русской службы Би-би-си можно было слушать также в FM-диапазоне на волнах московских радиостанций "Открытое радио", "Большое радио", "Радио Арсенал" и "Серебряный дождь", а также в Санкт-Петербурге на волне "Радио Ленинград".

С начала 1990-х отдельные тематические программы Би-би-си на русском языке регулярно появлялись в эфире других российских радиостанций, в том числе на "Радио России" и "Маяке".

Многолетнее сотрудничество с российскими радиостанциями прекратилось в 2007 году по не зависящим от Би-би-си причинам.

Прощание с радиоэфиром

24 марта Русская служба Би-би-си отметила свое 65-летие, а через два дня после этого, 26 марта, ее передачи в последний раз вышли в эфир на коротких и средних волнах.

Прекращение традиционного радиовещания Би-би-си на русском языке было связано с серьезными сокращениями бюджета Всемирной службы Би-би-си. Эти сокращения привели к закрытию передач "Утро на Би-би-си" и "Вечер на Би-би-си".

Это был грустный момент в истории Русской службы Би-би-си, однако он ознаменовал начала нового этапа – перехода на интернет-вещание.

Три передачи – "БибиСева", "Вам слово" и "Пятый этаж" – сохранились в формате онлайн-радио.

Основной платформой Русской службой Би-би-си стал сайт bbcrussian.com.

Сайт

Интернет-домен Русской службы Би-би-си был зарегистрирован в январе 1998 года.

Первоначально сайт bbcrussian.com, на котором размещалось расписание передач с координатами лондонской редакции, делала группа энтузиастов из числа сотрудников службы.

В течение следующих двух лет на сайте появилась своя команда журналистов, готовившая и обновлявшая новостные материалы. С конца 1990-х годов началось радиовещание Русской службы Би-би-си в интернете.

В 2000 году руководство Всемирной службы Би-би-си решило разработать единый дизайн и ввести единую систему публикаций для сайтов всех языковых служб. С осени 2000 года сайт Русской службы Би-би-си стал обновляться круглосуточно семь дней в неделю.

Новый дизайн, новые возможности

Изначально интернет-страница Русской службы существовала в фиксированном формате шириной 600 пикселей, однако в мае 2003 года дизайн сайта претерпел серьезные изменения, и ширина страницы увеличилась до 800 пикселей.

С марта 2006 года на сайте начали появляться новостные видеосюжеты собственного производства, которые с весны 2009 года обновляются в круглосуточном режиме.

Кроме того, с 2007 года на сайте bbcrussian.com появился подкастинг. Сегодня на главной странице сайта размещены регулярно обновляемые подкасты программ "БибиСева", "Вам слово", "Пятый этаж", а также уроков английского языка.

С апреля 2009-го сайт Русской службы вновь полностью поменял свой облик, перейдя на фиксированную ширину 1024 пикселей.

Отличительной особенностью сайта Русской службы Би-би-си стали спецпроекты. Один из первых таких проектов увидел свет осенью 2000 года и был посвящен катастрофе подлодки "Курск". В последние годы Русская служба ежегодно публикует от 15 до 20 проектов в разделе "Аналитика".

В 2001 году на сайте появился и начал развиваться интерактивный отдел, предложивший российской интернет-аудитории регулярно обновляемые форумы с актуальными темами для обсуждения.

В начале 2007 года с запуском интерактивной программы "Вам слово" участники форумов Русской службы получили возможность высказывать свою точку зрения и в радиоэфире, при этом темы для обсуждения задают на сайте сами участники программы.

В мае 2008 года на сайте начала действовать Школа журналистики Би-би-си, в которой речь идет о каждодневной журналистской кухне, методам, используемым корреспондентами Би-би-си для сбора материала и подготовки репортажей, как для телевидения и радио, так и для интернета.

Материалы Школы касаются не только методики журналистской работы: например, в них рассказывается о том, как преодолевать последствия психологических травм, как эффективно слушать мнения коллег о ваших публикациях и т.д.

Новый дом

С апреля 2012 года Русская служба размещается в новом Доме вещания, который расположен на улице Портланд-плейс в самом центре Лондона.

Старое здание Буш-хауса, в котором прошли 65 лет истории службы, было возвращено его владельцам, а в новом доме собрались многочисленные отделы Всемирной службы, а также внутренних теле- и радиоканалов Би-би-си.

Новое здание, строительство которого обошлось корпорации в 700 млн фунтов, сразу стало заметным ориентиром центрального Лондона. Это крупнейший медийный центр в Европе, где работает 6 тысяч журналистов и менеджеров.

Его внутренняя архитектура предусматривает возможность быстрой трансформации рабочего пространства при появлении новых технических средств и редакционных потребностей.Celebrities test whether retirement in India is better than in the UK.

Washington is rife with political warfare, as 2016's presidential electoral combat spills over into Donald Trump's presidency and shows no signs of abating.

It's a battle of leaks and tweets, background innuendo and rhetorical broadsides.

In the middle of the maelstrom are federal law-enforcement and intelligence agencies and operatives that are supposedly above the partisan fray.

It hasn't worked out that way.

Menelisik plastik buatan Indonesia yang bisa diminum

Inikah plastik ramah lingkungan generasi baru? Tidak hanya bisa terurai di dalam tanah, plastik buatan Avani Eco ini diklaim aman dikonsumsi oleh mamalia laut.Away from its famed cerulean seas, Sardinia’s craggy interior is a twisting maze of deep chasms and impenetrable massifs that shelter some of Europe’s most ancient traditions.

Residents here still speak Sardo, the closest living form of Latin. Grandmothers gaze warily at outsiders from under embroidered veils. And, in a modest apartment in the town of Nuoro, a slight 62-year-old named Paola Abraini wakes up every day at 7 am to begin making su filindeu – the rarest pasta in the world.

In fact, there are only two other women on the planet who still know how to make it: Abraini’s niece and her sister-in-law, both of whom live in this far-flung town clinging to the slopes of Monte Ortobene.

No one can remember how or why the women in Nuoro started preparing su filindeu (whose name means “the threads of God”), but for more than 300 years, the recipe and technique have only been passed down through the women in Abraini’s family – each of whom have guarded it tightly before teaching it to their daughters.

But after an unexpected invitation to Abraini’s home, I found myself in her kitchen, watching her work.

I wasn’t her first guest, though. Last year, a team of engineers from Barilla pasta came to see if they could reproduce her technique with a machine. They couldn’t. After hearing rumours about a secret Sardinian pasta, Carlo Petrini, the president of Slow Food International, visited this spring. And this summer, British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver stopped by to ask Abraini if she could teach him how to make the dish. After failing for two hours, he threw his hands up and said, “I’ve been making pasta for 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like this.”

“Many people say that I have a secret I don’t want to reveal,” Abraini told me, smiling. “But the secret is right in front of you. It’s in my hands.”

Su filindeu is made by pulling and folding semolina dough into 256 perfectly even strands with the tips of your fingers, and then stretching the needle-thin wires diagonally across a circular frame in an intricate three-layer pattern. It’s so difficult and time-consuming to prepare that for the past 200 years, the sacred dish has only been served to the faithful who complete a 33km pilgrimage on foot or horseback from Nuoro to the village of Lula for the biannual Feast of San Francesco.

When I arrived, the October feast was three days away and Abraini had just finished making enough su filindeu to feed the 1,500 pilgrims expected to descend on Lula from throughout Sardinia. She worked five hours every day for a month to make 50kg of the pasta, and for the larger nine-day feast in May, she’ll prepare four times as much.

“There are only three ingredients: semolina wheat, water and salt,” Abraini said, vigorously kneading the dough back and forth. “But since everything is done by hand, the most important ingredient is elbow grease.”

Abraini patiently explained how you work the pasta thoroughly until it reaches a consistency reminiscent of modelling clay, then divide the dough into smaller sections and continue working it into a rolled-cylindrical shape.

Then comes the hardest part, a process she calls, “understanding the dough with your hands.” When she feels that it needs to be more elastic, she dips her fingers into a bowl of salt water. When it needs more moisture, she dips them into a separate bowl of regular water. “It can take years to understand,” she beamed. “It’s like a game with your hands. But once you achieve it, then the magic happens.”

When the semolina reached just the right consistency, Abraini picked up the cylindrical strand to stretch and fold the dough, doubling it as she pressed the heads of the su filindeu into her palms. She repeated this sequence in a fluid motion eight times. With each sweeping pull, the dough became thinner and thinner. After eight sequences, she was left with 256 even strands about half as wide as angel-hair pasta. She then carefully laid the strands on a circular base, one on top of another, to form a cross, trimming any excess from the ends with her fingers before repeating the process over and over.

When she’d formed three layers, she took the base outside to dry in the Sardinian sun. After several hours, the layers hardened into delicate sheets of white razor-thin threads resembling stitched lace. Abraini then broke the circular sheets into crude strips and packed them into boxes, ready for the San Francesco feast’s prior to place them in boiling sheep’s broth with grated pecorino and offer it as a thick soup to the pilgrims.

“No one’s really sure how this ancient tradition started, but it’s at the heart of the festival,” Stefano Flamini, this year’s prior, told me. “If there’s no su filindeu, there’s no Feast of San Francesco.”

But after more than 300 years in the same matrilineal family tree, these threads of God may need a miracle to survive for future generations. Only one of Abraini’s two daughters knows the basic technique, and lacks the passion and patience of her mother. Neither of Abraini’s daughters have daughters of their own. The two other women in Abraini’s family who still carry on the tradition are now both in their 50s and have yet to find willing successors among their own children.

“This is one of the most at-risk foods of becoming extinct, in large part because it’s one of the most difficult pastas to make that exists,” said Raffaella Ponzio, head coordinator of Slow Food International’s Ark of Taste, an initiative that aims to classify and preserve the world’s most endangered culinary traditions. Of the project’s 3,844 listed items, no other pasta is made by as few producers as su filindeu – making it both the world’s rarest and most endangered pasta.

“Conserving su filindeu isn’t just a question of a culinary art form, but also a piece of cultural identity,” Ponzio added.

Recognizing this, Abraini has done something previously unheard of with her family’s tightly guarded dish: she attempted to teach girls in Nuoro from other families how to make it.

“It didn’t go well,” Abraini admitted. First, she approached the local government to see if she could open up a small school, but they told her there was no money. Then, she agreed to invite students into her home.

“The problem was that once they saw how I actually do it, they’d say, ‘It’s just too much work’, and wouldn’t come back,” she said.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Yet, Abraini refuses to let the tradition fade away, making it her mission to share su filindeu with the world. In the last few years, Italy’s premier food and wine magazine, Gambero Rosso, has invited her to Rome twice so they can film her preparing the dish. Recently, she’s begun making su filindeu for three restaurants in the area – and in the process, offering non-pilgrims a chance to taste it for the first time.

At one of those restaurants, Al Ciusa, her black squid-ink dyed su filindeu nero won Sardinia’s Porcino d’Oro prize for best dish in 2010.

At another, Il Refugio, it’s the most popular item on the menu.

“We have people coming from all over Europe just to taste it,” owner Silverio Nanu told me as I sampled the dish.

Where to Try Su Filindeu If you’re in Sardinia between 1-9 May or 1-4 October, follow the long line of pilgrims to the San Francesco church outside Lula. Otherwise, try it at these three restaurants: If you can’t stay the night at Sebastiano Secchi’s Agriturismo Testone, at least pop in for dinner and taste the island’s best rendition of Abraini’s su filindeu pasta, served in mutton broth.

At the expertly run Il Rifugio in downtown Nuoro, owner Silverio plays host out front while his son Francesco whips up su filindeu in the kitchen.

Upscale Al Ciusa serves Nuoro’s only version of su filindeu nero, which Abraini invented by combining the pasta with squid ink.

When I shared that news with Abraini, her eyes danced with delight.

“You know, for me it’s a blessing just to be able to make su filindeu. I’ve been in love with it since the first time I ever saw it, and I love it more each day,” she said. “I hope to continue to make if for many years ahead – but if one day I have to stop, at least I’ll have a video.”

"The next time you plan to cross a border, leave your phone at home."

That is the rather startling advice in a blogpost that is being widely shared right now.

Its author, Quincy Larson, is a software engineer, who has previously written about the importance of protecting personal data. He now fears that data could be at risk every time you cross a border.

His concerns were sparked by the story of Sidd Bikkannavar, an American-born Nasa engineer, who flew home from a trip to Chile last month. On arrival in Houston, he was detained by the border police and, by his own account, put under great pressure to hand over the passcode to his smartphone, despite the fact that the device had been issued to him by Nasa.

Eventually, Bikkannavar did hand over both the phone and the passcode. It was taken away for 30 minutes and then returned, and he was free to go.

Larson sees this as a very dangerous precedent: "What we're seeing now is that anyone can be grabbed on their way through customs and forced to hand over the full contents of their digital life."

We also know that the new homeland security secretary, John Kelly, has talked of requiring visa applicants to hand over passwords to their social media accounts - though whether that could apply at the border too is not clear.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption How much private data is on your smartphone?

And on Thursday, a new Republican congressman took to Twitter to announce proudly that he had introduced his first bill - to require the review of visa applicants' social media.

Larson predicts that a policy where travellers are asked to download the contents of their phones will soon become commonplace, not just in the United States but around the world.

Hence his advice to leave your mobile phone and laptop at home and rent devices when you get to your destination.

Which seems a little extreme. I can't imagine being separated from my smartphone on a flight - and I'm sure many others feel the same. So I decided to seek some advice from the UK Foreign Office and the US embassy in London.

Was there a danger that I would be forced by border officials to unlock my phone or hand over my social media passwords?

The Foreign Office told me their travel advice did not cover this subject because they had not received any calls about it. But they did suggest that if I happened to be trapped in immigration at JFK airport with a border agent demanding my passcode, I could call the British embassy and arrange a lawyer.

As for the American embassy, well I called before lunchtime on Thursday and got a perfectly pleasant response. They would need to speak to Washington and would get back to me later about the matter of my smartphone and my Facebook and Twitter accounts.

As I write, it's Friday morning and I've heard nothing. Perhaps Washington has other matters on its mind. So perhaps I'd better take what I believe is known as a "burner" phone the next time I fly across the Atlantic.404 - Page not found

Beijing needs to do more to rein in North Korea: that's the view of US President Donald Trump and his new team. But how much leverage does China really have there and what are the chances of it being used, asks the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing.

China and North Korea seem to be heading into yet another tense period in their recently rocky relationship.

Once brothers-in-arms fighting against "imperialist aggression" during the Korean War, now Beijing accuses Pyongyang publicly of breaching United Nations sanctions in the pursuit of its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

And the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam - the half brother of North Korea's brutal leader - is being seen as a fresh point of tension between these official allies.

In fact, some view it as direct slap in the face for China.

It appears Mr Kim was murdered in Kuala Lumpur airport, on his way back to Macau, by female killers using of some type of poison.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Kim Jong-nam died at Kuala Lumpur airport as he prepared to board a flight

Kim Jong-nam spent much of the past decade in a type of self-imposed exile inside the former Portuguese colony. There he was seen to have the protection of China.

The eldest son of North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il, he said time and again that he had no interest in becoming involved in his country's politics.

What's more, whenever he was cornered by reporters in the Asian casino city, with his shirt unbuttoned to number three and sporting a three-day growth, you could really believe him when he said it. After all, why would he want to?

There has been speculation that he operated some sort of North Korean sanction-busting slush fund out of Macau and that this was the reason that Beijing and Pyongyang tolerated his hedonistic life style.

But for China there was something else too. He was an ally inside the North Korean elite: somebody who thought the best way forward for his homeland was a Chinese-style opening up.

Substitute leader?

For years, China has been trying to promote this style of thinking with its isolated, impoverished neighbour.

Before he died, Kim Jong-il was shown around the prosperous Chinese city of Dalian. The message: "You too could have some of this at home with a bit of opening up!"

But the Kim dynasty has appeared petrified by the prospect of such openness, and that Kim Jong-nam would side with the Chinese.

So despite his apparent lack of interest in political power, the fact that he could be seen hanging around down in Macau as a possible leader to be called on by Beijing in the event of regime collapse in Pyongyang made him a threat to the paranoid figure in power there today.

If this was a political assassination, then most North Korea observers think the order came right from the top.

This will not go down well with the government of Xi Jinping in Beijing. In recent days the two countries' relationship has become even more murky.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported that China turned back a $1m (£800,000) coal shipment from North Korea.

China has long been criticised for turning a blind eye to North Korean coal exports, in violation of UN sanctions, but maybe not this time.

In the wake of last weekend's North Korean ballistic missile test, 16,295 tonnes of its coal were denied entry to Wenzhou Port in Zhejiang Province.

You see the sequence of events: Sunday 12 February missile test, next morning an ally of China is murdered, later that afternoon Beijing criticises the test, two days later the coal shipment is turned back. What's next?

When asked about the death of Kim Jong-nam, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said his government had "seen the media reports" and that that they were "following the developments". I'll bet they are.

At a social function run by the Chinese military recently, I was speaking to a Chinese officer about the US demand that they do more to bring pressure on North Korea.

He shrugged his shoulders. He said they didn't know what the North Koreans would do next and that they had no idea what China could do to change their minds.

Yet by far and away the vast majority of trade in and out of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), as the country prefers to be called, is with China. If you take Chinese trade out of the equation there's not much left.

So why would Beijing put up with all this? Why put up with the waves of instability flowing out of Korean peninsula?

The answer is US troops.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption US and South Korean marines recently conducted a joint military exercise

It's often said that a meltdown in North Korea could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China but, even if this did happen, it would likely only be a temporary problem.

No. The real fear is that a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with American soldiers based in a country with a land border with China.

Beijing will not let that happen and Pyongyang's current ruler, Kim Jong-un, knows it.

So no matter how many times North Korea drives its powerful protector to distraction, in the end, Beijing believes it doesn't have much choice but to put up with its weirdness, with its basket-case economy, with its erratic behaviour and probably also with its pursuit of nuclear weapons.BBC World Service tersedia melalui berbagai outlet radio, TV dan online.

One of California's strongest storms in years - dubbed a "bombogenesis" or "weather bomb" - has hit the state, killing two, and bringing torrential rain and flash floods.

Hundreds of homes have been evacuated amid fears of mud slides near Los Angeles.

More than 250 flights have been disrupted at Los Angeles International Airport, and major roads have closed.

The weather has also brought car-swallowing sinkholes and power cuts.

The rainstorms spread from the south of the state, around Los Angeles, up to San Francisco.

One man was killed after a tree fell and pulled a power line on to his car in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles.

A second person died in a vehicle when it was submerged by a flash flood in the town of Victorville.

Another motorist at the same junction was saved after climbing on to the roof of his car.

Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for WeatherBell Analytics, told the Los Angeles Times that 10 trillion gallons of rain would fall on California in the next week, enough to power Niagara Falls for 154 days.

Media caption Capt Erik Scott, LA Fire Department: People trapped have needed "swift water rescues"

Two cars fell down a sinkhole in LA neighbourhood Studio City, with the drama of the second one, teetering on the edge and then tumbling down, shown on live television.

Firefighters saved one person from the first car, and the driver got out of the second before it fell. No-one was injured.

Erik Scott from the Los Angeles Fire Department said that the sinkhole rescue was "a very unique and dangerous situation".

He said the frightened driver in the fallen car was forced to stand on top of her vehicle, underground and amid rushing water, until a ladder could be passed down to her, 10ft (3 metres) below the street.

The Los Angeles Times also spoke of "surreal scenes" with cars trapped by rising waters along freeways 11 and 15.

Evacuation orders were issued in the city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles, and in parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County.

It is feared that areas that have been previously hit by forest fires could be more susceptible to mud slides as there is less vegetation to break the flow of running water.

In Duarte, about 20 miles (32 km) east of Los Angeles, city authorities said they had been door to door to issue mandatory evacuations.

Those who chose to stay were required to sign notifications.

One local, Alberto Moreno, told Reuters news agency that he was staying put. "The neighbours are here so we're all basically going to help out each other if it comes down to it," he said, while barricading his home with sandbags.

Image copyright AP Image caption Schoolchildren caught in heavy rain in Los Angeles

Meteorologists describe the "bombogenesis" as an intense extra-tropical cyclonic low-pressure area, or "a weather bomb".

"The storm looks to be the strongest storm to hit southwest California this season," the National Weather Service said.

"It is likely the strongest within the last six years and possibly even as far back as December 2004 or January 1995."

Media caption More rain coming for drenched California

After five years of drought, a series of storms have filled state reservoirs.

California's Sierra Nevada mountain range is also loaded with snow. Runoff from its snowpack normally supplies about a third of the state's water.

Gusts of 87mph (140km/h) have been reported on the Big Sur scenic coastal highway.

Earlier in the week, heavy rain and melting snow caused fears of flooding at the tallest dam in the country, Oroville Dam, in northern California. More than 180,000 residents were evacuated.

'Weather bomb' storm stuns CaliforniaImage copyright Getty Images

The Michael Flynn controversy went from zero to resignation in the blink of an eye.

On Friday night, Donald Trump was asked about his national security advisor's pre-inauguration contact with a Russian ambassador and said he'd "look into" it.

"I don't know about that," he said. "I haven't seen it."

On Monday, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway assured reporters that Mr Flynn had the president's "full confidence".

Hours later, Flynn was gone and Conway was left explaining how the situation had become "unsustainable".

Although this may be the end of Mr Flynn's tenure in the White House, it's just the beginning of the story. There are a number of questions that aren't going away just because Mr Flynn has.

Why did Donald Trump wait to sack Flynn?

According to the Washington Post, acting Attorney General Sally Yates had informed Trump White House counsel Donald McGahn shortly after inauguration day that surveillance of Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak revealed he and Mr Flynn had discussed US sanctions imposed by the Obama administration during their 30 December phone call.

This ran directly counter not only to Mr Flynn's public denials, but those of other Trump administration officials, including press secretary Sean Spicer and Vice-President Mike Pence.

So, if the Trump White House knew that Mr Flynn had lied - or, as he put it in his resignation letter, had "inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information" - why did it take weeks, and multiple embarrassing media reports, for the national security adviser to be shown the door?

During his press conference on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Mr Trump had been informed that Mr Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr Kislyak on 26 January and had instructed the White House counsel's office to investigate whether any laws had been violated. The conclusion was that that it was legal. Over the course of the ensuing weeks, however, Mr Trump's trust in Mr Flynn "eroded" to the point where he could no longer be effective as national security advisor. It was then that he was sacked.

Those were weeks during which Mr Flynn was putting Iran "on notice", conferring tableside at Mar-a-Lago as the president and Japanese Prime Minsiter Shinzo Abe dealt with a North Korean missile launch and sitting front and centre in the East Room of the White House during Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mr Trump's joint press conference on Monday.

Will there be an investigation?

Democrats in Congress smell blood in the water and are already calling for a sweeping investigation into the circumstances behind Mr Flynn's resignation.

"The American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press release.

Although Democrats would prefer a new congressional special committee be created to investigate the matter, that seems unlikely at this point. There are already planned investigations into the larger question of whether Russia interfered with the 2016 US presidential election, to be conducted by the House and Senate intelligence committees.

"I think we should look into it exhaustively," said Senate intelligence committee member Roy Blunt of Missouri, "so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned and shouldn't reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions."

The House investigation will look into Russian intelligence activities and "links between Russian and individuals associated with political campaigns", according to a letter signed by the Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the committee.

John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two senators on the armed services committee, are also launching their own inquiry.

"General Flynn's resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the US and Russia," Mr McCain said in a press release.

Other Republicans in Congress seem less interested in the matter. Jason Chaffetz, the chair of the House Oversight Committee who made recent headlines with his pledge to continue investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton's email server, has so far declined from launching an inquiry into Mr Flynn's resignation.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Flynn controversy may sharpen the focus on Donald Trump's past pro-Russia statements

"It's taking care of itself," he said.

Of perhaps greater concern for the White House is the status of a reported FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties to the Russian government. According to the Post, FBI Director James Comey was reluctant to inform the Trump White House about evidence contradicting Mr Flynn's accounts because "it could complicate the bureau's ongoing investigation".

Although the BBC has reported that there is a multi-agency probe into Russia and the 2016 election, there's never been an on-the-record confirmation of this by government officials.

Could the inquiry include a look at whether Mr Flynn violated the Logan Act, a 1799 federal law that prohibits "unauthorised citizens" from negotiating with foreign governments? Given that the law has never been used in an actual prosecution, that seems unlikely.

The more the FBI asks questions, however, the greater the temptation for Trump administration officials to mislead or misstate in order to avoid further political fallout from the matter.

That could open the door for obstruction of justice charges. It wouldn't be the first time a cover-up of a political scandal turned into a criminal case. Or the second. Or the third.

Could this have been avoided?

As this story unfolds, Mr Flynn and the rest of the Trump team may want to look back and see whether this whole mess was preventable.

Forget, for now, the puzzler that Mr Flynn, who once served as director of the Defence Intelligence Agency, was seemingly unaware or unconcerned that phone conversations by the Russian ambassador to the US might be under government surveillance. Could he have just come out and admitted that he did, in fact, talk with Mr Kislyak about sanctions as part of a wide-ranging discussion of US policy priorities under soon-to-be-President Trump?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vice-President Mike Pence (left) had publicly insisted Michael Flynn did not discuss sanctions with the Russians

Perhaps. There certainly would have been political fallout. Democrats would have cried bloody murder, given their sensitivity to the outcome of the Clinton-Trump campaign. They would have accused Mr Flynn of undermining Mr Obama's efforts to punish Russia for its alleged meddling and, in all likelihood, questioned whether the move constituted a violation of the Logan Act.

In addition, there would have been further calls for a full investigation into Mr Trump's relations with Russia's Vladimir Putin and allegations of pre-election communications between the Republican's senior campaign officials and the Russian government.

What seemingly undid Mr Flynn, however, was that Mr Pence and other Republicans had framed their defence of the general based on his insistence that sanctions definitely were not discussed. Mr Flynn embarrassed the vice-president, who wields enormous influence in the administration.

A united White House may have been able to ride out this storm. As soon as it fractured, Mr Flynn was finished.

Who will be the next national security adviser?

Mr Flynn was one of the Mr Trump's most trusted advisers on national security, since the early days of the presidential campaign, and he will be difficult to replace.

The president has alienated much of the conservative foreign policy establishment and appears unwilling, at least so far, to consider enlisting the aid of experienced hands who actively worked against him during the campaign.

Following Mr Flynn's resignation, the White House announced that Keith Kellogg, who was serving as chief of staff of the National Security Council, would take over as acting national security advisor.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Keith Kellogg is taking over for Michael Flynn on a temporary basis.

Since retiring as a general from the Army in 2003, Mr Kellogg had worked for a variety of defence contractors and advised Mr Trump on foreign policy matters during the presidential campaign.

Although Mr Kellogg will have the advantage of incumbency while the formal search is conducted, another high-profile name has already been floated for the job - former CIA Director David Petraeus.

Once considered a rising star in the Republican Party after his success organising the 2007 US military troop "surge" in Iraq, he was forced to resign from the CIA in disgrace and charged with sharing top secret documents with a civilian reporter with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. He eventually pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information

That, it seems, has not been a career-killing event, however - even though Mr Petraeus would have to get approval from his parole officer before taking a job in Washington.

Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of US Central Command, is reportedly also under consideration.

Whomever Mr Trump selects for national security adviser will be thrust into a key role in the administration's foreign policy team under less than ideal circumstances. The job requires the ability to co-ordinate multiple intelligence and security agencies with competing interests and priorities. The NSA has to be a diplomat and a facilitator, making sure the president is kept abreast of all relevant national security developments and his policy directives are effectively implemented.

It's not a job for the faint of heart even in the best of times.

How does Sally Yates feel right now?

In late January Ms Yates, an Obama administration holdover who was serving as acting attorney general, advised the Trump administration of problems surrounding Mr Flynn's role as national security adviser.

On 30 January Ms Yates announced that she would not enforce Mr Trump's executive order barring entry to the US for individuals from seven predominantly Muslim nations, warning that she considered the action of questionable legality.

She was fired by Mr Trump later that day.

Now the president's immigration order has been indefinitely suspended by multiple courts, which have said it may violate constitutional rights. And Mr Flynn is gone.

We already know the answer to this particular question, actually. Ms Yates probably feels pretty vindicated.For many expats, finding new friends can ease the often overwhelming task of adjusting to a new life abroad. But with huge variances in local culture and language capabilities, some places can definitely feel more welcoming than others.

To determine where expats might find the best success of fitting in fast, global community network InterNations recently conducted their annual Expat Insider survey of more than 14,000 expats from 191 countries, asking residents to rate a number of aspects about life abroad, including how easy it was to settle in, a country’s friendliness and ease of making friends.

We talked to residents in the countries ranked high for friendliness to find out what makes these places so hospitable to newcomers.

Uganda

This East African country received the highest marks for friendliness. According to the InterNations report, 57% of expats in Uganda gave ‘general friendliness’ the best possible rating (the global average was 26%). Not only that, not a single respondent ranked this factor negatively.

Charlotte Beauvoisin, a British expat who writes about living in the capital Kampala at Diary of a Muzungu, said that welcoming all nationalities is an intrinsic part of the culture, and residents are quick to offer smiles to newcomers.

InterNations Ambassador Nadya Mileva, originally from Bulgaria and now living in Kampala, agrees, saying that the people are ‘amazingly friendly’.

“The country has a lot to offer, from breathtaking landscapes to high-end restaurants and bars to year-round summer,” she added.

Uganda isn’t without its problems, however, including the occasional power outage, pollution from old cars and infrastructure growing pains that can make traffic come to a complete standstill. But “the overwhelming majority of visitors to Uganda love the place. Many of us extend our contracts; many of us decide to settle here,” Beauvoisin said.

The majority of expats live in Kampala, where English is common and international restaurants abound.

“It has a high-energy core with a relaxed periphery well suited for families and others who prefer to stay at home,” Mileva said. While the southern half of the city is culturally diverse and less expensive, with easy access to Lake Victoria and the airport, the northern half is home to more affluent neighbourhoods. But expats live everywhere.

“There are not neighbourhoods predominated by mazungus [foreigners] and others only for Ugandans,” Mileva explained.

The country is also very affordable for food and labour – meaning that expats are usually able to maintain a high standard of living.

Costa Rica

The Central American country ranks high across all factors when it comes to how easily expats fit in. Almost nine out of 10 expats (89%) are pleased with the general friendliness of the population, and eight out of 10 (79%) feel at home, according to the survey.

Foreign- or native-born, the community is connected by the ‘pura vida’ sensibility, said Diana Stobo, owner of The Retreat Costa Rica. “The idea of living a ‘pure life’ is the promise here, and those who are tired of the hustle and bustle want to live that way.”

She believes the socialist government plays a part in maintaining this equality and openness. “People all live within the same means; it is difficult to get ahead financially, and therefore most find peace and harmony in what they have. No sweat, no worries, no problems, just ‘pura vida’.”

While English is widely spoken, learning Spanish will get you far with the locals, said David Black, an InterNations Ambassador who lives in Santa Ana, 15km west of the capital San Jose, and is originally from the UK.

“If you make an effort to understand and embrace the Costa Rican culture, you are very much welcomed with open arms and considered a friend.”

While expat retirees flock to beach locations like Guancaste in the northwest and Jacro and Manuel Antonio, both in the central west, many professional expats live in the Central Valley near San Jose.

“Santa Ana and Escazu [8km west of San Jose] are very popular with North Americans and Europeans in particular,” Jones said.

The cost of living in Costa Rica has increased in the past 10 years, with Jones noting that a cup of coffee and a cake can cost just as much as in central London in some places. “However, like most other places, if you know where to look and wish to survive on a modest budget, there are still plenty of local places where you can eat and shop at a reasonable cost,” he said.

Colombia

This South American hotspot feels like home fast, according to many expats.

“The Colombian people are eager to show their country in a positive light and are very receptive and hospitable towards newcomers,” said Anne Marie Zwerg-Villegas, an InterNations Medellín Ambassador living in Chia (a suburb north of Bogotá) and originally from the US.

“Colombia is one of the countries in the world with the lowest percentage of foreign-born residents, so we are a novelty. Locals tend to think of us as tourists and treat us as tourists.”

William Duran, who lives in Medellín, Colombia’s second largest city, where he hosts a digital nomad bootcamp, says this gives expats a unique opportunity to feel immediately welcomed, without the shine wearing off. “Out of the 40-plus countries I have been to, there is no other place where I've seen foreigners feel such a great balance of familiarity and novelty,” he said. “Colombians are very helpful and cheerful. The country is warm in every sense of the word.”

Most expats live in Bogotá, the metropolitan capital with nearly 8 million residents. Since traffic in the city is ‘horrendous’, according to Zwerg-Villegas, it pays to live close to your office. Most professional expats live in the northeast quadrant of the city, in neighbourhoods such as Chicó, Rosales, Usaquén and Cedritos.

“These neighbourhoods have modern commercial centres with international brands, restaurants with a variety of ethnic cuisine, and social and athletic clubs. Exclusive nightlife spots like Parque 93, Zona T and Zona G are also in these neighbourhoods,” Zwerg-Villegas said.

Younger and more adventurous expats might consider parts of the city further south like Teusaquillo or Soledad, where craft beer bars and inexpensive nightclubs are everywhere.

Since Colombia is an agricultural economy, fresh fruit and vegetables are available year round at affordable prices, and services are cheap too.

“Most expats will easily afford a maid, a driver and a nanny,” Zwerg-Villegas said. That said, expat incomes usually qualify as upper-middle class, which means a surcharge on utilities is levied to support the lower income earners.

Oman

As one of the sunniest countries in the world, Oman also has friendly residents who reflect the warm climate. A welcoming culture rooted in faith also leads to an openness with newcomers.

“Traditionally speaking, Omanis are very hospitable to strangers. With their strong Islamic background and belief, they love to help their neighbours or those in need, and will easily bring a stranger or new person into their home for coffee or dates or fruit,” said Nicole Brewer, who lives in Nizwa (160 km south of the capital of Muscat) and blogs about her experience at I Love to Globetrot.

The country is known for outdoor living and adventures, with great weather, camping and adventure spots.

“Don’t consider moving to Oman for the city life,” warned Rebecca Mayston, an InterNations Ambassador originally from New Zealand who lives in Muscat. “Move here with an open mind for outdoor experiences. For me, the life is endless adventures, amazing weather and landscapes, diverse nationalities and friendships.”

Muscat has more bars and restaurants than any other city in Oman, and Mayston says many of her expat friends enjoy clubbing here on the weekends. Nizwa has more of a small-town feel, even though it used to be the capital of the country, but has plenty of history, including the Nizwa Fort and its famous souq, a shopping district filled with gems and pottery.

While the cost of living in Oman is growing more expensive, it was recently ranked by Mercer as one of the more affordable places to live in the Middle East.

“For me, I can live a better life here than I do back home, and still get ahead with financial benefits,” Mayston said.

The Philippines

This island nation has become an outsourcing capital with many multinational companies opening offices here and attracting expats from across the world. Currently, residents of 159 countries do not need even need a visa to enter the Philippines.

English is a primary language and residents are eager to welcome newcomers.

“Locals are very outgoing and helpful, which makes foreigners feels accommodated,” said Eleanor Webley, a Manila native and InterNations Ambassador.

There’s also a strong culture of going out – to festivals and parties, or even just getting outdoors – which means newcomers can easily find opportunities to meet new friends.

“The people here are very friendly and are always smiling,” said Wendell Yuson, an InterNations Ambassador who was born and raised in Manila, adding that the slogan of the Philippine Department of Tourism also reflects this vibe: ‘It’s more fun in the Philippines!’”

While most expats work in Manila, many choose to make their home near the country’s beautiful beaches. Tagatay, 74km south of Manila, is a popular island for expats who want to be out of the fray, but still within reach via public transportation (buses connect the cities).

“The Philippines has 7,100 islands, and expats love the tropical lifestyle here,” Yuson said. Those who prefer city living usually stay in the Central Business Districts (including Makati, the primary and largest CBD; the newest district Bonifacio Global City; and centrally located Ortigas Center in Manila) or live in Cebu, the second city of the country located in the central islands.

The cost of living here is generally not high, and budget-minded expats can easily make ends meet, with costs in Manila about 60% less expensive than London in housing, transportation and food, according to Expatistan.com. Still, living in high-end districts or using serviced apartments, where residents enjoy hotel-level amenities and services, can push costs up substantially.

Compared to only a few years ago the category is no longer a byword among Oscar voters for obscurity.Image copyright PA Image caption Crowds gathered outside Huddersfield Parish Church for the service

The funeral of actor Gorden Kaye, who was best known for his role in the hit BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!, has taken place in his home town of Huddersfield.

Kaye played cafe owner Rene Artois on the show, which centred on the fictional exploits of WW2 resistance fighters in German-occupied France.

Mourners filled Huddersfield Parish Church for the lunchtime service.

'Allo 'Allo! co-stars Vicki Michelle and Sue Hodge were among those who attended.

Latest updates from the service and other stories in West Yorkshire

The service, led by the Reverend Canon Simon Moor, started with Yorkshire folk song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'At.

While telling the congregation about Kaye's childhood and early career, Canon Moor said: "He accepted himself he was never really a scholar.

"Ironically, his only real success at secondary school was in French."

In a eulogy, friend and producer Charles Garland, who worked on 'Allo 'Allo!, said the part of Rene was "written for him and, to be honest it was perfect casting".

The actor appeared in all 84 episodes of 'Allo 'Allo, which ran from 1982 until 1992, and reprised the role in a 2007 special, as well as appearing in a stage version of the series.

Kaye, who had dementia, died last month aged 75 at a care home in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire.

Image caption Kaye appeared in every episode of the hit BBC sitcom

Michelle, who played waitress Yvette Carte-Blanche, said he was part of her life "like family" for at least 20 years.

She said: "He was lovely. Sometimes he was really naughty and he played pranks, and other times he'd be quite serious, and sometimes I think he was quite lonely - there were many different sides to him."

Kim Hartman, who played Private Helga Geerhart, said: "We worked together for 10 years, we travelled the world together with the 'Allo 'Allo! stage show.

"They were exciting times and I associate those with Gorden."

Born in Huddersfield, Kaye revealed in his autobiography the unusual spelling of his first name was due to a spelling error by the acting union Equity, which he decided to adopt.

The actor got his first big TV break in ITV soap Coronation Street, playing Elsie Tanner's nephew Bernard Butler.

He went on to appear in a number of roles in sitcoms including Till Death Us Do Part, It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Are You Being Served? before landing the role of Rene.

Former Coronation Street actor Ken Morley, who played General Leopold von Flockenstuffen in 'Allo 'Allo!, said: "I am going to miss him.

"Between Gorden and myself it was like the War of the Roses because he was from Yorkshire and I was from Lancashire."

He added: "We had a laugh together, he was a very funny guy."

In 1990, Kaye was seriously injured when a piece of wood smashed through the windscreen of his car during a storm.

He was left with a scar on his forehead and no memory of the details of the accident, but he recovered and was able to resume his career.

Castmate Sue Hodge, who played waitress Mimi Labonq, said: "I haven't actually got to grips with the fact he's not here.

"I'm never ever going to forget him. He'll be with me forever."Image copyright F. Glaw Image caption Geckolepis megalepis can shed its scales with ease when attacked

A newly discovered species of gecko has tearaway skin that leaves predators with nothing but a mouthful of scales when attacked.

Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease.

The new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko.

The reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ.

The skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.

In addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.

Image copyright F. Glaw Image caption When grasped by a predator, fish-scale geckos lose not just their scales but also the skin underneath

Although several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.

They can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.

But Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.

"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar," said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

The new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.The future, present and past may not be as different as we think, says science writer and astrophysicist Adam Becker.

Thousands of people are gathering in The Gambia for the inauguration of the country's new president, Adama Barrow, after a lengthy power struggle forced him into exile.

Various African heads of state are expected at the ceremony.

Mr Barrow is only the third president in the history of The Gambia.

He was sworn in last month in a low-key event in neighbouring Senegal before his predecessor agreed to step down.

Saturday's much larger scale ceremony is taking place in a stadium near the Gambian capital, Banjul.

The celebrations also mark 52 years of the west African country's independence.

Long-time leader Yahya Jammeh was voted out in December but he only agreed to step aside when regional powers sent in troops ready to remove him by force.

He has since fled to Equatorial Guinea.

From the section MagazineWhether you’re feeling serious or a little bit silly right now, this week’s pop culture essentials have you covered. In fact, we’ve included everything from a self-help manual to a Snapchat.

1. WHAT TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH WITH A DONUT (BECAUSE IT’LL MAKE YOU WANT ONE)

CBS has high hopes for this new sitcom based on a Tracy Letts stage play. It premieres Thursday (February 2) night, right after ratings juggernaut The Big Bang Theory. Judd Hirsch stars as an old-fashioned Chicago donut store owner who’s dragged into the 21st century by an enthusiastic new employee played by rising star Jemaine Fowler. Superior Donuts won’t be 2017’s hippest new comedy, but an experienced supporting cast led by Katey Sagal should help sell it.

2. WHAT TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH WITH A VEGETARIAN SNACK

Launching Friday (February 3), Netflix’s latest original series is more enticing than its somewhat dry title suggests. Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant play California realtors whose lives are turned upside down when she undergoes an unexpected transformation, namely, turning into a flesh-eating zombie. The trailer makes clear that Santa Clarita Diet is aiming for comedy-horror, a tricky tonal balance that even Ryan Murphy‘s Scream Queens sometimes struggles with. But if anyone can make a cannibal into a relatable character, it’s got to be Drew Barrymore.

3. WHAT TO LISTEN TO NEXT TIME YOU’RE ON A BORING JOURNEY

This all-female trio from L.A. makes sparkling guitar-pop with soaring choruses and vivid lyrics that run the gamut of emotions. “I Know a Place” is a life-affirming celebration of LGBT safe spaces, while “Crying on the Bathroom Floor” is a heartbreaking insight into a dysfunctional relationship. Dropping this Friday, their debut album isn’t just serious ear candy; it’s also a proper, layered pop album with heart, soul and guts.

4. WHAT TO WATCH WHEN YOU’RE FEELING A LITTLE MORE CONTEMPLATIVE

When he died in 1987, revered writer James Baldwin was working on Remember this House, an exploration of race relations in America told through through his own encounters with civil rights leaders including Malcolm X. This exceptional documentary from Haitian director Raoul Peck brings Baldwin’s unfinished manuscript to life. As narrator Samuel L. Jackson recites Baldwin’s words beautifully, Peck illuminates his insights using archive footage spanning the decades. Opening in select theaters Friday, I Am Not Your Negro is one of the year’s most compelling and intelligent films.

5. WHAT TO ADD TO YOUR WORKOUT PLAYLIST

U.K. duo Goldfrapp have been difficult to pin down since they emerged in 2000. Though their best-known songs are the electro-pop stompers “Ooh La La” and duo “Strict Machine,” they’ve also impressed with folkier offerings and lush, cinematic music. “Anymore,” their first new track in four years, finds Goldfrapp at their most direct and hypnotic. “Give me your love, make me a freak,” singer Alison Goldfrapp purrs over crisp beats and whirring synths. It’s a fine and feisty comeback from an underrated act.

6. WHAT TO WATCH IF YOU DON’T TAKE COMIC BOOK SHOWS TOO SERIOUSLY



Fans of the DC Universe have been spoiled in recent years with hit TV shows including Arrow and The Flash. But Powerless, which premieres Thursday on NBC, is the comic book giant’s first ever sitcom. Vanessa Hudgens stars as a superhero safety-product developer at Wayne Security, a company fronted by Bruce Wayne’s rather less cool cousin, Van Wayne (played by the always amusing Alan Tudyk). Preview clips suggest the writers will have fun mining humor from this increasingly clichéd genre, so Powerless is definitely worth a try.

7. WHO TO FOLLOW ON INSTAGRAM AS SHE SINKS HER TEETH INTO A MEATY NEW ROLE

The actress/activist gets pretty political on Twitter, but her Instagram is generally more lighthearted. Lately she’s been teasing her upcoming TV series, Feud, in which she and Jessica Lange play screen legends Bette Davis and Joan Crawford squabbling on the set of 1961’s camp classic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. It’s becoming one of spring’s buzziest shows, so now is a fine time to catch up with this super-classy actress.

8. WHAT TO READ IF YOU WANT A MORE MODERN KIND OF MOTIVATIONAL GUIDE

You can tell from this book’s title that Scream Queens actress Keke Palmer means business. Billed as an “inspiring guide that encourages young women to live a life full of ownership, confidence, and freedom,” this isn’t a typical self-help book, but a kind of ‘patchwork quilt’ of inspiration featuring quotes, texts, song lyrics and amusing memes. It won’t be for everyone, but there’s something refreshing about Palmer’s willingness to quote Diddy one minute, then Martin Luther King, Jr. the next.

9. WHAT TO WATCH ON VIMEO… YES, VIMEO!

Though Vimeo is often thought of as a fancy alternative to YouTube, it’s recently started investing in original programming too. This anthology series from highly-rated alternative comics Kate Berlant and John Early promises to take a surreal and scathing look at Hollywood ambition over five standalone episodes. Debuting tomorrow (January 31), it’s an ambitious and quirky-looking show which has all the makings of a cult hit.

10. AND FINALLY, WHO TO FOLLOW ON SNAPCHAT BECAUSE, WELL, SHE’S BRITNEY SPEARS



Because the pop icon’s social media accounts used to be dull and eternally on-brand, most fans assumed they were run by her record label. But a couple of years ago, Spears seemed to take control of her Instagram and Twitter, and now uses them to showcase her personality. Last week she finally joined Snapchat too and so far she’s being adorably daffy. Would it surprise you to learn that Britney likes an animal filter? Because she really, really does.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU.

1. "The people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit."

Mr Blair argued that what he called the "cost" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on "imperfect knowledge" which would now become "informed knowledge".

It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, campaigners from both sides said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market.

2. "The practical impact of Brexit on immigration is, on analysis, less than 12% of the immigration total."

Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels.

He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU.

Image copyright Getty Images

The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK.

Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work.

Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct.

There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU.

3. "Seven months ago, after the referendum result, the chancellor was telling us that leaving the single market would be - and I quote - catastrophic."

This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June.

Image copyright Getty Images

Mr Hammond said: "I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic."

But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated.

4. "Our currency is down around 12% against the euro and 20% against the dollar, which is the international financial market's assessment of our future prosperity ie we are going to be poorer. The price of imported goods in the supermarkets is up and thus the cost of living."

It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down.

It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months.The artists claiming Belfast's streets

What we know so far about what happenedImage copyright Reuters

As with any resignation there are a thousand small, but nevertheless important questions. Most are of the who-knew-what-and-when variety. But with this astonishing fall from grace there is one big overarching question. I'll save that best bit for last.

The small questions concern whether Donald Trump knew about the calls Mike Flynn was making to the Russian ambassador, and what the substance of their conversations were.

What happened to the advice given by the acting attorney general to the White House counsel cautioning that Gen Flynn had not been entirely honest. Was the president aware of this? Were there different factions operating within the White House yesterday with different agendas on the embattled national security adviser's future?

Then we can go a sub-section of those questions which revolve around management at the White House. The seemingly dull-sounding process questions: What are the lines of communication? Who reports to whom?

Image copyright AP Image caption Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer had very different public reactions to stories about Flynn on Monday

If that all sounds rather trivial, ask this - how was it possible that within a single hour yesterday afternoon Kellyanne Conway, counsel to the president, said Mr Flynn enjoyed the full support of Mr Trump, and then shortly afterwards, Communications Director Sean Spicer said the president was evaluating Mr Flynn's position?

Those just aren't reconcilable statements. Who was speaking on whose authority? This is not good communications strategy; this is what shambles looks like.

And let's deal with one bit of smoke that has been thrown up since the resignation. Kellyanne Conway was across the US networks this morning with a simple and tempting argument - what sealed Flynn's fate was his misleading of the vice president over the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

That resulted in Mike Pence going on TV in the middle of January and saying: "It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia."

Of course, you can't lie/mislead/deceive/inadvertently misreport to (delete as appropriate) the vice president. But, if you draw yourself a little timeline of what happened then, what is striking is this - it is not the lie/misleading/deception/inadvertent misreporting that cost General Flynn his job, it is the lie/misleading/deception/inadvertent misreporting being made public by the Washington Post that cost him his job.

We now know the acting attorney general went to the White House weeks before to say voice intercepts of Gen Flynn's call proved that lifting of sanctions was discussed. But no action was taken then.

Only when it blew up did this become an issue. This conforms to the little discussed 11th Commandment that Moses handed down on his tablets of stone: Thou Shall Not Get Found Out.

But let us move on to the really big question. What does this say about President Trump's relationship with Russia? For a man who at the drop of a hat will freely spray insults on Twitter to anyone and anything, the one person he stubbornly refuses to say a bad word about is Vladimir Putin. Not ever.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption White House staff in the Oval Office as Donald Trump speaks by phone to Vladimir Putin in late January

In one recent interview he seemed to suggest that America as a state had no greater moral authority than Russia. It was the doctrine of American Unexceptionalism, if you like.

Michael Flynn had sat with the Russian president not that long ago at a dinner honouring the pro-Moscow TV network Russia Today. Extraordinary that a former three star US general would be there. A dossier drawn up by a former MI6 officer - that was flatly denied - alleged all manner of Russian involvement in President Trump's businesses and presidential campaign.

Make no mistake, the Trump base love what they've heard about the migrant ban, the eviction of illegal immigrants, the jobs pledges and a lot more besides.

But what causes a lot of people to scratch their heads is why the love-in with Putin? What is driving this? Even if the most lurid things in the dossier were untrue, are there other things that are? Does Putin have some kind of leverage over the new American president?

The smaller questions, like they often do, will fade away with the next news cycle. These huge ones won't.Jay Z watched on from the front row as Adele declared her undying love for his wife.

US President Donald Trump's nominee has been sworn in to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

Scott Pruitt, a fierce critic of the agency, was approved by the Republican-controlled Senate despite Democratic attempts to delay the confirmation.

A judge in Oklahoma on Thursday ordered him to release, by Tuesday, emails he exchanged with oil and gas executives.

Democrats boycotted an earlier vote over his email refusal and claimed he was too close to energy companies.

They held the Senate floor through the night to put pressure on the chamber to delay the confirmation vote until the emails, which were exchanged while he was Oklahoma attorney general, were handed over.

But the Senate voted in favour of his confirmation by 52 to 46, and he was sworn in on Friday.

Mr Pruitt, 48, had refused to hand over the emails, at the request of a liberal watchdog, for more than two years.

Oil and gas industry stooge? Analysis by Matt McGrath, BBC environment correspondent

Mr Pruitt is perhaps the most controversial appointment in the history of the EPA - the Oklahoma attorney general has spent years fighting the role and reach of the organisation he now heads.

Hundreds of former EPA staff members wrote an open letter against his appointment, some calling him an "unqualified extremist".

Environmental campaigners see him as an oil and gas industry stooge who is "lukewarm" on the threat posed by climate change - they fear that hard-won environmental regulations will be overturned.

Media caption Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change

Key among them is the 2009 ruling that greenhouse gas emissions endanger both the environment and public health. This underpinned many of the actions taken by President Obama to curb CO2.

With Mr Pruitt in place, it's likely that President Trump will rapidly push ahead with orders to overturn Obama's Clean Power Plan and his "Waters of the US" rule, something conservatives also see as an over-extension of federal power.

Mr Pruitt will probably attempt to cut through the "regulatory rampage" that Republicans believe the EPA has embarked on over the past eight years - but he needs to be wary of over-reach.

President Reagan appointed Anne Gorsuch Burford to reform the EPA back in 1981 - but after failed attempts to downsize, she was out on her ear two years later.

What is climate change?

Republicans predicted Mr Pruitt would reset the agency's goals.

"I have no doubt the Scott will return the EPA to its core objectives," said Oklahoma Sen James Inhofe, accusing the agency of "federal overreach, unlawful rule making and duplicative red tape".

"EPA has made life hard for families all across America," said Wyoming Sen John Barrasso, adding that Mr Pruitt would "bring much needed change".

What's next after one month of Trump drama

Environmental groups said they feared he would loosen regulations on energy companies.

During his confirmation hearing he had said he disagreed with Mr Trump saying climate change was a hoax but he previously cast doubt on the overwhelming evidence that changes in the earth's temperature were down to humans.

"Scott Pruitt is the worst pick ever confirmed to lead the EPA," said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

"We'll use every tool in the kit to stop him from harming our air and water, endangering our communities and surrendering our kids to climate catastrophe."

Mr Pruitt's confirmation means that President Trump has filled 14 of his 22 cabinet posts.

He has blamed Democratic obstructionism for not filling more of his key jobs by now.Image copyright Rachel Lindsay/Instagram

One of the most popular reality TV programmes in the US has cast an African-American lead. People are asking: what took so long?

It was no huge surprise that Monday night's announcement of the latest lead in America's most popular reality TV dating show franchise, The Bachelorette, got Twitter excited. But this announcement was, in the words of its producer Mike Fleiss, "historic".

That's because after 16 years and 33 seasons, the ABC franchise cast 31-year-old lawyer Rachel Lindsay as its first black Bachelorette. There has only been one previous minority lead. In 2013, Juan Pablo Galavis, a Venezuelan-American, was cast as the Bachelor.

The reveal of Lindsay resulted in the trending hashtag #BlackBachelorette and a doubling of her Twitter following. Twitter told BBC Trending that the micro-blogging site "went wild hearing the news" when it was revealed on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and that within moments there were "more than 36,000 Twitter mentions of Rachel (@therachlindsay)".

The vast majority of the tweets expressed support for Lindsay.

The franchise

The first season of the Bachelor premiered on ABC in 2002. A group of women competed for the affection of one man. The programme involved extravagant dates in exotic locations as contestants were eliminated week-by-week during a "rose ceremony" (you guessed it, the unsuccessful contestants do not get a rose).

The traditional aspects of a relationship all took place on camera - like hometown dates, and meeting each other's families. Then there were overnight "Fantasy Suite" dates for the final three contestants. The cameras were not allowed in the room.

That first season witnessed all the tears and tantrums you'd expect as as twenty-odd women simultaneously dated the same man. That first series ended with a proposal (but not, in the end, a marriage).

The runner up, Trista Rehn, was named the Bachelorette - and she went on to lead in the following series, with two dozen men competing for her affections. Rehn married her chosen beau Ryan Sutter in 2003, and the two remain together. In all but two seasons, the show has concluded with a marriage proposal.

The formula, with male and female leads switching off each series, proved to be gold - the show has consistently been one of America's most popular, averaging more than 7 million viewers per episode, according to market research company Nielsen.

Spoofing

Lindsay has been the only black female contestant on the franchise to have made it to the top four.

That in itself has been a subject spoofed on satire shows like Saturday Night Live.

"Tell me about yourself," asks the male lead.

"I'm the Black One," replies the woman.

"Let me walk you out."

"Like horror movies in which loose women and black characters are killed off quickly, the fate of the shows' non-white cast members has become a recognisable trope," wrote the Los Angeles Times.

Fleiss, the show's creator, addressed the issue in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly, claiming that he would like to cast more people of colour on the show, but "for whatever reason, they don't come forward."

However another reality TV producer Shawn Ryan tweeted his suspicion that the show's producers "just don't think America will watch black bachelor or root for mixed-race marriage."

Controversy

In 2012, two would-be black contestants brought a lawsuit against the franchise for under-representing minorities. The suit alleged that ABC deliberately cast fewer people of colour in the pool of contestants - and that the show was nervous that interracial romance may "create controversy among its audience."

That suit was dismissed, but some tweeters felt that due to her race, the next Bachelorette was set a higher bar in order to qualify in the lead role than other previous contestants.

Lindsay, who is a civil ligation lawyer, is the daughter of Sam Lindsay, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton to be a federal judge in Texas.

'Cookie cutter'

Prior to Monday's announcement about Lindsay, former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams speculated that a black Bachelorette might not be a successful move for the show.

"I think the franchise wants to so badly break out of its cookie-cutter, white-person shell, but I don't think that America will embrace it, sadly enough," he said.

And after the announcement, others online seemed to echo this thought.

And the timing of the announcement surprised many. Traditionally, ABC announces the next Bachelorette or Bachelor after the season's final episode. Lindsay is a yet-to-be-eliminated contestant on the current season of the show. Some fans, who call themselves "Bachelor Nation", called the reveal a "premature spoiler".

Former Bachelorette Ali Fedotowsky told Access Hollywood that the announcement had come so soon in order to take the discussion over diversity into account.

"They needed to let people of all different backgrounds and races and cultures that we're mixing it up this season," she said.

Bachelor Nick Viall shared an Instagram photo of the two of them after the announcement, writing that "no one is better prepared to show Bachelor Nation, and the world, the beauty of embracing diversity. Good luck Rachel, not that you'll be needing it."

Meanwhile, Lindsay told People magazine, "I'm obviously nervous and excited to take on this opportunity but I don't feel added pressure being the first black Bachelorette, because to me I'm just a black woman trying to find love. Yes, I'm doing on this huge stage, but again my journey of love isn't any different just because my skin colour is."

Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former Prime Minister, has said their son's death "overshadowed everything".

Ivan Cameron, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in hospital aged six in February 2009.

Mrs Cameron told the Times: "Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant."

She also said it changed her husband's outlook. "I think it changed Dave's politics. It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective."

David Cameron had been an MP for less than a year when Ivan was born in 2002, and became prime minister the year after Ivan died.

Mrs Cameron said: "From the moment he is born, you are living in a situation that is quite surreal and difficult to deal with.

"It is intense every day, in and out of hospitals... in a way, that prepared me for Dave being prime minister, because I was used to living and operating in a way that's not normal."

When Ivan died, she said, the outside world "became meaningless".

"Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice."

The Camerons have three other children; Nancy, born in 2004; Arthur, born in 2006; and Florence, born in 2010.

Mrs Cameron also spoke about her family's life in Downing Street.

"We tried to make the flat feel like a home.

"Dave would be combing the children's hair for nits before giving a speech in the evening."

They got their groceries delivered because there was no supermarket nearby - and if she forgot butter, she would have to go to a shop in Trafalgar Square.

"So I did plan quite carefully."

She also said she dreaded the official holiday photograph.

"At the last minute we would panic and think, 'Oh God, it's the holiday photo...

"I hated the holding-hands thing because it looked too romantic, so we overdid the cups-of-coffee-looking-wistful pose."

Mrs Cameron was speaking to the Times Magazine to promote her clothing brand Cefinn.

Before her husband became Prime Minister, she was creative director for Smythson, which makes luxury leather goods.An almost palpable fug of sour alcohol rises from the wild-bearded, unkempt man sleeping in the backseat of a battered limo. At a sharp clunk caused by the gang members trying to steal his rims, his rheumy, bloodshot eyes spring open and Logan, aka Wolverine, aka James Howlett, aka, for the last 17 years, Hugh Jackman, utters his first word in James Mangold's new X-Men spinoff. It’s unprintable here. But the four-letter word is a red herring. If you think that salty language will be Mangold's primary means of testing the permissive limits of the film's for-adults-only R-rating, in the very next moments he dispatches multiple sneering gang members via the maximally gory means of blading them through the head in gouging, spurting detail.

Logan expects us to take it seriously – and we actually can

As the last of them slides off his adamantium claws to the ground, we're not even halfway through the opening titles. This is Mangold declaring that not only will his film stand apart from his last time at the helm with 2013's The Wolverine, it will be different from all the Marvel movies that have gone before – if not from superhero films in general. It will be different even from Deadpool, the foul-mouthed hit of 2016, because there's no quip, no wink to camera, no meta flourish to let us know that this is all just a bit of malarkey. Determinedly dark, defiantly grimy and really quite depressing, Logan is pointedly devoid of humour, and expects us to take it seriously. The surprise is that, for the most part, we actually can.

For genre purists, it can be disconcerting to see comic book movies classified as sci-fi. And though the X-Men franchise, being about genetic mutation, has maybe more of a claim to that designation than, say, Thor, the outsize arcs and simplistic good vs evil binaries of the superhero film do not often lend themselves to the thoughtful curiosity that is a hallmark of the best science fiction. It would be overstating it to say that Logan reaches sci-fi heights – there's a standard-issue British Evil Scientist (played with pale-eyed zeal by Richard E Grant), a henchman with a Terminator arm (Boyd Holbrook, good value in a relatively small role) and an albino mutant (Stephen Merchant in a rare and surprisingly decent dramatic performance) whose photosensitivity is so extreme he'll burst into flames in sunlight like Nosferatu. So, you know, this is not Tarkovsky's Solaris.

The father-daughter mutant duo who slay together stay together

But Logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated, end-of-the-world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics. That said, the fight scenes are extremely gruesome, especially when half the time it's a child doing the slicing and dicing.

The X factor

According to the plot it is 2029 and no new mutant has been born for many years. A broken-down and alcoholic Logan is scraping a living as a limo driver and caring for a deteriorating Professor X (Patrick Stewart), whose degenerative disease renders his "weapon of mass destruction" brain potentially large-scale lethal unless he remains under heavy sedation. Logan is approached by a woman who begs him to take her and her daughter Laura to North Dakota, but there are mercenaries attached to a genetic research corporation, led by Pierce (Holbrook), on their trail. Laura is in fact a mutant, built in a lab, and the nature of her mutation suggests that Wolverine's DNA was the key ingredient. So despite an almost pathological reluctance to get involved, Wolverine is drawn into the role of protector, in a manner that the screenplay, co-written by Mangold, Scott Frank and Michael Green, keeps from getting overly sentimental, while still providing the film with what little emotional uplift it has. The father/daughter mutant duo who slay together, stay together, after all.

Logan’s darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as in Batman v Superman

Logan’s darkness is not simply an aesthetic filter as was the case in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; it emanates from within the character. It's ironic that the title shares some DNA with the famously campy 1970s sci-fi film, Logan’s Run, in which people are considered obsolete at 30 and murdered. In its way, Logan is just as much about the pitilessness of the aging process, and Jackman's battle-scarred, stiffening body is as expressive in this regard as his perma-scowl of a face. It's taking him longer to heal, his eyes are never clear and one of his claws won't fully extend. This makes him less Logan's Run, more Logan's Limp. He's as battered a superhero as we've ever seen, and for the first time his body bears exterior witness to the inner torture that has always defined him. His body is the story.

There are flaws, of course. At 135 minutes the film is unnecessarily long, especially when one lengthy digression in the middle feels so inorganic. And considering the relentless dourness, and the serially downbeat turns the story takes, it does pose the questions: How bleak is too bleak? How many head stabbings are too many head stabbings? How standalone can a film be, and still relate to the continuity of a wider cinematic universe? How much doom-laden mortality can a film portray and still be a superhero movie?

In an era of cinematic product homogenisation there’s no doubt that Logan is a risky proposition. But this is reportedly Jackman’s last time donning those claws and chewing on that cigar. Considering it was his Wolverine, as the centrepiece of Bryan Singer’s X-Men (2000), who launched the currently omnipresent superhero phenomenon in the first place, maybe the most appropriate thing would be that, with the brutal, melancholic elegy that is Logan, Wolverine remakes the superhero movie again, this time as a farewell.

The 'fine-tuned machine' memesAs the video above shows, large-bodied apes are extremely nimble, even on the highest tree branches. This does not, at first, make intuitive sense.

How are they so efficient so high up in the trees? Surely powering such a large body with enough energy should be a hindrance? Evidently, this is not a problem for apes.

To understand the energy costs involved for apes to move around their forested environment, researchers analysed the next best thing: parkour athletes, who are extremely agile and can climb up and down complex obstacles.

We're not as well-adapted as an orangutan

"They are as close to our ape cousins as we can manage," says lead author Lewis Halsey of the University of Roehampton in London, UK.

In order to measure their energy consumption they were fitted with an oxygen mask. This would be difficult and unethical with wild apes.

The athletes were given four chances to go around an obstacle course, and became more efficient each time. This is similar to the way orangutans become more adept as they move around the forest and climb familiar trees.

Further, the parkour athletes with the longest arm spans and shortest legs were the most efficient.

"That's rather like an arboreal primate," says Halsey. "These apes tend to have broad chests and long arms, which gives them a big arm span, and short legs." While their bodies are obviously not identical to those of parkour athletes, "nonetheless the pattern is somewhat similar".

The results reinforce the idea that "humans are still pretty well-adapted for the trees," he says. "We're not as well-adapted as an orangutan, we just don't have the shoulder flexion and grip strength. But nonetheless we are pretty good."

It also explains how such large-bodied animals can survive the energy costs required to navigate their complex environment. They have evolved ways to use minimal energy, with bodies well-adapted for trees.

The research is published in the Journal of Human Evolution.

Samsung's heir apparent Lee Jae-yong has been placed under arrest in South Korea, accused of bribery and other charges.

The case is linked to a scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.

Samsung is accused of giving donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for government favours.

Mr Lee and the Samsung Group deny any wrongdoing.

The acting Samsung chief was first questioned by prosecutors in January, but they decided then not to arrest him.

But he was questioned for a second time earlier this week.

On Friday, the court said it "acknowledged that it is necessary to arrest [Lee Jae-Yong] in light of a newly added criminal charge and new evidence."

The prosecution will now investigate further, and has 20 days to file formal charges. The arrest does not reflect a court opinion on guilt or innocence but only means it considers the potential crime very serious or that it assumes a flight risk.

What's the accusation?

Prosecutors accused Mr Lee of giving donations worth 41bn won ($36m;£29m) to organisations linked to Ms Park's close friend Ms Choi. They alleged this was done to win government support for a big restructuring of Samsung that would help a smooth leadership transition in favour of Mr Lee, who is standing in as chairman for his ill father, Lee Kun-hee.

The controversial merger required support from the national pension fund - the allegation is that this support was granted in return for the donations.

In a December parliamentary hearing, Samsung admitted giving a total of 20.4bn won to two foundations, but denied seeking favours in return.

Mr Lee also confirmed the firm gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Ms Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, something he said he now regrets.

What's the political scandal?

This centres around President Park's ties to Ms Choi and has brought allegations of cult activities, influence-peddling and leaks of classified information.

Image copyright EPA Image caption There have been protests against President Park Geung-hye, who has been impeached

Ms Choi is a long term family friend whose father had already had close ties with President Park's father who was president in the 1970s.

As well as soliciting donations, Ms Choi is accused of using their friendship to interfere in politics.

Image copyright AP Image caption Ms Choi has denied that she did wrong but has apologised for 'causing trouble'

She is now on trial charged with various offences, including abuse of authority, coercion and attempted fraud, and denies wrongdoing.

Parliament voted in December to impeach President Park. Her case is now being heard by the constitutional court. Meanwhile she has been stripped of her presidential powers.

A friendship too far in Seoul?

What does it mean for Samsung?

Mr Lee is currently vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics. But since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014, he is considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung Group conglomerate.

Regardless of the outcome, a trial is a big blow to the company. His arrest may not affect short term production or the running of the firm but there could be long term implications.

Shares in the conglomerate's firms lost between 0.5% and 2% on Friday.

Lee Jae-yong Samsung's heir apparent - Grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul, son of current chairman Lee Kun-hee.

- Aged 48, he's spent his entire career in the company and is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.

- Last year was nominated to join the board of Samsung Electronics - an appointment confirmed on 27 October.

- Widely expected to take overall control of Samsung once his 74-year-old father steps down.

- Critics say his position on the board is due to his birth, not his business experience. Getty Images

Samsung is one of the biggest electronics companies in the world and for the head of a company that thrives on a premium brand image to be involved in a corruption scandal is a huge embarrassment.

It says it will do its best "to ensure that the truth is revealed in future court proceedings", though denies wrongdoing.Think you're a geography expert?

She wanted to know if I was serious about the job at hand.

“Just do like I showed you before,” said Joe Healy-Rennison, my instructor and fellow pack member at Ireland’s School of Falconry. He encouraged me in his easy Irish manner, pushing a freshly severed chicken foot into my gloved fist. Then I stuck my left arm straight out to the side, tensing my shoulder as Lima, the beautiful brown Harris’s hawk, swooped down in a gush of wind, lighting upon the edge of my covered wrist. I rotated my hand as her sabre-like beak snapped up the chicken foot. She swallowed it whole, shaking her gullet, then blinked with satisfaction.

We were hunting for small game in the vast forest – some 350 acres of thick woodlands – surrounding historic Ashford Castle at the northern tip of Lough Corrib in western Ireland. As we stepped deeper into the ancient woods, massive tree trunks rose up like Greek columns with a vaulted ceiling of green, heart-shaped leaves. The day was warm and overcast, a dry spell following the wet and gloomy Irish morning.

“Hold onto Lima,” Healy-Rennison commanded, as I tightly pinched the speckle-feathered bird’s jesses, or tethers, under my thumb.

“Now she’s ‘under your thumb’,” Healy-Rennison explained with a smile.

“Quite literally,” I replied, amused to learn the etymology of a phrase that I’ve used for most of my life. Only now I was standing in the place where the phrase was born – in the wet green woods of the Anglo-Irish gentry, with a giant hawk on my wrist, her jesses wrapped around my little finger. “Yet another phrase we get from falconry,” said Healy-Rennison, who advised me to add the extra grip of my pinkie.

Healy-Rennison then covered the bird’s eyes and head with a small leather hood to keep her from distraction until we reached our hunting spot.

“Hence the term ‘hoodwinked’,” he said cheerily, continuing to teach me English – the English of 16th-century falconry, a rare jargon that entered the colloquial, thanks in part to one amateur falconer, William Shakespeare. Experts still argue about how much falconry Shakespeare actually practiced in real life, but he was no doubt personally acquainted with the sport, as his plays carry more than 50 references to falconry.

Macbeth advises “scarfing the eye”, a reference to hoodwinking a falcon to prevent the bird (his lady) from distraction. He continues the falconry metaphor with holding the lady back on her perch while other falcons prepare to “rouse”, or take flight. French terms like “rouse” (from the Old French ruser, when a hawk shakes its feathers) entered English with the Norman invasion of 1066. But it is Shakespeare who helped forge a new meaning: “to rouse” as in “awaken”.

Lima only roused slightly when I removed her hood, fluffing out her feathers before settling back into to her sleek, sharp self. Then she hurled forward, dashing upwards into the highest tree.

My eyes searched the dappled camouflage in front of me – tree limbs, leaves and shadow – but I could not see her.

“Just keep walking,” Healy-Rennison instructed. “She sees us far better than we can see her.”

“Eyes like a hawk,” I mused aloud, treading onward.

“Ten times stronger than a human’s eyesight,” said Healy-Rennison, adding, “Like reading a newspaper across a football field.”

I adjusted my glasses, squinting at the luxuriant blur and feeling even more inferior to the half-kilo bird that was teasing me deeper into the forest.

From medieval falconry to modern English Bate Birds beating their wings while still tethered; from the Old French batre (to beat), eventually “to hold back, restrain”, as in a bated breath.

Booze From the 14th-century verb bouse (Dutch origin), to drink excessively. A bird that drinks too much water will not hunt, similar to those who are “fed up”.

Fed up A bird that is no longer hungry has no incentive to hunt.

Haggard A wild hawk that’s difficult to train. One of Shakespeare’s favourite terms.

Hoodwinked To prevent a bird from immediately searching for prey, falconers cover the bird’s head until they are in the right place to hunt.

Rouse From the Old French ruser, when a hawk shakes its feathers. Figurative meaning “awaken” first appeared in late 16th-century England.

Under his thumb Tightly gripping the jesses, or tethers, under one’s thumb prevents the bird from flying away until it is released.

Wrapped around his little finger Wrapping the jesses around the pinkie finger adds an extra anchor in securing the bird.

“There, she’s found something!” Healy-Rennison called, pointing at Lima, who had magically appeared on a high oak limb ahead of us. We both rushed forward like urgent, obedient children. “See how she’s wagging her tail?”

Healy-Rennison pointed upward, and sure enough, Lima was bouncing her tail feathers up and down. “That means she’s spotted something. She’s signalling at us to find it.”

We dropped down to the ground and began crawling around on all fours. My first falconry lesson had reduced me to the same state as the rodents we were hunting, but like the haunting harp music of the Emerald Isle, this is tradition.

Humans have hunted with birds of prey for thousands of years, and for nearly 800 years at Ashford Castle. Built in 1228, the old Norman castle evolved into an elaborate chateau, eventually purchased by the Guinness family and transformed into a Victorian hunting lodge. To that end, the beer barons expanded the estate to more than 26,000 acres (larger than Manhattan), conserving the kind of old-growth forest that once covered the whole of the British Isles.

This is what all of Ireland used to look like, I told myself while rummaging in the underbrush under Lima’s watchful gaze. Everything was forest, and filled with fairies, say the legends. Prime leprechaun habitat too, I thought.

“So, they used to hunt mice and squirrels in medieval times?” I asked stupidly.

“Not really – more like rabbits,” Healy-Rennison explained, motioning for me to stand up. “Big rabbits. A hawk like Lima can lift a 5kg hare, easy.” Some still do, given a chance.

I do the maths.

“That’s like me picking up a car!” Healy-Rennison nodded, handing me another chicken foot, and I stuck out my arm. Lima swooped down once more and gobbled up the reward, but we could only repeat this search and retreat game so many times.

“If she has too much to eat, she won’t hunt anymore. Hence the term ‘fed up’.” I looked back at Healy-Rennison, who nodded. Again, the term comes from falconry.

In Shakespeare’s play The Taming of the Shrew, the male lead Petruchio likens taming his new bride to training a hawk:

My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;

And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,

For then she never looks upon her lure.

Another way I have to man my haggard,

To make her come and know her keeper’s call,

A falcon or hawk that is fully gorged, or “fed up” will no longer work for her master. On the other hand, a “haggard” is a wild hawk that may never be fully trained. Shakespeare uses the term five times to describe different women in his plays, which in later English came to mean wild, unkempt and dishevelled.

After two hours crawling through the forest, I was feeling a bit dishevelled myself. My first falconry lesson ended without any kills, but a whole pocket full of new vocabulary.

One of California's strongest storms in years - dubbed a "bombogenesis" or "weather bomb" - has hit the state, killing two, and bringing torrential rain and flash floods.

Hundreds of homes have been evacuated amid fears of mud slides near Los Angeles.

More than 250 flights have been disrupted at Los Angeles International Airport, and major roads have closed.

The weather has also brought car-swallowing sinkholes and power cuts.

The rainstorms spread from the south of the state, around Los Angeles, up to San Francisco.

One man was killed after a tree fell and pulled a power line on to his car in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles.

Firefighters saved one person from the first car, and the driver got out of the second before it fell. No-one was injured.

Erik Scott from the Los Angeles Fire Department said that the sinkhole rescue was "a very unique and dangerous situation".

He said the frightened driver in the fallen car was forced to stand on top of her vehicle, underground and amid rushing water, until a ladder could be passed down to her, 10ft (3 metres) below the street.

The Los Angeles Times also spoke of "surreal scenes" with cars trapped by rising waters along freeways 11 and 15.

Evacuation orders were issued in the city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles, and in parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County.

It is feared that areas that have been previously hit by forest fires could be more susceptible to mud slides as there is less vegetation to break the flow of running water.

In Duarte, about 20 miles (32 km) east of Los Angeles, city authorities said they had been door to door to issue mandatory evacuations.

Those who chose to stay were required to sign notifications.

One local, Alberto Moreno, told Reuters news agency that he was staying put. "The neighbours are here so we're all basically going to help out each other if it comes down to it," he said, while barricading his home with sandbags.

Meteorologists describe the "bombogenesis" as an intense extra-tropical cyclonic low-pressure area, or "a weather bomb".

"The storm looks to be the strongest storm to hit southwest California this season," the National Weather Service said.

"It is likely the strongest within the last six years and possibly even as far back as December 2004 or January 1995."

'Weather bomb' storm stuns CaliforniaThey formed a "human wall" to protest US President Donald Trump's plans for a wall between the countries.Many species have been seen practicing infanticide and cannibalism. But birds of prey, also known as raptors, are something of an exception. They have only rarely been seen doing these things, and when they have been spotted the circumstances were usually exceptional. For instance, parents have killed their own offspring to feed siblings, or chicks that were already dead have been eaten by parents or siblings.

But one bird of prey has taken things a bit further. In two separate studies, researchers have caught Eleonora's falcons on camera breaking both taboos. These birds, it seems, are willing to prey on their neighbours' offspring.

One study reports an incident of cannibalism that took place in September 2013 on Akrotiri Peninsula in Cyprus. It was published in the Journal of Raptor Research in 2016.

A nestling is easy prey because it has little strength to fight back, and it can't fly to escape

Eleonora's falcons generally eat winged insects, but during the breeding season they mainly feed on small birds instead. It is therefore not surprising to see adult falcons dismembering birds to feed to their chicks.

But when the chicks in one nest were about three weeks old, their mother was seen holding a one-week-old chick that appeared to be from the same species. The mother then killed the helpless chick and fed it to her young.

"We were certainly not expecting to see this," says Alexander Kirschel of the University of Cyprus in Nicosia, who made the observations with his colleague, Thomas Hadjikyriakou. "We were expecting to see adults bring small migrant prey to the nest to feed their young, but not nestlings of their own species."

Just before the incident, the adult male falcon had been standing guard in the nest. Kirschel and Hadjikyriakou suspect that the adult female, who was out searching for food, stole the chick from a neighbouring nest.

There seems to be a small window in the morning, when both parents are away

"An Eleonora's falcon may not usually have the opportunity to steal a nestling from another nest, because the parents will be protecting their young," says Kirschel. "But given the opportunity, when parents may have left the nest for a short time, a nestling is easy prey because it has little strength to fight back, and it can't fly to escape."

That is in line with the findings of a second study, which documents three incidents of baby bird robbery, all while the nests were unguarded by the parents. These events took place in the early mornings of September 2014 and 2015 on the tiny Greek island of Anidro, and are also described in the Journal of Raptor Research.

"There seems to be a small window in the morning, when both parents are away looking for food for their dependent nestlings," says Ronny Steen of the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Ås.

In one case, Steen was surprised to discover "a stranger at the entrance of the nest just after sunrise, namely a neighbouring female".

Non-parental infanticide is generally very rare

He saw the intruder arriving at a nest just before 7am and attacking three chicks. She visited the nest four times in total, but her last visit was cut short when the mother of the chicks returned and attacked. Only one chick survived.

The same nest was attacked the following year. The unwanted visitor left with the nest's one and only chick in its talons. Its parents kept returning to the empty nest anyway, bringing food for their lost chick.

Two days later, an intruder attacked two chicks at a neighbouring nest. These chicks, however, were older and fought back with their talons. One managed to escape. Its sibling was not so lucky

"Non-parental infanticide is generally very rare, and has never been directly documented in Eleonora's falcons before," says Steen.

Although he cannot be sure, Steen says that there might be just one intruder, raiding different nests in consecutive years. He also suspects that this intruder stole the chicks to feed its own young – which would fit with the observations that Kirschel and Hadjikyriakou made.

"This study provides evidence of an adult stealing a nestling from a nest, whereas ours shows what the adult then does with the nestling — takes it to its own nest, kills it, and feeds it to its young," says Kirschel.

Kirschel and Hadjikyriakou say the nest where cannibalism took place was the most successful they tracked in their three-year study. It produced three fledglings each year. They suspect that the cannibalism might have contributed to the success.

In other species, such as herring gulls, it seems that only some individuals carry out infanticide and cannibalism. "So it might be something that specific individuals learn, rather than [this being] a generic behaviour in Eleonora's falcons," says Hadjikyriakou.

"We could talk about this as a strategy; a strategy that some individuals adopt," says Steen. "However, this strategy will never be too frequent as this is how natural selection works."

The new studies show what happens when food resources are limited or when breeding densities are high. Infanticide and cannibalism in birds may be more common when they breed in colonies.

Although I cannot be certain, I find it more likely that the female adopts an infanticide behaviour

"Migrating birds have seasonal and other temporal fluctuations, mainly governed by weather conditions, so there are periods or even whole seasons that food supply is low," says Hadjikyriakou. "This puts stress on the breeding population and might trigger individuals to look for alternative sources of food, such as nestlings in nearby nests."

The prey is usually brought to the nest by the male and given to the female to feed the chicks. In all cases, however, it seems that the female was the culprit.

"Although I cannot be certain, I find it more likely that the female adopts an infanticide behaviour, as she is more attached to the nesting ground and she might have a better overview of presence or absence of neighbours," says Steen.

It seems Eleonora's falcons may be quite flexible in their behaviours. In another study, which was described in New Scientist in 2016, researchers found that Moroccan Eleonora's falcons seem to cripple and imprison live birds, apparently storing them for later consumption.

Boston Image caption The caves were discovered by miners 100 years ago

It is a remarkable discovery in an amazing place.

Scientists have extracted long-dormant microbes from inside the famous giant crystals of the Naica mountain caves in Mexico - and revived them.

The organisms were likely encased in the striking shafts of gypsum at least 10,000 years ago, and possibly up to 50,000 years ago.

It is another demonstration of the ability of life to adapt and cope in the most hostile of environments.

"Other people have made longer-term claims for the antiquity of organisms that were still alive, but in this case these organisms are all very extraordinary - they are not very closely related to anything in the known genetic databases," said Dr Penelope Boston.

The new director of Nasa's Astrobiology Institute in Moffett Field, California, described her findings here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

Image copyright Mike Spilde Image caption Conditions can require the use of "ice suits" to try to stay cool

First opened by miners looking for silver and other metals a hundred years ago, the deeply buried Naica caves are a key interest to scientists fascinated by extremophiles - microbes that can thrive in seemingly impossible conditions.

The environment is hot (40-60C), humid and acidic. With no light at depth, any lifeform must chemosynthesise to survive. That is, it must derive the energy needed to sustain itself by processing rock minerals.

Researchers had identified microbes living in the walls of the caves, but isolating them from inside the metres-long crystals is a surprise.

These outsized needles of gypsum have grown over millions of years. They are not perfect. In places they have defects - small voids where fluids have collected and become encased.

Image copyright Mike Spilde Image caption The caves lie deep under the limestone mountains

Using sterile tools, Dr Boston and colleagues opened these inclusions and sampled their contents.

Not only did they detect the presence of bacteria and archaea, but they were able also to re-animate these organisms in the lab.

The concern would be that these organisms might simply be the result of contamination, either introduced by the team or the mining operations. But the Nasa director said that the necessary protocols were followed.

Scientists have previously claimed to revive bugs thought to have been dormant for many millions of years. These organisms had been trapped inside salt or ice crystals. All such claims are contentious, but Dr Boston said she was minded to accept them after everything she had seen at Naica and in other similar environments.

Media caption Penelope Boston: "Stupendously huge crystals"

What gives her confidence in the status of the Mexican caves is the great diversity of life that seems to exist there.

"Other groups have shown there are lots of viruses in these caves and what that says to me is that these are fully fledged microbial communities that have their viral load just like every other community does. So, that's another aspect of this that argues against casual contamination," she told reporters.

Working for Nasa as an astrobiologist, she is clearly interested in the relevance of such finds to the search for life beyond Earth.

"The astrobiological link is obvious in that any extremophile system that we're studying allows us to push the envelope of life further on Earth, and we add it to this atlas of possibilities that we can apply to different planetary settings."

Image copyright Mike Spilde Image caption Iron oxides turn the walls of the caves orange

Many scientists suspect that if life does exist elsewhere in the Solar System, it will most likely be underground, chemosynthesising like the microbes of Naica.

Dr Boston said her team was about to submit a paper on the caves to a relevant journal.

In her discussion with reporters she lamented the fact that the crystal complex had become flooded following the recent cessation of mining activities, preventing any further access.

"It is tear inducingly beautiful down there. I wrote several poems about it actually."

Like many parents, I am the unofficial IT manager in my house. And, like many IT managers, my users are never happy with the service they get.

The complaints have got louder over the past few months as I have tried to manage how much time two of them (my teenage children) spend online and to restrict what they see.

A patchwork of different technologies help me do this. It includes:

rules on the router to limit net time

apps on tablets to watch content

software on PCs to spot malware and filter searches

It works, after a fashion, but I know it has holes and that is why I also use a lot of sneakernet.

This involves me walking around the house, kicking my kids off the game console, tablet, phone or TV (delete as appropriate) they are using when they should be doing homework, cleaning out the rabbit or getting ready for school.

Locked off

Research suggests I'm not alone in using tech to oversee online time - both to limit it and to help them stay safe.

About 44% of parents use apps to oversee online activity, 39% check browser histories and 37% put controls on the router, suggests statistics gathered by security company Symantec.

I use all three of those and want to use more. And it looked like technology was going to get even more useful as electronics companies released products with comprehensive parental controls onboard.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Talking to children about their online habits can help limit cyber-bullying

It's perhaps no surprise that parents are keen to turn to technology to help manage time online, says Nick Shaw, European general manager at security company Norton, because it's one area where they struggle to find help.

"When people have a parenting problem with their children, they might go to their own parents for advice," he says, "but this is the one area where your parents are not as clued up as you are."

And, he says, children are even more clued up and easily capable of running rings around their parents.

"A lot of parents are very naive about this," he says.

Even I got complacent because none of the tech I had put in place was sending me alerts. I thought it was all working fine and my children were browsing and gaming in an impenetrable bubble of safety.

Wrong.

Slowly I found out that by fiddling with system clocks, using safe mode and putting home PCs into sleep states, my two teenagers could avoid most of the locks and blocks.

My schoolboy error, says Mr Shaw, was to let the hardware do the heavy lifting.

"Technology is going to help you," he says, "but it's not going to get away from the fact that you should be having more conversations about this with your kids."

Image copyright Symantec Image caption The parental controls of Norton's futuristic looking Core router are controlled via a smartphone

What I should be doing, he says, is helping them to understand why the controls are needed.

Explaining the reasons, he says, can help to defuse some of the objections.

It is fair to say that my children and I have had some of these conversations. But they have been more of the "play-less-games-and-do-more-maths" type rather than the "anti-virus-stops-your-YouTube-account-being-stolen" sort.

Rights and respect

Tony Anscombe, security evangelist at anti-virus company Avast, says talking to children about safe ways to use the web is better than just imposing restrictions.

"Sure," he says, "set some rules about how they should use it, but you should also educate your kids about basic security principles.

"A lot of parents just do not have the conversation, talking to them about what is acceptable and what is not."

This should cover not sharing passwords and thinking before they share personal data such as contact information, images and videos.

Naivety puts many children at risk, he says, and it is worth reminding them about what can be done with that information and who might want it.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Ofcom suggests UK parents are doing more to protect their children online, but threats remain (stock photo)

It might not just fall into the hands of cyber-thieves, he says, it might also expose them to cyber-bullying or just be inappropriate to share.

Warnings about the hidden features in popular apps are worth passing on, he says, as they often seek to scoop up more information than they really need.

"The biggest and most important thing that parents can do is run the apps their children do," he says.

This will help parents understand what information children might share and uncover any hidden features the apps possess.

Some, he says, look innocuous but are designed to help children conceal what they are doing.

"Gadgets are only half the story, if that," says Dr Sonia Livingstone, from the London School of Economics, who studies how children use the internet, as part of her work with the long-running EU Kids Online project.

Companies should concentrate on doing less selling and more on designing services that do not need the protections they peddle, she says.

In addition, she says, parents should encourage children to do the right thing by doing it themselves, rather than just by dictating terms.

It's about respect too, she says, helping children make good decisions instead of arbitrarily imposing rules.

If they can see the benefits of the rules, they are more likely to follow them.

"I am not very keen on the idea that parents have lots of control over their children," she says. "Children have rights too."Сайт bbcrussian.com входит в структуру интернет-подразделения Британской вещательной корпорации (Би-би-си), крупнейшей в мире информационной медиаорганизации.

Ecuadoreans will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a successor to President Rafael Correa after three terms of what he and his administration have dubbed "21st-Century socialism".

Why does it matter?

After 10 years in power and three election wins, President Correa will not be running again, so change at the top is inevitable.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rafael Correa will not run again after 10 years in power

When he was first elected in 2007, Mr Correa was one of a group of left-wing leaders in power in Latin America, including Argentina's Nestor Kirchner, Bolivia's Evo Morales, Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Cuba's Raul Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.

Some observers spoke of a "pink tide" sweeping across the continent.

A decade on, Argentina and Brazil are led by conservative presidents, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces a hostile legislative and Evo Morales is on his last term after Bolivians rejected a proposal to change the constitution to allow him to run again.

Will Ecuadoreans follow the lead of Argentines and Peruvians and turn their backs on left-wing politics and favour a conservative candidate?

Or will they favour the man who served as Mr Correa's vice-president?

Who are the main contenders?

With Mr Correa not running again, his governing leftist Alianza PAIS (Country Alliance) party threw its weight behind former vice-president Lenin Moreno.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lenin Moreno is the candidate for the left-wing governing Alianza PAIS political party

Despite having been a key figure in Mr Correa's cabinet between 2007-2013, Mr Moreno has sought to differentiate himself from the outgoing leader.

Challenged when he disagreed with the president about tax policies, Mr Moreno simply stated: "The President has the right to think differently. Each one decides in his own government."

Observers say the 63-year-old's style is less confrontational than that of Mr Correa and they suspect Mr Moreno may try to jettison some aspects of his predecessor's socialist policies.

As vice-president, Mr Moreno, who became paraplegic after being shot in the back in 1998, set out to improve the rights of people with disabilities.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Moreno fought to make Ecuador more accessible to those with disabilities

Not only did he give motivational talks, he also published books on humour and happiness with titles proclaiming: "Being Happy is Easy and Fun".

Most recently, he served as UN Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility.

Among his main campaign promises are increasing employment opportunities and ensuring that all Ecuadoreans have the chance to go on to higher education.

Most polls suggest Mr Moreno is likely to get a majority of the votes on 19 February, but not the 40% needed to win outright in the first round.

The 'business-friendly' man

His main rival is centre-right businessman and former presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Guillermo Lasso

The 61-year-old is running for the Creando Oportunidades (Creating Opportunities) party.

A banker, Mr Lasso wants to create jobs by promoting foreign investment and has promised to cut taxes for big companies.

He also has plans to make Ecuador's central bank independent of the government. The youngest of 11 children, he says he wants to "create an Ecuador with opportunities for all".

'No government waste'

Hot on his heels in the polls is Christian-Socialist candidate Cynthia Viteri.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Cynthia Viteri has been catching up in the polls in recent weeks

The 51-year-old lawyer has also pledged to cut taxes to promote job creation. She wants to slash government spending by at least $700m (£560m) on existing programmes she calls "luxuries".

What awaits the winner?

If whoever wins the first round on 19 February does not get 40% or more of the vote, a run-off will be held on 2 April.

The eventual winner of the election will be sworn in to a four-year term in May.

Economic recovery is likely to be a top priority for Ecuador. The oil-exporting country has suffered from a drop in international oil prices and has seen its GDP contract 1.7% in 2016.

Corruption is another major problem with officials from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht recently revealing that they paid close to $35.5m in bribes to Ecuadorean officials in exchange for contracts.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brazilian construction company paid over 35 million dollars in bribes to Ecuadorean officials

Officials of Mr Correa's government, including his former energy minister Jorge Pareja, are also under investigation over the granting of contracts by state-owned oil company Petroecuador.

In foreign policy, the new president will have to deal with US President Donald Trump and his potentially more protectionist economic policies.

He or she will also have to adapt to a shift of alliances in the region, following the departure from power of left-wing governments in Argentina, Brazil and Peru over the last two years.

What is Mr Correa's legacy?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Rafael Correa formed alliances with other left-wing Latin American leaders such as Hugo Chavez of Venezuela (right)

Rafael Correa was elected in 2007 on a promise of bringing radical social and political reforms to Ecuador.

During his tenure, Mr Correa increased government spending on social programmes and looked to diversify Ecuador's trade and political relationships.

He forged close ties with the left-wing regional group Alba, which includes Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela among others.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China became Ecuador's main creditor after Quito's ties with the US cooled

He also moved Ecuador much closer economically to China, which is now one of the country's major creditors and trade partners.

Mr Correa has been credited with reducing poverty until 2014, when the oil price slump hit government revenue and its ability to finance poverty reduction programmes.

But recent corruption scandals and Mr Correa's frequent clashes with the media have produced some disillusionment.

One poll suggests 70% of Ecuadoreans want "important changes" to be made.

Voting is mandatory and more than 12 million people are entitled to vote for the president, the vice-president and also 137 seats in the legislature.

To understand where the concept of sharing or dividing this piece of land comes from, it is important to look at its recent past.

Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism arose during the same period of history with claims to the same territory. This rationale was the underlying basis for an equitable solution, based on partition and a two-state solution.

In 1921, TransJordan (now the state of Jordan) was formally separated from Palestine (now Israel and the West Bank/Gaza). A UN resolution in 1947 proposed a second partition, this time of the territory west of the river Jordan.

One part would be a state where Zionist Jews constituted a majority, the other where the Palestinian Arabs would be a majority of the population, but the latter rejected the idea.

Competing claims

Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Jordan occupied the West Bank. Egypt in turn controlled Gaza.

During the Six Day War in 1967, Israel defeated Jordanian forces and conquered the West Bank. Similarly Egypt was forced to leave the Gaza Strip.

While the Israeli Left was willing to return territory to Jordan for regional peace, the rise of Palestinian nationalism under Yasser Arafat and the ascendency of the Israeli Right under Menahem Begin initially proposed polarised solutions - either a Greater Israel or a Greater Palestine, but not a two-state solution.

The Israeli Right argued that there were nationalist and religious reasons for retaining the West Bank. Some on the Israeli Left wanted to build socialism on the West Bank through the construction of a network of kibbutzim.

Israeli security experts, meanwhile, believed that the West Bank provided strategic depth to slow down an invading army. All this led to a burgeoning settler movement.

Two states

Yasser Arafat started to move towards a two-state solution after 1974 (though some saw this as a ploy) and established a Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza, following the Oslo Accords with Israel in 1993.

Successive Israeli prime ministers - Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert and Benjamin Netanyahu - have all accepted the idea of a Palestinian state, but have differed in terms of what it should actually comprise.

Recent advocates of the two-state solution have suggested an Israeli border near the West Bank barrier, which would encompass a majority of Israeli settlers. This may well be the basis for a plan eventually put forward by the Trump administration.

Despite proclamations of a State of Palestine by Arafat and his successor, Mahmoud Abbas, it has never materialised as a de facto entity, and despite Mr Netanyahu's declaration of support for a Palestinian state in 2009, it is unlikely that any right-wing government would permit its emergence for both ideological and security reasons.

The takeover of Gaza in 2007 by Hamas produced a divided Palestinian Authority. The nationalists controlled the West Bank while the Islamists ruled Gaza.

In the past decade any reconciliation has been based more on public relations than on public reality. This has led to the idea of two Palestinian states or autonomous areas for the Palestinians.

One fundamental difference between the two sides has been support for a two-state solution by Palestinian nationalists, but no unambiguous statement to this effect from Palestinian Islamists.

Their objection is essentially theological in that the entire territory from the Mediterranean to the River Jordan should be under Islamic rule with no land being ceded.

One state

A one-state solution is based on the premise that it is highly unlikely that today's 400,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank will leave voluntarily or be evacuated forcibly.

Those on the Israeli far-left regard such a unitary state as being a state of all its citizens.

However critics on the Israeli side point out that within a few years the number of Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza and the number of Arab citizens of Israel itself will have reached parity with the number of Jews in Israel and in the West Bank.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Decades of on-off peace talks have failed to reach a final settlement

Given that the Arab birth-rate is higher than the Jewish one, if voters vote according to their ethnic origin, then this means the end of Jewish self-determination in their own nation state.

Some on the Israeli far-right favour either a full or partial annexation of the West Bank while restricting democratic rights for the Palestinians.

Meanwhile, an interim solution of a bi-national state would see both national groups working constructively within the same state, but one which offers protection for their political and legal rights and preserves their national identity.

Nationalism however has proved to be a powerful force in recent times with the disintegration of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia into individual nation-states - and some have argued that while a one-state solution is logical in a theoretical sense, the national enmity between Israelis and Palestinians would produce an unworkable entity.

Three-state confederation

The idea of a confederation between Israel, Palestine (West Bank/Gaza) and Jordan has been debated ever since 1948.

A former Israeli foreign minister, Abba Eban, vigorously promoted a Benelux-style economic union solution. The Israeli Labour government after the Six Day War adopted variations of a solution known as the Allon Plan, which effectively partitioned the West Bank between Israel and Jordan with remaining territory under local Palestinian autonomy.

However, it was the rise of a Palestinian national identity in the 1970s which scuppered this idea in favour of a Palestinian state. Ever since, both Jordan and Egypt have shown little enthusiasm for reassuming responsibility for the West Bank and Gaza.

Autonomy

Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin proposed the idea of administrative autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza shortly after coming to power in 1977.

Self-rule for the Palestinians meant that Israel would be responsible for security and foreign policy while ideologically retaining a claim to Judea and Samaria (West Bank).

While limited autonomy was granted under the Oslo peace accords, it was probably viewed by both sides as an interim solution. The demise of the peace process has frozen any further progress.

The eventual shape of a final settlement has therefore yet to be determined.

A musician and pop singer who later became a priest has died of brain cancer.

The Reverend Peter Skellern had a hit single in 1972 with the piano ballad, You're A Lady.

The 69-year-old composer, who lived in Cornwall, was ordained after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour last year.

He died on Friday morning. His family paid tribute to his "legacy of love and laughter".

Image copyright Cornwall Live Image caption Mr Skellern (left) was ordained by the Bishop of Truro in October

Rev Skellern, who was born in Bury, Greater Manchester, and trained at the Guildhall School of Music, began recording in the 1970s and released 14 albums.

He also wrote the lyrics to One More Kiss, Dear for the 1982 film Blade Runner.

He hosted the BBC Two chat show Private Lives and in recent years, turned his attention to choral music, often appearing on Songs of Praise.

In October the Bishop of Truro, the Right Reverend Tim Thornton, ordained him at St Wyllows church in Lanteglos-by-Fowey, Cornwall.

Image caption The musician recorded 14 albums

In a statement, his family said: "Peter's creativity in art, comedy and music stand as his legacy to love and laughter.

"The love he brought to us will continue to be shared with everyone through his music. We will miss him with all our hearts."

Bishop Thornton said he would be praying for Mr Skellern and his family.

"It really is very, very sad," he said. "Although we knew Peter was ill, the news that he had died came as a shock.

"I can only reflect on what a privilege it was to have known Peter, and to have ordained him."A Storyville documentary: Moving and inspiring account of university professor’s sight loss, his rebirth and renewal. Available with audio description or a heightened soundtrack.

This BAFTA-nominated film is a moving and inspiring account of loss, rebirth and renewal - and the discovery of 'a world beyond sight'. In 1983, after decades of steady deterioration, John Hull, a professor at the University of Birmingham, became totally blind. To help him make sense of the upheaval in his life, he began documenting his experiences on audio cassette. Over three years he recorded over sixteen hours of material.

This beautifully crafted documentary takes John's original recordings as the template for the film, incorporating lip-syncing by actors in evocative reconstructions. The technique allows the viewer to immerse themselves in John's world as he comes to terms with his deteriorating sight, and learns to experience the world in different ways. As John explains about his redemptive journey: "I knew that if I didn't understand blindness, it would destroy me."

This heightened soundtrack was produced by one of Europe’s leading sound designers, Joakim Sundström, who has created a rich, immersive soundtrack calibrated specifically for blind audiences. This track uses enhanced sound design and additional audio from the characters in the film to guide the audience through the story. Instead of a narration-led model (as in the standard AD track) this approach aims to create a rewarding and complete audio experience that is immersed in the dramatic world of the film.

An audio described version read by Stephen Mangan is also available and aims to provide blind and partially sighted audiences with an alternative to the standard AD track.To play this programme you need to enable JavaScript.

The US will be "unwavering" in its support for Nato, vice-president Mike Pence told European leaders at the Munich Security Conference.

In the first major foreign policy address for the Trump administration, Mr Pence said the US would "stand with Europe today and every day".

But he told the gathered leaders that European countries were "failing to pay their fair share" on defence.

That failure "erodes the foundation of our alliance", he said.

The vice-president pointed out that apart from the US, only four Nato countries had met a 2014 commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence.

"The time has come to do more," he said.

President Donald Trump warned before taking office that the US might not uphold its commitment to come to the defence of Nato allies who were not perceived to have contributed enough financially.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Angela Merkel addressed the conference directly before Mike Pence

Watching the speech was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who spoke before Mr Pence. Germany is among the nations yet to meet the 2% target.

Nato estimates for 2016 show that only the US, UK, Greece, Poland and Estonia do so.

Media caption Mike Pence: "With regard to Ukraine...we must hold Russia accountable"

Mr Pence went on to say that the US would "continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found".

Mr Pence said Russia must honour a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, aimed at ending violence in eastern Ukraine.

His comments came amid huge controversy in the US over ties between the Trump administration and Russia, and concern in Europe over whether the new administration would attempt to restrain Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Speaking before Mr Pence, Ms Merkel called for increased co-operation between the US and the European Union on issues including Russian aggression and Islamist terror.

The two leaders were scheduled to meet face to face later in the day.

A dig at Trump - Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent

Speaking before Mr Pence, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the question now facing the trans-Atlantic community was whether "we will be able to act in concert or fall back into parochial politics" - a subtle but clear dig at Mr Trump's mantra of "America First".

Asked directly what she thought about the Trump administration's rhetorical onslaught against sections of the media, Ms Merkel insisted that freedom of the press was a pillar of democracy.

When Mr Pence took to the stage he stressed that he was bringing a message of reassurance from the new president, who would "unwaveringly" back America's Nato allies.

But he also used the opportunity to repeat Mr Trump's long-held view that Washington's European allies must spend more on their own defence.Image copyright Getty Images

Retail sales slipped back unexpectedly in January, following on from December's dip.

Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), showed retail sales volumes dropped by 0.3% compared with the previous month, well below the 0.9% rise expected.

The ONS said the data indicated the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013.

It said evidence suggested higher fuel and food prices were key factors.

Compared with January 2016, sales were up 1.5%, the weakest performance since November 2013.

Figures earlier this week from the ONS showed inflation rose to its highest level in two and a half years at a time when wage growth was slowing down.

Fuel prices jumped 16.1% in January, the biggest changed since September 2011.

Wary

Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said: "In the three months to January 2017, retail sales saw the first signs of a fall in the underlying trend since December 2013.

"We have seen falls in month-on-month seasonally adjusted retail sales, both in conventional stores and online, and the evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown."

Analysts said consumers were becoming wary of spending at a time when employment and earnings growth was slowing and inflation rising.

Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said consumers were starting to "crumble" in the face of inflation pressure.

Ruth Gregory, from Capital Economics, said: "January's surprise fall in the official measure of retail sales volumes has brought the recent run of resilient economic news to an abrupt end. And the rest of the year is shaping up to be tough on the high street, given the expected squeeze on consumers' real pay growth."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Canada and the US share the longest international border between two countries

The Canada-US border has become a fault line for Canadian fears surrounding the new US administration.

The uncertainty comes as Parliament considers a preclearance security bill that could give US border agents new powers and the Liberal government comes under pressure to reconsider an asylum pact with the US.

The US has made it clear secure borders are a top priority and while President Donald Trump has set his sights on Mexico and the Middle East, Canadians are still feeling a chill.

Pollster Nik Nanos, whose firm tracks Canadian attitudes towards the international boundary, said sentiment about the border is driven by two things - political rhetoric in the US and people's actual experiences at border crossings.

Both factors are driving anxiety as the new US administration begins to put its plans into practice.

Canadians took some 20 million trips to the United States in 2015 and report they are mostly well treated by US border and customs agents.

Media caption 'I lost all my fingers': Asylum seekers make dangerous border crossing

But amid reports of border agents seizing and searching mobile devices, of people being questioned and turned away at the border and schools cancelling trips south, they are concerned about what Mr Trump's policies might mean for cross-border travel.

Mr Nanos said that even the "informal influence" of the president can have an impact on border crossings.

"The president does not have to pass an executive order to thicken the border. Trump has said he considers the border a sieve and if you're a border security person you're going to take that signal," he said.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is expected to raise how travellers are being treated with his US counterpart, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, when they meet soon.

"Our expectation - on both sides of the border - is that travellers be treated with respect, and in accordance with the rule of law," said Mr Goodale's spokesman.

Meanwhile, the Trudeau government is trying to reassure people about Bill C-23, preclearance legislation currently before Parliament that is part of a bilateral agreement with the US. The US Congress passed its own version of the bill in December.

The US immigration preclearance operations have had in Canada for decades - an example of the deep co-operation between the two countries on border matters. The system allows travellers to conveniently pass through American customs sites set up in Canada and for the US to vet people before they set foot on US soil.

But lawyers are concerned about the powers Bill C-23, which will supersede the existing agreement, would give US border agents operating in Canada.

Toronto-based immigration lawyer Howard Greenberg says he worries the legislation contains provisions that might hinder the legal rights and freedoms of Canadian citizens.

Among the red flags Mr Greenberg sees in the bill are provisions that would allow American customs officials to detain and question people, to perform body searches on travellers, and to require people who wanted to withdraw from pre-clearance interviews to give a reason.

Currently a traveller has the right to leave the preclearance area with no consequence.

"You head for the curb, take a taxi home," said Mr Greenberg.

It would also allow US border agents to carry firearms and "restraint devices" at preclearance sites.

Image copyright AP

Public safety officials note that preclearance officers cannot place anyone under arrest, that they must operate in accordance with Canadian law, and that no right or power is conferred on border officers of one country and not the other.

They also say that allowing border agents to question people withdrawing from a preclearance area is necessary to avoid illicit "probing" of those sites by those who may be trying to detect weak points or deficiencies.

But Mr Greenberg says the bill, which still has time to be amended, needs to do more to clarify the rights of Canadians on Canadian soil, especially when a US administration talks about "extreme vetting" of migrants and refugees.

Ottawa is also under growing pressure to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement amid increasing numbers of refugee claimants crossing illegally into Canada in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia.

That pact with the US states that refugee claimants are required to request protection in the first safe country they arrive in - a policy meant to better manage refugee claims and to avoid so-called "asylum shopping" between countries.

But it is also driving asylum seekers to make the illegal crossing to avoid being turned back to the US at official ports of entry.

More than 200 Canadian lawyers recently sent a letter calling on the Trudeau government to suspend the pact following Mr Trump's election.

Representatives from the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic also wrote to the Liberal government this month asking for them to consider the "enforcement and implementation" of the STCA.

So far, the federal government is standing behind the agreement, which came into effect in 2004, saying the conditions of the agreement continue to be met.Hidden in plain sight, just minutes away from the bustle of New Delhi’s commercial hub, Connaught Place, is an ancient landmark unknown even to most locals.

Agrasen ki baoli is a 14th-century stepwell (known as baoli or baori), a unique architectural idea that was medieval India’s ingenious answer to perennial water shortage. By creating enormous wells deep below ground, accessed by steps going down as far as 30m, these sophisticated water reservoirs tapped into difficult-to-reach underground water tables, providing a year-round water supply to locals.

As I stood at the top of the 104 steps descending into the depths of the Earth at Agrasen ki baoli, I could see the high-rise city buildings in the backdrop, their white facades presenting a stunning contrast to the russet bricks disappearing into the dark. The steps were enclosed on three sides by tall walls decorated with arches, niches and passageways, none of it giving any idea of what lay underground.

American art historian and archaeologist Victoria Lautman, author of the upcoming book The Vanishing Stepwells of India, described the sensory overload of her first descent into a stepwell: “The contrasts were so pronounced, all my senses were activated: bright light became murky dark, intense heat became cool surrounding air, and the incessant din above-ground became hushed – the deeper I went the more everything transformed.”

While stepwells are largely to be found in the arid north and west of India, they are not unique to those regions. In the country’s south, they take on the form of temple tanks (locally known as kalyani or pushkarani), which fulfilled essentially the same function.

India’s oldest stepwell is believed to date to 600 CE, although most of those still standing were built after the 10th Century. Stepwells proliferated in public areas in towns as well as along important trade routes, and were open for use by the entire community. As such, over time they became a social hub for travellers and for women, who would come to fetch water each day, with fine architectural and design elements incorporated into the basic structure: think graceful arches, handsome pillars and ornate carvings.

Divay Gupta, a leading conservation architect and head of the Architectural Heritage Division of INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage), described them as “magnificent in their conception, their architecture and ornamentation, no less so than the temples and palaces of their times.”

One of the grandest, the Unesco-listed Rani ki vav (vav is the local word in the west Indian state of Gujarat), was built in the 11th Century by the queen Udayamati as a gift to her people. On a cool winter morning, I explored five levels of this massive stepwell with guide Bhupendra Jadeja. Rani ki vav originally goes seven floors down, but the bottom two are currently closed to visitors due to recent earthquakes.

As I took in the exquisite statues lining the walls and supporting pillars, Jadeja shared an interesting use for these places. When women from all over the area congregated at the well, they would exchange gossip about their lives and livelihoods, which was picked up and passed on to the king by his informers: an easy and efficient intelligence network.

Many stepwells, as is to be expected in India, have legends of love and valour associated with them. The most tragic of these is around the Adalaj ni vav near the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat. The story goes that in 1499 the kingdom was conquered by the Muslim ruler Mohammed Begda, who killed the Hindu king Rana Veer Sinh and fell in love with his beautiful widow Rani Rudabai. Rani Rudabai demanded that Begda complete the work on the stepwell begun by her husband in return for her hand in marriage.

And so Adalaj ni vav took shape, a work of love expressed through its amalgamation of Hindu-Islamic styles, with intricate carvings and statues reaching five levels into the ground. When the vav was proudly presented to the loyal queen, she inspected it and then drowned herself in the waters.

Although echoes of the story have faded with time – with even many locals unaware of the site’s rich history – Adalaj remains one of the most beautiful stepwells in the region.

Just 100 years ago, there were close to 3,000 of these fascinating reservoirs scattered across water-scarce regions of India. However, as a result of diminishing underground water tables, due to a growing population, and the movement towards private water sources such as taps and tanks, stepwells have fallen into disuse. British rulers also deemed stepwells unhygienic and breeding grounds for disease, filling them up with mud or sealing them off from the public.

Today, many of the remaining ancient stepwells are neglected and dilapidated; some even used as rubbish dumps. In many cases, entire communities are unaware of the existence of an old stepwell in their area or simply do not consider them significant in any way.

As Bharatbhai, the tea-seller near Rani ki Vav told me with a dismissive wave of his hand, “Yes, many tourists come here these days, but the vav is all toota-phoota (broken), so I can’t really understand it.”

However, despite all the dereliction, some of the better-preserved stepwells are starting to become tourist attractions. And justly so. For these examples of beautiful architecture, as well as of clever and sophisticated engineering, could be relevant again today, with India regularly facing the spectre of drought over the past few decades.

“[Stepwells] could still be relevant in storing water, which is becoming very scarce and also in improving ground water table,” Gupta told me.

Perhaps, there is still a future for the ancient baoli.

A North Korean national has been arrested over the killing of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother, Malaysian police say.

The first North Korean to be arrested over Kim Jong-nam's death was named as Ri Jong Chol, 46.

An Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and a woman with a Vietnamese passport were detained earlier.

Police believe poison was sprayed into Mr Kim's face as he waited to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau.

Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi formally confirmed on Thursday that the dead man, who was travelling under the name Kim Chol, was Kim Jong-nam.

Police say the latest suspect was detained on Friday evening in Selangor, near the Malaysian capital. No further details were given.

One of the detained women, an Indonesian national named as Siti Aisyah, is said to have told Malaysian police she had been paid to perform what she thought was a prank.

A Malaysian man thought to be her boyfriend was detained along with her.

The woman carrying a Vietnamese passport has been identified as Doan Thi Huong.

Image copyright REX/Shutterstock Image caption This CCTV image has been broadcast by South Korean and Malaysian media

Kim is believed to have been attacked in the airport departure hall on Monday by two women, using some form of chemical.

A grainy image taken from security camera footage, which has been broadcast in South Korea and Malaysia, shows a woman wearing a white T-shirt with the letters "LOL" written on the front.

It is not clear whether either of the detained women is the woman in the footage, and police say they are still looking for "a few" other suspects.

Police have now finished Kim Jong-nam's post-mortem examination, though the results have not yet been made public.

North Korea has said it will reject the result of the autopsy.

It has demanded that Malaysia immediately release the body. Malaysia is refusing to do so until it receives a DNA sample from Mr Kim's next-of-kin.

South Korea's intelligence agency has accused the country's rivals in the north of assassinating Kim Jong-nam, saying Pyongyang had wanted to kill him for years but that he was being protected by China.

Despite widespread speculation that North Korea was behind the killing, there has been no proof. Pyongyang has made no public comments on the issue.

Kim was largely estranged from his family, after being passed over for the North Korean leadership in favour of his youngest half-brother. He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore.

He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities.

But he had said he was not interested in assuming the leadership himself.Видео

Albanian families would go to a camp, find a family and then take them home. These weren’t relatives or friends, they were strangers, but the Albanians would take them in, feed them, clothe them, treat them as if they were part of the family.”

Nursing a macchiato in a small cafe in Berat, Albania’s famed city of 1,001 windows, I listened as Nevila Muka remembered the effects the Kosovo War had on her home country. In order to escape the death and devastation brought by Serbian military forces in the 1990s, more than 500,000 refugees, mostly ethnic Albanians, fled from Kosovo to seek sanctuary in Albania over the course of just two years. I quickly learned that Muka hadn’t just observed the mass exodus from a distance.

“My grandmother actually took in a family. I was young, so I remember playing with their kids a lot. I remember they were really good bakers, they made the best bread I’ve ever tasted.”

It’s the Albanian way. It’s besa.

“Didn’t that ever get difficult?” I asked.

“Not really for us, we were okay. But for many families it was a struggle, a lot of them didn’t have the money to support the Kosovars. Many people went into debt doing it, but they would never turn anyone away.”

When I asked her why, she shrugged.

“It’s the Albanian way. It’s besa.”

I had heard the word besa before, and knew that it meant something akin to belief, trust or faith, but I hadn’t heard it in this context before. Muka explained that it’s like a code for Albanians, one that dictates their generous hospitality. If someone comes to you looking for help, you give them a place to stay. It’s that simple.

After our discussion, I was fascinated by the concept of besa and wanted to learn more, so I contacted Orgest Beqiri, an Albanian university student and history buff I had met during my time in the country. I knew that if anyone knew more detail about besa, it would be him.

When we met, he explained that the tradition has been passed down for centuries as part of the Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini, a set of customary laws created in the 15th Century to govern the tribes of northern Albania. Though the Kanun is often considered to be the original source of besa, many argue that the tradition is in fact even older and that the Kanun merely put words to the tribal traditions that had existed long before.

“There’s an old proverb written in the Kanun,” he said. “‘Shpija para se me qenë e Shqiptarit, asht e Zotit dhe e mikut’, which means ‘Before the house belongs to the owner, it first belongs to God and the guest.’ It’s a strong tradition, and in the older times, if you were a traveller or seeking refuge, you could knock on the door of the first house you found and ask ‘Head of the house, do you want guests?’ and the owner would have to take you in. The Kanun says that the master of the house should always have a spare bed ready at any time of day or night, in case a guest arrives unexpectedly.”

“So it was a duty, then?” I asked him. “Even if you didn’t want to host someone, you were bound by besa to do it?”

“Not exactly. Yes it’s a duty, but honestly most Albanians really enjoy hosting guests. It’s a point of pride for them. In fact, there’s an old story about a town in the north somewhere that rebelled when a hotel was going to be built there. All the people went to the town hall and complained, saying people who needed a place to stay could just come and knock on their doors.”

Although some of the more rigid aspects of besa have lost their hold over the passing of time, this general sense of duty and hospitality has endured in the Albanian people. Even though the Kosovo War was certainly the largest crisis that the country has ever had to deal with, it was neither the first nor the last.

Little known to most, Albania was one of a few European countries to emerge with a larger Jewish population by the end of WWII than at the start, saving nearly all of its original Jews while offering refuge to more than 2,000 others from surrounding countries. Despite pressure from Italian fascists and occupying Nazi soldiers, Albanians refused to yield their guests, as doing so would not only result in great shame but would bind the master of the house to “clean the blood”, meaning to take vengeance.

More recently, Albania has again found itself offering besa, this time to those travelling from the Middle East. Hundreds of Iranian exiles are currently residing within the country after having been relocated from Camp Liberty in Iraq. Albanian prime minister Edi Rama has also expressed an intent to aid Syrian refugees, provided a collaborative agreement is reached with other European nations, saying that Albania will not ignore its duty.

Despite all these heroic instances, unassuming Albania remains unrecognized for its great services to the huddled masses of the world. The truth remains that this Balkan nation is small and poor, and as such, it hardly receives international attention for its exploits. Yet, at a time when refugees are being turned away at borders all over the world, it seems that there is a lot to learn from Albania’s penchant for hospitality.

I later shared this sentiment with Muka, long after our first discussion about the Kosovars that her family took in.

“It’s a shame most of it’s unknown. Albania is so under the radar that most of these things happened without anyone giving a second glance,” I said.

She smiled knowingly, nodding her head.

Beijing needs to do more to rein in North Korea: that's the view of US President Donald Trump and his new team. But how much leverage does China really have there and what are the chances of it being used, asks the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing.

China and North Korea seem to be heading into yet another tense period in their recently rocky relationship.

Once brothers-in-arms fighting against "imperialist aggression" during the Korean War, now Beijing accuses Pyongyang publicly of breaching United Nations sanctions in the pursuit of its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

And the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam - the half brother of North Korea's brutal leader - is being seen as a fresh point of tension between these official allies.

In fact, some view it as direct slap in the face for China.

It appears Mr Kim was murdered in Kuala Lumpur airport, on his way back to Macau, by female killers using of some type of poison.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Kim Jong-nam died at Kuala Lumpur airport as he prepared to board a flight

Kim Jong-nam spent much of the past decade in a type of self-imposed exile inside the former Portuguese colony. There he was seen to have the protection of China.

The eldest son of North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il, he said time and again that he had no interest in becoming involved in his country's politics.

What's more, whenever he was cornered by reporters in the Asian casino city, with his shirt unbuttoned to number three and sporting a three-day growth, you could really believe him when he said it. After all, why would he want to?

There has been speculation that he operated some sort of North Korean sanction-busting slush fund out of Macau and that this was the reason that Beijing and Pyongyang tolerated his hedonistic life style.

But for China there was something else too. He was an ally inside the North Korean elite: somebody who thought the best way forward for his homeland was a Chinese-style opening up.

Substitute leader?

For years, China has been trying to promote this style of thinking with its isolated, impoverished neighbour.

Before he died, Kim Jong-il was shown around the prosperous Chinese city of Dalian. The message: "You too could have some of this at home with a bit of opening up!"

But the Kim dynasty has appeared petrified by the prospect of such openness, and that Kim Jong-nam would side with the Chinese.

So despite his apparent lack of interest in political power, the fact that he could be seen hanging around down in Macau as a possible leader to be called on by Beijing in the event of regime collapse in Pyongyang made him a threat to the paranoid figure in power there today.

If this was a political assassination, then most North Korea observers think the order came right from the top.

This will not go down well with the government of Xi Jinping in Beijing. In recent days the two countries' relationship has become even more murky.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported that China turned back a $1m (£800,000) coal shipment from North Korea.

China has long been criticised for turning a blind eye to North Korean coal exports, in violation of UN sanctions, but maybe not this time.

In the wake of last weekend's North Korean ballistic missile test, 16,295 tonnes of its coal were denied entry to Wenzhou Port in Zhejiang Province.

You see the sequence of events: Sunday 12 February missile test, next morning an ally of China is murdered, later that afternoon Beijing criticises the test, two days later the coal shipment is turned back. What's next?

When asked about the death of Kim Jong-nam, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said his government had "seen the media reports" and that that they were "following the developments". I'll bet they are.

At a social function run by the Chinese military recently, I was speaking to a Chinese officer about the US demand that they do more to bring pressure on North Korea.

He shrugged his shoulders. He said they didn't know what the North Koreans would do next and that they had no idea what China could do to change their minds.

Yet by far and away the vast majority of trade in and out of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), as the country prefers to be called, is with China. If you take Chinese trade out of the equation there's not much left.

So why would Beijing put up with all this? Why put up with the waves of instability flowing out of Korean peninsula?

The answer is US troops.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption US and South Korean marines recently conducted a joint military exercise

It's often said that a meltdown in North Korea could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China but, even if this did happen, it would likely only be a temporary problem.

No. The real fear is that a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with American soldiers based in a country with a land border with China.

Beijing will not let that happen and Pyongyang's current ruler, Kim Jong-un, knows it.

So no matter how many times North Korea drives its powerful protector to distraction, in the end, Beijing believes it doesn't have much choice but to put up with its weirdness, with its basket-case economy, with its erratic behaviour and probably also with its pursuit of nuclear weapons.Image copyright Getty Images

The authorities at a national park in India protect the wildlife by shooting suspected poachers dead. But has the war against poaching gone too far?

Kaziranga National Park is an incredible story of conservation success.

There were just a handful of Indian one-horned rhinoceros left when the park was set up a century ago in Assam, in India's far east. Now there are more than 2,400 - two-thirds of the entire world population.

This is where David Attenborough's team came to film for Planet Earth II. William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, came here last year.

But the way the park protects the animals is controversial. Its rangers have been given the kind of powers to shoot and kill normally only conferred on armed forces policing civil unrest.

Media caption Entire villages are being destroyed to make way for extended national parks

At one stage the park rangers were killing an average of two people every month - more than 20 people a year. Indeed, in 2015 more people were shot dead by park guards than rhinos were killed by poachers.

Innocent villagers, mostly tribal people, have been caught up in the conflict.

Rhinos need protection. Rhino horn can fetch very high prices in Vietnam and China where it is sold as a miracle cure for everything from cancer to erectile dysfunction. Street vendors charge as much as $6,000 for 100g - making it considerably more expensive than gold.

Indian rhinos have smaller horns than those of African rhinos, but reportedly they are marketed as being far more potent.

But how far should we go to protect these endangered animals?

I ask two guards what they were told to do if they encountered poachers in the park.

"The instruction is whenever you see the poachers or hunters, we should start our guns and hunt them," Avdesh explains without hesitation.

"You shoot them?" I ask.

"Yah, yah. Fully ordered to shoot them. Whenever you see the poachers or any people during night-time we are ordered to shoot them."

Avdesh says he has shot at people twice in the four years he has been a guard, but has never killed anybody. He knows, however, there are unlikely to be any consequences for him if he did.

The government has granted the guards at Kaziranga extraordinary powers that give them considerable protection against prosecution if they shoot and kill people in the park.

Critics say guards like Avdesh and Jibeshwar are effectively being told to carry out "extrajudicial executions".

Getting figures for how many people are killed in the park is surprisingly difficult.

"We don't keep each and every account," says a senior official in India's Forest Department, which oversees the country's national parks.

Image caption Guards like Avdesh and Jibeshwar have considerable powers

The director of the park, Dr Satyendra Singh, is based at the park's impressive colonial-era headquarters.

He talks about the difficulties of tackling poachers in the park, explaining that the poaching gangs recruit local people to help them get into the park but that the actual "shooters" - the men who kill the rhinos - tend to come from neighbouring states.

He says the term "shoot-on-sight" does not accurately describe how he orders the forest rangers to deal with suspected poachers.

"First we warn them - who are you? But if they resort to firing we have to kill them. First we try to arrest them, so that we get the information, what are the linkages, who are others in the gang?"

Dr Singh reveals that just in the past three years, 50 poachers have been killed. He says it reflects how many people in the local community have been lured into the trade as rhino horn prices have risen. As many as 300 locals are involved in poaching, he believes.

For the people who live around Kaziranga the rising death toll has become a major issue.

Kaziranga is densely populated, like the rest of India. Many of the communities here are tribal groups that have lived in or alongside the forest for centuries, collecting firewood as well as herbs and other plants from it. They say increasing numbers of innocent villagers are being shot.

In one of the villages that borders the park live Kachu Kealing and his wife. Their son, Goanburah, was shot by forest guards in December 2013.

The only picture they have of him is a fuzzy reproduction of the young man's face.

Media caption Kaziranga National Park in India is home to rhinos, elephants and tigers

Goanburah had been looking after the family's two cows. His father believes they strayed into the park and his son - who had severe learning difficulties - went in to try and find them. It is an easy mistake to make. There are no fences or signs marking the edge of the park, it just merges seamlessly into the surrounding countryside and fields.

The park authorities say guards shot Goanburah inside the forest reserve when he did not respond to a warning.

"He could barely do up his own trousers or his shoes," his father says, "everyone knew him in the area because he was so disabled."

Kachu Kealing does not believe there is any action he can take now, especially given the unusual protection park guards have from prosecution. "I haven't filed a court case. I'm a poor man, I can't afford to take them on."

Image caption Kachu Kealing says his disabled son was only looking after the family's cows

Conservation efforts in India tend to focus on protecting a few emblematic species. The fight to preserve them is stacked high with patriotic sentiment. Rhinos and tigers have become potent national symbols.

Add to this the fact that Kaziranga is the region's principal tourist attraction - its 170,000 or more annual visitors spend good money here - and it is easy to see why the park feels political pressure to tackle its poaching problem head on.

In 2013, when the number of rhinos killed by poachers more than doubled to 27, local politicians demanded action. The then head of the park was happy to oblige.

MK Yadava wrote a report which detailed his strategy for tackling poaching in Kaziranga. He proposed there should be no unauthorised entry whatsoever. Anyone found within the park, he said, "must obey or be killed".

"Kill the unwanted," should be the guiding principle for the guards, he recommended.

He explained his belief that environmental crimes, including poaching, are more serious that murder. "They erode," he said, "the very root of existence of all civilizations on this earth silently."

And he backed up his tough words with action, putting this uncompromising doctrine into practice in the park.

The numbers of people killed rose dramatically. From 2013 to 2014 the number of alleged poachers shot dead in the park leapt from five to 22. In 2015 Kaziranga killed more people in the park than poachers killed rhinos - 23 people lost their lives compared to just 17 rhinos.

And, as the park's battle against poaching gathered in intensity, there were to be other casualties.

In July last year, seven-year-old Akash Orang was making his way home along the main track through the village, which borders the park.

His voice falters as he recounts what happened next. "I was coming back from the shop. The forest guards were shouting, 'Rhinoceros! Rhinoceros!'" He pauses. "Then they suddenly shot me."

The gunshot blasted away most of the calf muscle on his right leg. The injuries were so serious he had to be rushed to Assam's main hospital five hours away.

He was there for five months and had dozens of operations but, despite the hospital's efforts, Akash can still barely walk.

His father, Dilip Orang, bends down and removes the bandage from the boy's leg to display the wound. His leg appears to be stripped of its skin - the calf muscle is bunched into tight ball. It doesn't flex. "They took the muscle from here and grafted it here," he says. "But it hasn't worked very well. Just look at it."

Image caption Akash has not fully recovered and has to be carried to the shop by his brother

It is clear just how terrible his injuries are when Akash gets up to move out of the sun. He can barely limp the few feet into the shade. His older brother now has to carry him to the local shop.

"He has changed," Dilip says. "He used to be cheerful. He isn't any more. In the night he wakes up in pain and cries for his mother."

The park admits it made a terrible mistake. It paid all his medical expenses and gave the family almost 200,000 rupees ($3,000; £2,400) in compensation. Not much given the scale of Akash's injuries, says his father, who worries whether his son will ever make a living.

The crippling of Akash led to a huge outcry from villagers. It was the culmination of long-simmering disquiet over the mounting death toll in the park. Hundreds marched on the park headquarters.

In a house a short walk from the park HQ, human rights campaigner Pranab Doley, himself a member of a local tribe, pulls out a bag stuffed with paperwork. He has made a series of requests under India's Right to Information Act and says the replies show that many cases aren't followed up properly.

"In most cases you don't have things like the magisterial inquiry, the forensic report, the post mortem reports," he says, rifling through the stacks of paper.

The park says that it's not responsible for investigating the killings, and whatever action it does take follows the law. Even so, some of Mr Doley's documents reveal a surprising lack of information. He pulls out a table listing deaths in one of the park's four districts. It shows nine suspected poachers killed in one year, six of whom are recorded as unidentified.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have visited the park

And there are other indications that careful investigation is not a priority when it comes to wildlife crime in Assam. The park says that in the last three years just two people have been prosecuted for poaching - a striking contrast to the 50 people who were shot dead in the park in the same period.

The park justifies the number of deaths, saying the figures are so high because the heavily armed poaching gangs engage guards in deadly shoot-outs. However, the statistics indicate that these "encounters" are more one-sided than the park suggests. Once again, firm figures are hard to come by, but according to the reports we can find just one park guard has been killed by poachers in the past 20 years, compared with 106 people shot dead by guards over the same period.

Mr Doley argues the high number of deaths is because, at least in part, of the legal protection the park and its guards enjoy. "This kind of impunity is dangerous," he says. "It is creating animosity between the park and people living in the periphery of the park."

That animosity is deepened because so many of the local community are tribal people who claim they and their ancient way of life are - like the animals the park is trying to protect - also endangered.

Their cause has been taken up by Survival International, a London-based charity. It argues that the rights of tribal people around the park are being sacrificed in the name of wildlife protection.

"The park is being run with utmost brutality," says Sophie Grig, the lead campaigner. "There is no jury, there's no judge, there's no questioning. And the terrifying thing is that there are plans to roll [out] the shoot at sight policy across [the] whole of India."

Image caption Villagers are angry about evictions

Her strong language is testimony perhaps to the concern felt by activists like her that traditional communities might be sacrificed in the name of wildlife protection.

She says some of the biggest animal conservation charities in the world, including the World Wildlife Fund, have turned a blind eye to the activities of the park.

"WWF describes itself as a close partner of the Assam Forest Department," says Ms Grig. "They've been providing equipment and funds to the forest department. Survival has repeatedly asked them to speak out against this shoot-on-sight policy and extrajudicial executions which they have so far failed to do."

According to the WWF India website, it has funded combat and ambush training for Kaziranga's guards and has provided specialist equipment including night vision goggles for the park's anti-poaching effort.

"Nobody is comfortable with killing people," says Dr Dipankar Ghose, who helps run much of WWF's conservation programme in India. "What is needed is on the ground protection. The poaching has to stop."

The bulk of WWF's funding comes from individual donations. So how would the WWF's donors feel about the organisation's involvement with a park facing allegations of killing, maiming and torturing? Dr Ghose does not answer the question directly.

"Well, as I said, we are working towards it. We want the whole thing to reduce - we don't want poaching to happen, and the idea is to reduce it involving all our partners. It is not just the Kaziranga authorities but also the enforcement agencies, also the local people. So I think the main thing is to work with the local people."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The park is popular with both Indian and foreign visitors

And there are plenty of conservationists that accept that, in some circumstances, there must be a tough response to poachers. "No park would exist in India without having regular anti-poaching operations," says naturalist and writer Valmik Thapar. "Anti-poaching is an essential element of conservation."

"There are some that do it well. There are some that fail miserably… and they don't have any tigers. So there are some tiger reserves in India, that actually don't have any tigers at all because they have all been poached.

"In some exceptional cases you can use the gun against the gun, but in other places in India you need to use community intelligence, because the local community are the eyes and ears of the forest."

Three months after Akash was shot and villagers marched on park headquarters once again - this time to protest allegations of torture.

Mono Bora was sitting at a roadside cafe when he was picked up by forest guards. He claims he was punched in the face repeatedly as he was driven to park headquarters. Once inside the offices the questioning became even more violent.

"They gave me electric shocks here on my knees, and here on my elbows. And here on my groin too." Mr Bora describes how he was tied in a stress position to bamboo staves.

Image caption Village leader Biren Koch believes innocent people have been targted

"They kept on hitting me," he says. The ordeal lasted for three hours until finally his assailants became convinced they had the wrong man.

Kaziranga confirmed it did bring Mono Bora in for questioning but categorically denies any harm came to him, adding that it "never uses electric shock during interrogation".

The chief of Mono Bora's village picked him up from the park headquarters. Biren Kotch says he did not believe Mr Bora had any involvement in poaching. "How can they justify torture?"

But it isn't just the anti-poaching effort that threatens local people. Big wild animals like tigers and rhinos need lots of space.

To accommodate them India is planning a massive expansion of its network of national of parks. It is great news for conservation, but the plans involve relocating 900 villages. More than 200,000 people will have to leave their homes, it is estimated.

Kaziranga will double in size and an eviction order has been issued. State police recently evicted two villages amid chaotic scenes in which stone-throwing villagers were beaten with batons and fired on by police. Two people - a father of two and a young female student - were killed.

Image caption Sophia Khatum’s husband was shot dead by police in the demonstration against the evictions

Diggers were brought in and the national park provided a team of elephants to help raze every home to the ground.

In the wreckage of the village critics might see more evidence of a brutal approach to conservation. The problem is the park's tactics appear to have worked. Since the crackdown in the park began in 2013 the numbers of rhinos poached has fallen back. Last year just 18 rhinos were killed.

But the important question is what the long term cost will be, says Pranab Doley, the tribal rights campaigner. He believes the park's behaviour betrays a misguided attitude to conservation. "That's what their policy and philosophy is - move the people out of here and create pure pristine forest."

He says the park is on a collision course with local tribal people. If it gets its way, he says, it will destroy the ancient culture of tribal people like him, but could also end up frustrating its own efforts to protect its animals.

"Without the people taking care of the forest, no forest department will be able to protect Kaziranga. It's the human shield which is protecting Kaziranga."

Of course, there's no arguing that endangered species must be protected and preserved, but the costs on the human community need to be taken into account too.

A North Korean national has been arrested over the killing of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother, Malaysian police say.

The first North Korean to be arrested over Kim Jong-nam's death was named as Ri Jong Chol, 46.

An Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and a woman with a Vietnamese passport were detained earlier.

Police believe poison was sprayed into Mr Kim's face as he waited to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau.

Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi formally confirmed on Thursday that the dead man, who was travelling under the name Kim Chol, was Kim Jong-nam.

Police say the latest suspect was detained on Friday evening in Selangor, near the Malaysian capital. No further details were given.

One of the detained women, an Indonesian national named as Siti Aisyah, is said to have told Malaysian police she had been paid to perform what she thought was a prank.

A Malaysian man thought to be her boyfriend was detained along with her.

The woman carrying a Vietnamese passport has been identified as Doan Thi Huong.

Kim is believed to have been attacked in the airport departure hall on Monday by two women, using some form of chemical.

A grainy image taken from security camera footage, which has been broadcast in South Korea and Malaysia, shows a woman wearing a white T-shirt with the letters "LOL" written on the front.

It is not clear whether either of the detained women is the woman in the footage, and police say they are still looking for "a few" other suspects.

Police have now finished Kim Jong-nam's post-mortem examination, though the results have not yet been made public.

North Korea has said it will reject the result of the autopsy.

It has demanded that Malaysia immediately release the body. Malaysia is refusing to do so until it receives a DNA sample from Mr Kim's next-of-kin.

South Korea's intelligence agency has accused the country's rivals in the north of assassinating Kim Jong-nam, saying Pyongyang had wanted to kill him for years but that he was being protected by China.

Despite widespread speculation that North Korea was behind the killing, there has been no proof. Pyongyang has made no public comments on the issue.

Kim was largely estranged from his family, after being passed over for the North Korean leadership in favour of his youngest half-brother. He spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore.

He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities.

But he had said he was not interested in assuming the leadership himself.Lego's launched a "safe" social network for under-13s on a new app, called Lego Life.

Basically it's a child-friendly Lego-themed Instagram.

It'll let children post photos of their creations and comment on other people's but with strict restrictions on what they can say.

Text comments aren't allowed but users can either use prewritten responses or custom Lego emoji and stickers.

Although it's aimed at children, who have to use a parent's details to sign up, there is no restriction on adults also joining the network.

To keep kids safe, they won't be asked for any personal information or photographs and the app doesn't have tracking enabled.

Instead, avatars are Lego mini-figures and account names are random words.

The company says the app is heavily moderated through automated filters and employees filtering content.

The app also offers building challenges to try to encourage creativity.

All the adverts on the network are for Lego products.

Lego hopes in future the app will expand to become a central hub for all its services, including games and instructions.

This meeting of Nato defence ministers is the first formal alliance get-together since the arrival of the Trump administration in Washington. Mr Trump's initial suggestion that Nato was in some sense "obsolete", along with his stated desire to do deals with Moscow, set alarm bells ringing in many capitals, where Russia is seen as a re-emerging strategic threat.

Many in Europe see elements in the Trump administration as having an in-built antipathy towards multilateral institutions. There were also fears about certain officials' closeness to Moscow - a worry that the US might seek a strategic dialogue with Russia over Europeans' heads. Accordingly, the resignation of the president's controversial National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will not prompt many tears in Europe.

America's European allies will, though, at least to some extent, have been reassured by the subsequent noises that have come out of Washington. But they will want to hear direct reassurance from Gen James Mattis - Mr Trump's new defence secretary - that the alliance retains its centrality in US security thinking.

They will also want confirmed that all of the steps that the Obama administration took to reinforce deterrence in Europe - the deployment of additional combat brigades and an intensive series of exercises - will continue under the new man in the White House.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Poland is one of just five Nato members to meet spending the spending benchmark in 2016

Of course Gen Mattis will come with some messages of his own. President Trump - indeed the US Congress - wants to see the European allies shoulder more of the cost of their own defence.

Washington has shown that it is willing to stump up troops and equipment, but while collective Nato expenditure is rising, too many Nato governments have been sluggish in bringing their expenditure up to the agreed target of 2% of GDP. According to the latest Nato figures only five allies, Estonia, Greece, Poland, the UK and the United States met or exceeded the 2% benchmark in 2016.

The demand from Washington that its allies spend more on their collective defence has been a consistent one over recent years. As a former Nato commander, Gen Mattis knows the alliance well and he has heard all of the excuses before. He will deliver the familiar message with more punch and with a clear implication that this time the US administration expects to see prompt action.

Gen Mattis also wants to see Nato become more agile and better at decision-making especially at times of crisis. Washington wants to see the alliance playing a greater role in international efforts to defeat terror and to help prop up failing states.

This is a difficult area which causes divisions among the alliance's European members as much as between European capitals and Washington. Iraq - where Nato has already agreed to conduct a small amount of training - could become a test case.

The Americans are already thinking about what will happen after Mosul is fully re-captured. As the situation on the ground transitions from all-out war-fighting, there will be a continuing need to build Iraqi capabilities. Here there are lots of things that the US believes Nato countries could do - training for border patrolling, instituting defence reforms and so on. So far the response among allies to the small-scale effort in Iraq has been, shall we say, limited.

As far as Washington is concerned, Nato countries don't just need to spend more - they need to significantly enhance their capabilities and be relevant to the sort of real-world tasks in which the US wants its partners to be engaged.

Nato's response to a more assertive Russia is all very well but it threatens to open up fissures between northern and eastern allies, on the one hand, who directly face Russia's modernising forces and countries on Nato's Mediterranean flank, on the other, who confront a very different set of challenges.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The alliance is faced with a more militarily assertive Russia

As the paroxysms in Syria and Libya have shown, the migrant or refugee crisis has repercussions throughout the Middle East and much of Europe.

At this meeting, Nato ministers want to apply a small corrective to enhance the focus on threats from the south. It's a modest start - a small command hub at the joint forces headquarters in Naples whose job will be to explore what Nato can contribute to dealing with the complex security challenges on its southern flank.

But as well as a demand for a more dynamic Nato agenda the US is eager to reassure its allies. A senior US Congressional delegation is visiting the Nato headquarters this week. The Nato meeting is followed by Europe's premier annual security event - the Munich conference - after which the US vice-president himself will also be stopping by at Nato.

It is all something of a curtain-raiser for the US president's own first visit to the alliance which will take place in late May. That looks set to be a fairly brief event - little more than a lunch - in Nato's brand new headquarters building, which inconveniently will not be finished in time for the summit.

By then it is hoped that Mr Trump will have fully made his peace with Nato. If not, a reduced scale summit in an unfinished building holds risks as well as opportunities. The headline writers could have a field day.

The hope is that this Nato ministerial meeting will set the course for more harmonious relations between the alliance and its most important, albeit mercurial member.BBC's Travel Show brings you the latest insider travel news, a wealth of destinations, amazing experiences and features and practical hints, tips and advice for your holidays.

Ask about change in Saudi Arabia.

The reply used to be: it will come, in its own way and in its own time, in the conservative kingdom.

It was another way of saying it would take a long time - and might never happen.

But, in Saudi Arabia now, talk of change is measured in months.

"I made a bet with a male colleague that the ban on women driving would end in the first six months of this year, and he said it would happen in the second half," a successful Saudi businesswoman says to me over lunch in the capital, Riyadh.

"But now I think it will happen early next year, and apply only to women over 40," she adds.

Media caption Rocking out, Saudi-style

That's a prediction you hear in Riyadh's royal circles too. Some even say younger women will be allowed to drive before too long.

Change on every front is still slow and cautious in a culture where ultra-conservative religious authorities wield great influence, and many Saudis want to hold on to their old ways of living.

But an accelerating pace is largely being forced on Saudi rulers and society by a dramatic change in fortune for the world's biggest oil producer.

"Whether we get there in 2030, whether we get some of them in 2025, some of them in 2030, some of them in 2035, we'll see," he explains in a nod to a master plan with demanding benchmarks for every ministry.

Saudi editor and writer Khaled Maeena points to a new accountability starting to emerge.

"Everybody is on the go, ministers bureaucrats and all, looking over their shoulders not to make mistakes," he says.

Those at the top, he adds, must "lead by example".

Salaries and lavish perks have been slashed in government jobs. The private sector is expected to provide one of the big engines for growth. It's still not up to speed.

"We're not hiring now," asserts a Saudi business executive who oversees a vast conglomerate of companies. "And we're not selling to the government unless we're sure we'll get paid for our goods."

"Vision 2030 is unlikely to reach its destination in 2030," a sceptical Saudi statistician replies when I ask for his view. Like most Saudis who criticise, he asks not to use his name.

"But at least there is a vision, and this time there are practicalities about how to achieve it," he adds, in a reference to previous schemes which never went anywhere.

"This is la la land," was the even more scathing assessment of another consultant. "Is there a bureaucracy able to implement it and a readiness at the top to change their own lives?"

The young deputy crown prince driving this plan, who is seen as the favourite son of 81-year-old King Salman, knows there's another clock fuelling pressure for change.

Two-thirds of Saudis are his age or younger.

Hundreds of thousands of them, men and women, were educated at the best western universities thanks to a generous scholarship programme started by the former King Abdullah.

Now they're back, looking for work but also ways to spend their weekends in an austere culture where even cinemas are banned,

Under the rules, men can only sit with women if they are dining with their female relatives, or "families" as that section is known.

But even since my last visit about a year ago, small but significant steps are visible.

Gone from the streets of the capital are the notorious religious police, the Mutawa, who used to roam in a mission to "prevent vice and promote virtue" and were often accused of zealously abusing their powers. The deputy crown prince is credited with sorting this out.

Wealthy Riyadh residents speak excitedly of newly opened restaurants where seating arrangements are less strict and music blares loudly.

"We need to see women drivers and cinemas here," insists Waleed al-Saedan when we meet at one of the few public places where the speed of life truly picks up.

"Dune bashing" in the desert provides one of the few legal thrills as Saudis rev the engines of sand buggies and SUVs to careen down the soft slopes of sand.

As is so often the case here, it's usually a men-only adventure.

But a new General Entertainment Authority is on the case. Despite its stern title, the people who run it are on a mission to bring some fun to Saudi lives, albeit within limits. No one is suggesting drinking and dancing.

"My mission is to make people happy," asserts the authority's chairman Ahmed al-Khatib, whose own serious demeanour is quickly brightened by a smile.

A calendar of some 80 events ranging from art festivals to light shows and live music concerts is carefully prepared and implemented to avoid any backlash which could put the whole project at risk.

"We will definitely provide things for the more open people and we will provide activities and things for the more conservative people," Mr al-Khatib explains, choosing his words carefully.

Opening up more social freedoms isn't just about providing more fun.

"Seventy billion riyals are being spent by Saudis on holidays abroad," laments a Saudi tour operator who is trying to tempt Saudis to spend more of their time and money at home instead of fleeing to the bright lights of Dubai or London.

More profound changes like political reform, tackling a questionable human rights record, or easing a web of restrictions on women's lives aren't on the agenda.

And at the same time as happiness is on the agenda, so is pain.

This is a country where people have always lived with cheap petrol, without taxes, and free water and electricity.

Now subsidies are being cut and a sales tax introduced. A new "Citizen's Account" will help lighten the burden for poorer families, but Saudis are having to juggle their own finances now.

"Saudis have taken too much for granted for too long," insists Nadia al-Hazza, an engineer who used to worked in the oil and gas sector who is now helping to get women involved in Vision 2030.

She starts her presentations with a famous mantra from former US President John F Kennedy: "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."

So now Saudis are also being asked to do more, and faster, than they've ever been used to.

"We're like a turtle on wheels," says political observer Hassan Yassin. "We're moving in a faster way to try to meet local demands and 21st Century obligations."Hong Kong doesn’t need much introduction as a business hub. Trading has always been this city’s lifeblood, from its days as a British-controlled free port to its growth as a global financial hub.

Hong Kong benefits from a strategic location between Japan, China and southeast Asia, which has made it a global travel hub, with just over 70 million air passengers in 2016.

With one of the world’s highest concentrations of banking institutions (71 of the world’s 100 largest banks operate out of there) Hong Kong attracts business travellers from all over the world. In the first quarter of 2016, some 314,000 visitors to the territory came for meetings, conventions and exhibitions.

Hong Kong has one of the world’s highest concentrations of banking institutions

While banking is still a big part of the city, business travellers of a different stripe are being drawn to an emerging industry in the SAR: the art market.

With Art Basel and other fairs, along with auction houses and an expanding roster of blue-chip art galleries, Hong Kong accounts for a growing chunk of the world’s art market and those who travel to scour it. Based on the value of its auction sales, it is the third-largest art market in the world, after London and New York.

“Money talks,” says Hong Kong-based management consultant Daryl Chan, and if people in Hong Kong can find a business opportunity in something, they will take advantage of it. The ingredients behind the art boom are the same ones that made Hong Kong a global commercial centre in the first place.

“It’s the practicalities of doing business here which makes it easy,” says Chan. Low taxes, easy business registration, a pool of international talent and strong rule of law draw companies to Hong Kong, whether they are in the business of selling paintings or software.

Getting in and around

Air travel consultancy Skytrax has consistently ranked Hong Kong’s international airport among the best in the world since it opened in 1998, and the Lord Norman Foster-designed terminal remains a breath of fresh air after a long flight. Frequent visitors can sign up to use the Immigration Department’s eChannel, which cuts time spent at passport control to just a couple of minutes. Once you’re past customs, the Airport Express whisks you to Hong Kong Island in 24 minutes for HK$90 ($12) – about a third of the price of a taxi.

Once you’re in town, a rechargeable Octopus card gives you access to the frequent, reliable and inexpensive MTR subway system. Taxis are also affordable, with a HK$22 ($2.80) flagfall that includes 1.5km of travel before the meter starts ticking upwards.

Cultural considerations

Before setting foot in Hong Kong, remember you’re going to a Special Administrative Region of China – not mainland China itself. Hong Kong’s British colonial legacy has left it with a different language, currency, legal system and culture than mainland China

Never stick your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice

While English is prevalent and Mandarin is increasingly common in the business world, Cantonese is Hong Kong’s lingua franca. Ng goi is probably the most useful word you can learn: it can be used to mean “please,” “excuse me” and “thank you” in different contexts.

While Hong Kong is distinct, there is plenty of cultural overlap with the mainland, especially when it comes to the concept of saving face. The worst thing you can do is make your partner or client feel belittled. Concessions, even symbolic ones, are essential to maintaining a good relationship that saves everyone face.

Food is another place where foreign visitors risk a misstep. Business dinners at Chinese restaurants usually involve shared dishes. Courtesy is paramount: make sure to fill your dining companion’s cups with tea or water before filling your own, and don’t take the last piece of food on a dish. Never stick your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice as this resembles the joss sticks used at a funeral.

Money matters

A surging property market has made Hong Kong one of the most expensive cities in the world, so if you stick to the main business districts, expect eye-watering prices for everything from a cup of coffee to a steak dinner – a report by business-to-business sourcing service Expert Market pegs the average daily cost of a business trip at US$523, compared to $478 in Singapore and $442 in New York.

If you stick to the main business districts, expect eye-watering prices for everything

Many places accept Visa and MasterCard, but not often American Express, and many smaller businesses are cash-only. Automatic teller machines are plentiful around the city, including those for major international institutions like HSBC and Citibank.

Tipping is not customary, though many diners do leave a token gratuity at upscale restaurants. In many restaurants and bars, a 10% service charge is automatically added to the bill.

Where to stay

Hong Kong’s hotel scene was once dominated by big-name brands with opulent but somewhat stodgy interiors, but the industry has been shaken up by punchier new boutique offerings in the past few years.

“The old iconic hotels are updating their interiors and overall offerings because of new independent players in town fighting for the tourist dollar,” says architect JJ Acuna, design principal of JJA/Bespoke Architecture.

Most business travellers stick to the main commercial districts of Central and Wan Chai, where a stable of opulent five-star properties like the Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons and Grand Hyatt compete with sleek newcomers such as Upper House and Mira Moon.

An entirely new crop of neighbourhoods now appeal to business visitor

High rents are increasingly pushing Hong Kong businesses further afield, though, which means an entirely new crop of neighbourhoods now appeal to business visitors. In Quarry Bay, Hotel East is close to the office towers of Taikoo Place and the up-and-coming business district of Kowloon East, while the Ritz-Carlton and W Hotel, located above an Airport Express station, are convenient options for both the International Commerce Centre and Central.

Dining alone

Hong Kong has always been a paradise for food lovers, with acclaimed restaurants at all price points – the 2017 Michelin guide includes 61 starred restaurants, among them famous dim sum chain Tim Ho Wan, where a hearty meal for one costs no more than HK$100 ($13).

Restaurants are packed every night with groups of friends and solo diners alike

The average Hong Kong apartment is just 40 sq m (431 sq ft) in size, so restaurants are packed every night with groups of friends and solo diners alike. There is an abundance of quick and casual neighbourhood restaurants, which serve satisfying bowls of wonton noodles or dishes of Cantonese roast meat and rice for less than HK$45. Try Kau Kee’s curry brisket noodles in Central or, a short walk from there, Yat Lok’s barbecued pork.

In recent years, Hong Kong has seen a boom in casual, yet refined, restaurants helmed by ambitious chefs. At Fish School, David Lai—who trained under famed French chef Alain Ducasse—delivers modern dishes made with local seafood, while up-and-comer May Chow offers a cosmopolitan take on Shanghainese flavours at buzzing gastropub Second Draft.

Off the clock

Business travellers to Hong Kong have always been spoilt for choice when it comes to off-hour activities, whether that means hitting the beach, drinking in one of the city’s many bar districts, hitting the trails in the 440sq km of protected country parks – or some combination of all three.

But Hong Kong’s culture boom has added even more diversions to the mix. International galleries like White Cube, Gagosian and Ben Brown Fine Arts regularly bring big-name artists to town, while local non-profit institutions like Para Site and Spring Workshop are havens for thought-provoking exhibitions.

They will soon be joined by some big new players. Tai Kwun, a contemporary art centre housed in a 19th Century prison compound, will open later this year with 15,000sq m of exhibition space in mysterious black boxes designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron.

Mark Zuckerberg has revealed deep-seated concerns that the tide is turning against globalisation.

In an interview with the BBC, the Facebook founder said that fake news, polarised views and "filter bubbles" were damaging "common understanding".

He said people had been left behind by global growth, sparking demands to "withdraw" from the "connected world".

In a call to action, he said people must not "sit around and be upset", but act to build "social infrastructures".

"When I started Facebook, the mission of connecting the world was not controversial," he told me.

"It was as if it was a default assumption that people had; every year the world got more connected and that seems like the direction things were heading in.

"Now that vision is becoming more controversial."

Losing hope

He told the BBC: "There are people around the world that feel left behind by globalisation and the rapid changes that have happened, and there are movements as a result to withdraw from some of that global connection."

Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Anti-globalisation protests, such as this one in the Philippines, have broken out across the world.

Mr Zuckerberg's interview comes alongside the publication of a 5,500-word letter he has written about the future of Facebook and the global economy.

In it Mr Zuckerberg quotes Abraham Lincoln who spoke of acting "in concert", and talks about "spiritual needs", civic engagement and says that many people have "lost hope for the future".

"For a couple of decades, may be longer, people have really sold this idea that as the world comes together everything is going to get better," he said.

Facebook AI 'will identify terrorists'

"I think the reality is that over the long term that will be true, and there are pieces of infrastructure that we can build to make sure that a global community works for everyone.

"But I do think there are some ways in which this idea of globalisation didn't take into account some of the challenges it was going to create for people, and now I think some of what you see is a reaction to that.

"If people are asking the question, is the direction for humanity to come together more or not? I think that answer is clearly yes.

"But we have to make sure the global community works for everyone. It is not just automatically going to happen.

"All these different kinds of institutions, whether they are governments, or non-profits, or companies, need to do their part in building this infrastructure to empower people so that it creates opportunities for everyone, not just some people.

"If you are upset about the direction things are going in, I hope you don't just sit around and be upset, but you feel urgent about building the long term infrastructure that needs to get built," Mr Zuckerberg said.

Global challenges

I asked him whether he felt President Trump agreed with his view that "bringing people together" and "connecting the world" would lead to greater progress.

Mr Zuckerberg did not, famously, attend the round-table of technology leaders hosted by the new president.

"I don't think I am going to speak to that directly," he answered carefully. "You can talk to him, you can look at what he has said to get a sense of that.

"The thing that I will say is that a lot of folks will look at this through the lens of one or two events, and I really do think this is a broader trend.

"I have been talking about this for a long time, since before recent elections both across Europe and Asia and the US.

"A lot of today's biggest opportunities will come from bringing people together - whether that is spreading prosperity or freedom, or accelerating science, or promoting peace and understanding."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The charitable foundation set up by Mr Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan is giving billions of dollars to charity.

Mr Zuckerberg said: "A lot of challenges we face today are also entirely global - fighting climate change or ending terrorism, or ending pandemics, or when a civil war in one country leads to a refugee crisis across different continents.

"These are inherently global things and require a different level of infrastructure than we've had historically."

Political ambitions?

Would you like to meet President Trump? I asked.

"I would like that not be the focus of this. I don't really have much comment on that. It somewhat detracts from the focus of what we are trying to do here."

There has been speculation that Mr Zuckerberg could be contemplating a political career, and even suggestions that he will run for US president in 2020 - rumours he has flatly denied.

I said the political tone of the manifesto would do little to dampen speculation about where he sees himself longer term.

Could he imagine himself going into politics? "I am not doing that now, it's not the plan," he said. "The thing I really care about is connecting the world."

Facebook has been attacked for not doing enough to tackle "fake news" - untrue stories which claimed, for example, that the Pope backed Mr Trump - which have appeared prominently on its news feeds.

In Germany, there has been controversy after a Green MP was quoted in a Facebook post defending an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who had raped and murdered a German student.

The MP, Renate Kuenast, had never said what was attributed to her by a right-wing extremist organisation.

Ms Kuenast said she found it hard to accept that "Zuckerberg earns billions, shows off with all his charitable donations, and at the same time allows Facebook to become a tool of extremists".

Mr Zuckerberg said he understood the importance of tackling fake news.

Freedom of opinion

"Accuracy of information is very important," he said in the 5,500-word letter, published on Thursday. "We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook.

"We've made progress fighting hoaxes the way we fight spam, but we have more work to do.

"We are proceeding carefully because there is not always a clear line between hoaxes, satire and opinion."

But Mr Zuckerberg added: "In a free society, it's important that people have the power to share their opinion, even if others think they're wrong.

"Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information, including that fact checkers dispute an item's accuracy."

He told me that "polarisation and sensationalism" also undermined "common understanding".

And he admitted that social media - which deals in short, often aggressive, messages - had been part of the problem.

"In some places [it] could over simplify important and complex topics and may push us to have over simplified opinions of them," Mr Zuckerberg said.

"And I think it is our responsibility to amplify the good effects and mitigate the negative ones so we can create a community that has a common understanding

"There is a lot of research that shows we have the best discourse when we connect as whole people rather than just opinions.

"If I get to know you on the values that we have in common or even the interests that we share it is a lot easier to have a debate about something that we disagree about productively than if we just meet and go head to head on something without understanding our common humanity."

'Setting an example'

Some may argue there is a question of legitimacy here, that no one voted for Mark Zuckerberg and question his right to outline - and attempt to execute - a vision of the world.

And what about those controversies over taxes paid, or privacy, or vast profits in an age when inequality is as much a factor behind the present dim view of many in the political and business establishment as any perceived failures of globalisation.

"There are a lot of areas that I know we need to improve and I appreciate the criticism and feedback and hope we can continue to do better on them," Mr Zuckerberg said, pointing out that he is donating 99% of his Facebook shares - worth £36bn ($45bn) - to the charitable foundation he runs with his wife, Priscilla Chan.

"Being a good corporate citizen is really important," he said. "We operate in a lot of different countries all around the world.

"We need to be help build those communities and that is what I am trying to do in my personal philanthropy - setting an example hopefully for other entrepreneurs who will build things in the future for how you should give back to the community and to the world.

"I care deeply about all of this, and it is a work in progress."On Graham's sofa are Tom Hiddleston, Ruth Wilson, Ricky Gervais, Daniel Radcliffe and Joshua McGuire. Plus music from Tinie Tempah.

“It was a rite of passage for Hungarian youth,” he said. “Once we got to Poland we would hitchhike around and stay with locals; we’d just need to hold out a small Hungarian flag on the side of the road and we’d be picked up.”

“Why did the flag help?” I asked once.

“The two countries have always been friendly, there’s even an old proverb about it: ‘Lengyel, magyar két jó barát, együtt harcol s issza borát.’ In English, it means ‘Hungarians and Poles are two brothers, they fight together and they drink together’,” my father replied.

Although I had heard tales like this all my life, it still came as a surprise when I learned that the friendship between the people of Hungary and Poland is no small matter. In fact, it’s so remarkable that it is celebrated with an official holiday.

In 2007, the respective parliaments of both countries declared 23 March as ‘The Day of Polish-Hungarian Friendship’ by unanimous decree. I found it both endearing and unusual that, in a world of global tensions and conflict, two countries that do not even share a border would set aside a day solely to appreciate their camaraderie.

Curious to learn what makes the bond between these countries so special, I sought out Professor Gábor Lagzi, a historian and Polonist at the University of Pannonia in Veszprém, Hungary.

“The friendship between Hungary and Poland is a phenomenon,” Lagzi explained. “It is like two oak trees that grow separately, but their roots are fused, grown together in the soil. We are connected by nearly 1,000 years of intense political, economic, and cultural relations.”

The precise beginnings of the connection are difficult to identify, but Lagzi notes a history of shared monarchs from the Middle Ages as a significant factor.

In the 14th Century, the Hungarian king Louis the Great inherited the Polish throne after his maternal uncle, the Polish king Casimir III, died without an heir. Louis the Great ruled both countries separately at different points in his life. After his death, his daughter Jadwiga became the first queen of Poland, and remains a respected figure to this day.

In 1576, another Hungarian held the Polish throne – this time by choice – when the people of Poland elected Transylvanian prince István Bathóry as their ruler.

But royalty wasn’t all the two countries shared.

“One of the peaks of Polish-Hungarian friendship came in the Spring of Nations in 1848,” Lagzi explained. “Almost everyone has heard of the liberation hero Józef Bem, a Polish general who fought bravely alongside the Hungarians in the struggle for independence from the Austrian Empire. In Hungary, we often call him Bem Apó, which is a term of endearment meaning something like ‘Grandpa Bem’.”

Having fought in both the Polish uprisings against the Russian Empire in 1830 and in the Hungarian uprising against the Austrian Empire in 1848, Bem became regarded as a national hero in both countries, even though he was Polish in origin. According to Lagzi, the slogan ‘For our freedom and yours’ caught on in Poland at this time, reflecting the fact that many Polish war heroes travelled to take part in liberation struggles across the globe.

Though an intertwined group of monarchs and national heroes certainly strengthened the relationship between Hungary and Poland, it’s true that ties between countries were often solidified through marriage in the Middle Ages, and it wasn’t unheard of for allied countries to be joined in battles.

I asked Lagzi what exactly makes the Hungarian-Polish relationship different from any other alliance. He pointed to World War II, a time when the friendship endured despite the two countries finding themselves on opposing sides: Hungary affiliated with the Axis and Poland on the side of the Allies.

“One of the most beautiful moments in our relationship was the acceptance of more than 100,000 Polish refugees after their country’s collapse in 1939. At that time, Hungary was in an alliance with Germany, remember, but it still proved to be a safe haven for Polish refugees.”

“Weren’t there any consequences for accepting the refugees?” I asked.

“The German authorities, mainly the German embassy workers in Budapest, were not happy,” Lagzi replied. “Still, many Polish refugees remained safe until the German occupation of Hungary. All Hungarian people, from aristocrats to commoners, felt a lot of sympathy for the Polish people.”

All Hungarian people, from aristocrats to commoners, felt a lot of sympathy for the Polish people.”

Though Hungary did order some deportations in the earlier years of the war, the situation did not escalate until after potential armistice discussions between Hungary and the Allies took place in 1944. Seeing the discussions as a betrayal, German forces began an aggressive occupation of the country in retaliation, and soon both Poles and Hungarians – specifically the Jewish and the Roma populations – faced execution or deportation to concentration camps.

After World War II ended, however, the people of Poland did not have long to wait before they could return the favour, according to Lagzi.

In 1956, protesters in Budapest gathered around a statue of none other than Bem to speak out against the domineering influence of the Soviet Union. The result was the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a bloody conflict that eventually led to a crushing defeat of the Hungarian rebels. The people of Poland quickly stepped in to provide aid to the beleaguered Hungarians. They sent munitions and supplies, and thousands of Polish citizens donated blood for the wounded. The gesture had such a profound and lasting impact that Hungarian parliament declared 2016 as the year of Hungarian-Polish Solidarity to commemorate the 60-year anniversary of the uprising.

But Lagzi was clear that these government declarations are not merely a whim of the political elite, but largely reflect the will and spirit of the greater population.

“The Hungarian and Polish parliaments declared 23 March the day of friendship without any votes opposed or abstentions,” he said, stressing that this was a highly unusual occurrence considering that there are usually deep political divides between Hungary and Poland’s political parties.

“A unanimous vote showed us that the Hungarian-Polish relationship is outside of, or even above, political agendas. It united the entire political elite in both countries.”

Now, Polish-Hungarian Friendship Day is celebrated annually, with the main festivities taking place in the sister cities of Győr (Hungary) in even years and Poznań (Poland) in odd years. It is an occasion for major politicians of the two countries to gather together, and festivities often include theatrical productions, film screenings and art exhibitions, all centred around the strong bond between the two nations.

But even with this new, more comprehensive understanding of the historical ties between the two countries, I felt that there was something missing from the equation, some unquantifiable factor that remained elusive.

Lagzi understood the sentiment all too well, admitting that the friendship did seem strange, especially from an outside perspective.

“We can look at the history for an explanation, but really I think it is something that cannot be explained logically. Somehow, we Hungarians just inherently love the Poles, and vice versa,” he said.

“The truth is,” he added, “that if asked about the relationship, almost every person in Poland and Hungary would say, ‘we are friends forever’.”

On Monday, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed in Malaysia. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Kuala Lumpur dissects a week of mystery and intrigue.

It's been almost a week since the mysterious death of a Korean man at Kuala Lumpur airport and there are still no real answers.

Initially, Malaysia refused to identify the dead man as Kim Jong-nam, saying just that the passport he had on him was under the name Kim Chol.

This despite South Korea's insistence that it was indeed him, killed on the orders of North Korea's brutal regime.

Malaysia finally confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that the dead man was indeed the half-brother of the North Korean leader.

Zahid Hamidi, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, told reporters: "I think he carries two different identities. Probably this [passport] is an undercover document."

Malaysia's cautious handling of this case has been evident from the start. The police have been sparing with their details, with official statements about arrests coming hours after they've already been widely reported.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Kim Jong-nam had openly criticised North Korea and called for it to open up

There have also been conflicting and often contradictory accounts from different divisions of the police - national and district - adding more confusion to the story.

But here's what we do know: three people have been arrested so far. Two women are amongst them.

Police say one is Indonesian while the other was carrying a Vietnamese passport.

A third suspect - a Malaysian man police say is the boyfriend of the Indonesian - has also been detained.

Police have detained the suspects for seven days for further questioning.

Still, nothing is known about how closely connected they are to the death of Kim Jong-nam, nor indeed why and exactly how he died.

Malaysian police have told me that the two women were both identified from CCTV camera footage captured at the scene of the alleged crime.

I went to the airport terminal where the attack happened to see for myself how it might be possible to get away with murder in broad daylight.

The facts in this case are murky to say the least. But based on police reports, this is what appears to have happened.

On Monday, Kim Jong-nam was about to board a flight. He is thought to have arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 February and was on his way back to Macau, where it is believed he lived.

But while he was at the airport, some police reports say at least one woman is thought to have accosted him, and covered his face with a cloth doused in some sort of burning or poisonous chemical.

He then went to the information counter and is thought to have asked for help. Subsequently it appears he was taken to the medical clinic in the airport from where he was sent to hospital, dying en route.

But when I spoke to staff at the airport who may have witnessed what happened, no-one was willing to talk to me. At least two people said they had been told by police and their bosses not to speak to the media or divulge any details of what happened.

So there's a lot we still don't know.

What kind of chemical was used in the apparent poisoning? How exactly did he die? The post-mortem examination of his body has been completed, but details have yet to be released to the public.

We also don't know what he was doing in Malaysia, although we understand that he did come here fairly frequently.

I tried to track some of Kim Jong-nam's old haunts in Kuala Lumpur, which led me to a Korean restaurant in the centre of town. At the restaurant, the mainly Bangladeshi and Burmese staff had no idea who Kim Jong-nam was.

But the owner of the restaurant is Korean, and he did speak to me. He refused to meet me in person though, choosing to speak to me on the phone. He also didn't want to be filmed or named because he was afraid of being linked to Mr Kim.

But he said Mr Kim was a regular customer at his restaurant, and that he would bring bodyguards with him.

In halting English, he told me Mr Kim often spoke to him and told him he feared for his life.

"Scared, yes," he told me. "He was sure scared, because Kim Jong-un planned to kill him since so far five years."

North Korea hasn't said anything about the death and it's highly unlikely it ever will.

All we have heard about what Pyongyang wants is from Malaysian officials, who have said they will turn the body over if a formal written request is made.

Instead, the focus in Pyongyang this week has been on the 75th anniversary celebrations of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il.

In North Korea's secretive regime, unanswered questions are a way of life.404 - Page Not Found

The seven officers were jailed for two years each over the 2014 assault, which was caught on camera.Arcade Fire is a Canadian indie rock band based in Montreal, Quebec,consisting of husband and wife Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, along with Win's younger brother William Butler, Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara. The band's current touring line-up also includes former core member Sarah Neufeld, frequent collaborator Owen Pallett, two additional percussionists, Diol Edmond and Tiwill Duprate, and saxophonists Matt Bauder and Stuart Bogie.

Founded in 2001 by friends and classmates Win Butler and Josh Deu, the band came to prominence in 2004 with the release of their critically acclaimed debut album Funeral. Their second studio album, Neon Bible, won them the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. Their third studio album, The Suburbs, was released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success. It received many accolades, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year, and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album. In 2013, Arcade Fire released their fourth album, Reflektor, and scored the feature film Her, for which band members William Butler and Owen Pallett were nominated in the Best Original Score category at the 86th Academy Awards. All four of their studio albums have received nominations for the Best Alternative Music Album Grammy; the band's work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for Neon Bible, in 2011 for The Suburbs and in 2014 for Reflektor, winning the award for The Suburbs.It's a year since the four members of Viola Beach and their manager died in a car crash in Sweden.

They were on their way back to the UK when their car crashed into a raised section of a bridge and fell into a canal.

In the last 12 months there's been a huge amount of support for a band who many had tipped for major success.

Here's what River Reeves, Jack Dakin, Kris Leonard, Tomas Lowe and Craig Tarry have achieved in that time.

'Success was a certainty'

Viola Beach formed in Warrington in May 2015 and had were supported by BBC Introducing from the very start.

They played on the BBC Introducing stage at Reading and Leeds Festival in the August of the same year.

Backstage at the festival singer Kris Leonard said: "I uploaded Swings & Waterslides and it was played within a day.

"The within a week it was on Radio 1, how quick everything's happened is just ridiculous."

Following the accident, tributes flowed in from the likes of Huw Stephens, Annie Mac and Rob Da Bank.

There were also due to play at the Introducing showcase at SXSW in Texas in March 2016.

Instead, a video montage containing clips of interviews and one of their BBC sessions was shown at the festival, with BBC 6 Music's Steve Lamacq paying tribute.

He said: "All the tipsters around the country and the major magazines, the DJs who played them like me and Radio 1's Huw Stephens - everyone genuinely believed that this was a band for whom success was a certainty."

They scored a top 20 single

Warning: Third party content, may contain ads

In the week after the deaths, fans started a campaign to get Swings & Waterslides to number one.

The band's single reached the top of the Apple iTunes chart but just missed out on the official top 10 - finishing at number 11.

The Kooks, The Coral and Blossoms played their songs

In April 2016, a Viola Beach memorial concert was held in the band's hometown Warrington.

The gig was made up of sets from the band's friends and musical influences, including sets by The Kooks, The Coral and Blossoms, who Viola Beach were on tour with when they died.

They were due to play the final date of their tour together in Liverpool's O2 Academy in March, but Blossoms paid their respects by having a DJ play Viola Beach's music from an empty stage to the sell-out crowd.

"I don't think any of us could prepare for something like that," Blossoms told Newsbeat at the memorial concert.

"It's unheard of in history - it's so devastating and shocking.

"You know they would have been having the time of their lives. It could have been us."

The evening was hosted by Radio 1's Phil Taggart.

He said: "In my lifetime I can't think of anything happening in the music industry as crippling and as sad as what happened to the boys in Viola Beach.

"You saw this really raw potential, it was at that point where they knew they were going to do something."

They 'headlined' Glastonbury

During their set on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury 2016 in June, Coldplay covered Viola Beach's Boys That Sing.

Frontman Chris Martin said: "We're going to create Viola Beach's alternative future for them and let them headline Glastonbury for a song.

"This is maybe what would have been you in 20 years.

"Let's give it our best shot fellas."

They got a number one album

Warning: Third party content may contain ads

A self-titled nine-track album, made up of recordings the band made before the incident, was released on 29 July 2016.

It was put together by the band's families and included Swings & Waterslides, Boys That Sing and a version of Get To Dancing which was recorded during a BBC session.

Warning: Third party content may contain ads

It outsold the number two album that week, ELO's All Over The World, The Very Best Of, by about 6,000 copies, according to the Official Chart Company.

Four weeks. Twenty-eight days. It feels like 280 days. I feel 280. If Donald Trump is exhausting even the news-hungry political journalists, I wonder what he is doing to the rest of the world.

For the first three weeks I started the day repeating a mantra, "watch what he does, not what he says." I've discarded that notion. What Mr Trump says and how he says it is an important part of his presidency. His rhetoric, both in person and Twitter, appeals to his supporters. It's new and fresh and irreverent. But one day it could also be his undoing. He is increasingly losing respect among key Republicans, and he needs them to govern effectively.

Media caption Trump's busy first month in 90 seconds

This is my fourth American administration and we've never seen anything like it for sheer non-stop drama. Lewinsky was a daily feast of slightly prudish titillation, but it was one story line, and in the end it was just sex. 9/11 was far more serious and scary, and the ramifications lasted far beyond that fateful morning. But in a way it was a more conventional (though nonetheless horrifying) story of geopolitics and ideology. We journalists knew how to cover them both.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John McCain has been a Republican critic of Trump

Sometimes now, I admit, I'm at a loss. There is so much to say and think, and even feel, about the Trump administration that I find myself curiously stuck for words.

What's the most important story here? Is the psychodrama of a president who is both fantastically confident and oddly insecure, who publicly lashes out those who offend him and rewards those who please him? Is it the hard right turn he plans for America? Is it Russia, the curious crush Donald Trump seems to have on Vladimir Putin and what that might mean for global security? Is it America's allies, floundering in the face of this unpredictability?Image copyright EPA

Waitrose, Iceland and Marks & Spencer have topped a Which? supermarket consumer satisfaction survey.

Shoppers gave Waitrose the award for best in-store experience, with Tesco and Asda trailing in eighth and ninth place respectively.

The consumer group said Iceland was voted best for online, closely followed by Ocado, with Morrisons in third.

The M&S Simply Food chain won the convenience store category. Which? surveyed more than 7,000 UK shoppers.

Customers were asked to rate stores and online operations based on their experience in the past six months on categories such as quality, value for money, service from delivery drivers, how easy it was to find products, and whether shoppers would recommend the retailer to a friend.

Which? said customers were particularly happy with Iceland's convenient delivery slots and friendly drivers, helping it to top the online category for the second year in a row.

The consumer group also said Waitrose's helpful staff had won over shoppers in the in-store survey, with customers saying that its spacious store layouts made groceries easy to find.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fresh products go a long way to satisfying shoppers, Which? said

M&S came second in the in-store category, with Aldi and Lidl placed joint third.

Which? said Aldi and Lidl were fairly "evenly matched", with both scoring particularly well on value for money.

Asda was at the bottom of the in-store table in ninth place, and was also joint last with Sainsbury's and Waitrose in the online rankings.

Analysis: Value, convenience and experience

Supermarkets do pay attention to the Which? survey, says Paul Martin, head of retail at consultancy firm KPMG. He believes there are three key conclusions to draw from the report.

"Number one, Waitrose winning is not a surprise." Shoppers are most interested in value, convenience and experience, and Waitrose is "very good at experience", he says.

Secondly, Iceland was best for online shopping because its website is user-friendly, customers don't have to trawl through thousands and thousands of products, and the delivery service is good.

And thirdly, "we still underestimate the power that Aldi and Lidl have". As well as competing on price, they are "trying to capture the middle-class shopper", says Mr Martin, who also co-chairs the Retail Think Tank.

Is Iceland now cool?

Must do better

While Asda was seen by consumers as being generally good value, its food quality was rated as average.

Richard Headland, Which? magazine editor, said: "With concerns over rising prices the competition among supermarkets is fiercer than ever.

"While value for money remains a top priority, in-store appearance and the availability of quality and fresh products can also go a long way to satisfying shoppers' need," he said.

An Asda spokeswoman said: "We know that we need to do a better job for our customers and all our colleagues are working hard to make a real difference.

"We're getting better every day and we are confident that customers will be pleasantly surprised if they shop with us today compared to when this survey took place last year - and we'll be even better tomorrow."

On Oscar night the winner of the award for Best Foreign Language film probably won't get much publicity - it seldom does.

Yet compared to only a few years ago the category is no longer a byword among Oscar voters for baffling obscurity.

And this year one of the films shortlisted is already lined up for a Hollywood remake.

Here's a look at this year's nominees:

LAND OF MINE

Image copyright Soda Pictures

Country: Denmark

Language: German with some Danish and English

Denmark's track record in this category: 11 nominations including 3 wins

Director: Martin Zandvleet

Story: Immediately after World War Two on Denmark's west coast, a group of teenage German soldiers are to clear some of the two million landmines which Germany deployed on beaches and along the shoreline to deter an Allied invasion. They are supervised by the Danish Sergeant Rasmussen who at first seems filled with violence.

Will it win? Voted Best Danish Film at last year's Danish film awards. It's well acted both by Roland Moller as the sergeant and by the young actors who play the Germans. When early on Rasmussen delivers a savage beating for no clear reason, we guess that the story will see him humanised by his contact with the soldiers he appears to despise. A couple of incidents late in the film seem there only for dramatic convenience and don't convince. The scenes of defusing mines are impressively tense and hard to watch.

A MAN CALLED OVE

Image copyright Music Box Films

Country: Sweden

Language: Swedish

Sweden's Track Record: 14 nominations including three wins (all for Ingmar Bergman)

Director: Hannes Holm

Story: Ove is a cranky old widower living alone. He expends a lot of energy trying to police the behaviour of his neighbours, who treat him warily. Ove's not pleased when the house opposite is taken by a new family: he finds it hard to accept the warm-hearted Parvaneh (who's Iranian) and her Swedish husband. Yet a relationship builds and in flashback we encounter the younger Ove, a man more open to life's possibilities who marries the beautiful Sonja.

Will it win? The film is attractively shot and Rolf Lassgard makes Ove sympathetic as an old man without totally sentimentalising him. Some of the humour is a bit clunky and the process of discovering Ove's latent nice guy within runs along predictable lines. But in the extensive flashbacks Filip Berg and Ida Engvoll make an attractive and likeable young couple which gives the film an unexpected sweetness.

THE SALESMAN

Image copyright Artificial Eye

Country: Iran

Language: Persian

Iran's track record: 2 nominations including a win for the same director in 2011

Director: Asghar Farhadi

Story: Emad and Rana are middle-class inhabitants of Tehran: he teaches but their joint passion is acting. After a tip-off from a fellow actor they find a new apartment. It seems a good move until they discover more about the previous occupant who left one room locked. As they work on a production of Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman, the couple's relationship becomes more tense. There is a violent incident and Emad becomes obsessed with revenge.

Will it win? It may be that no film can overtake the German nominee this year. But Farhadi has written a superbly tense and unsettling screenplay whose mastery of dread Alfred Hitchcock would have relished. The couple are superbly played by Taraneh Alidoosti and Shahab Hosseini. Previous winner Farhadi has indicated he will refuse to attend the Oscar ceremony in protest at President Trump trying to restrict Iranians entering the USA: could this create a sympathy vote for him? The most memorable of this year's films.

TANNA

Image copyright Yume Pictures

Country: Australia

Language: Nivhaal (The film was shot on location on Vanuatu.)

Australia's Track Record: First nomination in this category

Directors: Martin Butler and Bentley Dean

Story: On a Pacific island, Dain and Wawa live in a primitive village where life is virtually untouched by the modern world. The spirited young Selin watches as her sister Wawa is betrothed to a man outside the village - but Wawa wants to be with Dain. The lovers run away. Selin follows as the villagers set off to find her sister - and tragedy looms.

Will it win? The least mainstream of this year's nominees is exactly the kind of film the Academy hoped would benefit from reforming the voting system. It's a well-shot and mainly well-acted story filmed on a South Pacific island far from the usual movie-world support systems. The story, with its echo of Romeo and Juliet, is engrossing and in its early stages charming. Locations are attractive without resembling an ad for upmarket beach holidays. It won't take the Oscar but it's worth catching.

TONI ERDMANN

Image copyright Sony Pictures Classics

Country: Germany

Language: German, English and Romanian

Germany's track Record: 18 nominations (including one for East Germany) and a total of 3 wins

Director: Maren Ade

Story: Winfried (who adopts the name Toni) has a distant relationship with his daughter Ines, a business consultant working in Bucharest. He decides to leave Germany to pay her a visit, not wholly to her pleasure. Ines is climbing in her career and finds some of her eccentric father's activities a pain. But she tries to tolerate him and passes him off to colleagues as her life coach. A late scene suggests they have re-established some kind of family intimacy, but the question is left open.

Will it win? The film got a lot of attention at last year's Cannes Festival - often along the lines of 'Amazing - a German comedy!'. The fact that large sections are in English won't harm its chances and it's built up a head of steam which may well grab it the Oscar. The simple description comedy underplays the story's ambiguities and some audiences will be surprised that certain scenes are far from comic. The film's half an hour too long. A Hollywood remake has been announced, to star Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig. Could that incline Academy voters to back the original?

The Academy Awards are held on 26 February.

Donald Trump is exhausting the news-hungry journalists. What he is doing to the rest of the world?Hanjin Shipping used to be one of the world's top 10 shipping companies. But now, the final curtain has fallen.

This Friday, the firm was declared bankrupt by a South Korean court after months of uncertainty.

Hanjin's collapse is the largest to hit the shipping sector and it sent shockwaves through the industry.

What went wrong?

For years, the global economic downturn had affected profits across the cargo shipping industry. It led to overcapacity, lower freight rates and rising debt levels.

The question was not whether a big shipping line would go under, but which one would be first. The questionable honour eventually fell to Hanjin, at that time South Korea's biggest shipper and number seven in the world.

Crippled with $5.4bn (£4.1bn) in debt in August 2016, the company failed to get any more money from its creditors. Hanjin went into receivership and applied for court protection.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Hanjin was unprofitable for four of the last five years

There was still a chance for an investor or the government to come to the rescue yet it quickly became clear that any such hopes were futile.

"Stopping the credit line immediately results in an inability to purchase fuel, it immediately results in vessels not being able to go to port and it immediately results in all customers going to the competitors," explains Lars Jensen of Sea Intelligence Consulting.

What followed were long and painful months of sailors losing their jobs and investors losing their money.

No chance for a rescue?

With Hanjin's situation suddenly in limbo, its ships were stranded at sea. Most ports refused them entry, fearing they would not get paid for loading and unloading the cargo. Some ships were arrested while docking as debtors had issued warrants to get at least some of their money back.

Technically though, there still could have been a rescue - Hanjin needed to find an investor or convince the government to step in.

Image caption Many of Hanjin's assets have been sold off

"There was likely a window of some 24 to 48 hours after the announcement where Hanjin could have been saved, but after that it was simply a snowball effect and it was unrealistic to bring back the company," says Mr Jensen.

The chaotic demise of the company's operations did little to shore up confidence. So over the following months, many of the better assets got sold off - ranging from vessels to cargo terminals in the US to its Asia-US route operations.

The buyers were other global shipping companies that were able to cherry pick what they wanted. "All the good assets have been sold, the carcass has been thoroughly cleaned up," says Greg Knowler, a maritime trade specialist at IHS.

After Friday's official bankruptcy, the court handling the liquidation process will proceed to sell off the remaining assets and give the money to the creditors.

For the seamen, the collapse of their company meant that almost all of them lost their jobs. Hanjin's ships had been crewed with South Korean officers and engineers and an international mix of seamen hired through agencies.

Image copyright Moon Kwon-do Image caption Hanjin staff tried hard to lobby support for their cause

One of those now unemployed is captain Moon Kwon-do, who last year was stuck for months on the Hanjin Rome after it had been seized by creditors in the Singapore port.

"I will never sail again, I will abandon my life as a seaman," he says with bitterness and frustration.

Despite a lot of protests organised by unions, the government in Seoul did not step in to help. Yet there's doubt that saving Hanjin would have worked.

"If you're shipping cargo anywhere in the world - would you have gone with Hanjin after that?" asks Mr Knowler. The sudden suspension of all the company's vessels had led to supply chain disruptions around the world.

"I don't think it could have been saved," he concludes.

What now?

In fact, as dramatic as it was for Hanjin, for the rest of the industry the failure of one of the big players might have been a lucky break.

"This was a long time coming, it's what was widely needed," says Mr Knowler. "So from this perspective this was a good thing."

Hanjin's bankruptcy has a good chance of bringing global overcapacity in the sector down to a sustainable level.

"Everyone will be seen to have had a hard time in 2016," says Mr Jensen. Fellow shipping giant Maersk, for instance, earlier this month revealed a $1.9bn net loss for 2016 - just its second annual loss since World War Two.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Last year was tough for the whole industry, with Danish giant Maersk reporting a loss

"2016 was the bottom of the market, but the climb upwards towards a more balanced market will take two to three years to fully accomplish," says Mr Jensen.

Analysts agree that it is unlikely there will be another large carrier like Hanjin failing. South Korea is now left with Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) taking over as the country's biggest shipping company.

And while last year HMM was in as much financial trouble as Hanjin, the collapse of its fellow shipper means that it is now on a much safer footing, says Mr Knowler.

"There is absolutely zero chance that the Korean government will let another major shipping line - now their only major line - fail."Drama based on the kidnapping of Shannon Matthews. After the discovery of Shannon, her friends and the police attempt to discover the truth behind her disappearance.

The days of the three-hour, five-bottle City lunch appear to be well and truly over after Lloyd's of London introduced a booze ban.

The insurance market has told its 800 employees that they are not allowed to drink alcohol between 09:00 and 17:00.

Lloyd's said it had been considering the move for some time to bring it into line with "industry norms".

The ban applies to Lloyd's staff, not brokers and underwriters doing business in the historic insurance market.

But angry staff have called the new measures "heavy-handed".

Workers took to Lloyd's intranet to air their grievances, with one asking: "Will we be asked to go to bed earlier soon?"

According to the London Evening Standard, another asked: "Did I just wake up from my drunken induced slumber to find we are now living in Orwell's 1984?"

Media caption Last orders for "boozy lunches" in The City?

The boozy lunch had long been a staple of City life when deals were done and contacts made.

A spokesman for Lloyd's said: "There is no denying that it has traditionally been part and parcel of this type of business."

In an internal memo to staff, Lloyd's said an examination of grievance and disciplinary cases over the last two years found that about half were related to alcohol.

A Lloyd's spokesman said that the market had changed and that Lloyd's wanted to attract younger people to the industry.

He added that Lloyd's wanted to bring its employee guide into line with other companies, such as QBE, which advises staff not to drink as opposed to an outright ban.

He said that if someone was found to have broken the rule, their manager will decide on the best course of action to take.Sitcom. Andy tries to work up the nerve to confront Teresa about their child. Meanwhile, Errol butts heads with Bruce, and Sam contemplates motherhood.

An official watchdog in Germany has told parents to destroy a talking doll called Cayla because its smart technology can reveal personal data.

The warning was issued by the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur), which oversees telecommunications.

Researchers say hackers can use an unsecure bluetooth device embedded in the toy to listen and talk to the child playing with it.

But the UK Toy Retailers Association said Cayla "offers no special risk".

In a statement sent to the BBC, the TRA also said "there is no reason for alarm".

The Vivid Toy group, which distributes My Friend Cayla, has previously said that examples of hacking were isolated and carried out by specialists. However, it said the company would take the information on board as it was able to upgrade the app used with the doll.

But experts have warned that the problem has not been fixed.

The Cayla doll can respond to a user's question by accessing the internet. For example, if a child asks the doll "what is a little horse called?" the doll can reply "it's called a foal".

Media caption Rory Cellan-Jones sees how Cayla, a talking child's doll, can be hacked to say any number of offensive things.

A vulnerability in Cayla's software was first revealed in January 2015.

Complaints have been filed by US and EU consumer groups.

The EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Vera Jourova, told the BBC: "I'm worried about the impact of connected dolls on children's privacy and safety."

The Commission is investigating whether such smart dolls breach EU data protection safeguards.

In addition to those concerns, a hack allowing strangers to speak directly to children via the My Friend Cayla doll has been shown to be possible.

The TRA said "we would always expect parents to supervise their children at least intermittently".

It said the distributor Vivid had "restated that the toy is perfectly safe to own and use when following the user instructions".

Privacy laws

Under German law, it is illegal to sell or possess a banned surveillance device. A breach of that law can result in a jail term of up to two years, according to German media reports.

Germany has strict privacy laws to protect against surveillance. In the 20th Century Germans experienced abusive surveillance by the state - in Nazi Germany and communist East Germany.

The warning by Germany's Federal Network Agency came after student Stefan Hessel, from the University of Saarland, raised legal concerns about My Friend Cayla.

Mr Hessel, quoted by the German website Netzpolitik.org, said a bluetooth-enabled device could connect to Cayla's speaker and microphone system within a radius of 10m (33ft). He said an eavesdropper could even spy on someone playing with the doll "through several walls".

A spokesman for the federal agency told Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily that Cayla amounted to a "concealed transmitting device", illegal under an article in German telecoms law (in German).

"It doesn't matter what that object is - it could be an ashtray or fire alarm," he explained.

Manufacturer Genesis Toys has not yet commented on the German warning.Galeri Foto

Setelah 12 tahun tsunami menerjang 14 negara

A Church of England bishop has apologised after accidentally voting against a controversial report on homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

The Bishop of Coventry said he had pressed the wrong button - giving the impression "that there was not complete agreement in the House of Bishops".

The Rt Rev Christopher Cocksworth said the mistake had been a "moment of distraction and some confusion".

Overall, the church's ruling body voted not to take note of the report.

Last month, the House of Bishops had published an official report for the Church on sexuality, after three years of "shared conversations" with the LGBT community and other Christians.

It called for a "culture of welcome and support" for gay Christians.

But the report maintained the position that marriage in church should remain the lifelong union of a man and a woman, and services should not be held to bless same-sex relationships.

'Valuable road map'

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, who supported the report, concluded Wednesday's debate at the Church's ruling general synod by calling for a "radical new Christian inclusion".

Dr Cocksworth said he had apologised to his colleagues in the House of Bishops and to the archbishops for his mistake.

In a statement, he said: "Due to a moment of distraction and some confusion over the voting process, I pressed the wrong button on my handset, thus registering a vote against taking note rather than a vote for taking note of the report."

The House of Bishops voted overwhelmingly (43-1) in favour of the report - with Dr Cocksworth's vote the one against - and the House of Laity backed it by 106 votes to 83.

But to win approval, the report had to win backing in all three houses of the general synod and the House of Clergy rejected it by 100 votes to 93, with two abstentions.

Dr Cocksworth added that the report was a "valuable road map" and he was "disappointed" by the vote's outcome.Image copyright PA

Unilever, which owns some of the UK's most famous household brands, has strongly rejected a takeover bid from US food giant Kraft Heinz.

The maker of Marmite and PG Tips said it saw "no merit, either financial or strategic" in Kraft's offer, worth about $143bn (£115bn).

But Kraft, which makes Heinz ketchup, indicated it would continue working on a deal for the Anglo-Dutch firm.

The deal would be one of the biggest in corporate history.

It would combine Unilever's dozens of household names, which also includes Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap, and Hellmann's mayonnaise, with Kraft's own wide range, such as Philadelphia cheese and Heinz baked beans.

Shares in both companies rose sharply on Friday, as investors welcomed the possible creation of such a powerful firm.

But a deal could also raise concerns about job cuts and would probably be examined by competition regulators, analysts said.

Unilever: Profile of a consumer giant

Unilever, which has 7,500 employees in the UK, said Kraft's offer "fundamentally undervalued" the company. "Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions," it added.

Kraft, which is part-owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett, said it had made "a comprehensive proposal" and looked "forward to working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction".

The US food company attracted political scrutiny when it bought Cadbury in 2010, although it later spun the UK chocolate maker off into another company.

'Flex muscles'

The UK government has no "legal powers" to block a Kraft-Unilever deal, but competition regulators would need to investigate it, said former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable.

Analysis - When does 'no' mean 'no'?

By Jonty Bloom, BBC business correspondent

Takeovers are like those strange mating rituals you see on Planet Earth narrated by David Attenborough.

Kraft Heinz has approached Unilever about getting together and making an even bigger business with a huge family of brands.

Unilever has spurned the offer and is looking aloof, saying not only the proposal was too cheap but also that it "sees no merit, either financial or strategic".

Quite a slap in the face you might think but faint heart ne'er won fair hand. If Kraft Heinz offered a lot more money it might look a bit more attractive to Unilever.

Although whether the competition and takeover authorities would bless the union is another matter.

It would create a behemoth that could dominate many consumer sectors from food to soap and might stifle competition; many societies have rules against that kind of relationship.

With so many brands, Kraft-Unilever would be in a stronger position to raise prices, said Neil Wilson, an analyst at London broker ETX Capital.

"The combined entity would have a huge brand footprint and be able to flex bargain muscles even more with supermarkets," Mr Wilson said.

"It could come up against a number of hurdles as it would create a giant in the sector. EU regulators in particular could be against it," Mr Wilson said.

Unilever clashed with UK supermarket Tesco in October over its attempts to raise prices to compensate for the steep drop in the value of the pound.

The consumer goods giant has over a dozen sites across the UK, including three major plants in Liverpool, Norwich and Gloucester.

A UK government spokesman said: "This is clearly an important potential deal for a major company in the UK and its workforce. We continue to monitor the situation closely."

'Test the water'

If the deal went through, it would be the second biggest ever, behind Vodafone's $183bn takeover of Germany's Mannesmann in 2000, according to Dealogic.

Kraft's offer was at an 18% premium to Unilever's closing share price on Thursday, Unilever said.

Unilever shares rose 13% after the companies' announcements, suggesting investors were not fully convinced the deal would happen. Kraft shares rose 11% on Wall Street.

Unilever's best-known brands include:

Image copyright Alamy

Food: Ben & Jerry's; Bovril; Colman's; Cornetto; Flora; Hellmann's; I Can't Believe It's Not Butter; Knorr; Magnum; Marmite; Pot Noodle; Wall's

Drink: Lipton; Lyons tea; PG Tips

Household: Comfort; Domestos; Dove; Lynx; Persil; Radox; Sure; Surf; Timotei; Tresemme; Vaseline

Kraft Heinz brands include:

Food: Amoy; Heinz Ketchup; Heinz Soup; HP Sauce; Kraft Mac & Cheese; Lea & Perrins; Philadelphia; Weight Watchers Smart Ones

Drink: Capri Sun; Kool-Aid; Maxwell House

Still, analysts said Kraft was likely to return with another offer for Unilever, which reported net profit of 5.5bn euros (£4.7bn) last year.

"With Kraft Heinz saying it'll be coming back to the table, it looks like the initial offer was just to test the water," said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Mr Buffett's investment fund Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G are major investors in Kraft.

Kraft merged with Heinz in 2015 to create one of America's biggest food companies.

In 2010, Kraft bought Cadbury for £11.5bn, but it no longer owns the UK chocolate maker after spinning it off in a company called Mondelez.Image copyright Axel Hochkirch Image caption The Crau plain grasshopper is confined to a small area of the South of France

The first comprehensive assessment of Europe's crickets and grasshoppers has found that more than a quarter of species are being driven to extinction.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the insect group is the most threatened of those assessed so far in Europe.

Europe harbours more than 1,000 species of grasshopper and cricket.

If we don't act now the sound of crickets could become a thing of the past, said the IUCN.

Crickets, bush crickets and grasshoppers - a group known as Orthoptera - live on grassland.

They are an important food source for birds and reptiles, and their decline could affect entire ecosystems.

Their habitat is being lost due to wildfires, intensive agriculture and tourism development.

Image copyright Paulo Lemos Image caption The knotty sand grasshopper is threatened by tourist development

Jean-Christophe Vié, deputy director, IUCN Global Species Programme, said to bring these species back from the brink of extinction, more needs to be done to protect and restore their habitats.

"This can be done through sustainable grassland management using traditional agricultural practices, for example," he said.

"If we do not act now, the sound of crickets in European grasslands could soon become a thing of the past."

The assessment took place over two years and involved more than 150 scientists.

Axel Hochkirch is chair of the IUCN invertebrate conservation sub-committee and lead author of the report.

"If we lose grasshoppers and other Orthoptera like crickets and bush crickets, we will lose diversity," he told BBC News. "They are very good indicators of biodiversity in open ecosystems."

The experts are particularly concerned about species that occupy small ranges, such as the Crau plain grasshopper, which lives only on the Crau plain in the South of France.

Some populations are also being lost through wildfires, particularly in Greece and on the Canary Islands.

"The results from this IUCN Red List are deeply worrying," said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office.

The report recommends the setting up of a monitoring programme across Europe to obtain information on population trends.

The US will be "unwavering" in its support for Nato, vice-president Mike Pence told European leaders at the Munich Security Conference.

In the first major foreign policy address for the Trump administration, Mr Pence said the US would "stand with Europe today and every day".

But he told the gathered leaders that European countries were "failing to pay their fair share" on defence.

That failure "erodes the foundation of our alliance", he said.

The vice-president pointed out that apart from the US, only four Nato countries had met a 2014 commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence.

"The time has come to do more," he said.

President Donald Trump warned before taking office that the US might not uphold its commitment to come to the defence of Nato allies who were not perceived to have contributed enough financially.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Angela Merkel addressed the conference directly before Mike Pence

Watching the speech was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who spoke before Mr Pence. Germany is among the nations yet to meet the 2% target.

Nato estimates for 2016 show that only the US, UK, Greece, Poland and Estonia do so.

Media caption Mike Pence: "With regard to Ukraine...we must hold Russia accountable"

Mr Pence went on to say that the US would "continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found".

Mr Pence said Russia must honour a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, aimed at ending violence in eastern Ukraine.

His comments came amid huge controversy in the US over ties between the Trump administration and Russia, and concern in Europe over whether the new administration would attempt to restrain Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Speaking before Mr Pence, Ms Merkel called for increased co-operation between the US and the European Union on issues including Russian aggression and Islamist terror.

The two leaders were scheduled to meet face to face later in the day.

A dig at Trump - Jonathan Marcus, defence correspondent

Speaking before Mr Pence, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the question now facing the trans-Atlantic community was whether "we will be able to act in concert or fall back into parochial politics" - a subtle but clear dig at Mr Trump's mantra of "America First".

Asked directly what she thought about the Trump administration's rhetorical onslaught against sections of the media, Ms Merkel insisted that freedom of the press was a pillar of democracy.

When Mr Pence took to the stage he stressed that he was bringing a message of reassurance from the new president, who would "unwaveringly" back America's Nato allies.

But he also used the opportunity to repeat Mr Trump's long-held view that Washington's European allies must spend more on their own defence.Image copyright AP Image caption Larry Nassar looks at a computer after seeing a patient in this 2008 file photo.

A judge has ordered a former USA Gymnastics doctor to be tried on sex assault charges, as an accuser said he abused her during hide-and-seek.

A 25-year-old woman testified that Larry Nassar molested her from the age of six until 12 during family visits to his Michigan home.

Mr Nassar, 53, is accused by more than 60 former patients and athletes of sexual abuse during pelvic procedures.

He is facing separate federal charges for possession of child pornography.

After testimony at a court in Mason, Michigan, Judge Donald Allen ordered Mr Nassar to stand trial on three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person under 13 years old.

The accused, a sports doctor who treated US Olympic gymnasts, faces up to life in prison if convicted.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption USA Gymnastics is the national governing body for the sport in the United States

He was stripped of his medical licence last month, amid at least six criminal and civil lawsuits.

The unnamed woman, who was neither a patient nor an athlete, testified against him for more than two hours on Friday.

She detailed how Mr Nassar allegedly molested her during family visits to his home in Holt, Michigan, from 1998 to 2005.

"Almost every time I was there for a couple of years, something occurred," she told the court.

Some of the abuse happened under a blanket as he sat next to her on the sofa, while her unwitting older brother sat nearby, she said.

When she tried to tell her parents about the molestation, they did not believe her.

Image copyright AP Image caption MSU coach Kathie Klages quit abruptly earlier this week after being named in several lawsuits

"They made me feel like I had done something terrible," she said, adding that they told her to apologise to the doctor. She refused.

When the woman left home for university, she again told her parents about her experience with Mr Nassar.

Her father, who committed suicide in March 2016, "crumpled" when she repeated her claims.

Mr Nassar was fired in September after working for decades as a doctor for gymnasts at Michigan State University, as well as USA Gymnastics - the sport's governing body.

Allegations of sexual assault were first revealed by the Indianapolis Star newspaper in September 2016 when he was accused by two former gymnasts.

Since then, more than 60 women have accused him, and at least 40 have filed lawsuits.

Several of those suits name USA Gymnastics as a co-defendent, claiming they had not done enough to prevent the abuse.

MSU gymnasts coach Kathie Klages quit abruptly this week after being named in several legal actions.

She had worked as a coach for nearly 30 years, before she was suspended by the university, leading to her surprise departure.BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner and explorer Benedict Allen journey through Papua New Guinea. As Frank gets close to realising his dream, old injuries return to haunt him.

BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner has dreamed of seeing birds of paradise since he was a young child. But that dream died in 2004 when he was shot by terrorists. A chance meeting with explorer Benedict Allen changed everything. Thirty years ago, Benedict lived in Papua New Guinea with the Niowra, a remote people. They thought he would live amongst them forever but he abandoned them. Intent on returning, Benedict pledges to take Frank with him. Together, they set out on an incredible journey through some of the most inhospitable terrain on the planet, to make it up into the cloud forest where the birds live. Benedict is determined to get Frank there despite the wheelchair.

This time, the terrain is getting even tougher, and they must make an epic journey into the highlands, crossing through two tribal territories. But as Frank gets close to realising his dream, his old injuries return to haunt him and the expedition hangs on a knife edge.1. Emotional Dependence

Ask anyone under the age of 30 to give up their mobile for a week and you’ll trigger immediate panic. “I can’t live without it!” is a genuine cry from the heart. This goes way beyond convenience – mobiles are our constant companions, always answering our questions and offering reassurance. It is an emotional dependency that was predicted by Asimov in the episode Robbie (1940), where a child forms a stronger relationship with her robot childminder than her parents, with far reaching consequences.

2. Internet of Everything

In The Evitable Conflict (1950) Asimov describes Machines which are “the vastest conglomeration of calculating circuits ever invented.” These Machines collect “a nearly infinite number of data in nearly infinitesimal time,” from all around the world, and use it to keep the global economy running smoothly.

Cut to the present day, and the internet of everything is busy embedding billions of everyday objects with microchips that stream information back to vast data-clouds which some people fear gives too much control to companies wanting to sell us more stuff and governments wanting to keep an eye on us.

3. Human Impotence

In the 1940s, movie heroes would routinely wrestle with the controls of aircraft, or become legends for their sharpshooting; but when Asimov put pen to paper, he envisioned a world where men would become impotent in the face of smart robots.

And that’s precisely the world we are now building around us – how many of us can still read a map and navigate through a city without electronic satnavs? How many of us could slam on the brakes and avoid skidding if the ABS was turned off? How many planes could land in fog without computers? Let’s face it, whenever we hear the phrase “switching to manual control”, we instinctively tighten our seatbelts because we know it’s going to be a bumpier ride than if the computer was in charge.

4. Intellectual Sophistication

One of the most striking things about I, Robot is the way Asimov maps the growing intellectual sophistication of AI. In the early stories the robots can’t even talk, but later in the book they are playing complex mind games with humans.

This is already a reality. A few weeks ago, a Japanese insurance company announced that it was replacing 34 key staff with super-smart Watson computers. These aren’t just going to handle routine enquiries, they’re going to make complex decisions about financial pay-outs. The company has put its bottom line into the hands of AI because the computers “can think like a human” enabling them to “analyse and interpret all of your data, including unstructured text, images, audio and video.”How firms should react to a crisis

A number of companies and experts explore how businesses should best react to a disaster, be it a cyber-attack, financial scandal or other series issue.If you consult a large-scale map of the Essex coastline between the River Crouch and the River Thames, you will see a footpath – its route marked with a stitch-line of crosses and dashes – leaving the land at a place called Wakering Stairs and then heading due east, straight out to sea. Several hundred yards offshore, it curls northeast and runs in this direction for around three miles, still offshore, before cutting back to make landfall at Fisherman’s Head, the uppermost tip of a large, low-lying and little-known marshy island called Foulness.

The Broomway is thought to have killed more than 100 people over the centuries

This is the Broomway, allegedly “the deadliest” path in Britain, and certainly the unearthliest path I have ever walked. The Broomway is thought to have killed more than 100 people over the centuries; it seems likely that there were other victims whose fates went unrecorded. Sixty-six of its dead are buried in the little Foulness churchyard; the other bodies were not recovered. Edwardian newspapers, alert to the path’s reputation, rechristened it “The Doomway”.

Even the Ordnance Survey map registers, in its sober fashion, the gothic atmosphere of the path. Printed in large pink lettering on the 1:25,000 map of that stretch of coast is the following message:

WARNING Public Rights of Way across Maplin Sands can be dangerous. Seek local guidance.

The Broomway traverses vast sand flats and mud flats that stretch almost unsloped for miles. When the tide goes out at Foulness, it goes out a great distance, revealing shires of sand packed hard enough to support the weight of a walker. When the tide comes back in, though, it comes fast – galloping over the sands quicker than a human can run.

Disorientation is a danger as well as inundation: in mist, rain or fog, it is easy to lose direction in such self-similar terrain, with shining sand extending in all directions. Nor are all of the surfaces that you encounter reliable: there is mud that can trap you and quicksand that can swallow you. But in good weather, following the right route, it can feel nothing more than a walk on a very large beach.

Until 1932, the Broomway was the only means of getting to and from Foulness, save by boat

The Broomway takes its name from the 400 or so brooms that were formerly placed at intervals of between 30 and 60 yards on either side of the track, thereby indicating the safe passage on the hard sand that lay between them. Until 1932, the Broomway was the only means of getting to and from Foulness save by boat, for the island was isolated from the mainland by uncrossable creeks and stretches of mud known as the Black Grounds. The island is currently controlled by the Ministry of Defence, which purchased it during the First World War for “research purposes” and continues to conduct artillery-firing tests out over the sands.

The route of the Broomway seems to have been broadly consistent since at least 1419 (when it is referred to in a manorial record for Foulness). Conceptually, it is close to paradox. It is a right of way and as such is inscribed on maps and in law, but is also swept clean of the trace of passage twice daily by the tide. What do you call a path that is no path? A riddle? A sequence of compass bearings? A Zen koan?

Before I left, my friend Patrick had given me a warning: “The Broomway will be there another day, but if you try to walk it in mist, you may not be. So if it’s misty when you arrive at Wakering Stairs, turn around and go home.”

It was misty when I arrived at Wakering Stairs. Early on a Sunday morning, and the air was white. It wasn’t a haar, a proper North Sea mist that blanked out the world. More of a dense sea haze. But visibility was poor enough that the foghorns were sounding, great bovine reverbs drifting up and down the coast. I stood on the sea wall, looking out into the mist, feeling the foghorns vibrating in my chest, and wondering if I could imaginatively re-categorise the weather conditions such that I could disregard Patrick’s final warning. I felt queasy with anxiety, but eager to walk.

With me, also nervous, was my old friend David Quentin, who I had convinced to join me on the path.

Where the road met the sea wall, there was a heavy metal stop-barrier, tagged with a jay-blue graffiti scrawl. A red firing flag drooped at the foot of a tall flagpole. Beyond the stop-barrier was a bank of signs in waspy yellow-and-black type and imperative grammar, detailing bye-laws, tautologically identifying themselves as warnings, indemnifying the MoD against drownings, explosions and mud deaths, offering caveats to the walker, and grudgingly admitting that this was, indeed, the start of a public right of way:

Warning: The Broomway is unmarked and very hazardous to pedestrians.

Warning: Do not approach or touch any object as it may explode and kill you.

Away from the sea wall ran the causeway, perhaps five yards wide, formed of brick rubble and grey hardcore. It headed out to sea over the mud, before disappearing into water and mist. Poles had been driven into the mud on either side of the path, six feet tall, marking out its curling line. There were a few tussocks of eelgrass. The water’s surface was sheened with greys and silvers, like the patina on old mirror-glass. Otherwise, the causeway appeared to lead into a world of white.

We stopped at the end of the causeway, looking out across the pathless future

After 300 yards the causeway ended, dipping beneath the sand like a river passing underground. Further out, a shallow sheen of water lay on top of the sand, stretching away. The diffused light made depth perception impossible, so that it seemed as if we were simply going to walk onwards into the ocean. We stopped at the end of the causeway, looking out across the pathless future. I took off my trainers and placed them on a tussock of eelgrass.

“I’m worried that if we don’t make it back in time, the tide will float off with my shoes,” I said to David.

“If we don’t make it back in time, the tide will float off with your body,” he replied unconsolingly.

We stepped off the causeway. The water was warm on the skin, puddling to ankle depth. Underfoot I could feel the brain-like corrugations of the hard sand, so firmly packed that there was no give under the pressure of my step. Beyond us extended the sheer mirror-plane of the water, disrupted only here and there by shallow humps of sand and green slews of weed.

Out and on we walked, barefoot over and into the mirror-world. I glanced back at the coast. The air was grainy and flickering, like an old newsreel. The sea wall had hazed out to a thin black strip. Structures of unknown purpose – a white-beamed gantry, a low-slung barracks – showed on the shoreline. Every few hundred yards, I dropped a white cockle shell.

With so few orientation points and so many beckoning paths, we were finding it hard to stay on course. I was experiencing a powerful desire to walk straight out to sea and explore the greater freedoms of this empty tidal world.

But we were both still anxious about straying far from the notional path of the Broomway, and encountering the black mud or the quicksand.

Our directions said that we should reach something called the Maypole, a sunken telegraph pole with crosspieces that marked the southeastern edge of a tidal channel named Havengore Creek. But scale behaved strangely, and we weren’t paying sufficient attention to our pacings and distances. We became confused by other spars sticking up from the mud here and there: relics of wrecks, perhaps, or more likely the mark points of former channels long since silted up by the shifting sands.

At last we found and reached what was surely the Maypole. It resembled the final yards of a galleon’s topmast, the body of a ship long since sunk into those deep sands. At its base, the currents had carved basins in whose warm water we wallowed our feet, sending shrimps scurrying. We took an onwards bearing and continued over the silver shield of the water.

My brain was beginning to move unusually, worked upon and changed by the mind-altering substances of this offshore world, and by the elation that arose from the counter-intuition of walking securely on water. Out there, nothing could be only itself. The eye fed on false colour values. Mirages of scale occurred, and tricks of depth.

Walking always with us were our reflections, our attentive ghost selves. For the water acted as a mirror-line, such that we both appeared joined at the ankles with our doubles, me more than 12ft tall and David a foot taller still. If anyone had been able to look out from the shore, through the mist, they would have seen two long-shanked walkers striding over the sea.

~

You enter the mirror-world by a causeway and you leave it by one. From Asplin’s Head, a rubble jetty as wide as a farm track reaches out over the Black Grounds, offering safe passage to shore. As we approached the jetty the sand began to give way underfoot, and we broke through into sucking black mud. It was like striking oil – the glittering rich ooze gouting up around our feet. We slurped onwards to the causeway, the rubble of which had been colonized by a lurid green weed. Sea lavender and samphire thrived in the salt marsh.

By the time we reached the sea wall, David and I both wore diving boots of clay. We washed them off in a puddle, and stepped up onto a boat ramp. We had made landfall.

Beyond the causeway’s end, the shining sands stretched to a horizon line. One of Foulness’s farmers, John Burroughs, has spoken wistfully of coming out onto the sands in late autumn to hunt wigeon: he brings a board to use as a shooting stick and, leaning against it, feels that he “could be on the far side of the moon”. That felt exactly right: the walk out to sea as a soft lunacy, a passage beyond this world.

We walked back along the causeway to the point where the Broomway supposedly began, and there we turned into the wind and returned along the route by which we had come. Perhaps halfway back to the Maypole, emboldened by the day, we could no longer resist the temptation to explore further across the sand flats, and so we turned perpendicular to the line of the land and began walking straight out to sea, leaving the imagined safety of the Broomway behind us.

That hour was an hour I will never forget. We did not know where the sand would slacken to mud, and yet somehow it never felt dangerous or rash. The tide was out and the moon would hold it out, and we had two hours in which to discover this vast revealed world: no more than two hours, for sure, but surely also no less. The serenity of the space through which we were moving calmed me to the point of invulnerability, and thus we walked on. A mile out, the white mist still hovered, and in the haze I started to perceive impossible forms and shapes: a fleet of Viking longboats with high lug-rigged square sails; a squadron of feluccas, dhows and sgoths; cityscapes (the skyline of Istanbul, the profile of the Houses of Parliament). When I looked back, the coastline was all but imperceptible, and it was apparent that our footprints had been erased behind us, and so we splashed tracelessly on out to the tidal limit. It felt at that moment unarguable that a horizon line might exert as potent a pull upon the mind as a mountain’s summit.

The tide was out and the moon would hold it out, and we had two hours in which to discover this vast revealed world

Eventually, reluctantly, nearly two miles offshore, with the tide approaching its turn and our worries at last starting to rise through our calm – black mud through sand – we began a long slow arc back towards the coastline and the path of the Broomway, away from the outermost point. There was the return of bearings, the approach to land, a settling to recognisability.

Mud-caked and silly with the sun and the miles, we left the sand where it met the causeway near Wakering Stairs. There at the causeway’s frayed end, on the brink of the Black Grounds, were the marker poles, and there – perched on the top of their stand of eelgrass – were my faithful trainers, still waiting for me. I put them on and we walked out, off the mirror and onto the sea wall. For days afterwards I felt calm, level, shining, sand flat.

When Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard agreed to a date with a student after losing a Twitter wager, it had the hallmarks of a one-off event.

But in love, as in tennis, there is always room for surprises.

Talking about her evening with 20-year-old John Goehrke, Ms Bouchard called him a "gentleman" and declared it "awesome!"

Asked by a reporter if there would be a second date, she answered: "For sure!"

The saga behind the original date has charmed millions as it played out online, starting amid the drama of the US Super Bowl.

While the Atlanta Falcons were 21-0 ahead, Ms Bouchard predicted their victory on Twitter.

But when New England Patriots fan Mr Goehrke bet her a date that his team would triumph, she gamely accepted.

The Patriots duly mounted a nail-biting comeback in the game's dying minutes.

Ms Bouchard, 22, clearly a woman of her word, met the University of Missouri student in New York on Wednesday to watch a basketball game - and tweeted a picture with him en route.

"Just met my 'Super Bowl Twitter Date' John. On our way to the @BrooklynNets game!" she wrote.

The Montreal native had secured prime courtside seats for the encounter, where the Brooklyn Nets took on the Milwaukee Bucks.

Ms Bouchard is a one-time Wimbledon finalist who is currently 44th in the world tennis rankings.

The signs were good when she shared a photo of Mr Goehrke kissing her cheek at the evening's end.

And when US news site TMZ asked how the date had panned out, she answered: "He picked me up at my hotel, like a gentleman, and we came over here. He got me a nice little gift. We enjoyed the game courtside, and he's a normal fan!"

Donald Trump reportedly started work in the Oval Office on Thursday morning and told his staff he wanted to hold a press conference that day.

And so he did. Boy, did he.

The event, ostensibly an announcement of the president's new pick for labour secretary, was anything but routine. New nominee Alexander Acosta wasn't even in attendance - and it probably wasn't a bad thing that he missed out, since he quickly became an afterthought to the 76-minute free-form scrum that ensued.

So much for White House message discipline. Instead, it was Trump being Trump. The off-the-cuff style got him elected president, of course, so perhaps it's how he will reboot his four-week-old (!) presidency. Donald Trump was off the leash - just the way he seems to like it.

Here are some of the highlights.

Image copyright Getty Images

"The leaks are absolutely real; the news is fake."

Thursday's press conference was Trump v the Media, round eleventy-billion.

Mr Trump said mainstream journalists were the voice of a "broken system" of special interests that he is challenging - which can only be catnip for his base and a way of insulating himself against the recent barrage of negative stories.

When pressed on the simmering scandal over former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia and how the White House handled them, the president parried and then went after "dishonest" reporters who should be "ashamed" about inaccurate reporting based on illegal leaks (the president did not acknowledge the apparent contradiction in such a statement).

He blamed reporters for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal for not directly contacting him before running unflattering stories, as though they had his personal mobile number.

He even engaged in a bit of presidential concern-trolling, telling a CNN reporter his network would "do much better by being different".

"I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press," Mr Trump continued. "The public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you."

Mr Trump seemed to be at his happiest in this back-and-forth with hostile reporters over whether or not the media are honest - and with good reason. While journalists care deeply about the reputation of their profession, the general public probably views it as so much navel-gazing.

Every minute debating the impartiality and truthfulness of the press is a battle fought on terrain friendly to the president.

Media caption Trump was challenged by NBC on his false election boast

"I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan."

Mr Trump has a habit of making statements that have, shall we say, a sometimes distant relationship with reality. He often couches the remarks in phrases like "I've heard", "people are saying", or "I guess".

Such was the case when he turned once again - in the scripted portion of his press conference, no less - to the size of his Electoral College victory last November.

In a bit of a twist, however, a reporter from NBC, Peter Alexander, called him on it minutes later.

He said that Barack Obama and Bill Clinton posted bigger margins of victory. Mr Trump replied that he was referring to Republican presidents.

Alexander countered that George HW Bush had a bigger win, too.

"Why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information they've received as being fake, when you provide information that's not accurate?" he asked.

Trump replied that it was information he "was given" and had "seen around", before saying that it was still a "very substantial victory" - a claim much more difficult to disprove.

President Trump, like Candidate Trump, has seemed invulnerable to fact-checkers, perhaps in part because he's moved on to a hundred different topics before the media watchdogs can catch up.

Thursday, for at least a brief moment, was different.

"I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done."

The event on Thursday was billed as a press conference, but for the first half-hour it seemed more like an unpolished mid-day State of Union address. It was a chance for the president to talk over the gathered heads of the journalists in remarks broadcast on three of the four major US commercial networks and all the cable news outlets.

He spoke about the jobs he's brought back to the US - anecdotal and small-bore though they may be. He spoke of "productive talks" he's had with world leaders and the request he's made for his military to come up with a plan to defeat the so-called Islamic state.

He cited executive actions withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and cutting back on government regulations. He boasted of task forces created, councils formed and agency co-ordination instructed.

And he touted his immigration efforts - a key piece of which is currently suspended pending court review.

"This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country," Mr Trump asserted again. "And we have not even started the big work yet."

That last part is definitely true. While the Trump administration has seemed to be in a flurry of activity, legislatively there has been relatively little accomplished. Within the first four weeks of his presidency, Mr Obama had signed into law a measure increasing protection for women's wages in the workplace and a massive economic stimulus bill that included more than $800bn in new federal spending.

After four weeks, Mr Trump still has 98% of his presidency ahead of him. The start has been rocky, and less accomplished than he says, but the jury is still out.

"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved."

One of the criticisms that seems to irk Mr Trump the most is that his presidency has been beset by "chaos" and mismanagement.

Mr Trump lays part of the blame at the feet of Democrats, whom he says have been slow to approve his top-level cabinet appointments.

While part of this assuredly true, as Democrats slow-walked several of his nominees, others have been tardy because there were delays in submitting vetting paperwork or in the announcement of the nominations.

Perhaps of greater cause for concern is the lack of lower-level appointments announced. In key departments like state and treasury, the under-secretary slots remain largely unfilled.

Then there's the ongoing palace intrigue within the White House, which Mr Trump glossed over. He said that his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is "working so hard just putting out fires" - but some of those fires are coming from within his own administration.

In one Washington Post story, an unnamed White House official said Priebus had to "become more competent". There's talk of rival factions within the Trump team, with pragmatists like Priebus squared off against longtime Trump true-believers like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller.

When asked by the BBC's Jon Sopel about one of the most-cited example of White House chaos - the confusion surrounding the administration's rollout of the Mr Trump's immigration order - the president was defiant.

"We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban," he said. "But we had a bad court."

The court decisions Mr Trump was apparently referencing - either by the Seattle judge who suspended implementation of the ban or the appellate court that upheld the injunction - came well after the first few unruly days of implementation, however, when US immigration officials seemed uncertain of how to apply the broadly worded order.

Perhaps "chaos" is too strong a word, but "smooth" is downplaying the confusion, particularly for permanent US residents from Iran, Iraq and other targeted nations who were left wondering whether they could safely enter the US.

"I think Melania is going to be outstanding."

After berating a CNN reporter, calling Jon Sopel and BBC News "another beauty" and repeatedly telling a Jewish reporter asking about anti-Semitism to be quiet, Mr Trump finally found a question he liked - from an independent reporter named Kyle Mazza.

"Can you tell us all the things Melania does for the country?" he asked, referring to the president's wife.

"That is what I call a nice question," Mr Trump responded, before extolling the virtues of the first lady.

"I've known her for a long time," he said. "She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well."

Mr Trump had been criticised for only calling on friendly reporters over the course of the last three press availabilities - all joint appearances with foreign leaders where a total of six questions from US journalists were permitted. Mr Trump chose conservative news outlets like Townhall, the Daily Caller and Newsmax over traditional mainstream media reporters.

On Thursday, however, Mr Trump took the media's best shot - although he carped about how he'd be portrayed as "ranting and raving" in the subsequent coverage.

He may not have ranted and raved, but it was a most unusual press conference nonetheless.Image copyright Getty Images

Washington is rife with political warfare, as 2016's presidential electoral combat spills over into Donald Trump's presidency and shows no signs of abating.

It's a battle of leaks and tweets, background innuendo and rhetorical broadsides.

In the middle of the maelstrom are federal law-enforcement and intelligence agencies and operatives that are supposedly above the partisan fray.

It hasn't worked out that way.

When leaks were welcome

During the campaign, Donald Trump loved to tout the latest news about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server - whether through the agency's public pronouncements or background leaks to media outlets.

"The investigation is the biggest political scandal since Watergate," he said at a late October rally in Iowa, "and it's everybody's hope that justice at last can be delivered."

In one early November television advert, an ominous voice warned that the former secretary of state couldn't lead the US while "crippled by a criminal investigation".

"She is unfit and unqualified to be president," Mr Trump said at a rally in Michigan, "and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford."

Meanwhile, it was Democrats who were crying foul - focusing their scorn on FBI Director James Comey in particular.

"By providing selective information, he's allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage," Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said in October, "and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts."

Some in the FBI, on background, said the leaks were a reflection of the anti-Clinton views of many in the bureau.

Mrs Clinton, one unnamed FBI agent told The Guardian, "is the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel".

What a difference an election, an inauguration and four weeks of being president make.

Trump v leakers

This week, Mr Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the FBI and other intelligence agencies for leaks about investigations into his administration's ties to the Russian government.

"The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy," he tweeted on Wednesday. "Very un-American!"

He mentioned the FBI and the National Security Agency by name, compared them to Russia (an interesting choice) and said the New York Times should apologise for writing stories based on leaks.

In his press conference on Thursday Mr Trump again pledged to bring to justice those responsible for the leaks, which he said have led to "fake news" stories and could possibly threaten national security.

"Those are criminal leaks," Mr Trump said. "They're put out by people either in agencies - I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in."

Mr Trump's comments hint at what others in his White House have called "sleeper cells" of career government workers - internal saboteurs - whom they view as hostile to the new president.

Police state tactics

There's little doubt that the Trump administration has been rife with leaks. Stories about Justice Department contact with the White House regarding Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak - secretly recorded by US intelligence operatives - helped force the embattled national security advisor's resignation.

A New York Times article about ties between members of the Trump team and Russian intelligence agents was based solely on the accounts of anonymous government officials.

According to Eli Lake of Bloomberg View, the recent flood of weaponised leaks points to a disturbing trend.

"Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity," he writes. "This is what police states do."

Lake's column rose to particular prominence when Mr Trump thanked the author in a Thursday morning tweet and said it was a "very serious situation".

The leaks are just one piece of what has become an ongoing feud between Mr Trump and the intelligence community over concerns of Russian meddling in the US election.

Mr Trump and his team view attempts to investigate and document Russian efforts as an under-the-table effort to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win.

In January, before his inauguration, Mr Trump upped the rhetoric by comparing agency leaks to the actions of Nazi Germany.

This prompted a stinging rebuke from former CIA head John Brennan.

"I found that to be very repugnant, and I will forever stand up for the integrity and patriotism of my officers who have done much over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens," he told the Wall Street Journal.

Toxic politics

In the last days of the presidential campaign, some observers framed the election as a "deep state" feud between the CIA, which backed Mrs Clinton, and the Trump-friendly FBI.

Given Mr Trump's recent animosity towards the FBI, and reports of an ongoing investigation by the bureau into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, that now seems less likely.

The fact that such views could have been widely shared, however, demonstrates just how toxic the partisan views of these government entities have become. If anything, the conflict between the Trump team and the intelligence community seems to have escalated in the days following Mr Flynn's resignation.

A Wall Street Journal report indicated that members of the intelligence community were withholding details in the president's national security briefings for fear of compromising their information sources.

Meanwhile, White House sources told the New York Times of a pending review - and perhaps restructuring - of the intelligence community, led by an outsider, financier Stephen Feinberg, who is intensely loyal to the president.

In other sections of the executive branch, systemic "housecleaning" is already underway. The State Department, which is also viewed by the White House as stocked with political opponents, just announced widespread layoffs.

Intelligence agencies may fear what's coming their way - and further leaking is their best way of pushing back against the White House.

History repeats

While it is easy for critics to paint the ongoing drama as unprecedented, this is far from the first time members of the intelligence community have become entangled with politics.

In 1993 President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions - the first time the nation's top law enforcement official had been sacked mid-term.

Then there's the case of the deputy director of the FBI whose background leaks helped bring down President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.

The man was Mark Felt, but for decades he was known by different name - Deep Throat.

The leaks in Washington right now are many - and some have proven quite damaging.

If history is any guide, however, the real fireworks may still be ahead.These places are not scary

I ask the Dutch ruling party's Europe spokesman what the election next month is about. "Identity," he replies without hesitation.

I try to ask his leader, the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, about their strategy.

Near the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, a small crowd gathers in the snow and begins a countdown for Mr Rutte. "Tien, negen, acht" - ten, nine, eight - they chant before he unveils the statue of Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, a 19th-Century statesman, hero to Rutte's Liberal party, the VVD.

The rather delightful mixture of old-fashioned marble for the statesman himself and burnished steel, portraying his modern equivalent, complete with a woman in a short skirt perched on his desk, is the work of Tom Pucke, an English sculptor who's lived here for 20 years.

He tells me his Thorbecke gazes into the future with worry. "You see in his face a sort of concern, in his expression, maybe he's concerned about the way things are going."

The prime minister may well feel the same. Another countdown is well under way, to the election on 15 March, and Mr Rutte is becoming decidedly less liberal in reaction to the man leading the opinion polls.

Long before there was Donald Trump, another populist politician with an exotic hairstyle was already making waves. Platinum blonde Geert Wilders was once banned from Britain.

Now he's on course, according to most polls, to head the largest group of MPs in the Dutch Parliament. He wants to ban the Koran and close the country's Mosques.

So one slogan you won't find Mr Rutte using is "It's the economy, stupid."

Image copyright JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Dutch PM Mark Rutte says immigrants who "refuse to adapt" should "behave normally or leave"

He has devised a plan to ensure he isn't the first continental leader to drown in the new populist tide, joining Hillary Clinton and David Cameron bobbing in the waves. He has issued a very hard-line open letter.

It begins "there is something wrong with our country." He continues to appeal to "the silent majority," saying Dutch freedoms have been abused, women in short skirts and gay people have been abused. He tells those immigrants who he says "refuse to adapt" to "behave normally or leave."

When I try to talk to him at the unveiling his spokeswoman butts in: "This is not the moment."

So I asked his party's Europe spokesman MP, Anne Mulder, what the election is about.

"Identity," he replies. "What makes the Netherlands the Netherlands. I think it is globalisation, people travelling all around the world, people losing their jobs, so that's why people need some security.

"People are looking for identity, our shared feelings, acting normal. It is not only Islam, but if people leave their wife at home, if there's not equality between men and women...."

I say some people might think this was dancing to Geert Wilders' tune. "Some people might say so," he answers, expressionless.

So has his party been pushed to the right ? He hesitates. "We have been having discussions in the party. Ten years ago I start in this city council - telling people, "Act normal."

Wilders will launch his campaign next week in Spijkenisse, a suburb on the end of the Rotterdam tube line.

So I go to the community centre there. A group of women are executing a rather slow line dance to gently exercise the limbs. Keeping moving is on their minds, not the election. But when I mention politics, just one name is on all their lips.

Image copyright Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images Image caption Geert Wilders' party has topped a number of recent opinion polls

"I am going to vote for Wilders. He's direct. Straight. We shouldn't take in so many people with the Islamic religion."

As they dance to a tune about a beautiful lady from South Texas, some of the views are very similar to those I've heard in the States recently. "I think we have to close the borders and have less foreigners. People here are getting poorer, kids going without breakfast, no clothes."

There's a paradox too - Wilders is valued for speaking out - but not all supporters want him to lead their country. "He dares to say things as they are, about the foreigners. They are not good to women, there's the crime, all the murders, they rob shops with guns.

"Even though I'm voting for him, he can't be prime minister. But we need him to show the truth about Holland."

Marianne Vorthoren from Spior, Rotterdam's Islamic umbrella organisation, says the atmosphere has changed.

"Many Muslims feel 'are we still part of this society?' It's not just that some people say these things, [like calling for a ban on the Koran] but that about 20% of the voters support this. That is shocking. We don't feel safe any more."

I ask her about the prime minister's comments that people should leave if they can't "act normal." Fair enough, surely ?

"Who do you define with 'we' and 'us' and 'our values'? There are lots of groups - some in Parliament, Christian orthodox groups - who don't agree with equal rights for homosexuals. Now we don't say to them 'get out!'"

Despite these concerns, Wilders' party seems likely to do very well in the election.

The diffidence I found in the community centre could play either way. People seem to say that they want Wilders around to speak his mind, but not to become their country's leader.

Image copyright Sean Gallup/Getty Images Image caption Both Germany and France will hold major elections in 2017

That might put people off voting for his party or, my guess, suggest that he's a safe protest vote. Unintentionally the political mainstream cements this appeal, by firmly rejecting him as a possible coalition partner.

Wilders has zero chance of becoming prime minister - according to the current prime minister - because the other parties simply won't do a deal with him.

I asked political editor of the right-wing Daily Standard blog Tim Engelbart how that would go down.

"A government would have to be formed with four or five parties. It would be an extremely unstable, unpopular government, featuring all kinds of parties from left to right with very little in common beyond the desire to keep Wilders out.

"It would anger Wilders voters, who are worried about security, their country, and who will be told: 'We're going to ignore you, regardless of the results.' Their faith in the Dutch political system won't improve."

It could be a script from the populist playbook - the people's will rejected, the people's choice excluded by a colluding elite. It would suggest betrayal wasn't a myth but a reality.

A lot hangs on several European elections this year. The vote next month in the Netherlands will be followed by even more critical elections in France and Germany.

But the Netherlands suggests some choices have already been made.

The 'politics of identity' mean many centrist politicians aren't hesitating at the crossroads, contemplatively chewing their fingers. Many who were once happy to occupy the centre lane have forked to the right and are zooming down the autobahn in emulation of their more popular opponents. The question is not the direction of travel - but how far it goes.

In the Netherlands, the revolution of the far-right has been brewing for a long time. We'll find out if they are near to taking power on 16 March. But you needn't wait until then to find out how Wilders has done. In one sense he has already won.The claim: The UK's spending on defence fell below 2% of GDP in 2016.

Reality Check verdict: Nato has confirmed that its figures for 2016 show the UK is still meeting the 2% target, but won't release the full details until next month. The amount that the IISS claims that defence spending is below 2% of GDP is tiny by the standards of government spending, and may easily be erased by using different exchange rates or definitions of defence spending.

Defence think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) claimed on Tuesday that the UK had dropped below its pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence, made in the Strategic Defence Review in 2015.

GDP is what you get when you add up all the goods and services produced in an economy. In the UK in 2016 it was about £1.87 trillion.

The IISS said that as a result of UK GDP being higher than expected, the UK had actually only spent 1.98% of GDP on defence in 2016.

The Ministry of Defence says that the IISS figures are wrong. It pointed to Nato figures saying that the UK spent 2.21% of GDP on defence last year.

That figure is based on analysis from Nato, which was published last July, meaning they were based on forecasts for both GDP and spending.

But Nato later said that it had looked at the final numbers for 2016 and could confirm that the UK was still meeting the 2% target, but it would not be releasing the full figures until next month.

The alliance said that the UK, US, Poland, Greece and Estonia met the target last year.

As this is a Nato target, it is Nato's methodology that is important. Before making the calculation, Nato converts both defence spending and GDP into US dollars at 2010 exchange rates and prices.

There are disagreements about what should and what should not count as military spending - whether pensions paid to soldiers' widows count, for example.

IISS has calculated the figure slightly differently. It gets to a figure of £38.3bn for UK defence spending in 2016 .

If you divide that by the ONS figure for GDP you get 2.05%, but that's not what the IISS has done. Because it is trying to make comparisons between different countries, it has converted all the figures into US dollars, using International Monetary Fund exchange rates and also used IMF GDP figures.

When you do that, you get to 1.98%.

Austria is to sue Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium over a 2 billion-euro (£1.7bn) deal to buy Typhoon warplanes.

Its defence ministry said that following an investigation it believed Austria had been misled over the purchase price.

It could sue the two companies for 1.1bn euros, it said.

Airbus said the allegations had taken it by surprise and that it was "a political manoeuvre".

Airbus and Eurofighter charged nearly 10% of the purchase price for offset deals, which involve work for local contractors, said the defence ministry's report. This should have been charged separately, it said, and means it is suing for at least 183.4 million euros.

It says the 1.1bn euro figure is its calculation for the difference in price between the Eurofighter and a cheaper option.

'Very expensive'

Defence minister Hans Peter Doskozil said the investigation suggested "Austria would not have decided to purchase the Eurofighter in 2003 without the fraudulent deception".

Austria ordered 24 Eurofighter jets in 2002 but reduced its order to 15. It then ordered a review of the purchase in 2012 in light of bribery allegations.

Mr Doskozil said the first order of Eurofighters used by the German army are "very expensive during operation" and that the Eurofighter programme would cost Austria 80 million euros in 2017. He will commission a new report to find a cheaper alternative, he said.

The Eurofighter programme is a joint venture between Airbus, BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo to provide a modern fighter jet for the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as other buyers. The UK bought 160 of the aircraft.

"Airbus is surprised by media reports of a criminal complaint and alleged repayment claims on the part of the Austrian Ministry of Defence against Airbus Defence and Space and Eurofighter," Airbus said in a statement.

"We have received neither notification of a criminal complaint nor any other information regarding this matter or the ministry's accusations. These new accusations have never been raised before; we thus cannot see any foundation in particular for the allegations of bad faith and fraud. Rather, they appear to be contrived, and we deny them vigorously.

"We see today's announcement as a political manoeuvre. We are, of course, continuing our policy of actively supporting the Austrian authorities in investigating concrete suspicions."We'll hide these CBBC shows for 30 days.

Why did you hide them?A profoundly deaf couple from Salisbury have heard each other speak for the first time thanks to cochlear implants.

It is believed Helen and Neil Robinson are the first couple in the UK to get the implants together.

The devices, which were fitted by the Auditory Implant Service in Southampton, use small electrical currents to stimulate the hearing nerves.

The pair have been married for 12 years but up to a few months ago they communicated using sign language.
