Yesterday I wrote about the news media, offering them a reminder as to why the public trusts them the same (or maybe less) than the politicians they cover. On cue, members of the media spent nearly the entire day complaining about Trump and what he said about the press. They crapped the bed when he tweeted the following:

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

Bless their little insensitive hearts. They could barely take it. But just to give one example of how the press handled it, here is what Ryan Lizza had to say:

I was on the fence about this, but how can journalists go to WHCA dinner and toast somebody who has branded them an "enemy" of the state? — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) February 17, 2017

Putting aside Lizza’s silly comments about the White House Correspondents Dinner, which is nothing but an event where journalists get to pretend they’re celebrities, he completely misstates what Trump said! Trump specifically said the “fake news media” are the “enemy” of the “American people.” Consider the source. Lizza is the one who tweeted a quote from Jeb Bush about mass shootings that purposely left out critical context.

People in the media are proving to be just as thin-skinned and just as narcissistic as President Trump and President Obama. Just as Donald Trump needs to get over it when he decides to start a flame war against a critic, the press needs to get over it when Trump complains about them. Somebody said to me, “Trump was unhinged, but who cares if he was whining about the media? The point is he was whining instead of being a President.”

That’s perfectly stated.

It’s fair to make the case President Trump is attempting to delegitimize the press. But in the course of his near one month in office, he’s delegitimized the judiciary, Congress, NATO, the intelligence community and more. Every day the press is busy fighting on Trump’s turf by battling him about themselves, is another day issues such as the repeal of Obamacare, tax cuts and the nomination of Neil Gorsuch remain untouched. There are still important questions about Russia that need to be answered and investigated. That Trump needed to declare his administration is a “finely tuned machine” when it’s a train wreck needs follow-up.

Don’t get me wrong. I am not one of these people who thinks Trump is the brilliant Svengali, able to manipulate the press at will. What’s going is the equivalent of a gorilla and a group of chimpanzees flinging s**t at each other.

However, the media is busy engaging in a battle they likely will not win if they continue to make it about themselves. Trump has a core of supporters who will follow his lead no matter where it goes. If he determines tomorrow The Wall Street Journal is “fake news,” they’re going to agree and start saying it. If Trump is left alone to grouse about the media, he loses out.

Two days ago, Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back a last-minute Obama coal mining regulation. He did with coal miners by his side along with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Optically, this was a terrific win for Trump. The problem is, hardly anybody noticed it because he was too busy screaming at the press and the press screamed back.

It all comes down to this for the mainstream media: Do your job. Stop making threats to boycott the White House Correspondents Dinner. Stop blubbering about our supposedly “threatened democracy” because the President is having a hissy-fit on Twitter. The fourth estate has more important things to do than see who between them and President Trump can pee more on each other’s leg.

Get to work.In what would likely be an unprecedented move, the Trump administration is looking at utilizing the National Guard for illegal immigrant roundups in border and non-border states.

From Bloomberg:

The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. Four states that border on Mexico are included in the proposal — California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas — but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four — Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Governors in the 11 states would have a choice whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, written by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general. While National Guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the U.S.-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly or as far north.

Governors having the choice is key. Many will face a major backlash if they approve.

Another question is whether or not Natl. Guard personnel is prepared for this kind of work:

…the draft memo says participating troops would be authorized “to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States.” It describes how the troops would be activated under a revived state-federal partnership program, and states that personnel would be authorized to conduct searches and identify and arrest any unauthorized immigrants.

More on this to come for sure.

UPDATE: The White House is denying the story:

So, the AP reports that DHS wrote the memo And the WH says that the memo is false? — Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) February 17, 2017

Homeland Security person is saying the story is false as well:

Homeland Security spokeswoman tells NBC News: "That AP story about the National Guard is incorrect. It's not true." — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 17, 2017And just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water:

The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who has refused Democratic requests to investigate possible conflicts of interest involving President Donald Trump, is seeking criminal charges against a former State Department employee who helped set up Hillary Clinton’s private email server.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday asking him to convene a grand jury or charge Bryan Pagliano, the computer specialist who helped establish Clinton’s server while she was secretary of state.

Pagliano did not comply with two subpoenas ordering him to appear before the oversight panel. The GOP-led committee later voted to hold him in contempt of Congress.

…

Chaffetz said in a statement that allowing Pagliano’s conduct “to go unaddressed would gravely harm Congress’ ability to conduct oversight.”A California college student was suspended for revealing his professor’s ridiculous bias. Now, he’s punching back.

Yesterday, Andrea Ruth covered the story of a student at Orange Coast College, Caleb O’Neil, who was suspended for filming his professor’s anti-Trump rant:

The professor, Professor Olga Perez Stable Cox, calls Trump a “white supremacist.” She calls Mike Pence “one of the most anti-gay humans in this country.” She calls Trump’s election an “act of terrorism.” She assumes all her students agree with her and says “we are the majority.” She says she will go over “coping skills.”

One of those coping skills includes adding 2-3 more words to her name. “From now on, instead of Professor Olga Perez Stable Cox, I will be called Professor Olga Perez Stable Suarez Humbert-Gillers Cox.” Nah, I made that last part up.

For publishing this rant, Mr. O’Neil was praised for revealing an issue with the faculty suspended for a semester and ordered to write an essay about why he was such a bad boy.

Guess what? Now he’s not only appealing the suspension, but threatening a lawsuit:

19-year-old Caleb O’Neil will appeal. The Orange Coast College freshman said Wednesday that he [will] file a lawsuit in federal court if his appeal is rejected. “We think this is a clear example of unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination that targets conservatives and we’re going to challenge it,” O’Neil’s attorney, Bill Becker, said at a news conference in Costa Mesa, according to CBS Los Angeles. Becker told the Orange County Register that the suspension “is an attack by leftists in academia to protect the expressive rights of their radical instructors.”

These people need to market themselves better. Set up a fund. I’d donate.

To be fair, I’m not quite sure what the fella expected when he signed up for a “human sexuality class” taught by a Professor Olga Perez Farias-Smith Williams Gutierrez Walker Unstable Cox, or whatever her name is.

In an interview published in Politico, Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) describes himself as a “dead man walking” and explains why this gives him the freedom to be the conservative resistance against President Trump.

When he was Governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford’s name routinely came up in discussions of future GOP presidential hopefuls. That was until he disappeared in 2009 and returned later with an unlikely story about hiking the Appalachian Trail alone. In truth he was in South America with the Argentinian journalist with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Destroying his marriage through infidelity isn’t something Trump or his hardcore supporters can seriously use to discredit Sanford, but it’s the sense of having hit rock bottom that emboldens the Congressman.

All this gives Sanford a unique sense of liberation to speak his mind about a president whose substance and style he considers a danger to democracy. “I’m a dead man walking,” he tells me, smiling. “If you’ve already been dead, you don’t fear it as much. I’ve been dead politically.” His digs at Trump cover the spectrum. The president, Sanford says, “has fanned the flames of intolerance.” He has repeatedly misled the public, most recently about the national murder rate and the media’s coverage of terrorist attacks. He showed a lack of humility by using the National Prayer Breakfast to ridicule Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Most worrisome, Sanford says, Trump is unprepared for the presidency.

Described as “professorial” and “quirky” about his conservative philosophy by his colleagues, he was bound to lock horns with Trump.

Sanford’s opposition to Trump, then, was somewhat inevitable. When a chorus of House conservatives took turns fawning over the GOP nominee after a meeting with him last June, Sanford made a point of mocking Trump’s constitutional knowledge. (“Somebody asked about Article I powers and what he would do to protect them,” Sanford told reporters. “I think his response was, ‘I want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII,’ going down the list. Of course, there is no Article XII.”) When party officials began marginalizing the issue of tax returns after the convention, Sanford wrote a New York Times op-ed calling Trump’s unprecedented lack of transparency “something our country cannot afford.” And when his colleagues returned to D.C. infused with optimism after the Republican ticket’s November 8 victory, Sanford privately warned them to brace for disappointment.

Carl Blackstone, a former employee, explains that superficially, Sanford is said to have a “disdain for expensive clothing.” Substantially, Sanford was raised by a father who drilled the notion of equality into his children. Sanford is not impressed by Trump at all.

“And all of a sudden a guy comes along where facts don’t matter?” Sanford asks aloud. “It’s somewhat befuddling. It’s the undoing of that which you base a large part of your life on.”

Sanford’s concerns about Trump echo a lot of the concerns expressed here at RedState.

What concerns Sanford on a fundamental level—“the danger” of Trump’s presidency, he says— is that “historically there’s incredible deference to the presidency from the party in power.” He understands the reluctance of rank-and-file Republicans to criticize a president who “has a proven record of taking people down.” But, he says, there must be a muscular check on Trump from somewhere inside the GOP. He was encouraged to see Speaker Paul Ryan push back on him throughout 2016, but equally disheartened to see him willingly subjugated after the election results came in. “I admired his conviction in the campaign,” Sanford says of Ryan. However, he adds, “at the end of the day, radio silence is not sustainable in being true to yourself.” … “Our republic was based on reason. The Founding Fathers were wed to this notion of reason. It was a reason-based system. And if you go to a point wherein it doesn’t matter, I mean, that has huge implications in terms of where we go next as a society.”

Amen to that. In the short term keeping Hillary Clinton out of the White House was a win for conservatives. In the long run, putting Donald Trump there, may well prove to be a negative for the movement. All the more reason we need people in the GOP to backstop Trump from sliding into the big government policies he spent much of his life supporting. But it has to be more than just Republicans who have nothing left to lose..@AriMelber The New York Times seems to think Mrs. Clinton played a pretty important role in that deal. Why wouldn't you mention that? — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 17, 2017

President Trump’s press conference to announce his new nominee to be labor secretary turned into a massive media push back/ fact check that lasted over an hour. He did take 17 questions though, which is probably more than Hillary Clinton probably ever would take if she were elected president. Of course, a lot of questions were about Russia, to which the president vociferously said he has no ties, no loans, and no business deals. He said that it doesn’t mean he can’t call Russia, but he doesn’t because he has no one to talk to over there. He then took a swipe at Hillary Clinton saying that she gave Putin 20 percent of our uranium.

On The Today Show, MSNBC’s Ari Melber fact checked the presser and found this claim to be false.

WATCH: Did Clinton give Russia uranium? Federal employees leaking classified info. to public? @AriMelber fact-checks Trump news conference pic.twitter.com/5ENyMVzZvZ — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 17, 2017

Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton gave them [Russia] 20 percent of our uranium. Ari Melber: Now, that claim we can tell you is false. Clinton did not give away any American uranium. Russia’s energy agency did buy part of a Canadian company that produces uranium and that was during the period while she was secretary of state.

Yeah, there are a lot of details missing with this shoddy fact check job. For starters, the company, Rosatom, which is a state-owned corporation didn’t just buy a part of a Canadian company—Uranium One—it absorbed the whole entity and its mining operations, some of which were in the United States. On top of that, the chairman for Uranium One at the time, Ian Telfer, used his family’s charity organization to send $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation between 2009-2013, which was when the Russians were assuming more and more control over the company. It’s important since the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom had to be signed off on by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who was part of the Council on Foreign Investment, which oversees business dealings pertinent to American’s national security interests. To no one’s surprise, she did sign off on it—adding to the claims of unethical quid pro quo dealings at the Clinton Foundation.

Yet, back to the uranium angle of this, which by the way, was reported by The New York Times in April of 2016, so it’s not like this is a wacky right wing conspiracy theory. The sale did give a Russian company significant control of uranium interests in the U.S. The approval of the sale comes after some other interesting financial transactions besides the Telfer’s donations. The publication added that Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 to give a speech at a Russian bank pushing Uranium One futures around the time (2010) Rosatom announced their intention to purchase a majority share of the company [emphasis mine]:

The headline on the website Pravda trumpeted President Vladimir V. Putin’s latest coup, its nationalistic fervor recalling an era when its precursor served as the official mouthpiece of the Kremlin: “Russian Nuclear Energy Conquers the World.” The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain. But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one. […] When the Uranium One deal was approved, the geopolitical backdrop was far different from today’s. The Obama administration was seeking to “reset” strained relations with Russia. The deal was strategically important to Mr. Putin, who shortly after the Americans gave their blessing sat down for a staged interview with Rosatom’s chief executive, Sergei Kiriyenko. “Few could have imagined in the past that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves,” Mr. Kiriyenko told Mr. Putin. […] Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

So, as you can see, Melber leaves out some details and even gets some of them wrong, namely that the Russian company bought the whole Canadian company, that about one-fifth of our reserves were included in that Canadian company’s base of operations, and that Clinton signed off on the deal which gave the Russians control of those interests. Leave it to MSNBC to get it wrong.

(H/T redsteeze/ Stephen Miller)Of all the questions asked of President Trump during yesterday’s presser, this one was probably one of the most innocuous, and presented in the most deferential of terms – and Trump still found a way to take offense to it.

In fact, had Trump not been on the defensive as a natural default, and really heard what the young man was asking, this could have been a shining moment for him.

Jake Turx is a young, Hasidic Jew and a correspondent for Ami Magazine, an Orthodox Jewish weekly publication, based out of Brooklyn, New York.

No one from Ami has ever had a seat in the press pool for a presidential press conference, so Mr. Turx was looking at this as a real opportunity.

From the New York Times:

When President Trump called on him at a news conference on Thursday, saying he was looking for a “friendly reporter,” Mr. Turx was prepared. He had spent an hour crafting a question about a recent surge of anti-Semitism, with a preamble that he hoped would convey his supportive disposition toward Mr. Trump. But the exchange did not go the way he expected. A few hours later, with the clip replaying on social media and Jewish groups issuing news releases, Mr. Turx, 30, was still reeling. He said in a telephone interview, “Regretfully, today was a day I wish we could have done over.” His editor, Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter, watched aghast from the magazine’s offices as his young correspondent received a tongue-lashing from the president: “It was a very disheartening moment for us, to watch him being berated.”

And given the context of the question, nobody watching it can come away without scratching their heads and wondering if Trump is well.

He’s not.

He crawled all over this gentleman, based on his assumption of where the question was going.

Again, this could have been a grand moment for him, and no matter what gushing praise the debacle received from Rush Limbaugh or Trump’s favorite crotch-sniffer, Sean Hannity, the reality resembles something more along the lines of a train wreck, with many casualties.

To set the scene, Turx stood and tried to separate himself and his intentions from some of the media, who, just by their nature, may have been less than “friendly” towards a Republican president, and even less so towards this particular president, as he has drawn very clear battle lines between himself, his administration, and them.

“Despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren. You are their zayde,” which is Yiddish for “grandfather” and often a word of great affection. At that Mr. Trump nodded slightly, and said, “thank you.” “However,” Mr. Turx continued, “what we are concerned about and what we haven’t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There’s been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to——” At that, Mr. Trump interrupted, saying it was “not a fair question.” “Sit down,” the president commanded. “I understand the rest of your question.” As Mr. Turx took his seat, Mr. Trump said, “So here’s the story, folks. No. 1, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person.” Mr. Turx tried to interject, realizing how the encounter had turned. He said he had wanted to clarify that he in no way meant to accuse Mr. Trump of anti-Semitism but instead intended to ask what his administration could do to stop the anti-Semitic incidents. But Mr. Trump would not let him speak again, saying, “Quiet, quiet, quiet.” As Mr. Turx shook his head with an incredulous look on his face, Mr. Trump accused him of having lied that his question would be straight and simple. Mr. Trump said, “I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me. …”

Trump went on to point out his recent meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, and the friendliness of that meeting, adding that Netanyahu could vouch for the fact that he, Trump, is no anti-Semite.

Mr. Trump concluded that Mr. Turx should have relied on Mr. Netanyahu’s endorsement, “instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.” “Just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is,” Mr. Trump said.

Yes. The press is many things.

One thing they can be counted on to be is a source of information. Were Trump to get out of his echo chamber full of bootlicks and suck-ups, availing himself of what the real media offers, he would know about the rash of bomb threats being called into Jewish synagogues, schools, and community centers, since January.

There have also been incidents of graffiti and vandalism against Jewish institutions. All of these things have resulted in FBI investigations and evacuations, in some instances.

This is what Mr. Turk was asking, and he was giving Trump an opportunity to speak out against the ugliness that prompts such hateful actions.

Trump blew it.

It was the second time in two days that Mr. Trump was asked to denounce anti-Semitism and offer American Jews a dose of reassurance. In his joint news conference with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump responded to a question about anti-Semitism by breezily recounting the size of his Electoral College victory and then reminding the reporters that his daughter, Ivanka, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and their three children — Mr. Trump’s grandchildren — are all Jewish. The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement on Thursday that said, “It is mind-boggling why President Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or brush this off as a political distraction.” David Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, said, “Respectfully, Mr. President, please use your bully pulpit not to bully reporters asking questions potentially affecting millions of fellow Americans, but rather to help solve a problem that, for many, is real and menacing.”

To be very fair, nobody with Ami Magazine feels Trump is an anti-Semite, and they are generally supportive of him, based on his stated support of Israel.

They’re even more willing to assume yesterday’s incident was just a misunderstanding, rather than Trump being a self-absorbed, abusive jerk.

After the news conference, Mr. Turx, a pen name, said that he had had conversations on Thursday evening with White House staff members and that he and members of the Orthodox Jewish community were “extremely confident” that the White House would give “the proper help, guidance and collaboration” on anti-Semitism.

And that is a graceful response to the abuse and derision he was forced to publicly endure.

Let’s hope somebody conveys the message to Trump and that he responds with a bit of uncharacteristic maturity and thoughtfulness.Pretty much NOT what needs to happen.

Speaking with the Washington Examiner (mainly because few, outside of some of the alt-right nightmare sites will still speak to him), former Trump adviser, Roger Stone, promised that the world would see more unscripted Trump pressers, because that’s what his fan base wants to see.

“All of my other clients have been career politicians and therefore they were more scripted and more coached and more programmed,” said Stone. “That’s not the case with Donald Trump. He is his own man. He’s happy to listen to advice but at the end of the day he decides what’s best and he chooses his own message so you don’t have the scripted nature of it.” “It’s much more genuine,” he said. “So, if you’re a political consultant for Donald Trump, your job is to give your best advice but at the end of the day he can choose whether he wants to agree or disagree.”

Stone was speaking of President Trump’s Thursday press conference, that saw him drift from announcing his labor secretary pick, Alexander Acosta, to bragging about his election win (while giving false information about his Electoral College count), to attacking Hillary Clinton and mainly, the media.

Stone said Trump’s relationship with the news media, which characterized much of his campaign, is unlikely to change. “The majority of the voters are now getting their news from somebody other than the three networks and the two cable networks and the major national newspapers,” he said. “In terms of his criticism of CNN, I think he’s right on the money. They’ve ceased to be a news organization and now they’re an opinion operation.”

And Stone probably isn’t saying that out of bitterness, at all.

CNN, along with MSNBC banned Stone from appearing on their networks because of abusive and sometimes racist rhetoric.

Among the random, unscripted moments from Trump, there was the moment he berated a young, Jewish reporter for Ami Magazine. I wrote about that earlier.

This would have been a perfect moment for Trump to really show off his level of maturity and compassion, speaking on a troubling rise of anti-Semitism in the nation. What’s more, the reporter who asked was from a friendly outlet, and the reporter attempted to frame his question in a way that allowed for Trump to hear that he was on his side.

But, off-the-cuff, or something.

Keep giving that bad advice, Stone. This can only hurt Trump, in the long run.Donald Trump and his band of tough guys on what used to be the right love to brag about speaking openly and honestly and damn the consequences. If you don’t like it, you can just GET OUT!

David French has a perfect summary of this phenomenon which he calls “The Tough-Guy Right.”

So when Trump deleted a Tweet earlier today, yes DELETED, you have to wonder if the Alpha Keyboard finally typed something even the internet army wasn’t ready for. Here’s the deleted tweet:

So which adviser told Trump to take this down? Now deleted. pic.twitter.com/NUKF6h7sbt — Michael Schwab (@michaelschwab13) February 17, 2017

You would be hard-pressed to find a conservative, a republican, or a Trumpublican who would call the media fair, balanced, even-handed, objective, and rational in all things. That they work from and for the left is hardly in doubt. But having the President of the United States declare them an enemy of the state (and by name!) is (or should be) a bit too much. Too far.

So surely he deleted it for that reason, right?

But no, sorry. It seems the tough typing, safe behind a computer bravado knows no bounds.

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

Yes it looks like he just forgot to add ABC News and wanted to be inclusive.

He really is the king of Twitter trolls. And contrary to what his loudmouth minions on social media think, that’s not remotely a compliment. Although they do do their tough talk remotely.Trending

The consumer price index is up 2.5% over the past 12 months, the highest inflation rate in four years.

Buffeted by slow growth and too few decent paying jobs, Americans now have to deal with more inflation.

In January, consumer prices rose 0.6%. Although that was driven by a surge in energy prices not likely to repeat, core inflation — prices less food and energy — has been greater than the Fed’s target of 2% for the last year.

Yet, economic growth is not likely to accelerate enough to support wages that rise as fast as prices going forward.

Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and reforms, infrastructure and deregulation initiatives are likely to face a host of obstacles. Those include congressional Republican opposition to further increasing the budget deficit, opposition from adversely affected parties like Wal-Mart and other retailers regarding border tax adjustments, and legal challenges to executive orders — for example, easing labor market and financial regulations.

America's 75 million baby boomers have piled up more debt while holding less savings than generations before them, a mix that is crimping their hopes of a comfortable retirement.

The Federal Reserve will be faced with an uncomfortable choice — raise rates too quickly to combat inflation or continue printing more money in hopes of further supporting economic growth.

Here are four things to know about higher inflation.

1. More Money Won’t Boost Growth

Much of what caused the financial crisis and slow growth has not been fixed. Big banks are still too big to fail and without a structural solution — namely breaking up the largest institutions and reinstating Glass-Steagall — deregulation or simply lax enforcement of existing rules by former Wall Street executives, who made fortunes making deals and trading, poses new risks.

Subsidized Chinese products are still flooding U.S. markets, destroying good-paying manufacturing jobs, and Trump is backing off his campaign promise to directly challenge Chinese protectionism.

Similarly, oil prices are up enough to soon increase U.S. shale production to 2015 levels — drilling activity has risen significantly since May. However, Trump will face considerable political opposition and years of legal challenges if he tries to boost drilling activity in the Gulf and elsewhere offshore. That will leave the United States dependent on imported oil, and send consumer dollars abroad instead of creating jobs here.

Absent fixes for those problems — and promised tax cuts — the Fed going slow on interest-rate increases will enable more inflation but won’t do much to boost growth.

2. Easy Money and High Inflation Steals from the Elderly

Easy money pushes down rates on CDs where many retired Americans park savings to supplement Social Security and pensions.

Even with the Federal Reserve pushing up the fed funds rate 0.5 to 0.75 percentage points this year, the rush of foreign capital into U.S. markets will likely keep long rates low, as it did when Ben Bernanke pushed up short rates in 2004-2006.

Hence short-term CDs will pay a bit more than in recent years but rates on 5- and 10-year deposits are not likely to increase much — none will likely rise enough to compensate for higher inflation.

3. Federal Policies Make Too Much Inflation Certain

Many households have only one practical source for high-speed Internet and cable TV, but the government does not regulate cable companies as it does electric utilities. Rates have risen rapidly in recent years.

Health-care inflation is not likely to abate whether Obamacare stays in place, or the Republican Party successfully replaces it with other forms of subsidies to purchase insurance.

Top private universities and a few elite public institutions have a lock on most good-paying jobs for graduates. Those schools have boosted tuition far more rapidly than even health-care costs. That sets the pace for other schools, and the Trump team is not likely to intervene in their monopoly pricing.

Federal policies permit prescription-drug manufacturers to charge much higher prices than in Europe but don’t permit consumers to legally import drugs and force competition. Here we may see some presidential leadership for reform but progress will be slow.

4. A Higher Minimum Wage Will Only Make Matters Worse

When President Barack Obama proposed a $10.10 minimum wage in 2014, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that would destroy about 500,000 jobs. Now absent any change in the federal wage floor, many states have gone into business for themselves — some mandating even more aggressive pay increases.

Some restaurants and other labor-intensive establishments will shutter, but most will find better ways to use smart machines and save labor.

Although those holding minimum-wage jobs will earn more, all those extra unemployed workers will push down wages of workers earning near the minimum. Floor managers at fast-food restaurants will have fewer people to supervise but end up accepting barely above new minimum wages to work.Florida has been the target of two mass shootings in the past nine months; the Orlando Nightclub shooting which left 49 dead and the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting which left 5 dead.

In hopes of preventing yet another tragedy, two Republican state lawmakers introduced legislation this week that would eliminate gun free zones in the state.

Florida law currently lists over a dozen locations in which guns are prohibited, including seaports, patrol stations, jails and prisons, police stations, courthouses, polling places, schools, sports stadiums, airports and places where alcohol is served like bars and clubs.

If House Bill 803 or Senate Bill 908 is approved, Florida residents with a concealed carry permit – of which there are over 1.7 million – will be allowed to carry wherever they please…almost.

Federally imposed restrictions will still apply, and private property owners will still have the power to dictate whether guns are allowed on their premises.

Rep. Don Hahnfeldt, sponsor of HB 803, told the Miami Herald that “gun-free zones have been a failure” in the state and across the country.

“This [HB 803] gives these businesses and institutions an opportunity to better protect themselves, their place of business, their employees and their guests in the event of an unfortunate incident, so that maybe the next Pulse, the next Fort Lauderdale…may not happen,” he said.

Similarly, Sen. Dennis Baxley, sponsor of SB 908, said, “Perpetrators of violence do not care what your rules are…This bill eliminates the sterile target we have created with noble intentions.”

Of course, gun control advocates disagree, arguing that the bill will instead create more violence.

“These gun-happy legislators have gone too far. They are endangering the public, not protecting it,” Patti Brigham, co-chairwoman of the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, told the Miami Herald. “The idea of allowing permit-holders to take their guns into bars is absurd and incredibly dangerous. And just why would we want permit-holders to take guns into polling places?”

Unfortunately for Brigham, HB 803 and SB 908 aren’t the only pro-gun bills up for debate in the Republican-held Florida legislature this year.Historically the communications responsibility in the White House has been split between two people. A communications director who sips good bourbon and thinks big brain thoughts and a pinata press secretary who gets fed to the news media every day at noon like some pagan sacrifice. Since January 20, Sean Spicer has been filling both roles and it shows. He is being consumed by the daily press battles and messaging for the administration on what it is doing is simply being lost as you have several surrogates spinning conflicting stories. According to press reports, that is set to change:

Crossroads Media founder Mike Dubke is expected to be named as White House Communications Director, two administration officials tell CNN. The appointment is expected to be announced as early as Friday, the officials say. The expected appointment is rankling some inside the White House, with longtime Trump loyalists inside and outside the West Wing saying they would have preferred a veteran from the campaign. “Dubke and his Crossroads friends did everything they could to kill the Trump movement and failed,” one loyalist said.

Am told Mike Dubke will be comms director, which @Acosta just reported. Here he is hiding in plain sight at Trump presser 2 over from Spicer pic.twitter.com/Mc7Bfd67kw — Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) February 17, 2017

Crossroads Media is a GOP focused communications company that has represented a lot of candidates, like Rick Perry and Greg Abbott, and trade groups and corporations. It is best known as the ad maker for Karl Rove’s American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS. That is where the butthurt of some Trump loyalists is coming in. Rove was not a big Trump fan this past election cycle and even though Crossroads Media, according to this report, did not develop anti-Trump ads, the Rove stink is still there. (More Dubke info.)

Dubke will bring some critical communications expertise to the White House and it seems to be another indication that Mike Pence is slowly but surely establishing control of the day-to-day White House operations as Priebus, Spicer, and now Dubke, are much closer to Pence than they are to the Bannon-Miller team.It’s okay to hate that Donald J. Trump is currently in the White House. What is not okay is being hurtful towards his family who have not involved themselves in his politics, namely his youngest son, Barron, and youngest daughter, Tiffany.

Apparently, the same people who have made the definition of bullying fluid and petty are perfectly fine with engaging in veritable middle school “mean girl” bullying tactics at New York City’s Fashion Week shows.

Nobody wants to sit next to Tiffany Trump at Philipp Plein, so they moved and the seats by her are empty. pic.twitter.com/XcxNYI6Kf8 — Christina Binkley (@BinkleyOnStyle) February 14, 2017

While it was later reported that Miss Trump wasn’t alone for long, the women who moved away from her did so because they didn’t want to sit next to her or end up in photographs with the daughter of Donald Trump.

“She was surrounded by photographers, and the two women who moved were leaning away — they clearly didn’t want to be in those photographs,” says Binkley, who was seated a few seats down from the first daughter.

Regardless, one co-host of ABC’s The View — not exactly a Republican friendly place — is reaching out to Tiffany Trump and offering to sit by her at the next fashion show.

Watch:

It’s nice to know that there are still some who can see the intolerance and bullying that the people who moved out of their seats because they just couldn’t stand sitting next to a Trump.

Tiffany Trump responded via Twitter with a happy acceptance of the offer.

Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg I'd love to sit with you too! 😊 — Tiffany Ariana Trump (@TiffanyATrump) February 15, 2017It’s the kind of thing you should expect when you elect a proven-corrupt, incompetent governor, such as North Carolina’s bumbling mess, Roy Cooper.

Cooper took office after a skin-tight, dubious victory over Governor Pat McCrory, and immediately set to work, in attempts to bring down all the good McCrory and the Republican-led state legislature put in place.

He has flirted with the expansion of Medicaid in the state, against state law.

He has recently proposed a “compromise” for repeal of the controversial bathroom law, HB2, that basically was no compromise, at all. At least, not one that people who don’t want their children exposed to the opposite sex in public bathrooms could be comfortable with.

Now, it appears that Cooper, himself, hasn’t just danced close to the edge of an ethical and legal abyss, but so are those he brought with him to Raleigh.

At least four of his cabinet nominees have been cautioned that they risk running afoul of ethics laws.

From WRAL.com:

Dr. Mandy Cohen, Anthony Copeland, Susi Hamilton and Michael Regan, who have been tapped to head the departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Natural and Cultural Resources and Environmental Quality, respectively, all received letters from North Carolina’s State Ethics Commission saying reviewers found the “potential for a conflict of interest” due either to properties they own or certain business relationships. “Governor Cooper has appointed a diverse cabinet with deep experience in their respective fields,” Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said. “These leaders have publicly reported their economic interests in accordance with state law, and Governor Cooper is confident that they will serve North Carolina with distinction.” Senators say the items highlighted by the Ethics Commission are the kind of potential problems they would like to ask about during planned confirmation hearings, which Cooper has sued to halt. “That’s the sort of thing I think it’s fair for us to inquire about,” Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger said Thursday. Berger, R-Rockingham, and other senators have said they want to reschedule cabinet confirmation hearings in light of a recent court order removing an injunction on the process. Cooper and his administration say that, while a three-judge panel has refused to grant a preliminary injunction to the law, that same panel has made clear confirmation hearings should go forward.

Of course, Cooper is spitting and kicking at the thought of his nominees going through a confirmation process, calling it a “power grab,” but Republican lawmakers point out that it is a nonpartisan effort, crafted to curb any unforeseen conflicts arising that would disrupt the government.

Three of Cooper’s cabinet secretaries – the heads of Administration, Military and Veterans Affairs and Public Safety – were found to have no potential conflicts, while Transportation Secretary Jim Trogden has not yet received his Ethics Commission review, according to the Governor’s Office. Nominees to lead the Revenue and Information Technology departments haven’t been named yet. Senate Rules Chairman Bill Rabon, R-Brunswick, said that senators have been “given the green light” to push ahead with confirmation of Cooper’s nominees. Cooper’s lawyers argue that the governor has until May to give lawmakers official notice of his appointments.

You would think this willingness to move forward would be welcomed by Cooper.

“As the court found on Monday, the Senate cannot begin their ‘advise and consent’ process until Governor Cooper formally submits his cabinet to the legislature. By statute, the governor has until May 15 to do so,” Porter said. Rabon says that notion defies common sense. “If you put your hand on the Bible and you’re sworn in, you’re getting a paycheck and the two best newspapers in the area have you on the front page, then you’re probably who we think you are,” Rabon said.

Rabon makes a solid point. Cooper has nothing to lose by letting the confirmation hearings move forward with those picks he has ready to go.

Cooper has taken the warnings from the Ethics Commission as some sort of an indictment against his administration, so he’s reacting defensively.

The reality is, as expressed by experts in North Carolina politics, the back and forth, the warnings and evaluations are common. There has been nothing found in any of those Cabinet picks that would prevent them from stepping into their roles. All that is expected of them is that they are cognizant of the potential ethical snags and take steps to avoid them.

The statements coming from the Ethics Commission are based on things like statements of economic interest that are filed ahead of taking office, land ownership, outside business activities, the business relationships of spouses, and any other financial dealings the nominee may have.

For example, Hamilton noted on her form that her husband, Stephen, works for Wilmington’s parks department. The commission cited that fact in its letter evaluating Hamilton. By and large, the conflicts cited by the commission include experience that would equip people for their posts: Cohen’s husband is a partner in a law firm with a health care practice area, although he primarily handles matters related to federal health policy.

Copeland is a partner with the Williams Mullen law firm, where his practice focused on economic development.

Hamilton is a board member for the Cucalorus Film Festival, which has received grants from the North Carolina Arts Council, which is in turn overseen by the Department of Cultural and Natural Resources.

Regan headed his own environmental consulting firm and was a vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit that lobbies for environmental preservation.

So the potential is there. Asking that the nominees go through a basic confirmation process, in the interest of propriety should be welcomed by Cooper and his Democrat cohorts.

It should be, but given that they went to the lengths they went to, in their efforts to rip the governorship from Republican hands, and then finding a brick wall, by way of the North Carolina General Assembly waiting on them, I guess pouting is expected as their default on any commonsense moves by Republicans.The Associated Students of Madison issued a resolution which says that the University of Wisconsin should provide free tuition and housing for black students because of slavery.

Black students should be offered free tuition and housing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison because blacks were legally barred from education during slavery and university remains out of reach for black students today, the student government said Wednesday.

Not only do they think black students deserve a free ride at Wisconsin, they think that admission standards shouldn’t apply them either. Apparently they don’t believe black students can compete academically without lowering the bar.

The Associated Students of Madison said in a resolution that students from suburban high schools are overrepresented. The group said consideration of ACT and SAT scores in applications restricts opportunities for the poor and thus upholds “white supremacy.”

I suppose university admissions should be based totally on how needy someone is and how rough their ancestors had it.

The resolution demands free access to the university for all black people, including former inmates. That means free tuition, free housing and no fees, Mack said. That would save a black resident undergraduate student about $20,000 a year. The resolution goes on to call for the university to use 10 percent of donations to bolster financial aid and study the feasibility of test-optional and geographically weighted admissions. The language mirrors demands that the Black Liberation Collective, a national network of black youth focused on higher education, has made to nearly 90 campuses across the country.

The Black Liberation Collective—as one might expect from anything calling itself a “liberation collective”—looks like just another identity politics front organization fighting for socialism. The bulk of their website consists of statements that begin with “We demand…” with the occasional raised fist logo. This is their mission statement:

The Black Liberation Collective is dedicated to building infrastructure for Black students around the globe to build power, using an intersectional lens, in order to make our campuses safe for all Black students. The Black Liberation Collective is also committed to working collectively with Black organizers across the country and globe to bringing about freedom and liberation for all Black people.

“Building infrastructure?” I’m not clear on whether they’re using that phrase figuratively or if they literally want to build separate campus infrastructure for black students, which is entirely possible. They tout their general social justice warrior bonafides in a description of their “framework.”

In our organizing we believe in centering those that experience intersecting identities which make them particularly vulnerable to various forms of violence and oppression, including cis and trans Black women, Black queer folks, gender non-conforming Black folks, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated Black folks, Black folks that are undocumented, and working class Black folks.

The Associated Students of Madison is a a student government organization and is responsible for allocating about $43 million in student fees every year.

The Associated Students of Madison (ASM) is composed of roughly 50 elected or appointed students, 50 student employees, 12 professional staff members, and 200 student appointees on committees that hold legal rights to recommend university policies, budgets, and candidates for UW employment.

The student government calls the University’s commitment to diversity and race relations “empty promises.” They’re not without their critics though.

Asked for comment on the resolution, Mike Mikalsen, an aide to state Sen. Steve Nass — a Republican and one of the university’s most outspoken critics — responded by calling ASM a waste of student fees.

Not every student is on board either.

Chinese graduate student Yuhong Zhu said the resolution is awkward and he’d rather see more scholarships than a blanket offer of free access. “I wouldn’t appreciate if the school offered me free tuition just because I’m a minority,” he said. “We should at least have to work hard for it.” Jared Akers, a white student at the school, said the resolution was “odd” and that free access for blacks was unfair. “That,” he said, “kind of seems like a handout more than doing them any favors.”

This isn’t about doing favors for anyone. It’s about exploiting racial tensions and shaping the malleable brains of college students to advance the cause of socialism.As soon as the news breaks, it is debunked by two separate entities mentioned directly in the story: Sean Spicer has tweeted out the story that the Department of Homeland Security is NOT thinking about tapping 100,000 National Guard troops to assist with immigration enforcement.

This is not true. DHS also confirms it is 100% false https://t.co/MFIJci7XaU — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 17, 2017

The denials are raising questions, as the AP’s original story states they asked both entities, the White House and DHS, for comment.

"AP reporter noted they asked multiple times before publication" https://t.co/AmZxu6qhBa — Elahe Izadi (@ElaheIzadi) February 17, 2017

Is it another case of fake news? Or is the administration reacting quickly to a story it doesn’t think will bring good PR?If any of you saw Trump’s press conference yesterday and struggled with making sense out of it all, you’re not the only ones.

At some point, you probably checked to make sure you hadn’t actually stumbled across a rebroadcast of Saturday Night Live.

The supposed purpose of the conference was to talk about Trump’s new labor secretary pick, Alexander Acosta. What transpired was far less about Acosta (who was more of a footnote to the presser, than the actual topic), and far more about everything else, but ultimately, it was all about Trump. Again.

“I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos,” Trump told reporters. “Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.” “Tomorrow, they will say, ‘Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,’” Trump added. “I’m not ranting and raving.” “I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it.”

Ranting and raving would be something, at least.

The president briefly spoke about Acosta, but then went on to attack the media, calling them “fake news,” or “very fake news.”

He talked about blowing Russian ships out of the water and nuclear war with Russia.

We can at least take some comfort in that he said those would be bad things.

He asked a veteran reporter, April Ryan, if she was friends with the Congressional Black Caucus (Ryan is black), and if she could set up a meeting with them.

Honestly, it would be easy to assume he was asking her that because she was black (all black people are friends with other black people kind of thing), or we could give him the benefit of the doubt and say that because she brought it up, he was being glib and asking her to set up a meeting.

He talked about the mess he inherited, which is always pointless to hear from politicians taking office. Most of them run on the premise that things are a mess and they’re the only ones that can fix it. Trump was no different.

Trump also erroneously stated – again – that he had the biggest Electoral College win since Reagan. When it was pointed out that George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama all had bigger Electoral College wins, he blew it off that this was just information that was given to him.

Translation: This was info from a meme he saw on Twitter.

By every rational account, this press conference was surreal. More than anything, it was just a random excuse for Trump to pimp his “brand” of the presidency, once again.

That didn’t stop the sycophants from sycophanting, however.

Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

Rush Limbaugh, someone I used to respect, breathlessly praised the chaos.

“Just what the doctor ordered,” he said. “This is Donald Trump going over the head of the media right to the American people, advancing his domestic agenda and being totally transparent with these people.” “They don’t know how to get on the same stage that he’s on,” the conservative commentator added. “The American people are gonna eat this up when they see it.”

Indeed.

I saw tweets from some of Trump’s loyal cultists referring to it as the “best news conference” they’d ever seen. Which leads me to believe it was the only news conference they’d ever seen.

This morning, Trump, from the comfort of his ego-bubble, tweeted out his thanks to Limbaugh for such devotion to bootlicking.

How long can the “fake media” shtick protect him? He’s a month in and even though he’s had several good picks, he’s also stepped in it just as many times. People like Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and that goon with Gateway Pundit are not helping him face reality.

But then, he wasn’t elected based on reality, was he?Earlier today the Associated Press ran a facially ridiculous story about a plan to use National Guard troops to round up illegal aliens. This is the tweet:

BREAKING: Trump administration considers mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants. — The Associated Press (@AP) February 17, 2017

Read it carefully.

The obvious fallacy here is that it implies that the National Guard troops will be federalized (note the word mobilized) for this project. While a governor can use the National Guard for most anything he wishes so long as it remains paid for by the state and under state control, once National Guard troops are mobilized they are de facto and de jure federal troops and indistinguishable from the Regular Army. The obvious legal barrier to this plan is the Posse Comitatus Act which forbids the use of federal troops in a law enforcement role.

This is the lede from the story:

The Trump administration considered a proposal to mobilize as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border, according to a draft memo obtained by The Associated Press. Staffers in the Department of Homeland Security said the proposal had been discussed as recently as last Friday. The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. Four states that border on Mexico were included in the proposal — California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas — but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four — Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday the document was “not a White House document.” “There is no effort to do what is potentially suggested,” he said. Spicer called the AP report “100 percent not true, adding that there was “no effort at all to utilize the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants.”

After some delay the AP finally produced the actual memo. This is a screen grab of the relevant portion:

If you're wondering why AP refused to provide the full memo, or even to directly quote it, it's because the memo contradicts AP's narrative. — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 17, 2017

I'm trying to imagine scenario where what AP did in reporting "draft immigration EO" isn't wild, flagrant, motivated malpractice. Failing. — Jeff B/DDHQ (@EsotericCD) February 17, 2017

These news orgs, btw, are screaming about not getting questions at pressers. Maybe if the AP were as accurate as Katie Pavlich they would. — Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 17, 2017

I can't say whether @AP @garanceburke deliberately lied about the scope of the memo, but I can say they wildly mischaracterized it. — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 17, 2017

The memo clearly refers to the 287(g) program. It is a law that was enacted in 1996 that allows certain state officials to act as immigration enforcement officers once they’ve received the requisite training and if they work under the supervision of an immigration officer. There is no mention of “100,000” National Guard troops. There is no mention of “mobilization.” In fact the memo clearly states just the opposite:

Pursuant to Title 32 of the United States Code, State National Guard components are employees of their respective states and are under the command of their Governors when they are not in federal service. Based on their training and experience, these men and women are particularly well-suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by Department components. To maximize participation by state and local jurisdictions in the enforcement of federal immigration law, I am directing the Director of ICE to engage with all willing and qualified law enforcement jurisdictions for the purpose of entering into agreements under section 287(g) of the

The memo, to the extent it even mentions the National Guard, talks about them in the context of a voluntary expansion of a 20-year-old program.

I didn't realize until now that I took AP's deportation characterization for granted. And yet deportation is never mentioned in the memo. — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 17, 2017

At no point does the DHS memo ever recommend using the National Guard to deport anyone. The entire focus is apprehension of criminal aliens. — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 17, 2017

An amazing fact about the DHS memo that I didn't realize until now: deportation is never mentioned. National Guard language *excludes* it. pic.twitter.com/nmMdoAzVoc — Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 17, 2017

Okay I've read the DHS memo and my provisional take is that @seanmdav's harsh reaction to AP coverage was right and mine was wrong. — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February 17, 2017

What the AP did on this was simply manufacture a bullsh** story out of whole cloth. Their story misrepresents the memo it purports to report on and simply makes some stuff up. And yet the media continues to try to play the victim despite.We’ve n0w had more than twenty four hours filled with analysis of the yesterday’s stream of Trump-sciousness press conference. Most of it boils down to “People who love Trump love watching Trump attack news reporters.” We’ve already known that for quite a while though.

I get it. Nothing appeals to a blogger like slam dunking a reporter peddling a bogus story that advances the left’s agenda. The satisfaction comes from exposing them by telling the real story. The truth.

Biased media is infuriating. It’s Orwellian. I understand why people hate the establishment media and get a jolt of schadenfreude when Trump calls them liars.

Beyond that I don’t understand why it is treated by so many like some sort of victory. I think anyone who believes what Trump does will somehow make the media more truthful and impartial is delusional.

Other than entertaining people who are already 100% behind him, he accomplishes nothing by rambling on about how terrible and dishonest the media is. Especially considering that when he does it, his spiel is usually peppered with misstatements or falsehoods which they can then spend hours on TV pointing out to their audience and telling them how unhinged their President is.

As much as his supporters are reveling in Trump’s aggressive disdain for the press, he won’t win that fight. They’ve got 24 hours a day in which to tear him down. Trump has the occasional press conference to address his dissatisfaction and if every one of those becomes a full blown complaint session about how they cover him, he’s going to forever be portrayed as a buffoon. His die hard supporters like the ones who will show up at his rally in Florida tomorrow will go on enjoying the show but the people who voted for him only because he wasn’t Hillary won’t defend him forever.

Politicians like Newt Gingrich or Ted Cruz—or even Lindsey Graham—have been combative with the news media as well but the difference is that they could enunciate why reporters’ questions are flawed or based on false premises. When they lecture the media, they’re teaching. Maybe the reporters aren’t learning anything but someone watching probably is.

Gingrich dressed down reporters as a candidate like a tough professor grading a student. Trump is more like a man beating a dog with a rolled up newspaper for barking too much two days ago. All the dog learns is this is a human that hits me so I’m going to bark louder at him next time I see him.

The reporter lectured by Gingrich might not be convinced of anything but he’ll at least learn to approach Gingrich differently and tighten up his questioning. Trump’s approach only asks for more of the same. The press gets indignant but they certainly don’t feel as if they’ve been justifiably chastised. The only way Trump comes out ahead is if he convinces people not to pay attention to the mainstream press altogether.

How likely is that? Not very if he can’t deliver substance to back up the emotion.Yesterday, I posted on why the media has not right to expect to be treated as anything but a hostile force by the administration so long as it deliberately positions itself as the opposition party. Jay Caruso followed up with an analysis of a couple of fatuous tweets by the fatuous Chuck Todd on why we should all be exercised over Trump basically ignoring them. The stupid condensed and crystallized last evening on ABC News:

.@matthewjdowd says press conference gave "amazing and spectacular insight" into Pres. Trump and his state of mind today. pic.twitter.com/PM9jHf3oVi — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 16, 2017

Via the Daily Caller:

During Wednesday’s press conference, Trump limited questions to two non-mainstream media outlets: the Christian Broadcasting Network and Townhall. Dowd argued that Trump is “shutting down part of the First Amendment by not taking questions that are going to be any way antagonistic in this.” “I think he thinks relying on his Twitter feed, and sending it out to the millions of people that subscribe to it, and then dealing with very cozy press in this is going to be the way to get through this,” Dowd said.

To put the best possible face on this is to call it bullsh**. While the press is given special protections under the US Constitution the press has no constitutional role to play in our governance. For the first 130 years of the Republic presidents did not give press conferences. The presidential press conference is an invention of Woodrow Wilson. Whether Trump has press conferences or takes questions is irrelevant to just about everyone in the nation except to the news media. What Boyle is demanding is that Trump provide not merely responses to questions that he may not want to answer, which is bizarre enough, but that he provide the media with free content that they will then repackage… in a way guaranteed to show the administration negatively… and sell. While I understand why Boyle is upset, it is more than a little unclear to me why Trump should go along with that and how the Constitution is offended by this any more than it is damaged by the Jerry Springer Show being off the air.Now, this is a pretty delicate topic, considering that, yeah, he’s the President of the United States and his family does in fact need protection. However, do they need to continue living such an extravagant lifestyle at the expense of the taxpayer?

That’s, at least, the question posed by the Washington Post. And, before you criticize me for going with something the Mainstream Media reports, they directly quote Judicial Watch, a right-leaning advocacy group.

In New York, the city is paying $500,000 a day to guard Trump Tower, according to police officials’ estimates, an amount that could reach $183 million a year. This month, The Post reported that Secret Service and U.S. embassy staffers paid nearly $100,000 in hotel-room bills to support Eric Trump’s trip to promote a Trump-brand condo tower in Uruguay.

That’s a lot. Sure, Obama had some expensive vacations – a single family trip to Hawaii alone cost taxpayers more than $4 million. But, $183 million per year? That’s an insane amount. And that’s where Judicial Watch comes in.

“This is an expensive way to conduct business, and the president should recognize that,” said Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, which closely tracked President Barack Obama’s family vacation costs and said that it intends to continue the effort for the Trump administration. “The unique thing about President Trump is that he knows what it costs to run a plane.” Fitton added, noting that Trump should consider using the presidential retreat of Camp David, a short helicopter ride from the White House, or even his golf course in Northern Virginia. Of Mar-a-Lago, Fitton said, “Going down there ain’t free.”

This is a problem for small-government, fiscal conservatives. A runaway government addicted to spending, with deficits and debt all around, is taking on another massive cost both at the local and the federal level. The sad part is that conservatives who frequently got on to Barack Obama for that Hawaii vacation (and every other vacations) will say nothing about this cost, which far exceeds the Obamas.

Fitton is right that all this is a known quantity to Donald Trump. He knows what these things cost, and yet he is determined to spend a lot of time in the “Winter White House” at Mar-a-Lago, as well as New York, and he knows his family’s lifestyle won’t get any less extravagant.

It’s unfortunate, because there will inevitably be good fiscal conservatives who will otherwise twist themselves in complex (and illegal in some states) ways just to defend it.BREAKING. Nation Breathes A Sigh Of Relief As Entire Senior Staff Of State Department Walks Out...Make That FIRED | RedStateThe only way any of President Trump’s appointees are going to have much success in Washington is if they can “fundamentally transform” each of their respective departments. It looks like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is doing just that. Tillerson is shaking up the staff at Foggy Bottom. The NY Post’s Daniel Halper calls it a “bloodbath.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is cleaning house at the State Department, according to a report. Staffers in the offices of deputy secretary of state for management and resources as well as counselor were shown the door Thursday, according to CBS News. Many of those let go were on the building’s seventh floor — top-floor bigs — a symbolically important sign to the rest of the diplomatic corps that their new boss has different priorities than the last one.

This and some earlier firings/resignations last month are setting a new tone. CBS reports that during the recent visit from Israeli PM Netanyahu, there were no officials from the State Department involved in any of the meetings.

This is welcome news.

Of all the Executive Branch agencies, the State Department is probably the one most in need of a serious culture change.Look for this one to be front and center, once Trump’s newly named pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, goes before the Senate during his confirmation hearing.

As a federal prosecutor in Miami, back in 2008, Acosta cut a deal with Jeffrey Epstein – the billionaire investor, accused of having sex with numerous underage girls.

As the U.S. attorney for Southern Florida, Acosta agreed not to file any federal charges against the wealthy financier, Jeffrey Epstein, if he pled guilty to state charges involving soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. Epstein ultimately received an 18-month sentence in county jail and served about 13 months — treatment that provoked outrage from alleged victims in the case.

Epstein has a very dirty past, and some high-named acquaintances. Among those are former President Clinton, and current President Trump.

How excited do you think Senate Democrats will be to draw that line to Trump (while ignoring the Clinton connection)?

Soon after the deal was cut in 2008, two women filed suit claiming that the decision to forgo federal prosecution violated a federal law — the Crime Victims Rights Act — because they and other teenagers Epstein paid for sex were never adequately consulted about the plea deal or given an opportunity to object to it.

Acosta is not part of the suit, but in 2015, lawyers for the women demanded Acosta submit a deposition in the case. That request was later withdrawn, as the two sides talked settlement.

Acosta’s involvement in the saga could be personally or politically awkward for Trump, drawing fresh attention to his ties to Epstein — including the financier’s tenure as a member at Trump’s Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine back in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Another Trump associate offered that Trump and Epstein weren’t particularly close, but rather, Epstein was a member of one of Trump’s clubs.

For his part, Acosta points out that his office was under an immense amount of pressure to strike a deal for Epstein from his formidable defense team.

Of the big names putting pressure on Acosta’s office, were Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz, Florida criminal defense attorney, Roy Black, and former Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.

Acosta went on to say that the prosecution team endured a yearlong assault.

“I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered,” the former U.S. attorney wrote. He said his office stuck to its opening position in the case, but he also acknowledged that the ultimate punishment in the case may have been more lenient than Epstein deserved.

Acosta later wrote:

“Some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher,” Acosta wrote in the letter, posted online by The Daily Beast. “Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view. Many victims have since spoken out, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking damages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had these additional statements and evidence been known, the outcome may have been different. But they were not known to us at the time.”

Ultimately, Acosta wasn’t trying to let a filthy child predator off the hook. He went on to say that he did not approve of the lenient treatment Epstein was reported to have received, while in prison. He added, “”The treatment that he received while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence.”

We can look for Senate Democrats to use this, however.

They’ve pounded other nominees for far less.One of the first things the Trump administration did upon taking office was to order a freeze on implementing regulations and on drafting new regulations that had not yet been published in the Federal Register:

President Trump’s regulatory freeze is in full effect.

Federal agencies are following orders to delay the rules that Obama administration officials finalized before leaving office but that have not yet taken effect.

This week alone, the Department of Health and Human Services delayed two rules: one to protect the privacy of alcohol and drug abusers who seek treatment, and a second to help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protect against the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission delayed a rule it finalized two days before the inauguration requiring federal agencies to enact hiring policies that favor individuals with disabilities.

Last week, the Federal Railroad Administration delayed new safety rules for commuter trains, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture delayed news standards for how animals should be treated if the farmer wishes to sell the meat as certified organic.

Trump’s regulatory freeze began with a government-wide memo that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sent on Jan. 20. The memo advised agency heads to delay rules that had already been published for at least 60 days, pushing most rules back until March 21.

The effect of Trump’s orders has been noticeable in the Federal Register, the daily docket where new and proposed regulations from government agencies are published.

Before Trump took office, the register would often include dozens of regulations at various stages of completion.

Now the docket is short and mostly includes notices about public meetings.Calendar

February 17 – 23, 2017

February 20 – 24: Senate and House takes a nap recess.

recess. February 18 @ 5 pm: Reality star and Presidential hopeful Donald Trump will hold a campaign rally in Florida Saturday. Wait! What? Didn’t he win bigly?

Trump appears to be rallying his minions for a quick ego fix before moving on to his next 26 days. His pre-election Yuge crowds claims are not, I can imagine, impressing some of the senior members of the hush-hush Global Leaders Club. He needs new stats and photos, real pictures, too, not that Fake News crap his National Park Service tweets out!

Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5pm for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport!

“White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday the event was a campaign rally and directed questions about it to ‘the campaign.’ “

Oops! Who pays? Indeed.

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2016

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2016

February 19 @ 8 pm: NBA All-Star Game. Recall the NBA relocated the East meets West exhibition matchup from Charlotte, NC to the Big Easy as punishment for North Carolina’s “bathroom law.”

“As for Sunday’s All-Star Game, the cheapest ticket is $180 — a 75% decrease from last year ($723 three days before event) and a 48% decrease from 2014 ($346). Why the dip in prices? All-Star Weekend was originally supposed to take place in Charlotte, N.C., but was moved in July because of North Carolina’s controversial anti-LGBT law, House Bill 2. The NBA announced the move to New Orleans in August — the third time in 10 years that the city has been selected to host the league’s annual midseason celebration.” – TicketIQ

February 19 @ 3:10 pm: Daytona 500 front row qualifying round setting up for its 59th annual running next Sunday, 26 February.

February 20: Donald Trump’s Liberal enablers are hosting a nationwide event from “Baltimore to Seattle” to celebrate Presidents Day renamed for 2017, “Not My President’s Day.” Clever.

“BAD AND NASTY (aka Bad Hombres and Nasty Women) is a loose knit coalition of artists and activists from the U.S. and beyond who are tired of waking up every morning since Election Day 2016 feeling angry, scared, and sad.” – Huffington Post

February 21: Supreme Court to hear two oral arguments:

Hernandez v. Mesa – The eight Justices of the Supreme Court will hear argument regarding a cross-border shooting involving a US border agent (Jesus Mesa) on US soil killing a Mexican national (Jesus Hernandez) in a US-controlled buffer zone (although legally Mexican soil; think Guantanamo). The question to the court is, under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution is the teen covered against unjustified death. It’s more complex than this, but it is an interesting case specifically because of our current strained relations with Mexico. The argument preview is worth reading.

McLane Company v. EEOC – Specific to an EEOC subpoena for omitted information, the question to the Supreme Court is should the Ninth District Court of Appeals review an EEOC subpoena request de novo (as if first hearing) or defer to lower court decision.

Hey, RedStaters! Welcome back to the WaterCooler. It’s RedState’s only Daily open thread. Supreme Court. Sports. Reality Stars. What goings on next week did I miss on my calendar?Of all the questions asked of President Trump during yesterday’s presser, this one was probably one of the most innocuous, and presented in the most deferential of terms – and Trump still found a way to take offense to it.

In fact, had Trump not been on the defensive as a natural default, and really heard what the young man was asking, this could have been a shining moment for him.

Jake Turx is a young, Hasidic Jew and a correspondent for Ami Magazine, an Orthodox Jewish weekly publication, based out of Brooklyn, New York.

No one from Ami has ever had a seat in the press pool for a presidential press conference, so Mr. Turx was looking at this as a real opportunity.

From the New York Times:

When President Trump called on him at a news conference on Thursday, saying he was looking for a “friendly reporter,” Mr. Turx was prepared. He had spent an hour crafting a question about a recent surge of anti-Semitism, with a preamble that he hoped would convey his supportive disposition toward Mr. Trump. But the exchange did not go the way he expected. A few hours later, with the clip replaying on social media and Jewish groups issuing news releases, Mr. Turx, 30, was still reeling. He said in a telephone interview, “Regretfully, today was a day I wish we could have done over.” His editor, Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter, watched aghast from the magazine’s offices as his young correspondent received a tongue-lashing from the president: “It was a very disheartening moment for us, to watch him being berated.”

And given the context of the question, nobody watching it can come away without scratching their heads and wondering if Trump is well.

He’s not.

He crawled all over this gentleman, based on his assumption of where the question was going.

Again, this could have been a grand moment for him, and no matter what gushing praise the debacle received from Rush Limbaugh or Trump’s favorite crotch-sniffer, Sean Hannity, the reality resembles something more along the lines of a train wreck, with many casualties.

To set the scene, Turx stood and tried to separate himself and his intentions from some of the media, who, just by their nature, may have been less than “friendly” towards a Republican president, and even less so towards this particular president, as he has drawn very clear battle lines between himself, his administration, and them.

“Despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren. You are their zayde,” which is Yiddish for “grandfather” and often a word of great affection. At that Mr. Trump nodded slightly, and said, “thank you.” “However,” Mr. Turx continued, “what we are concerned about and what we haven’t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There’s been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to——” At that, Mr. Trump interrupted, saying it was “not a fair question.” “Sit down,” the president commanded. “I understand the rest of your question.” As Mr. Turx took his seat, Mr. Trump said, “So here’s the story, folks. No. 1, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person.” Mr. Turx tried to interject, realizing how the encounter had turned. He said he had wanted to clarify that he in no way meant to accuse Mr. Trump of anti-Semitism but instead intended to ask what his administration could do to stop the anti-Semitic incidents. But Mr. Trump would not let him speak again, saying, “Quiet, quiet, quiet.” As Mr. Turx shook his head with an incredulous look on his face, Mr. Trump accused him of having lied that his question would be straight and simple. Mr. Trump said, “I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me. …”

Trump went on to point out his recent meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, and the friendliness of that meeting, adding that Netanyahu could vouch for the fact that he, Trump, is no anti-Semite.

Mr. Trump concluded that Mr. Turx should have relied on Mr. Netanyahu’s endorsement, “instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.” “Just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is,” Mr. Trump said.

Yes. The press is many things.

One thing they can be counted on to be is a source of information. Were Trump to get out of his echo chamber full of bootlicks and suck-ups, availing himself of what the real media offers, he would know about the rash of bomb threats being called into Jewish synagogues, schools, and community centers, since January.

There have also been incidents of graffiti and vandalism against Jewish institutions. All of these things have resulted in FBI investigations and evacuations, in some instances.

This is what Mr. Turk was asking, and he was giving Trump an opportunity to speak out against the ugliness that prompts such hateful actions.

Trump blew it.

It was the second time in two days that Mr. Trump was asked to denounce anti-Semitism and offer American Jews a dose of reassurance. In his joint news conference with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump responded to a question about anti-Semitism by breezily recounting the size of his Electoral College victory and then reminding the reporters that his daughter, Ivanka, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and their three children — Mr. Trump’s grandchildren — are all Jewish. The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement on Thursday that said, “It is mind-boggling why President Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or brush this off as a political distraction.” David Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, said, “Respectfully, Mr. President, please use your bully pulpit not to bully reporters asking questions potentially affecting millions of fellow Americans, but rather to help solve a problem that, for many, is real and menacing.”

To be very fair, nobody with Ami Magazine feels Trump is an anti-Semite, and they are generally supportive of him, based on his stated support of Israel.

They’re even more willing to assume yesterday’s incident was just a misunderstanding, rather than Trump being a self-absorbed, abusive jerk.

After the news conference, Mr. Turx, a pen name, said that he had had conversations on Thursday evening with White House staff members and that he and members of the Orthodox Jewish community were “extremely confident” that the White House would give “the proper help, guidance and collaboration” on anti-Semitism.

And that is a graceful response to the abuse and derision he was forced to publicly endure.

Let’s hope somebody conveys the message to Trump and that he responds with a bit of uncharacteristic maturity and thoughtfulness.
