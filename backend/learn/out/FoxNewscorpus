A lost continent that sunk 100 million years ago has been discovered underneath New Zealand.

The sunken world has been dubbed Zealandia as is mostly submerged beneath the South Pacific.

Zealandia stretched 1.9 million square miles and was 94 percent underwater, according to research published in the Geological Society of America’s Journal, GSA Today.

This makes it the size of greater India.

RESEARCHERS SAY LONG-LOST CONTINENT LIES BENEATH INDIAN OCEAN ISLAND

It was part of the Gondwana super-continent but broke away about 100 million years ago, researchers claimed.

New Zealand has never been regarded as part of the Australian continent, although the geographic term Australasia often is used for the collective land and islands of the southwest Pacific region.

But after 20 years of research, scientists believe that the isolated island belonged to its own super land mass.

There is no official body that recognizes new continents, but the scientists believe Zealandia has the same features as the six we are familiar with.

Lead author Nick Mortimer said scientists have been gathering data to make the case for Zealandia for two decades.

FIRST CAME A 'CATASTROPHIC COLLAPSE,' THEN A TSUNAMI

He wrote: “As well as being the seventh largest geological continent, Zealandia is the youngest, thinnest, and most submerged.

“The scientific value of classifying Zealandia as a continent is much more than just an extra name on a list.

“That a continent can be so submerged yet unfragmented makes it a useful and thought-provoking geodynamic end member in exploring the cohesion and breakup of continental crust.”

Discoveries of this kind proves that “the large and the obvious in natural science can be overlooked”, Mortimer concluded.

The students objected to the school’s Institute of Politics’ invitation to former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. They claim that allowing him to speak “normalizes bigotry” and provides a platform for fascism.

Lewandowski did not join the White House staff but by many accounts remains an influential advisor to the president.

The coalition of students from U of C Resists, Graduate Students United, Students Working Against Prisons, and UChicago Socialists claim that the school’s “commitment to free expression” doesn’t require the institution to host him due to his alleged ties to white supremacists and similarly alleged calls to violence against minority groups and refugees.

They told Campus Reform that they did not call for the University to disinvite him, but rather “encouraged [the person who invited him] to reconsider and rescind the invitation,” as if it makes a difference.

In an open letter to the school, the authors state that Lewandowski courted right-wing extremist groups. They also referred to his alleged “assault” of a woman Breitbart journalist during the campaign, among other things.

“Lewandowski is not the first Trump surrogate to be invited to the Institute of Politics. Last month, Sean Spicer, Trump’s Press Secretary and Director of Communications, spoke in the same series,” it states. “By hosting figures like Spicer and Lewandowski the Institute of Politics suggests that the ideas and ideologies they represent are debatable positions within the range of normal politics.”

Free speech, it claims, should not extend to Trump surrogates.

“It sends a positive signal to white supremacists that they are welcome here,” the students declare. “This exposes the most vulnerable members of our community to even greater risk. That is unacceptable.”

In addition to the letter, the student coalition set up a “Bigotry is not Normal” event to protest Lewandowski, in which over a hundred students claimed to have participated on Wednesday. Students set up protest fliers with statements like “This is not dialogue it’s a war.” [sic]

Speaking to The Chicagoist, IoP Executive Director Steve Edwards says that he respects the students’ right to protest but believes it’s necessary to invite guests who can provide insight into Trump’s campaign, adding that ““people are free to contest, criticize, and protest views expressed on campus so long as they do not obstruct or interfere with the freedom of others to express their views.”

The blueberry pie flavor, available exclusively at Target, is made with graham-flavored cookies and a light purple blueberry crème filling. Fruity Crisp Oreos, an unofficial nod to Fruity Pebbles cereal, have a golden cookie shell but with rainbow rice crisps (that supposedly crackle on your tongue) in a plain vanilla crème. Both flavors will hit store shelves in June.The "birth plan" of an ancient Nessie look-alike didn't involve laying a giant egg, but rather delivering a live baby sea monster, a new study finds.

Until now, researchers had thought that the fearsome marine reptile known as Dinocephalosaurus laid eggs, just as birds and crocodiles (its distant relatives) do. But the discovery of the remains of a pregnant, 245-million-year-oldDinocephalosaurus specimen in a Chinese fossil deposit indicates that the reptile gave live birth, the researchers said.

"This is the first-ever evidence of live birth in an animal group previously thought to lay eggs exclusively," said the study's lead researcher, Jun Liu, an associate professor of paleontology at the Hefei University of Technology in China. [Image Gallery: Ancient Monsters of the Sea]

Researchers discovered the specimen of the pregnant Dinocephalosaurus in southwestern China's Luoping Biota National Geopark in 2008. During its lifetime in the middle Triassic period, the 13-foot-long marine reptile would have swum throughout the shallow seas of ancient southern China.

Dinocephalosaurus had a long neck and sharp teeth. "It was a fish eater, snaking its long neck from side to side to snatch its prey," Liu told Live Science. "It looks superficially like the legendary Nessie ."

Ancient embryo

The researchers discovered a fossilized Dinocephalosaurus embryo in the mother's abdomen. The fetus was small — about 12 percent of its mother's body size — but large enough for scientists to discern that its anatomy (for instance, a long neck and elongated ribs) was similar to that of the adult Dinocephalosaurus, the researchers said.

Still, the researchers went to great lengths to determine that the bundle of bones was, in fact, an embryo. First, they noted that the embryo was enclosed within the mother's body, which excluded the possibility that a foreign animal fell on top of her and then fossilized. Second, the embryo's neck was pointing forward. Usually, sea creatures swallow prey headfirst; the mother even had a partially digested fish, whose head was facing backward in her abdomen, the researchers noted.

"The neck-forward position of the embryonic skeleton suggests that the included skeleton was not ingested prey , but was an embryo," the researchers wrote in the study.

Finally, the embryo was curled in a fetal position, just like other known vertebrate embryos during development, the researchers said.

Egg-laying animals typically deposit eggs holding embryos that are much less developed than the one found inside the mother Dinocephalosaurus, the research team noted. In addition, the researchers said that they did not see any evidence of an eggshell near the embryo, further supporting the idea that the Dinocephalosaurus gave live birth, they said.

Reptilian evolution

Dinocephalosaurus was an archosauromorph (Greek for "ruling lizard form"), a relative of the group that includes crocodiles, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, including birds. The new discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the Archosauromorpha group by 50 million years, Liu said.

In addition, the discovery solves a mystery about egg laying in most archosauromorphs. Previously, researchers were unsure whether archosauromorphs had genetic or developmental barriers preventing live birth, but now they know there isn't a barrier — most archosauromorphs just evolved to lay eggs, Liu said. [Photos: Ancient Pterosaur Eggs & Fossils Uncovered in China]

The finding is an "extraordinary" one, and demonstrates how "evolution never really attains the optimal solution," said Kenneth Lacovara, a professor of paleontology and the dean of the School of Earth and Environment at Rowan University in New Jersey, who was not involved in the study. "It obtains the best solution possible based on the current situation."

The finding shows that "egg laying in the group that spans crocodiles to birds is not a deficit of their nature," Lacovara told Live Science. "It appears to be a strength. The alternative was possible, but that was not selected for."

Moreover, the fossils show that "Dinocephalosaurus determined the sex of its babies genetically," Liu said. "This is a noteworthy finding given that its closest extant [living] relatives, turtles and crocodilians, determine the sex of their offspring by environmental temperatures."

Live birth (known as viviparity) has evolved independently at least 115 times in living lizards and snakes, and at least once in the common ancestor of mammals, the researchers said. However, Dinocephalosaurus is hardly the only ancient marine reptile that gave live birth; a 182-million-year-old ichthyosaur fossil shows that a mother died during a breech birth, Live Science reported previously .

The new study was published online Tuesday (Feb. 14) in the journal Nature Communications.

Original article on Live Science.Volunteers at Boston Medical Center are helping babies who were exposed to drugs while in the womb heal faster with the power of human touch. The volunteer cuddlers are part of the hospital’s CALM program, which helps newborns who are suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome, Fox 25 reported.

“By snuggling a baby, it can be a difference between a baby getting medication versus not,” Dr. Elisha Wachman, head of the hospital’s CALM program, told Fox 25.

Babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome may suffer from tremors and difficulty eating or getting comfortable.

“We have a cuddler step in and really comfort the infant, to the point where, most of the time, I walk in and the infant is fast asleep on the cuddler, looking very comfortable and not showing any signs of withdrawal at all,” Wachman told Fox 25.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

According to Wachman, the program has helped to cut infants’ hospitalization time in half, while also helping 50 percent of babies heal without medication. The hospital has gotten 100 volunteers enrolled in the program since it started in December, with 150 more on the waiting list, Fox 25 reproted.

Program volunteer Pamela Turocotte said she became involved after watching her own grandchildren overcome neonatal abstinence syndrome.

“It fills you with so much purpose,” Pamela Turocotte, a volunteer, told Fox 25. “It’s amazing what one simple thing can do to change the outcome.”

Boston Medical Center said there are plans to expand the program in the spring.The Ford Ranger has returned.

Just a few weeks after the automaker confirmed it’s bringing back the small pickup model in 2019, a prototype has been spotted undergoing testing on public roads in Michigan.

Expand / Contract 2017 Ford Ranger -- Australia (Ford)

The body of the camouflaged truck appears to be identical to the one on the Ranger that Ford currently builds and sells in other countries, which Ford is basing the new Michigan-made Ranger on.

Chevrolet did the same thing when it reintroduced the Colorado to the USA in 2015, but while it looks much like its foreign market Colorado, it’s been significantly reengineered with more capability to better meet the expectations of American truck buyers. That’s likely the case with the Ranger, which could also end up getting a new body design by the time it goes on sale.

FORD CONFIRMS RETURN OF RANGER PICKUP AND BRONCO SUV

The undercover truck is a fairly conventional crew cab with a solid rear axle and front independent suspension. While its engine is unknown, today’s Rangers are sold with four-cylinder gas and diesel engines, along with a version of the five-cylinder diesel found in the Ford Transit van. It’s likely the American Ranger will be available with one or two of those and at least one V6 to compete with the other small pickups that all offer them in the United States.

With an on sale date expected late next year, the official production version of the new Ranger should make its debut at the 2018 North American Auto Show in Detroit in January.

BIG CHANGES, AND A BRONCO, COMING TO FORD TRUCKS:

Gary Gastelu is FoxNews.com's Automotive Editor. You can follow him on Twitter @garygastelu and @foxcarreportGovernment policies designed to reduce how much salt people eat may be cost-effective even without considering the potential healthcare savings, a recent study suggests.

That's because efforts to curb salt use through policies like public education and industry agreements would not cost that much relative to their potential to reduce mortality and disability, researchers estimate.

"We know that too much salt in the diet causes hundreds of thousands of preventable cardiovascular deaths a year," said senior study author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston.

"The trillion dollar questions are how to start to bring salt down, and how much would such an effort cost," Mozaffarian added by email.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, killing almost one in every three people. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general, and heart attack and stroke in particular.

Reducing sodium intake can significantly lower blood pressure in adults, in turn helping to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Sodium is found not only in table salt, but in a variety of foods such as bread, milk, eggs, meat, and shellfish as well as processed items like pretzels, popcorn, soy sauce and bouillon or stock cubes.

To lower the risk of heart disease, adults should reduce sodium intake to less than 2 grams a day, or the equivalent of about one teaspoon of salt, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

For the current study, researchers modeled the effects and costs of government-supported sodium reduction programs in 183 countries worldwide.

Researchers used data from 2010 to analyze sodium intake, blood pressure levels, the effects of sodium on blood pressure, the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease rates.

Then, they examined costs of sodium reduction programs using a tool from the World Health Organization for examining efforts to prevent non-communicable diseases. This tool accounts for costs of things like human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment and mass media.

Government programs designed to achieve a 10 percent reduction in salt consumption over 10 years could save nearly 6 million life years currently lost to cardiovascular disease each year, at an average cost of $204 per life year saved, researchers report in The BMJ.

The overall effectiveness of the intervention was based on recent efforts in the UK and Turkey, which showed that such a government-supported program could reduce salt consumption by at least 10 percent over a decade.

A gradual reduction of salt intake by 10 percent over 10 years could save an average of 5.8 million disability-adjusted life years (DALY) each year that would otherwise be lost to cardiovascular disease.

Of these, about 42 percent were attributable to coronary heart disease, 40 percent to stroke and 18 percent to other types of cardiovascular disease, researchers calculated.

One limitation of the study is that researchers used raw data from 2010 covering a majority but not all of the global population, the authors note. Estimated health benefits only considered cardiovascular disease and not other medical problems that may be prevented with salt reduction, the researchers also point out.

The projected savings are conservative, however, because they don't include savings based on people who might not require treatment for heart disease due to reduced salt intake.

Even when government policies don't encourage food manufacturers to reduce sodium in processed foods, consumers can still take steps to reduce salt consumption, said Dr. Margo Denke a former professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School who now works in private practice in Bandera, Texas.

"We do have and can make better choices," Denke, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.

"We have available lower fat canned goods in many categories like canned beans and canned tomatoes that contain no sodium, lower sodium luncheon meats, lower sodium bread, lower sodium chips, lower sodium soups, and other food categories will occur once demand for these products takes off," Denke added.

"Be a label reader and vote with your grocery cart," Denke said.For hundreds of years, violins by Antonio Stradivari have been considered the best in the world, some fetching millions of dollars. The only other instruments vying for the title were crafted by a man named Giuseppe Guarneri, who toiled away in his workshop in the same northern Italian city of Cremona at the same time.

Many theories have been spun over the years to explain why the instruments crafted by these masters produce a sound that cannot be replicated. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests it all comes down to the wood, a good bath, and a lot of time.

When Taiwanese researchers analyzed bits of maple from four violins and cellos by Stradivarius and one violin by Guarneri, they discovered a lost art. The instrument-makers, or luthiers, used wood soaked in a mineral bath to prevent rot that effectively changed it.

"This type of chemical seasoning was an unusual practice … unknown to later generations of violin makers," they write, per the Washington Post. It's likely, however, that the wood was soaked by those who first culled it from the forest, not the luthiers, to protect it before sale, notes the New York Times.

The upshot is that the maple used in these violins of old has different chemical properties from the maple in modern instruments. Add three centuries of aging and the effect of high-frequency vibrations from all that playing and you have, perhaps, the recipe for a masterpiece.

Skeptics aren't convinced. Two British scientists writing in the Conversation cited a "halo effect" around the Italian masters, taking note of a 2011 study of 21 experts who preferred playing a modern instrument.

(This stolen Stradivarius surfaced after 35 years.)

This article originally appeared on Newser: Researchers: We Know the Stradivarius' SecretFor the eight years of Barack Obama’s presidency, the United States treated Iran as if it were a major rising power in the world dominating the Middle East. But Iran is not a First World or even Second World power. Iran, as a Third World country, is far weaker than either the superpower United States or the rising First World power Israel.

Look at the figures. The American GDP of over $18 trillion is more than 40 times the GDP of Iran ($450 billion). American GDP/capita is $53,000 while Iranian GDP/capita of $4,800 is not even 10 percent of that figure.

On the military front, there is no comparison. The United States spends over $600 billion a year on defense while Iran spends a paltry $6 billion. The United States has over 1,500 strategic nuclear weapons while Iran has none. The Business Insider rates the American military the best in the world and Iran is not even rated in the top 20.

The United States has 10 high end aircraft carriers while Iran has none. The United States has 72 destroyers, Iran none. The United States has a staggering 14,000 planes to Iran’s 480 planes. The United States has 62 destroyers while Iran has none. The Americans have 72 submarines, Iran has three.

The Iranian military is weak, with very limited naval and air force capability. In the eight year war with Iraq in the 1980s the Iranian military was unable to beat Saddam Hussein’s military. By contrast, in 2003 the American military destroyed it and took Baghdad in only 22 days. Iran has been struggling, sometimes slowed by sanctions, to build nuclear weapons ever since 1984. After 33 years it still has not yet succeeded.

The United States can also likely count on help from three regional powers-- Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Israel, rated #8 in the world in a recent survey of military power, has 700 advanced fighters (including the F-35), 5 German Dolphin class submarines, 4,200 tanks and 100-200 atomic bombs. It has one of the world’s top 5 intelligence services in Mossad and Shin Beth. Bloomberg rates Israel #2 in the world for its anti-missile missiles (Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow 2 and 3). Having fought 11 wars since 1948, Israel has the most experienced military in the world.

Egypt, direly afraid of Iran, has 470,000 troops, 4,600 tanks and 1,100 planes. Saudi Arabia, a limited military power, has announced it will go nuclear if Iran develops atomic bombs.

Iran lags far behind in strong universities that are important on the field of battle. The United States has 15 of the top 20 universities in the world (including Cal Tech, MIT, Harvard, Yale, Columbia and the University of Chicago). By contrast, Iran does not have a single university in the top 100 or even the top 800 universities in the world. Iran’s four best universities are rated #895 (Iran University), #2,273 (Iran University Medical University), #3,363 and # 5,142 in the world! In education they rate 112th in the world alongside lagging African countries.

In global innovations, while the United States is a world leader with Silicon Valley, Iran rates 120th out of 143 countries. Iran takes 58th in the world in research and development. In business Iran rates 137th in the world for ease of doing business and 67th for entrepreneurship. Fully 20% of the adult population is illiterate. In doctors per thousand patients it runs in at 138th in the world and its national health system rate 93rd in the world. Women do especially badly with a 103rd rating of 109 countries for gender empowerment.

Finally, there are key domestic problems for Iran. Beset by massive corruption, blatant authorianism, strong opposition group (the Green Movement), large-scale emigration (4-5 million Iranians) and a rising young generation not enamored of isolation from the world, the future does not look bright.

Given all this the fear of Iran getting nuclear weapons still remains real. But, even more real is the notion that the biggest power in the world, plus three significant regional powers, could handle Iran if they would put their minds to it.

Only time will tell if that will happen in the days of the new American administration.

In a statement released Friday, the incident happened at the Port of Sasabe, about 74 miles southwest of Tucson.

Officers found the drugs hidden inside a shipment of mesquite firewood, after a narcotics-detection canine was alerted to a truck, the statement said.

The Marijuana was discovered, after officers loaded the firewood off the truck, and split them in half. The drug, according to the statement, is worth an estimated $53,000.

The person driving the truck, identified as a 41-year-old man, was reportedly turned over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Days after the Michigan Republican Party told Fox News that Rock would make an "awesome" candidate, right-wing guitar god Ted Nugent said he would consider running for the same seat.

"I'm always very interested in making my country and the great state of Michigan great again and there is nothing I wouldn't do to help in any way I possibly can," Nugent told The Daily Caller.

TRUMP-THEMED HOLLYWOOD PROJECTS ARE TAKING OVER

Michigan GOP press officer Sarah Anderson told Fox News that they have not spoken with Nugent.

"There's a lot of excitement here in Michigan and we think Ted Nugent would be a great candidate to win against Debbie Stabenow," Anderson said. She said of Rock, "I think [Kid Rock] would be awesome," adding she would not "be surprised if there was a movement for him to run."

Unlike Nugent, Rock has not responded to rumors that he is considering running.

"My dad was like, ‘Amy, did you brush your teeth?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah daddy.’ And he was like, ‘No you didn’t.’ And he picked me up by my throat, all the way up to the ceiling. He was like, ‘You will brush your teeth,'" Duggar said in the clip obtained by People. "And I was scared s--tless."

Duggar is the niece of "19 and Counting" stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. This is the first time she has identified her alleged abuser.

Duggar and her husband Dillon King decided they needed counseling after seven months of marriage.

She told Fox News earlier this month she is "grateful" for the opportunity to appear on "Marriage Boot Camp." However, she wishes she could have dealt with the alleged abuse "behind closed doors."

It's a discovery that rocked the archaeological world -- scientists working at Moropeng, the site outside Johannesburg known as the 'Cradle of Humankind,' discovered a mass underground cave housing the remains of hundreds of individuals that the researchers say belong to a new species of the human family. Researchers named the creature Homo naledi. That reflects the "Homo" evolutionary group, which includes modern people and our closest extinct relatives, and the word for "star" in a local language. The find was made in the Rising Star cave system.

(AP Photo/Themba Hadebe) a-surprising-mixThe apparent assassination of the North Korean leader's estranged half-brother is strengthening bipartisan calls for the U.S. to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, a designation lifted nine years ago.

Doing so would increase the country's isolation, while potentially complicating any future diplomacy to halt its nuclear and missile programs.

The U.S. kept North Korea on its terrorism blacklist for two decades after the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner. But President George W. Bush lifted the designation in 2008 to smooth the way for aid-for-disarmament negotiations that later collapsed.

Last June, the State Department said North Korea is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the plane attack 30 years ago. House lawmakers are pushing for a fresh review of the evidence.The New York Times and the Washington Post have delivered a one-two punch to President Trump that cost the national security adviser his job, raised questions about his campaign’s contacts with Russia and plunged the White House into a crisis atmosphere.

And there is an air of vindication coursing through the corridors of the mainstream media, which saw Trump survive many negative barrages during the campaign and which are constantly under attack by the new president.

Both things are true. The newspaper stories are based on solid reporting, and there is a strong sense the media are pumped about getting a scalp.

This journalistic digging would not have been possible without high-level leaks from sources who are clearly trying to damage Trump. The Times story yesterday is attributed to “four current and former American officials.” The original Post story on Flynn having discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador before the inauguration was attributed to “current and former officials.” But the stories have been accurate.

Both things are true. There has been a gusher of leaks from inside the administration, not just on the Russia mess but on the president’s calls to foreign leaders. Leakers often have nefarious motives, and ex-Obama aides seem to be involved (hence the “former officials” description). But the two papers nailed down the details, and Flynn had to apologize for misleading Mike Pence and others.

Trump went on a tweetstorm yesterday, accusing news organizations of hating him.

The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017

And:

Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017

And:

The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017

Well, it’s not “just like Russia,” which doesn’t have a free press. But it is illegal to leak classified information, and there is a hostile edge to much of the media coverage of this president. Both things are true.

The question now is whether the Times piece has kicked this story into the media stratosphere.

The paper said that “members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.”

This is based on intelligence intercepts that “alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.” The talks included not just Trump campaign officials but “other associates of Mr. Trump. On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the government outside of the intelligence services.”

Now it’s important to emphasize what the story doesn’t say. It doesn’t say there was evidence of improper collusion in these calls. It doesn’t say anyone discussed the hacking of the DNC or the Hillary campaign. And as the Times itself says,“it is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with Mr. Trump himself.”

But it’s unusual, and there’s an FBI investigation, and that makes it news.

The Democrats and liberal pundits are going haywire. Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, called in to MSNBC to compare the story to Watergate. He demanded a 9/11 commission-style investigation. 9/11!

Slate’s William Saletan, in a piece ripping the Trump team’s handling of the mess, ends thusly:

“That’s why the catastrophe of this administration won’t end with Flynn’s departure, or even with an investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia. It will end only when Trump is impeached and convicted.”



Well, no ambiguity on where he’s coming from.

But Commentary’s John Podhoretz issues this warning:

“The idea that Donald Trump is now inexorably on a path to impeachment has taken almost gleeful hold in the wake of the Michael Flynn resignation among liberal elites and anti-Trumpers generally—and everybody better stop and take a deep breath and consider what might arise from this. This isn’t fire we’re playing with, it’s a nuclear war.”



The media should aggressively pursue this story. And they should avoid the trap of hype and speculation. Both things are true.

The dubious honor stems from a bet that Zoo Atlanta (located in Atlanta, home of the Falcons) made with the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island (loyal to the New England Patriots). The terms? The losing side would give a baby animal in its zoo the name of the winning team’s quarterback.

Well, the Falcons lost, and so Zoo Atlanta did dub an animal "Tom Brady." It’s a little baby Madagascar hissing cockroach, as revealed in an Instagram video.

Known for his green tongue and hairy chest, "The Animal" received a master's degree from Central Michigan University and was a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Michigan.

While he was teaching, he began to book gigs in the pro-wrestling world. His first WWE appearance was in 1967 when he began his rivalry against WWE champ Bruno Sammartino.

The WWE Hall of Famer continued to make wrestling appearances through the 2000s.

He is survived by his wife Pat, their two sons Dennis and Randy and daughter, Felicia.1:37 Trump supporter argues against 'sanctuary' protections at Miami-Dade meeting Pause

The AnaOno X #Cancerland fashion show featured 16 women modeling lingerie—all of whom are either currently battling or have battled breast cancer.

The show featured underwear from AnaOno Intimates, a lingerie company that makes products with breast cancer patients in mind. Designer Dana Donofree started AnaOno in 2015 after battling breast cancer and having both of her breasts removed. She eventually underwent reconstructive surgery, but realized traditional bras were hard for her to wear.

"I went to my underwear drawer and pulled out all the beautiful lacy bras I owned and I quickly realized this wasn't going to work. I was no longer normal," she told TODAY in 2015 about her experience. "I thought, this can't be it: This can't be the way I'm going to have to live the rest of my life." That's when Dana decided to design her own bras for the many women like her who had undergone breast cancer treatment.

Each of the women who walked in Dana’s show have undergone some sort of breast surgery, ranging from a lumpectomy to a single or double mastectomy. Some women had reconstructive surgery while others didn’t. Some women went topless or wore body paint up top, while others modeled bras. The women represented a range of ages and races, to show that cancer can touch any life.

"This is my one little chance to help a woman feel a little bit better about herself in her journey," Dana told Women's Health about her business in 2015. "Work is also part of my healing process," she says.

This article originally appeared on WomensHealthMag.com.This should be the biggest Ferrari F430 sale of the year. So big in fact that some might say it’s “yuuuuge.” Although F430s aren’t common, even a cursory online search reveals that they are available, if not cheap. But this example, coincidentally being auctioned on April 1, 2017, by Auctions America at their Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) sale, was purchased and titled new in 2007 by our recently inaugurated 45th president, Donald Trump.

The Auctions America low pre-sale estimate is $250,000, which represents a roughly 30 percent premium over an average Ferrari F430. That expected premium is largely due to Trump’s celebrity and new political status, and to a lesser degree the car’s low mileage.

While the Rosso Corsa (Racing Red) Ferrari was sold to a new owner in 2011, the car will be auctioned along with a copy of its original title including “President Trump’s Trump Tower, New York address and his distinctive, bold signature.” According to Auctions America, “President Trump owned the car for a little over four years during which time the car accrued a little over 2,400 miles.” It currently shows fewer than 6,000 miles and is equipped with a 4.3-liter V-8 and semi-automatic F1 transmission. Besides its relatively low mileage, we wonder if President Trump's ownership justifies the aforementioned premium.

MORE CLASSIC CAR STORIES FROM HAGERTY

This sale does present both car and presidential history enthusiasts with a unique opportunity to own, enjoy – and hopefully use – a supercar once owned by a president. And it is a unique opportunity as most memorabilia doesn’t have a horsepower rating: “To see a former or current President’s personal vehicle offered for sale is extremely rare.” Furthermore, as befits Trump’s larger-than-life persona, most chiefs of state never owned a car that makes 490 hp.

So we’re curiously watching and wondering if this Ferrari, with its Chief Executive-provenance, will bring that 30 percent premium. Do you think it will?

TRUMP'S GLORIOUS 1988 CADILLAC LIMOUSINES MAY BE AUCTIONEDA powerful Pacific storm blew into Southern and Central California on Friday with wind-driven heavy rains that downed power lines and electrocuted a man, killed a motorist in a submerged car and disrupted hundreds of flights at airports.

With the storm feeding on an atmospheric river of moisture stretching far out into the Pacific, precautionary evacuations of homes in some neighborhoods were requested due to the potential for mudslides and debris flows.

More than 300 arriving and departing flights were delayed or canceled at Los Angeles International Airport.

In the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, a falling tree downed power lines and hit a car. A 55-year-old man was electrocuted and pronounced dead at a hospital, police and fire officials said.

Winds gusting to 60 mph or more lashed the area. Heavy rains turned creeks and rivers into brown torrents and released slews of mud from hillsides burned barren by wildfires. Several stretches of freeways and highways were closed by flooding.

"It's crazy," said Robin Johnson, an academic adviser at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "It's just pouring down rain. The wind is just going nuts."

"At one point the wind was so strong I'm surprised it didn't blow my windows out," retiree Phoenix Hocking said in a Facebook message from Carpinteria. "I now have a pond in my patio. And my dog is starting to grow flippers so he can go out and do his business."

In the desert town of Victorville, several cars were washed down a flooded street. A helicopter rescued one person from the roof of a car but another motorist was found dead in a submerged vehicle, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said.

Elsewhere in the county, a 20-mile stretch of State Route 138 in the West Cajon Valley was closed at the scene of a summer wildfire.

Mud sloshed over concrete rail barriers and about two dozen vehicles, including big-rigs and a school bus, were either mired in mud or became unable to turn around on the closed road and some were abandoned, Sherwin said.

Two people in a car were rescued and four students on the bus were removed and taken to a school office, he said.

Another road in the area was covered with 2 feet of mud.

In LA's Sun Valley, 10 cars were trapped in swift-moving water on a roadway and eight people had to be rescued, the Fire Department reported.

Using ropes and inflatable boats, firefighters rescued seven people and two dogs from the Sepulveda basin, a recreation and flood-control area along the Los Angeles River. One person was taken to a hospital with a non-life threatening injury.

The storm took aim at Southern California but also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco. It was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.

The National Weather Service said it could end up being the strongest storm to hit Southern California since January 1995.

Rain and wind wiped out play in golf's Genesis Open at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where a eucalyptus tree cracked.

Hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines had toppled in the Los Angeles area and at one point more than 60,000 city power customers were without electricity.

A 75-foot tree fell onto an apartment building near the University of California, Los Angeles, narrowly missing someone who was in bed, fire officials said. Four of the six apartments have been declared unsafe to enter, prompting the evacuation of 16 college students.

"I was just sitting in bed trying to enjoy a Friday morning of no class," one resident told KCAL-TV. "I had a giant, like, thunder popping sound and then next thing I knew a branch was coming through the ceiling."

Her leg was scratched by debris and "I was covered in sawdust," she said.

Her thought now was, "Where am I going to live?"

Another tree smashed a carport and vehicles in the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta.

Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Orange County closed because the weather. High surf pounded beaches.

By evening, Ventura County and northern Los Angeles County had seen 24-hour rain totals of up to 7 ½ inches, with the San Marcos mountain pass in Santa Barbara County receiving nearly 8 ½ inches.

Farther south, downtown Los Angeles had received about 1 ½ inches of rain while some areas saw up to 4 inches.

The storm system was moving "very slowly" eastward and Los Angeles County was expected to see more rain through Saturday, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.

The city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles, ordered evacuation of 180 homes below a burn scar. Up the coast, evacuations were urged for parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County and around an 11½-square-mile burn scar west of Santa Barbara.

Santa Anita Park near Pasadena canceled all its horse races Friday.

In Northern California, officials monitoring the stricken Oroville Dam on the Feather River said they were confident the reservoir would handle any runoff from expected storms because ongoing releases have been lowering the lake's level since its spillways were damaged last week.

If an invite-only rooftop lounge or hidden basement club doesn’t feel exclusive enough for you, there’s now a luxury yacht that is being called the “world’s largest floating private members’ club.”

Quintessentially One, as the 720-foot yacht will be called, will go around the world all year, popping up at select high-profile events. The yacht will not only host exclusive parties, but also have an onboard restaurant and hotel where rooms start at about $2,500 per night.

⭐️ #Business • Will this be the largest super yacht?: Concierge company, Quintessentially is building what they say… https://t.co/xfDJjcI1wO pic.twitter.com/Og2m9QmloZ — مدينة تلمســان 🇩🇿 (@Tlemcen_City) February 14, 2017

The yacht is run by Quintessentially, a luxury concierge service which provides services like restaurant reservations, tickets to sold-out events, and opulent travel planning. Membership to the service costs about $18,700 per year.

The yacht will dock where the ultra-wealthy tend to congregate — like the Cannes Film Fest, Monaco Grand Prix, Rio’s Carnival, etc. — and offer overnight accommodations.

“Where the traditional cruise model is to go somewhere, dock and get off, we will dock and people will want to get on,” Aaron Simpson, Quintessentially’s co-founder and chairman, told The Guardian.

The “superyacht” will include 12 residential suites and 112 “lower berth” rooms in a boutique hotel. Guests onboard the yacht will have access to a library, spa, gym, marina, “beach area,” shopping, and a bar/nightclub.

The yacht cost about $264 million to construct. About one-fifth of that was provided by five millionaire friends, who will each have their own suites aboard the vessel.

The ship is scheduled to make its maiden voyage in 2019.Mariah Carey performed live for the first time since her disastrous New Year's Eve performance.

Carey made her big live TV return Wednesday night when she performed her new song "I Don't" on "Jimmy Kimmel Live." The song was inspired by her breakup from Australian billionaire James Packer.

So how did the singer do?

Wearing a curve-hugging red gown, Carey belted out her new single with the help of rapper YG without a hitch.

A post shared by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Feb 15, 2017 at 7:21pm PST

One fan wrote on Twitter, "So Mariah Carey just served outstanding vocals live on Jimmy Kimmel."

Another chimed in, "...Mariah Carey! Is looking amazing tonight!!! & sing amazing as well on jimmy kimmel tonight."

It was the first time Carey had performed live since her less than wonderful performance on "Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve." The singer stopped singing in the middle of her performance, began pacing the stage and told the audience to finish the lyrics for her.

Carey blamed her disastrous show on technical difficulties and said it was Dick Clark Productions fault for not addressing the tech issues before the performance, including a malfunctioning earpiece. The production company denied Carey's claims.At 96 years old, Bob Brocklehurst needs a little more help boarding a plane than he did back in the day. But give him a second and he's right at home.

With a grin and a thumbs-up, the World War II veteran took off from Tampa in a P-51 Mustang, similar to those he flew in the war.

"I don't bend my legs like I used to, gentlemen," he said as he boarded the plane. "You think I'm calm, but I'm not. I'm standing about 35 feet up in the air, ready to go."

Once he's up in the air, he is surrounded by memories.

"I went back and landed that rascal. True story," he recalled.

On this flight, Bob wanted more than a trip down memory lane.

"We are all set for a loop, are we?" he asked.

He tested a few of his old tricks. Yes, he got to do the loop. He even did a barrel roll and he did it with skill.

"Just made me feel right at home. It's like putting the car in the garage. You do it without thinking," he said.

RUTGERS CONDEMNS ANTI-MUSLIM POSTER FOUND AT CULTURAL CENTER

Caleb O’Neil, a student at Orange Coast College, was suspended for a full semester and the summer term for filming the video.

The college said the 19-year-old violated its policy by “recording any person on District Property or at any District function without that person’s knowledge or consent.”

SPARKS FLY OVER MAHER'S BOOKING OF PROVOCATEUR MILO

He was also ordered to write a “three-page double spaced essay” regarding the incident, Campus Reform reported.

O’Neil videotaped his professor Olga Perez Stable Cox in December talking about Trump's election win. She called his election “an act of terrorism.”

Cox also said in the video that, “our nation is divided as clearly as it was in civil war times.”

O’Neil, who shared the video with college Republicans, wore pro-Trump clothing in class and said he felt threatened due to his teacher’s comments.

"I pulled my phone out, because I was honestly scared that I would have repercussions with my grades because she knew I was a Trump supporter," he said, according to The Orange County Register.

His suspension has caused mixed reactions among students at the campus.

“It’s unfair for the teacher to be secretly recorded. The student should have talked to the professor and voiced his opinions, then the fallout would’ve been avoidable,” one student told the Los Angeles Times.

The Los Angeles Times reported that a small group of people supported O’Neil, with one yelling, “You’re a hero, Caleb!”

Cox told the Washington Post in December that she was being virtually attacked by emails and Facebook messages saying, “I feel like I’ve been attacked by a mob of people all across the country.”

Kathleen Considine recently moved from Dearborn, Mich. to Portland. Considine's family recently sent Jacob, an 80-pound canine, on a flight to join her. But by the time her beloved dog landed--over 24 hours later-- Considine says he wasn’t the same dog.

According to FOX 6, Jacob's flight was scheduled to make a brief stop in Chicago. But Considine says she eventually learned that Jacob’s crate didn't make it onto the Portland-bound leg of the flight because he "did not fit."

United public relations manager Charlie Hobart confirmed to Fox News that airline staff in Chicago were unable to accommodate the dog on the second leg of the flight because his original crate size had been marked as a much smaller series.

WHEN PIGS FLY: WILL AIRLINES EVER CRACK DOWN ON EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PETS?

"The customer had booked the animal in a 500 series and the dog arrived in a 700 series crate-- and that crate was simply too big for the flight," Hobart said. However he noted that an agent in Detroit "mistakenly told the customer that we’d be able to get that crate on the [final Portland-bound] flight."

United says they alerted Considine that her dog would be sent to stay at a kennel overnight until they could find room on another plane. It took 20 hours before the 80-pound retriever was back in the air but Hobart maintains that the dog received food, water and plenty of bathroom breaks during his stay at the Chicago PetSafe facility.

By the time Jacob landed in Portland, however, Considine alleges her dog was disoriented and non-responsive, despite having passed a mandatory physical less than 24 hours before the flight.

She took Jacob to an emergency veterinarian, but by the time they arrived, Jacob was barely breathing. After eight minutes of CPR, he was pronounced dead.

Considine's vet determined the dog's cause of death to be a stomach flip (or Gastric Dilatation Volvulus), an ailment that cuts off blood flow to the internal organs. The illness is often caused by meal problems, stress, or a combination of the two.

Considine described the tragic day on her Facebook page.

"Nothing will bring my baby back, but I am asking everyone to please share this post so nobody else has to go through this terrible tragedy," Considine posted.

"United Airlines "PetSafe" program is cruel. They treat animals like baggage. They did not care if Jacob had food or water or any time out of his cage."

The airline maintains that the dog "showed no signs of distress" during the journey.

When Considine initially contacted United, she claims she was told they considered her case closed and accepted no responsibility for the dog’s death. On Tuesday, Considine told Fox News that "United has contacted me as of yesterday morning, finally reaching out after 2 weeks with an apology. I will not rest until I see changes in their policy."

Hobart says United has been in touch with Considine multiple times since Jacob's flight and plans to make a donation to her charity of choice in Jacob's name.

"We know this is an extremely difficult situation for Miss Considine and we have been in touch with her before she posted on Facebook and since," Hobart said. "We offered our condolences and have provided a full refund for the shipping cost."

United says it flies over 200,000 pets annually through its PetSafe program. According to U.S. Department of Transportation statistics, from May 2005 through Nov. 2015, 70 animals have died while flying United.Mexico's Desert Museum has unveiled a replica of a new dinosaur species, Yehuecauhceretops.

THE DINOSAURS DIED A COLD, DARK DEATH, NEW STUDY SHOWS

The dinosaur, whose name means “ancient horned-face,” is a small herbivore, measuring 3.2 feet in length, Reuters reports. Its remains were found were found in Ocampo, Coahuila in 2007. It is the newest species to be found in the country and native to the northern desert region. Yehuecauhceretops hails from the genus of the horned centrosaurine ceretopsid dinosaur and walked the earth 70 million years ago when the area was a coastal marsh and flood plain, according to Reuters.

Hector Rivera, who serves as the museum’s head of Paleontology, told Reuters the beast was found with its head intact. "There is no other example of this cranium with these particular characteristics anywhere in the world. This is one of a kind in the world," he said.

FEATHERED DINOSAUR TAIL GRAGMENT TRAPPED IN AMBER AMAZES SCIENTISTS

The Desert Museum has uncovered four other new dinosaurs in the past. Other fossils that have been found in Mexico include a flying reptile known as the Peterosaur, and the Albertosaurus.

Yehuecauhceretops is now featured among Latin America’s most important dinosaur remains, including the Tyrannosaurus Rex, according to Reuters.Tom Regan, the author of a noted book on animal rights and a professor emeritus of philosophy at NC State University, has died.

Marion Cox Bolz, a spokesperson for the family, said Regan died Friday after a bout of pneumonia at his North Carolina home. Regan was 78.

Regan is known for "The Case for Animal Rights," which is described on the web page www.tomregan.info as stating non-human animals bear moral rights. He wrote that a crucial attribute that all humans have in common, he argues, is not rationality, but the fact that each of us has a life that matters to us.

Regan is survived by his wife Nancy, son Bryan and daughter Karen and four grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are pending.Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

This is a rush transcript from "Hannity," December 20, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

ERIC BOLLING, GUEST HOST: Welcome to "Hannity." Germany is now treating the attack on a Berlin Christmas market as an act of terror.

I'm Eric Bolling in for Sean.

Tonight, Kellyanne Conway, Rudy Giuliani, Governor Scott Walker, Laura Ingraham and Mike Huckabee all join us.

But first, German chancellor Angela Merkel and the country's top prosecutor are now saying terrorism is the likely the motive behind a holiday rampage, and according to the Associated Press, ISIS is claiming responsibility for the truck attack. Also tonight, Russian president Vladimir Putin is vowing revenge after the country's ambassador to Turkey was gunned down yesterday.

President-elect Donald Trump is reacting to both stories by promising to fight radical Islam while the White House won't even utter the phrase.

Joining us now with reaction is Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. Thank you for joining us, Kelly. Big news day. Lots going on in the world . Let's start with the Berlin attack. President-elect Donald Trump says he will fight Islamic terror. He used those words together. Why did he specifically do that so soon?

KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP TRANSITION SENIOR ADVISER: Well, it's part of how he ran his campaign and won. People want tough, strong leadership. If you look at the polls, Eric, Americans feel less safe than they did four or eight years ago. Many of them feel less prosperous, as well.

But you know, in the last two years alone, we've had radical Islamic terrorists make its way onto our shores here. In San Bernardino, where the fiancee came -- the woman came through a fiancee K1 visa most Americans didn't even know existed as an option, and of course, down in Orlando this past May, the worst massacre of its kind in American history, 49 innocent lives being snuffed out by a man who was radicalized as an Islamist on the Internet.

And so we already know that this exists. We know that those who say that they're the JV team and they're no longer on the advance are just dead wrong. And you see it mostly in Europe. You see Nice and Paris, of course, and Brussels, and now, apparently, the market in Berlin, Germany. They're nondiscriminatory in terms of when they attack, who they attack, but we know why they attack, because they hate freedom-loving people and they're on a religious jihad.

BOLLING: So Kellyanne, yesterday, the White House said probably terror, or likely terror. Donald Trump came out and said, You know what? It's Islamic terror, and we're going to call them out for it and we're going to stop it, and since then, ISIS has claimed credit for it. So Donald Trump was right.

CONWAY: He's right again. And I was on a show earlier with someone said, Why does he get ahead of himself when he doesn't have the evidence? They said the same thing in San Bernardino about him. They said the same thing in Orlando.

The man's instincts are correct. And he's right this time, as well. By the way, he doesn't say that to be right, he says it to remind all of us, Eric, of who the enemy really is here, and you can't defeat them until you're willing to name them.

And one of the untold stories of the election, frankly, is how much it mattered to many Americans that Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee, was willing to stand up so many times and call it out radical Islamic terrorism, talk about the fact that the ham-handed way we got out of Iraq created this vacuum for ISIS, and its progenitor groups were able to flourish.

And he also -- you know, you may recall in August or September, he came out with this pretty muscular four or five-point plan to defeat them. So people can go and look it up. They can disagree if it. (INAUDIBLE) talks about extreme vetting. He talks about all those countries that harbor and train and export terrorists, where we have very little vetting process.

You and I know that they -- ISIS has promised to come in through the form of refugees, Syrian refugees and others. So they've been very clear that they're just getting started.

BOLLING: Sure. Kellyanne, the other big story yesterday was the Russian ambassador being assassinated in front of the cameras. In the aftermath of that, let's talk about this, because President-elect Donald Trump, President Donald Trump is going to walk into some sort of mess with this situation.

You have Russia on one hand saying, Our ambassador's killed and we want someone to pay for that, yet there are others like Ambassador John Bolton, former ambassador John Bolton, suggesting that maybe this is some sort of plot by the Russians now to use this tragedy to get Turkey to get out of NATO.

Now, it's a little wonky, though, but how is Donald Trump going to handle such a hot spot going forward?

CONWAY: Well, the way he handled this particular incident is he did two things, and they're both correct. He did what a leader does. First, he expressed outrage that an ambassador would be killed and that it violates every convention we can think of in orderly society. Number two, he expressed condolences to the gentleman's family.

That's what leaders do before they have all the evidence. And when he's president of the United States, he will make clear what his policies are. But I don't think the president-elect is going to speculate on the rest of it and come up with any type of theory, other than what he sees in front of him, which is a cold-blooded murder of an ambassador in a foreign country that he's been serving.

BOLLING: Talk to me a little bit, Kellyanne, about the very, very strategic and important country, Turkey, for many reasons -- its location to Iraq and Syria. Its access -- ISIS has claimed that they're selling oil to Turkey. It's -- part of being in NATO, it wants to be in the European Union. How does Donald -- what's Donald Trump's Turkey strategy?

CONWAY: Oh, I can't discuss that before he's the president of the United States. I know that he has discussed it and we're aware of it, but we're very respectful, Eric, until he is the president of the United States and the commander-in-chief starting on January 20th next month, that we have a president currently.

Everything that you just described about Turkey is 100 percent correct, and obviously, the president-elect is aware of that and discussing that with his leaders. He's made very clear, too, that as soon as he assumes office, he will be convening those leaders, his secretary of state, his secretary of defense, his national security adviser and others. And he will be conferring about the best strategies moving forward in Turkey and elsewhere.

BOLLING: OK, can we play this up? Can we talk a little bit about -- you know, clearly, Vladimir Putin -- he's ticked off. He lost an ambassador. How is -- has -- has Putin reached out to President-elect Donald Trump on this assassination yet?

CONWAY: I'm not aware that he has.

BOLLING: OK. All right, let's move on to this one. Now, there's some back and forth going on about a phone call that occurred on election night. Now, initially, Bill Clinton, former president Bill Clinton, suggested that Donald Trump had called him, Mr. Trump tweeted today, No, no, no, you got it wrong, he called me. Now, you have some intimate knowledge of this.

CONWAY: Oh, I do. Actually, it was -- the president-elect is correct. On Thursday, November 10th, which basically was a day after the wee hours of November 9th when he won and that Hillary Clinton called to concede and congratulate him, I received a call from President Bill Clinton's chief of staff who asked if we could arrange a call to have President Bill Clinton congratulate the president-elect.

The president-elect was in Washington, D.C., meeting with the current president on November 10th, that Thursday, as we'll all recall. And so we arranged a call. They had a great conversation.

But it did go that way, and I saw in his tweet tonight that President Bill Clinton did say, Donald Trump and I agree on one thing, I did call him. It's fine.

It may seem like a minor point to some, but it shows you the power of Donald Trump in his Twitter feed when he says, No, I'm going to correct the record right here. You actually called me, which is true.

I just think their war of the -- it's not really a war of the words, it's just a departure in facts when it comes to what just happened in this election.

BOLLING: Speaking...

CONWAY: I mean, Bill Clinton won the presidency twice because he knew how to win those important blue states in the upper Midwest and other places. His wife failed to do that. And she failed to do that not because Vladimir Putin told them to ignore Milwaukee, but because for some reason, they took for granted Wisconsin because it had gone blue in every election since 1984.

And so I think Bill Clinton, who knows politics so well, who is clearly the more gifted masterful politician in his two-person household -- he should know better than to be blaming Russian hacking or Jim Comey or Bernie Sanders -- how dare he run against...

(CROSSTALK)

CONWAY: Enough of these excuses!

BOLLING: He went even further than Jim Comey. He did. He blamed, what'd he call it, the fake e-mail scandal. Then he blamed Jim Comey. In this same comment where he said that Donald Trump had called him -- in that same comment, he said Donald Trump knows how to get angry white males to vote for him.

CONWAY: Well, that's not the only group -- first of all, it's insult. And I think Bill Clinton sounds like in that case a Trump voter these days. He seems pretty angry white male, but -- and that's too bad because he's a former president. We have enormous respect for him and for his legacy, as it were.

But we also have to point out that Donald Trump had a very broad coalition when he ran the tables among the same kind of Democratic union households that Bill Clinton won and Hillary Clinton lost. He ran the tables among rural voters. Frankly, he got almost as much as Mitt Romney got among women and he ran against the first female president.

Why did -- I would ask the Clintons, why didn't Hillary Clinton get 60 or 62 percent of the female vote? What's wrong with her, running as the first female president? Why does she have this wicked gender gap among men, where they disliked her, dismissed her, didn't want her to be president of the United States or commander-in-chief. They distrusted her.

She underperformed among millennials. She couldn't bring together the Obama coalition and she certainly couldn't bring together the Bill Clinton coalition. It's pretty simple.

BOLLING: So those comments I would call deplorable and irredeemable by Bill Clinton. Is that OK to do that?

CONWAY: I would call them -- yes, something like that. But I would just call them dead wrong, and it's time to -- look, it's time for the Clintons to do what the Obamas have done, which is to open up the door and say, We are here to help you have a peaceful transition in our great democracy. We're only one month away today, Eric, from January 20th, and it's really time for the Clintons to tell all of their adherers (ph), their protesters, this fanciful electoral strategy which failed, the hashtag -- it's time for them to tell everybody to support this guy.

BOLLING: So let's tell the audience -- I heard some news today. I heard a rumor today that Kellyanne Conway is going to move to Washington, D.C. Kellyanne, what are you going to do there?

(LAUGHTER)

CONWAY: Well, first I'm going to look for a house and some schools for my kids. We'll see how welcome the Trump people are in these schools, Eric. But we will -- I'm going to serve the president-elect and the vice president-elect in whatever capacity they would prefer me. And we've been talking about that. But either way, you can expect me in Washington, D.C.

We're just getting started. This is a man in a big hurry to do great things, and I am all too humbled and honored to be part of that because he's going to make good on these promises of his first 100-day plan. You see the activity and the energy already, just as president-elect and vice president-elect, and it's a very exciting time.

And I want to give a shoutout. I talked today on the phone for half hour with Valerie Jarrett, and I really appreciate the kind of counsel that I'm getting personally and others on the team are receiving from President Obama's administration and its officials. It's very helpful for us to talk to people who are actually there.

BOLLING: All right. Kellyanne, we're going to -- we're going to leave it right there. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to miss you around the neighborhood. I used to drive around and see Kellyanne and her -- and her beautiful family...

CONWAY: Oh, we're keeping our house here.

BOLLING: Kellyanne...

CONWAY: Well, come and visit.

BOLLING: Thank you. I will. I'll come visit you in D.C. Thank you very much.

Coming up -- after another stunning attack in Europe, the world is on edge, and President-elect Donald Trump is promising a new approach to fighting radical Islamic terror. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is here with reaction.

And later...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: To protect our country from terrorism and extremism, we will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed or vetted.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: Donald Trump is promising extreme vetting of refugees from countries with ties to terror. And now Wisconsin governor Scott Walker is asking the president-elect for more control of allowing refugees into his state. Governor Walker joins us later, along with Dr. Sebastian Gorka.

That and a whole lot more as "Hannity" continues.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(NEWSBREAK)

BOLLING: Welcome back to "Hannity." Following another major terror attack in Europe, the world remains on edge and the Trump presidency couldn't come at a more critical time for the country.

Joining me now with reaction is former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mayor, thank you for being here. A lot going on in the world. It's a scary place lately.

RUDY GIULIANI, R-FMR. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, you know, it's been this way really for the last year. San Bernardino was about a year ago, remember, right before Christmas. Since San Bernardino, we've had more radical Islamic terrorist attacks than at any time since September 11. The number is beginning to become almost exponential.

And I think some of it has to do with the fact that we just haven't faced up to the fact that they're at war against us. I think somebody today in - - I think it was in Germany said we've got to recognize they're at war against us. So if they're at war against us and we're not at war against them, they're winning.

(LAUGHTER)

GIULIANI: So I think -- you might remember that when Donald Trump criticized NATO, all the emphasis was on the money they don't contribute. One of the things he said is NATO has not put together an anti-terrorism force. Within two months, they did. And it isn't quite what it should be. I think Donald Trump will make that force a much bigger force. And I know all throughout the campaign, he would talk about that.

In many ways, he's been prophetic about the fact that Europe has not paid enough attention to terrorism.

BOLLING: Well, let's talk a little bit about that. Now, you know, I think the numbers are somewhere around 1.4 million refugees have gone to Europe, 750,000...

GIULIANI: There's another place where he was right.

BOLLING: ... in Germany alone...

GIULIANI: There's another place where he was right and Angela Merkel was wrong. And of course, the whole world criticized him, and he turned out to be absolutely right.

BOLLING: Drudge has a big picture on there -- on his headline today with Angela Merkel with blood on her hands. What did she do wrong? What lessons can we learn in America that he has -- Iraq is -- mistakes she's making now?

GIULIANI: Well, you don't let large numbers of people in from a part of the world where there's a tremendous amount of terrorism. It's just common sense! Here's a hotbed of terrorism. Here's a hotbed of people who are planning to come and kill you in your own country. To make it easier, they even warn you that they're going to do that because Baghdadi said, I'm going to slip in terrorists with the refugees. He told us! We didn't even have to think about it. And we let them in anyway.

So as Donald Trump used to say before he came president-elect, it was stupid. It was just stupid.

(LAUGHTER)

BOLLING: This made the Germans -- they initially had a guy that they thought was the terrorist. It turns out it wasn't the terrorist because they have some rule that you can't keep someone more than a day...

GIULIANI: Right.

BOLLING: ... unless you have probable cause to keep them. Are they too politically correct?

GIULIANI: Well, she -- probable cause is a criminal concept. It comes out of -- I mean, in America, it would be the 4th Amendment, probable cause for arrest. We're at war! You don't need probable cause to hold somebody during a war. Suspicion is good enough during a war.

So we're playing -- they're playing by war rules, and the Obama administration has us playing by criminal justice rules. Well, we're going to lose that. And we are losing it. That's why we've had so many attacks in the last year. You just add them up -- San Bernardino, Orlando, Nice, Paris, Germany a couple of times, the priest who had his head chopped off. I mean, I can go on and on.

BOLLING: Mr. Mayor, how do you extreme vet someone when you don't know what their past is? A lot of these people are coming over -- we -- they have no past! There's no school records. There's no criminal records. There's no work records. They're coming over and saying, Hey, I'm here. Help me out.

GIULIANI: When you come from a certain part of the world like Syria -- let's make it really simple -- the burden has to be on you to prove that you're safe. The burden can't be on me to prove that -- that -- that you're not.

This isn't -- this isn't a trial. This isn't a criminal proceeding. And you have no right to come to the United States. The United States Constitution doesn't give anyone in this world the right to come to the United States. That's a privilege that we extend to you. So we have a right to condition that privilege on things that insure to our safety, rather than to create dangerous situations for the world.

So if you can't get the information, person doesn't come in. Extreme vetting means you search the documents, you're sure they're safe, you let them in. If you can't find a record of safety, you don't let them in.

BOLLING: (INAUDIBLE) just go to Mexico? Why don't they just find their way through South America straight up to our border?

GIULIANI: Well, unfortunately, some of them do. And that's the reason why the wall has to be built and the extra protection has to be put there, including the electronic surveillance -- the wall by itself is going to need electronic surveillance below ground and aboveground, more border patrol. That's the reason we have to do these things.

Everything Donald Trump ran on is actually happening. NATO has to increase its emphasis on terrorism. It's got to modernize and increase its emphasis on terrorism. And we should build a safe zone in Syria and keep those people in Syria.

BOLLING: Are they here, Mr. Mayor? Are the terrorists here?

GIULIANI: Well...

BOLLING: In other words, if they've had such an easy go either through the border or through the refugee system, are they just waiting and waiting and -- what can Donald Trump do with the ones that have already come over here?

GIULIANI: Well, if Jim Comey is right -- to talk about a different subject for Jim Comey, which is the number of terrorist investigations in the U.S., about four or five months ago, he said there were 1,000. That's a lot of investigations.

I mean, I spent 17 years in the Justice Department, 1,000 investigations is a lot of investigations. I think he has got to sit down and figure out what are the rules of engagement here? Are we going to play this like this is one crime after another after another after another, or are we going to wake up and realize this is a war?

If somebody, God forbid, in the name of jihadism bombs an American city, to me, that person's a prisoner of war. That person is not a person who is going to be indicted under the criminal justice system.

BOLLING: And meanwhile, we're letting go -- President Obama announced he's going to let go some more Gitmo terrorists. Let me ask you this. Put a number on this. After 9/11, you were there. We hardened a lot of our targets. Give us -- on a scale of one to ten, how safe were we on 2 -- in 2 -- September 2002? Just give me a one to ten number.

GIULIANI: Seven.

BOLLING: Where are we now?

GIULIANI: Six, five.

BOLLING: So we're worse off than we were...

GIULIANI: Oh, no, no. We are definitely worse off...

BOLLING: ... 14 years ago.

GIULIANI: ... than we were before September 11 just by the nature of the groups that we're facing. We were facing one large group, al Qaeda, located largely in a few places where we could find them and put them on the run.

Just look at between September 11 and Ft. Hood, there was no domestic Islamic terrorist attack. Under Obama, when we decided we weren't at war anymore, but they didn't decide they weren't at war anymore, we've had -- look at what we've had in the last year.

BOLLING: Six, five.

GIULIANI: Yes.

BOLLING: All right, we'll leave it right there, maybe on a happier note.

GIULIANI: I wish Trump were in the White House right now. I think the response would be quick, swift, and he'd quickly turn it around to our being at war against them and using different rules.

BOLLING: He's already said -- he's already used the term "Islamic terror," something we haven't heard from the White House in eight years.

GIULIANI: Yes.

BOLLING: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

Coming up next right here on "Hannity"...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: To protect our country from terrorism and extremism, we will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed or vetted.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: President-elect Donald Trump is calling for extreme vetting of refugees from countries with terror ties. Earlier today, Governor Scott Walker sent the president-elect a letter asking for more control over who comes into his state. Governor Walker and Dr. Sebastian Gorka will join us next.

And later, President-elect Donald Trump and Bill Clinton are exchanging words as the former president continues to complain about the election results. Laura Ingraham will be here to weigh in.

That and a whole lot more as "Hannity" continues.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: To protect our country from terrorism and extremism, we will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed or vetted. You know, I've used the expression "extreme vetting!" Extreme -- oh, it's going to be extreme!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: That was President-elect Donald Trump during his thank you tour promising extreme vetting of refugees from countries with ties to terror. Today, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump asking for his state to have more authority over deciding the amount of refugees to accept.

Joining us now to explain more is the man himself, Governor Scott Walker. Thank you for joining us. Governor, so what exactly do you want states, Wisconsin, and every state, frankly, to be able to do?

GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS.: Well, it's all about safety. We want to know who's in our state, particularly if they're refugees coming from places like Syria, where we know the Islamic State has a known presence. We don't want to have happen, sadly, what we've seen happen many places throughout Europe. We want to know the people have been properly vetted, and we don't have that under the Obama administration, and I believe confidently we're going to have that when Donald Trump's the president.

BOLLING: So it seems so logical, to let a state decide who's coming into the state. Why is that? Is this just an Obama policy and it would be as simple as a policy change for President Donald Trump to fix, or is it -- is it have to go through legal machinations?

WALKER: Oh, I think it's something can be done quite simply. I know last year, we were talking with the president's secretary of Homeland Security - - and I know there's a lot of frustration amongst the governors, not just amongst Republicans. Overwhelmingly, obviously, it's Republican governors we were upset. But even some Democrats were upset that they didn't even know who was in their state.

And when you think about it, this is not just people coming in from Syria. These are refugees. They're defined -- a refugee is someone who's eventually going to go back to their country of origin. I think the whole idea is ridiculous that we're not working with our allies in the Gulf region to make sure that -- a lot of those folks would be better suited going to some of our partners, some of our allies in the Persian Gulf area so that eventually, when things improve, they can go back there.

They're coming to the United States, chances are they're not going back. That defies the definition of a refugee. But even for those who legitimately are seeking asylum here, we can't -- under this current administration, we can't distinguish between those who might want to do us harm and those who legitimately want to get away from the problems they see...

BOLLING: So how -- how...

WALKER: ... in the Middle East.

BOLLING: How does it -- how does it work? Tell our audience who it works. Do the feds coming and say, Hey, you know, you're going to have, I don't know, 3,000 refugees who are seeking asylum from various countries coming to Wisconsin, we're placing them there?

WALKER: They're not even -- they're not even as candid as that. For all the talk and hype about what they do out there, you find out after the fact. The states don't have any real ability to have any real control over who's coming in or even knowing until they start -- sometimes, you actually hear about it as a governor in the media before you even find out about anything via the government at the federal level.

That's just absolutely wrong. It's wrong from the safety standpoint. I just spent -- about two weeks ago, I was in Afghanistan and Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Germany, talking to our service men and women, and I know the threats are real. I saw it very vividly in places like Afghanistan, where there's more than 20 different organizations that want to do Americans harm through terrorist-related groups, radical Islamic terrorism groups.

BOLLING: So...

WALKER: We know they're all over the world, and the last thing we is people in without vetting them and knowing that they're going to be safe for our families and our citizens.

BOLLING: Sure. And so governor, and so let's say a neighboring state like Illinois has a wide open, policy, We'll take as many as you want to give us, you're bordering Illinois. What's to stop a refugee to settling in Illinois and next year, move up north to Wisconsin?

WALKER: Well, that's the problem with this. The federal government isn't doing their job. One of the core elements of our federal government -- there shouldn't be many. I'm one of those people who think the federal government should be fairly limited. The powers should flow back to the states, and more importantly, back to the people.

But protecting us, protecting our borders, protecting our country through our military, protecting our national security should be one of the primary roles of the federal government. And they're failing it right now because we don't know whether they come to Wisconsin, Illinois, or anywhere else -- we don't know that there's sufficient vetting being done to ensure that these people are not radical jihads...

BOLLING: Yes, it's like...

WALKER: ... who are going to do us harm.

BOLLING: It's a big issue we have with Europe. When they go into one country, they can travel freely to another country, only on state level here.

Governor Walker, thank you for joining us. Keep us abreast of what's going on with that initiative.

WALKER: Merry Christmas to you and your viewers.

BOLLING: You, too, Governor, and everyone in Wisconsin.

Joining us now with reaction is the author of "Defeating Jihad," Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Dr Gorka, you just heard Governor Walker saying, Hey, I want a say in which refugees or any are coming into my state. This seems so logical. Why is the Obama policy just put people in where they want to do it?

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, AUTHOR, "DEFEATING JIHAD": I can't agree more with the governor. How outrageous. Are we not a republic made up of states? What is this that the federal authority can do whatever they wish, willy- nilly, placing people that we know, according to the director of the FBI, cannot be adequately vetted across the nation?

Not only that, let me add one more outrageous aspect to the way the Syrian refugee crisis has been dealt with. Once the federal authorities that cannot physically cannot vet these people adequately, hands over these individuals who have been given refugee status by Washington to the local charities that place them into American society, at that point the federal authorities are not allowed to know where those people live, only the charities that have placed them into the local communities. That is the recipe for disaster, Eric.

BOLLING: Travel freely as you say, they're not allowed to track them.

Doctor, so ISIS has said infiltrate the American refugee system, get our fighters in there through the refugee system. Do you think right now currently there are ISIS fighters, jihadists, within our refugee system, people we've taken in?

GORKA: Without a doubt. Look at what happened in Europe. Individuals with asylum status, refugees who had asylum status in the European Union executed attacks in Europe in the last two years, that is just a fact. The reality is that when you're coming from a warzone, unless we have the time to vet you with in depth counterintelligence interrogations, we don't know who you are, because Assad isn't going to give us the data to check who you are. As a result it is impossible to verify exactly your intentions.

So ISIS has said, we will use the refugee streams. Of the 400 plus terrorist cases that have been prosecuted in America in the last 15 years, more than half of them involved people who were not born in the United States, many of them who were immigrants or people who had refugee status. These are just the facts, Eric.

BOLLING: No, you touched on something very important. The federal government, the feds, are not allowed to track the refugees once they're placed. What do you mean they're not allowed?

GORKA: They're not allowed to know where these people -- so once the dossier gets -- once they've been picked, yes, you're an asylum seeker, yes you're a refugee, they've been approved by the federal government, and then a charity takes over. Often a campaign --

BOLLING: But why aren't they allowed?

GORKA: Sorry. Privacy rights of people who aren't Americans, Eric. This is the absurdity. This is the same reason that was given as to why the Facebook page of somebody like the San Bernardino killer, the woman who came on a fiance visa, why her Facebook page which had jihadist material on it could not be accessed, could not be read by a federal government employee because that could have been impinged her privacy.

BOLLING: Privacy rights of people who aren't American, and frankly we're having a hard time vetting. Dr. Gorka, thank you very much.

GORKA: Thanks, Eric.

BOLLING: Coming up, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton are in a war of words after the former president took a shot at the president-elect. We'll tell you what they're now saying, and Laura Ingraham will be here with reaction, next.

Plus --

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I am asking Congress to support the construction of new roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, and railways all across our nation. We're going to do it.

(APPLAUSE)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to fix America's crumbling roads and bridges as a new report says he's putting together a task force to help build his campaign promise. Former governor Mike Huckabee is here with reaction, that and more as "Hannity" continues.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, and live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.

ISIS now claiming responsibility for yesterday's Christmas market attack in Berlin, Germany. Twelve people were killed, 50 injured when a truck driver slammed into the busy downtown market. German police are still hunting for the driver right now. They arrested a Pakistani man who matched witness descriptions but released him because there wasn't enough evidence to tie him to the rampage.

A brush fire burning dangerously close to home in Simi Valley California. Firefighters from both Ventura and Los Angeles counties fighting the flames which have burned more than 60 acres tonight. No evacuation orders have been issued and so far, there are no reports of injuries or damaged homes. It's not clear yet what sparked the brush fire. California has been plagued by severe drought.

I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to "Hannity." For all your headlines logon to FoxNews.com.

BOLLING: Welcome back to "Hannity." The election is over and the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump is just a month away. But former president Bill Clinton is still making excuses for his wife's devastating defeat. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: And she prevailed against it all, but, you know, in the end we had the Russians and the FBI, we couldn't prevail against that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: The former president echoed those excuses to a local newspaper, saying that Trump, quote, "doesn't know much. One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him." Clinton also said that he received a cordial phone call from Mr. Trump after the election. The president-elect responded on Twitter writing, quote, "Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong. He called me with a very nice congratulations. He doesn't know much, especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states and more. They focused on the wrong states."

This prompted a response from Bill Clinton who tweeted, quote, "Here's one thing that real Donald Trump and I can agree on -- I called him after the election."

Joining me now with reaction is Fox News contributor and editor in chief of Lifezette, Laura Ingraham. OK, Laura, it's funny the back and forth on the tweets and all, but it really started with president Clinton blaming everyone accept Hillary for her loss. He blamed the Russians, he blamed the phony e-mail scandal, he blamed Comey, he blamed everybody except her lousy candidacy.

LAURA INGRAHAM, EDITOR IN CHIEF, LIFEZETTE.COM: The amazing thing about that is Bill Clinton should really know better than to make that angry white male comment. I mean, he was governor of Arkansas. I mean, he's a good ole boy originally from Arkansas. He should know better.

Hillary Clinton made that catastrophic mistake with her "irredeemable and deplorable" comment. And now Bill Clinton comes out after the election, after the Electoral College, and makes that really bitter statement. That's the kind of thing that got them in trouble during the campaign.

And it really -- it's odd because he usually has better judgment than that. He actually has a better, I think, sense of the people of this country than his wife did, certainly. He's obviously a two-term president. But it doesn't win them any friends, certainly doesn't win them anymore support. So I find that really, that's odd. It's kind of sad actually for Bill Clinton as sadness goes for someone worth $175 million.

BOLLING: Do you know what else he forgot? He also forgot that he called ObamaCare a crazy system with a couple weeks left before the election. That didn't help either.

INGRAHAM: He also said that Obama, Obama the candidate in 2008 was, what did he say, one of the biggest fantasies ever. He trashed Obamacare. He at various times stepped in it during the campaign season early on for Hillary Clinton. He became in a way too big of a personality. People said over-shining her -- overshadowing her at some point.

And at this point again, it's sour grapes, and it's everything but what they need to do. What the Democrats need to do is figure out why the middle class white voter is leaving the Democrat party. And instead, they come out and Bill Clinton comes out and says well, he got a bunch of angry white males to vote for him. If you're a white middle class guy and you hear that, why are you ever going to vote Democrat again?

BOLLING: And this narrative it seems to be expanding. They want to keep on barking up this tree. MTV, I don't know if you saw it today, they had a video out with New Year's resolutions for white guys.

INGRAHAM: Oh, yes. Well, they're pushing the race narrative again because it allows them to avoid the conversation that they need to have amongst themselves and with the mirror. Everyone's to blame except in the man in the mirror.

Again, if you want to tell all white voters that they're bad people, they're dumb, they're a bunch of troglodytes, they're not smart, they're anti-intellectual, I guess you could do that. That to me seems like a really dumb political strategy and it's really mean. So there's the tolerant ones, they're the nice people, they like children, puppies, and lollipops on all the trees, but at the bitter end they are about identity politics, Eric. They're about dividing this country, and they're still doing that in the aftermath of the shocking defeat of Hillary Clinton. It's mindboggling.

BOLLING: And it's not working for them. Now the Republicans have the White House, Republicans have 52 senators, they have the Senate. They've got somewhere around 65 advantages. They have 31 governorships across the country and they're expanding. It doesn't look like whatever identity politics game they've been playing for years is working.

INGRAHAM: It doesn't work, and beyond that, looking to the midterm election cycle, they have an enormous number of seats to defend. And if Trump starts improving the country, the policies start being enacted, the economy continues to grow, I don't know where they're going to go with this argument.

I'm just trying to look practically going forward. It seems to me that they have to go back to the rustbelt on say, we heard you. We're going to tailor our policies and our message to your pain and we're going to focus on advancing the interests of all Americans, but especially those in the middle and the working poor that have been left behind. And that's what we're going to focus on. To me, that would be a better strategy for them.

BOLLING: It should be tailored a little bit more specific. We blew you off, we lost, now we're hearing you, maybe we'll fix this going forward.

Quick comment about a minute or so. Michelle Obama saying hope is leaving the country just as her husband and she are leaving the White House.

INGRAHAM: It's how she began. She began in the campaign of 2008 talking as for the first time as an adult she's proud of her country, and she seems to identify national pride with how she and her husband are doing. That's an odd thing to do. If you're successful, then you love the country. If you're unsuccessful or people don't buy into your policies, then you're not excited about the country or you're not hopeful.

And she said, Eric, if we don't have hope, what do we have? I'll tell you a couple things we have. We have our freedom. We have our independence. We have our founding documents. We have our representative democracy, and we have our faith. Sometimes it's hard to have hope, yes, for sure. A lot of people were demoralized in 2008 and 2012. But guess what. We have a lot to be thankful for and grateful for in this country regardless of what the political climate is. And that was another, that was a sad, sad moment, I think for Michelle Obama. And it's probably not the best way to end her time as first lady.

BOLLING: Laura Ingraham, thank you. We're going to leave it right there. We agree with you on all that stuff.

INGRAHAM: Merry Christmas, Eric. You did a great job this year.

BOLLING: Laura, Merry Christmas to you too. Did I say it loud enough. Merry Christmas to you too, Laura Ingraham.

INGRAHAM: You did a great job this year, Eric. You gave really, honest analysis and really on-target analysis when so many people were wrong. So hats off to you.

BOLLING: Thank you, and it goes right back at you as well. Thank you, Laura.

Coming up right here next on "Hannity."

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I am asking Congress to support the construction of new roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, and railways, all across our nation. We're going to do it.

(APPLAUSE)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: President-elect Donald Trump vows to fix America's crumbling roads and bridges. The Washington Post is reporting that the president- elect is working to create a, quote, "infrastructure task force" to get the job done. Former Governor Mike Huckabee is here with reaction, that and a whole lot more as we continue.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Another critical element of our jobs pledge is a historic $1 trillion investment in our crumbling infrastructure. Our infrastructure is going to hell. Our bridges are deficient. Our roads are in disrepair, and our airports are like third world countries.

I am asking Congress to support the construction of new roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, and railways, all across our nation. We're going to do it.

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: And we're going to build it on time, on budget, not for three times what it's supposed to cost.

(APPLAUSE)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BOLLING: That was President-elect Donald Trump promising to rebuild America's infrastructure, and today, The Washington Post is reporting, quote, "President Donald Trump is preparing to create an infrastructure tasks force that will help carry out the ambitious federal spending program he intends to undertake upon taking office."

So what would this task force look like and how should fixing our infrastructure be paid for? Joining us now, former 2016 GOP presidential candidate, former governor Mike Huckabee. Good to have you. So Mr. Trump wants to spend I think he wants to spend over $1 trillion. First of all, you like the idea of spending $1 trillion, and then again, we got to get to this, how are you going to pay for it?

MIKE HUCKABEE, R-FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Let's first talk about the fact that we really do have probably $2 trillion to $3 trillion in total needs that have been identified by Civil Engineers of America. And I know that sounds like let's just go spend a bunch of government money. But Eric, in some cases it's the government that has to spend the money to build things like roads and bridges and airports, water and treatment plants.

And here a fact. If you build roads, for every $1 billion that you spend in building a road, a highway, you put 7,900 people to work at the job site. If you start adding the indirect jobs, you're talking about 16,000, 17,000 more jobs. So the best way to get people off of government support is to give them a job. The most effective way to put people on a job is to do infrastructure jobs because it's the one thing you cannot outsource. You cannot say, China, build me a road and ship it over. You cannot do that.

BOLLING: So how do we pay for it? There's been some ideas floated, you increase the gas tax, slap a gas tax on because a lot of the infrastructure are going to be the roads and bridges used by the people who are driving, or do you use some other for a tax?

HUCKABEE: I think it's a combination of several things. For example, one thing Donald Trump has talked about is repatriating a lot of the money that corporations of parked overseas to protect it from the very onerous tax code. And he's talking about allowing it to come back to the U.S., maybe a 10 percent tax to bring it back. What if you can get all the tax off of that by investing it in infrastructure bonds? Safe bonds, good way to pay for it. When I was governor that's one of the things we did. We rebuilt our entire interstate system. We did it under budget, ahead of schedule, did it without long term debt.

Here's another factor. What about taking a lot of the extraordinary federal land that we have, putting it in private sector hands? And I'm not talking about selling off Yellowstone Park. I'm talking about the millions of acres that we have in many western states. It's not on the tax rolls. The federal government has kept an enormous amount of land that's not in protected forests or parks. It's just land. Using that in another way, putting the mineral rights up, for example.

BOLLING: That's a great way to do it as well. There are vast amounts of developable energy sector, you can drill, you can frack. And those are on federal lands. And you take some of those fees and apply it to infrastructure. Mike, $1 trillion, over what period of time?

HUCKABEE: We can look at a 10-year period, maybe looking at a five-year period. The needs are urgent. And one thing about infrastructure, Eric, that a lot of people may not understand -- for every year that you wait, you're adding great cost to the project.

For example, if you have a road that is in bad shape and you wait three years, now it's in worse shape and what would have cost $5 billion will cost $7 billion, $8 billion, $9 billion. So really there is no benefit to holding off on getting some of these things done.

BOLLING: Governor, thank you for explaining that with us tonight, thank you very much.

Coming up, tonight's "Question of the Day." Stay with us.

Annie Glenn turned 97 on Friday. On Thursday, she made her first public appearance since her husband's memorial service, a reception at Ohio State University's John Glenn College of Public Affairs.

John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Dec. 8 at the age of 95.

Annie Glenn told The Associated Press that losing her husband of 73 years has been difficult.

"Oh, gosh. It's just awful, because we've known each other since we were 2 years old, and he and I, we were both on the same side, he was always helping me, with the kids and everything," she said. "I really miss him terribly. There's nothing I can do about it."

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

John Glenn's body lay in repose at the Ohio Statehouse before a public service attended by hundreds, including the U.S. vice president, current and former Ohio governors and other dignitaries.

"Wasn't that special? I didn't expect that at all," she said. "It was very touching."

Annie Glenn couldn't quite say how her public pace may change now that John is gone and she has recovered after a recent fall.

"We always went to things together, and so it's simply ...," she said, reflecting. "I just can't explain to you what I have to go through."

FORMER ASTRONAUT AND US SENATOR JOHN GLENN DIES AT 95

Glenn said she fell about a month ago and has been recovering from the pain of three broken ribs and compressed vertebrae. She said she was "out and about" and hurrying when she slipped.

On Thursday, she moved slowly, but on her own, using a walker.

Accompanied by her daughter, Lyn, Glenn kissed hands and chatted cheerfully as several dozen faculty, staff and students celebrated her birthday over cake and coffee. Glenn apologized for being unable to recognize people because of her failing eyesight.

Lyn Glenn said she and her brother, David, have been taking turns visiting their mother at her high-rise condo in Columbus about once a month since their father died, traveling from their respective homes in Minnesota and California.State programs that require physicians to check drug registries before writing prescriptions appeared to slash the odds of doctor-shopping for opioid pain relievers, a new study found.

"Our study shows that prescription-drug monitoring programs are a promising component of a multifaceted strategy to address the opioid epidemic," Ryan Mutter, one of the study authors, said in a phone interview. He is a health economist at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration in Rockville, Maryland.

Mutter and other researchers analyzed annual nationwide surveys of drug use and health from 2004 until 2014, when 36 states implemented prescription-drug monitoring programs, or PDMPs.

PDMPs are state-run electronic databases designed to track prescribing of controlled substances and to identify people at high risk of using opioids for nonmedical purposes. Every state except Missouri now has a drug-monitoring program. Some states have mandatory programs requiring physicians to participate, and other states have voluntary programs.

The study, reported in the journal Addictive Behaviors, found that in states where physicians were required to check an electronic database before writing an opioid prescription, the odds that two or more doctors would be giving pain relievers for nonmedical purposes to a single patient were reduced by 80 percent. States that implemented voluntary monitoring programs showed a 56 percent reduction in the odds of doctor-shopping.

States with mandatory prescription-drug monitoring programs reduced the use of painkillers for nonmedical purposes by an average of 20 days a year, the study found. States with voluntary prescription-drug monitoring program reduced the use of painkillers for nonmedical purposes by an average of 10 days a year.

"Overall, this, as well as other studies, suggests there's promise for prescription-drug monitoring programs," Dr. Stephen W. Patrick said in a phone interview. "But they aren't a panacea."

"We really need a comprehensive approach. It isn't one thing that will help get us out of the opioid epidemic," said Patrick, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. He treats newborns struggling with the symptoms of withdrawal from opioids prescribed to their mothers and was not involved in the new study.

Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1999, deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled, as have sales of opioids, including the painkillers oxycodone (Oxycontin) and hydrocodone (Vicodin).

The number of PDMPs has expanded rapidly across states since 2000, but prior studies have shown mixed results about their effectiveness, the study authors write.

One previous study found that drug-monitoring programs help prevent 10 opioid-overdose deaths a day in the U.S., yet improvements could save another two people a day. States with the most robust programs - ones that tracked a greater number of potentially addictive medications and updated their databases at least weekly - saw the biggest drops in overdose deaths, the previous study showed.

Public health advocates worry that an unintended consequence of drug-monitoring programs could be that opioid users would seek drugs illegally and turn to heroin, the authors write. But the current study found that PDMPs did not lead to an increase in people starting to use heroin.

Lead author Mir M. Ali said in a phone interview he found it "reassuring" that drug-monitoring programs were not responsible for opioid users substituting heroin. Ali is a health economist at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

"In any situation where you're limiting supply, people might begin to substitute," Patrick said. "What we really need to do is focus on how we get control of the prescription opioid epidemic."President Trump claimed at his marathon press conference Thursday that his administration is running like a “fine-tuned machine” and has made “incredible progress” since the inauguration.

“I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done,” Trump said.

It’s a difficult assertion to fact-check, as the records of 44 other presidents’ first month on the job are all unique in their own right. But Trump’s first four weeks have been undeniably active, as he’s kept his commitment to disrupt the D.C. establishment.

TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS

To date, Trump has: Signed 24 executive actions spanning everything from the economy to national security; signed five bills; nominated a Supreme Court justice; and held numerous phone calls and meetings with foreign leaders. Some congressional conservatives are starting to get anxious about the slow pace of moving bigger legislation – like an ObamaCare repeal – but Trump is vowing big action in the weeks ahead.

Here’s a look back at the first four weeks of the Trump era:

WEEK 1

Jan. 20: Trump took the oath of office declaring, “From this moment on, it's going to be America first.” As one of his opening acts, he signed an order directing federal agencies to ease “regulatory burdens” of ObamaCare.

Jan. 21: Amid burgeoning controversy over leaks surrounding the Russia hacking controversy, Trump visited CIA headquarters and vowed to destroy the Islamic State. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer kicked off his tenure on a contentious note, delivering a scathing statement to the press about inauguration coverage and declaring: “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. That's what you guys should be writing and covering.” Some of his factual claims that day were later shown to be incorrect.

Jan. 23: This was billed by Trump’s team as the first full day of work at the White House. The president signed three executive actions including a federal hiring freeze and a directive to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Jan. 24: Trump signed five more executive actions: Two revived the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines; another sped up environmental reviews of other infrastructure projects.

Jan. 25: The so-called “Trump Bump” hit new heights. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 20,000 for the first time. Two new executive orders on immigration also were signed. The first called for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and pulling federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities; the other called for the construction of a southern border wall. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the wall would be built in two years, though the timeline remains unclear. As Trump ordered the wall, the Mexican president canceled a trip to the United States scheduled for the following week.

Jan. 27: Trump spoke with the Mexican president by phone, apparently in hopes of smoothing over tensions. Both men said the call went well, though before Trump picked up the phone, he tweeted: "Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough. Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!"

Later that day, the president signed what would be his most controversial executive order, temporarily halting the refugee program and imposing a travel ban for residents of seven mostly Muslim countries originally identified as “countries of concern” by the Obama administration: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order would soon be put on hold by the courts, after a rollout that initially caused confusion at airports around the world. The same day, Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said the visit further strengthened the special relationship between Britain and America.

WEEK 2

Jan. 28: Trump issued a memorandum instructing the Pentagon to come up with a plan in 30 days to defeat ISIS. Another memo moved White House adviser Steve Bannon to the National Security Council, prompting bipartisan complaints. The same day, Trump reportedly criticized the Australian prime minister during a contentious phone call focusing on a refugee agreement. Trump reportedly boasted about his Electoral College win and then hung up, though he later claimed it was a genial call.

Jan. 30: Trump, who during the campaign promised to try cutting 75 percent of government rules and regulations, signed the “2-for-1” order, which required agencies to nix two regulations for every new rule they want to issue. The same day, 900 State Department employees circulated a “memo of dissent” that opposed Trump’s travel ban. Trump tweeted: “There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!”

Jan. 31: Trump nominated federal Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, choosing a jurist widely seen by conservatives as a fitting successor to the late Antonin Scalia.

Feb. 3: The Trump administration imposed new sanctions on nearly two-dozen individuals and companies in response to Iranian ballistic missile tests. This, in the wake of then-National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s brief appearance in the White House press room where he put Tehran “officially on notice.” The same day, U.S. District Judge James Robert, a George W. Bush appointee, granted a temporary restraining order against the travel ban.

WEEK 3

Feb. 7: School-choice advocate Betsy DeVos was confirmed as secretary of Education, in a historically close vote. Vice President Pence had to attend to cast a tie-breaking vote in his capacity as president of the Senate.

Feb. 9: A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled against the Trump administration on the travel ban. Trump tweeted in response: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” Meanwhile, news reports emerged that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Russia’s ambassador – raising the possibility that Flynn had misled Pence on that point.

WEEK 4

Feb. 13: Flynn resigned, apparently at Trump’s request, after the White House concluded he misled Pence and other officials regarding his contacts with Russia. Amid the controversy, the administration and allied Republicans drew attention to the leaks that fueled the reports on Flynn and others. Trump tweeted, “The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?”

Feb. 14: Trump signed his first major bill, eliminating a controversial rule requiring oil and gas companies to disclose payments to foreign governments.

Feb. 15: Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He touted the prospects for a “great peace deal” in the Middle East while publicly prodding Netanyahu on Israel settlement building. Meanwhile, facing bipartisan pressure over a messy divorce as well as his fast food chain’s treatment of workers, Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary Andrew Puzder withdrew from consideration.

Feb. 16: Amid damaging leaks and controversy surrounding his team, Trump held an extraordinary press conference that lasted more than 75 minutes during which he chastised the media and defended his administration’s work. He again called the Russia narrative “fake news” and said some in the media are covering him with a tone of “hatred.” The president also signed legislation ending a key Obama administration regulation meant to protect streams near coal mines. Trump called it a “job-killing rule.”A Mexican woman trying to avoid deportation took refuge in a Denver church Wednesday after U.S. immigration authorities denied her request to remain in the country, the latest case to rattle the immigrant community as the White House promises to boost enforcement.

Jeanette Vizguerra skipped her scheduled check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in the suburb of Centennial. About 100 supporters demonstrated outside the building as her attorney, Hans Meyer, and a minister went inside.

ICE AGENTS REPORTEDLY ARREST ALLEGED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICITM AT TEXAS COURTHOUSE

They said they were met by a lobby full of agents, a few of them armed, and were told Vizguerra would not get another extension as she tries to obtain a U visa, sometimes given to crime victims.

ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer said Vizguerra was an "enforcement priority" because she had two misdemeanor convictions and a judge originally issued final deportation orders for her in 2011.

Meyer said Vizguerra had been granted several previous extensions under the Obama administration because officials realize it can take two or three years to obtain the visa.

PHOENIX OFFICIALS TURN DOWN PETITION TO ADOPT SANCTUARY CITY STATUS

"This is a big, huge red flare that the Trump administration has plans to deport as many people as possible," said Meyer, who declined to disclose details of the crime to which Vizguerra was a victim.

Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority, declaring plans to build a border wall, threatening to cut funding to cities that don't cooperate with federal immigration authorities and issuing an executive order making it clear that just about any immigrant in the country illegally could be a priority for deportation, particularly those with outstanding deportation orders.

ICE's Neudauer would not say whether denying Vizguerra's request for an extension was a change in policy.

Vizguerra took refuge in the church, a common tactic to avoid deportation because authorities generally don't enter places of worship, as immigrant advocates called for the release of 23-year-old in Washington state who was detained despite participating in a federal program to protect those brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

'DAY WITHOUT IMMIGRANTS' PROTESTS BEING HELD ACROSS US

She said she was thinking of Daniel Ramirez Medina as well as Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, an Arizona woman arrested during a routine ICE check-in and deported to Mexico the next day, before taking sanctuary.

Vizguerra, crying at first, spoke in Spanish by phone through a bullhorn to supporters outside the ICE building and later in person at the First Unitarian Church not far from the state Capitol.

With three of her four children joining her on the altar, the former union organizer and house cleaner said her only crimes were related to working in the country illegally to support her family.

She said she was arrested for not having a driver's license or current vehicle registration. Officers also discovered that she had a forged identity document, which she said had a Social Security number made up of digits from her birth date, not one that belonged to an actual person.

Vizguerra said she told her children last week of her decision to stay in a basement room of the church that they had painted in 2014 in preparation for any immigrant who might need to seek sanctuary.

"You can see the reasons behind me why I am fighting so hard to win my case," she said of her family.A python in Queensland, Australia, got quite a scratchy surprise when the 5-foot-long snake gulped down a tennis ball this week. Luckily for the reptile, veterinarians were able to remove the sporting good before the python starved to death.

"[The snake] would've died eventually from starvation, as it wouldn't have been able to digest the ball or have anything pass it," Trish Prendergast, senior vet nurse at Townsville Veterinary Clinic, where the ball was removed, told Live Science.

A local resident spotted the bulging snake, a coastal carpet python (Morelia spilota mcdowelli), on Monday, Feb. 6, in a backyard in Belgian Gardens, a suburb of Townsville in Queensland, and called a snake catcher to remove it. Brian West, another licensed snake catcher from Townsville Vet, did the honor, Prendergast said.

The nonvenomous snake species is one of the most common pythons in Australia and has been known to reach 14 feet in length, according to the Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc. (WIRES) in New South Wales. [Beastly Feasts: Amazing Photos of Animals and Their Prey]

"I put a plastic tube down its throat and put some paraffin oil down it [as lubrication] to help the ball come up easier," said Prendergast, who is also the reptile coordinator at North Queensland Wildlife Care Inc.

She massaged the snake's body while keeping constant pressure on the bottom of the ball. Finally, after about 20 minutes, the snake regurgitated the ball.

The snake is doing great, she said, adding that it was fed on Feb. 9 and planned to release it back into the wild.

As for why the python partook in a tennis-ball meal, she said the ball likely smelled like prey; a dog, bird or perhaps a frog had touched the ball.

This python is not alone in its odd dining habits. In the summer of 2015, a python bit off more than it could "chew," engulfing a 30-lb. porcupine. Park rangers in the Lake Eland Game Reserve in South Africa found the engorged animal dead , though they aren't sure if the spiky snack caused its demise.

Another python, a 16-foot-long Burmese python, gulped down three deer in the Everglades before it had to be euthanized. In addition to the remains of the venison meal in the python's gut, the biologists found a whopping 14 lbs. of fecal matter.

Original article on Live Science.When an 80-year-old woman went through security at Myrtle Beach Airport in South Carolina on Feb.9, officers noticed something odd about her cane.

It had an elegant bronze handle, and when it was tugged and twisted slightly, the casing fell away to reveal an enormous hidden sword.

“She had no idea it was there,” said Mark Howell, a spokesman for America’s Transport Safety Administration (TSA).

TSA discovers sword in woman's cane at airport. https://t.co/gG6UW2psCu pic.twitter.com/SyuKR2VoNy — FOX 29 (@FOX29philly) February 11, 2017

The cane was a gift from her son, and she’d been leaning on it for years-- but she agreed to surrender the cane in order to make her flight.

“It happens a lot, actually,” Howell said about the agency routinely discovering hidden weaponry.

“People pick them up at a thrift store and the sword isn’t found until we X-ray it.”

According to the Charlotte Observer, a 57-year-old man was also arrested at the same airport on Monday after officers found a gun in his carry-on luggage.

He was charged and released on a $5,000 bond.

However, Howell stated that about 99 percent of the time, passengers don’t intentionally pack guns in their carry-on bags.

“The most common excuse is ‘oops, I forgot to take it out before I came to the airport,’ or their husband or wife packed the bag for them.”

According to the TSA website, seized items are simply “terminated” unless passengers arrange for them to be checked or mailed elsewhere.Tarek and Christina El Moussa may be splitting up, but they're keeping the drama away from their HGTV show "Flip or Flop."

The 27-year-old actress whose mother is Lisa Marie Presley and grandfather the late Elvis, sat down with the New York Times’ T Magazine to talk about her sexually-fueled Starz series, “The Girlfriend Experience.” During the chat, she got candid about Michael Jackson.

ELVIS' GRANDDAUGHTER RILEY KEOUGH TALKS RISQUE NEW ROLE

“I loved him,” she told the magazine and revealed how, despite being mostly raised by her father between Hawaii and Los Angeles, she often made frequent pit stops at Graceland and Neverland Ranch.

“There were toys everywhere, animals everywhere, kids everywhere,” said Keough about her time at the King of Pop’s estate in Los Olivos, Calif. “It was like being at Disneyland all day.”

That wasn’t the only way the star’s childhood was different. Keough explained how her father home-schooled her temporarily because a traditional education became, what the publication called, “too much of a nuisance.”

“Looking back on it, I’m like, ‘Wow, my upbringing was very intense,’” she said.

ELVIS' GRANDDAUGHTER RILEY KEOUGH ON WHY MARRIAGE WAS 'THE RIGHT THING'

In 1988, Lisa Marie married musician Danny Keough, with whom she had a son, Benjamin, and daughter, Riley. The couple divorced in 1994 and Lisa Marie married Jackson later that year and divorced in 1996.

She then married actor Nicholas Cage in 2002, but divorced in 2004. Lisa Marie married guitarist/producer Michael Lockwood in 2006 and divorced in 2016 after 10 years of marriage. They share twin girls, Harper and Finley.

Jackson died from a cardiac arrest at age 50 in 2009.

Congressional Republicans had high hopes for making sweeping changes when the party gained control of Washington last month, but the 115th Congress has yet to advance the kind of barnburner legislation that marked the start of the last two administrations.

President George W. Bush proposed No Child Left Behind right after taking office, though it wasn’t signed until a year later. President Barack Obama and the 111th Congress finalized the controversial stimulus package, a children’s health insurance program, and a fair pay act by the end of February 2009.

House Speaker Paul Ryan is now trying to ease concerns within the Republican rank-and-file about the slow pace of activity by comparison. And he’s assuring them that leaders will roll out a plan to achieve their biggest goal – repealing and replacing ObamaCare – after next week’s recess.

“The plan is to repeal and replace … like we said,” Ryan told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Thursday.

As the GOP majority focuses out of the gate on rolling back Obama regulations, Ryan said Congress is precisely on the “timeline” leadership had set.

“The reason we are doing regulatory reform right now is we have a certain window of time where we can go back into the Obama administration and cancel the regulations,” Ryan told "Hannity." “It has a shelf-life of just a couple of months — we have been consuming February and March … then we are doing ObamaCare.”

But leadership is facing pressure from House conservatives, who have grown frustrated with the pace and are getting behind legislation introduced by Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would upend the health law.

“Speaker Ryan will roll out ‘ObamaCare light,’ leaving parts of ObamaCare – mine is a complete replacement bill,” Paul told Fox News. “Republicans need to come together and remember they used to be unified for a complete repeal, so let’s come back together, get this done, and move on.”

Amid separate pressure to pursue tax reform, House Republicans have been given talking points on the health law for their time with constituents during the upcoming recess. According to the document obtained by Fox News, the points stress that Republicans will advance repeal legislation “in the weeks ahead” to give “relief” from the law’s “taxes and mandates” and move forward with reforms.

Democrats, meanwhile, are pulling no punches in describing the GOP’s struggle.

“If the majority’s grand plan was to achieve nothing, then they’re on track for that,” said Adam Jentleson, former deputy chief of staff to ex-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and now senior strategist at the Center for American Progress. “Republicans have surfed on this myth that if you take away ObamaCare, things would get better and they would easily pass a replace plan — now they’re held accountable for promoting that lie.”

A source in the Senate GOP leadership noted that Obama had a “rubber-stamp” Democratic Senate, seemingly suggesting that President Trump does not – the GOP has only a slim majority in the Senate. The source pointed to the work the GOP-led Congress and White House have done over the last month to roll back some Obama administration regulations, like nullifying an SEC regulation from the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, and, most recently, overturning a rule on coal mining-debris.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News that Congress has taken “unprecedented action” in targeting and repealing some of the “most harmful” regulations from the Obama administration’s final days.

“The House has voted to change the structure of how regulations are finalized so the people have a voice in the rules of governing our lives,” McCarthy said.

Director of Public Policy at FreedomWorks Jason Pye told Fox News that Congress is taking a “positive step” to cancel Obama administration “midnight rules,” but their slow pace is cause for concern.

“This is taking far too long and the slow pace of work is giving the left the window they need to mobilize,” Pye told Fox News.

A source with the Senate Democratic leadership told Fox News that the GOP simply doesn’t have a legislative agenda “ready-to-go.”

Jentleson, who worked in the 111th Congress, told Fox News that “action from the White House” is supposed to cover up the initial “slow-launch” at the beginning of every Congress.

“The president is the one who is supposed to hit the ground running and direct Congress — especially when he has the majorities of his own party — and hand them framework for bills that everyone is together on so they can get moving quickly,” Jentleson said. “But Trump face-planted out of the gate on that, and exposed the fact that Congress is not working either.”

But Paul says much of the delay stems from the hold-up in confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks.

“I don’t know if there’s blame yet,” Paul told Fox News. “Half of our time is spent on nominations -- we need to get his Cabinet in place.”

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told Fox News that Trump has been working “nonstop” since being sworn into Office.

“Congress ought to work at the same pace President Trump has,” Meadows said, “and work to keep the promises we made to the American people, including repealing and replacing ObamaCare in its entirety, reforming our tax code, and passing legislation to secure our border.”

Newsworks.org reports (http://bit.ly/2lVBT4W ) Common Pleas Judge Kai Scott on Wednesday ruled that drugs police seized from Tyree Carroll cannot be admitted as evidence because the arresting officer wasn't legally permitted to stop and search Carroll.

A narcotics officer testified he approached Carroll on April 3, 2015, suspecting he'd recently sold drugs. The undercover officer grabbed Carroll by the arm, leading to a confrontation in which officers kicked, punched and cursed at him.

A spokesman for the Philadelphia district attorney says prosecutors haven't decided whether to appeal.

Carroll's lawyer says without the evidence, the DA's office will be forced to dismiss the case.

Information from: WHYY-FM, http://www.whyy.orgThere’s a new side to Paris Hilton.

Long gone are the days when the hotel heiress led party marathons, stirred tabloid headlines on the regular and portrayed the ditzy blonde with a baby voice to Nicole Richie’s troublemaker on the hit reality TV series “The Simple Life.” Hilton, who turns 36 on Friday, insisted she left those days behind and instead, has been expertly crafting her career as an entrepreneur.

In other words, Hilton has finally grown up.

#Queen of the Runway ✨✨✨👸🏼✨✨✨ #NYFW 🗽 A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Feb 9, 2017 at 9:52pm PST

PARIS HILTON DOESN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS A REALITY TV STAR

“I haven’t really been going to a lot of parties. All of my friends have been telling me to go out every single night, but I have to get up every morning around 7 a.m. for work,” explained Hilton to Fox News while she's in town for New York Fashion Week where she’s been spotted walking the runway for couture designers.

“I’ve only been to one party all week when usually it would have been 50 parties,” she said laughing, all while projecting a more poised voice. “My priorities have changed and I’m more focused on my business, getting up early and just being responsible, as opposed to going to all the Fashion Week parties.”

Hilton wasn’t just in town solely to scope the upcoming styles. The LA-based star has been spending time with her younger sister Nicky, who resides in New York City, as well as her 7-month-old niece Lily Grace.

PARIS HILTON GOES TO CUBA

She also promoted her 21st fragrance, Gold Rush Man, which she described as her most sophisticated scent for men. She proudly declared to us that like the late Elizabeth Taylor, she’s had a successful collection in her 12 years of producing scents. (Taylor was previously married to Hilton's great-uncle.) She also revealed that the perfume, “one of glamour and confidence,” reflected the next stage in her life.

“I feel very lucky that I grew up in a family with amazing businessmen, with my father and my grandfather — they’ve always been such incredible mentors to me that I’ve looked up to,” she explained. “Just getting advice from my family and growing up with a business mindset, I think that’s what really made me the woman I am today and the entrepreneur that I’ve become.”

And it seems like she’s determined to make her new role the most successful one yet. It’s been reported that Hilton sells $200 million worth of perfume annually. She also owns three hotels, 35 boutiques around the world and is a product manufacturer who has launched everything from makeup to children’s wear — resulting in Hilton, who hops on a plane every other day to launch or help create something new, being worth more than $100 million.

It’s also the reason why she hopes to be recognized as a role model for girls.

“I know I have a lot of young fans, especially girls who are very impressionable and are growing up,” she said. “I want to be a role model for them, an independent woman, someone they can look up to who works very hard and created her own empire. [I want to] show them that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and your confidence. I love that I could be a great role model for these girls and show that hard works pays off and that they can do it, too.”

PARIS HILTON DENIES HAVING PLASTIC SURGERY

Hilton is pleased with her success so far, but is eager to expand on what she calls an empire.

“I feel like I accomplished so much already and I’m so proud of what I’ve done so far,” said Hilton. “I’m so excited to be following in my family’s footsteps and getting involved in real estate and opening up my own properties. Another area I’m really focusing on, the next step in my life, is working on different tech projects involving virtual reality and apps….just really innovative, and game-changing projects within the tech world. That’s one area I’m involved in now.”

She is a paradox. She is faithful & yet detached. She is committed & yet relaxed. She loves everyone & yet no one. She is sociable & also a loner. She is gentle & yet tough. She is passionate but also platonic. In short she is predictable in her own unpredictability... ✨✨👸🏼✨✨ A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Jan 25, 2017 at 10:58am PST

However, one thing Hilton has zero plans on conquering again is reality TV. When asked, Hilton stressed that while that was the beginning stage of her career, she’s happily moved on and is just too busy with her countless business projects, which is what she was really meant to do as a Hilton.

“I get calls every single day from networks and companies pitching ideas for a show,” Hilton explained. “Every single day. I really enjoyed being a pioneer in the reality television world, but now I’m on to bigger and better things. I don’t know, I’m just not into the whole reality thing anymore at all. I just see myself more as a businesswoman now and that’s what I really prefer to put my focus on now.”Scientists have discovered a huge reservoir of molten carbon deep beneath the western U.S.

The research, which was conducted by geologists at the Department of Earth Sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London in the U.K., located the deep-Earth area of melting carbon that spans almost 695,000 square miles.

Experts harnessed the world’s largest array of seismic sensors to map the vast reservoir, which is 217 miles below the Earth’s surface, according to Royal Holloway. The 583 sensors measured the Earth’s vibrations to create a picture of the area’s deep sub surface.

FIRST CAME A 'CATASTROPHIC COLLAPSE,' THEN A TSUNAMI

The study, which is published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, indicates that the Earth contains much more carbon than was previously thought.

“It would be impossible for us to drill far enough down to physically ‘see’ the Earth’s mantle, so using this massive group of sensors we have to paint a picture of it using mathematical equations to interpret what is beneath us,” said Dr. Sash Hier-Majumder of Royal Holloway, in a statement. “Under the western US is a huge underground partially-molten reservoir of liquid carbonate. It is a result of one of the tectonic plates of the Pacific Ocean forced underneath the western USA, undergoing partial melting thanks to gasses like CO 2 and H 2 O contained in the minerals dissolved in it.”

As a result of the study, scientists now understand that the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s upper mantle, which forms most of the Earth’s exterior, may be up to 100 million metric tons.

DEFORESTATION IN BRAZIL INCREASED 30% IN 12 MONTHS, AGENCY SAYS

By way of comparison, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that global carbon emission in 2011 was nearly 10 billion metric tons. The carbon reservoir will eventually make its way to the surface through volcanic eruptions, slowly contributing to climate change, according to Royal Holloway.Smoking comes along with numerous health concerns that are incentives to quit, but one case proved cigarettes can be beneficial.

Rice University researchers found that smoking was the reason why a 20-something woman had anemia, but her father, who is a smoker, did not.

Both the man and his daughter share a gene mutation that encodes hemoglobin, which is responsible for delivering oxygen around the body, according to the study.

Researchers found the mutation did not impact the iron content in the dad’s blood, but was responsible for the woman’s anemia. More research determined that absorbing carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke can be therapeutic for those who suffer from the disorder.

“He may never be an athlete because his blood can’t carry as much oxygen, but smoking has prevented him from being anemic,” researcher John Olson said. “And there’s a side benefit. People with this trait are more resistant to carbon monoxide poisoning.”In a Mexican cave system so beautiful and hot that it is called both Fairyland and hell, scientists have discovered life trapped in crystals that could be 50,000 years old.

The bizarre and ancient microbes were found dormant in caves in Naica, Mexico, and were able to exist by living on minerals such as iron and manganese, said Penelope Boston, head of NASA's Astrobiology Institute.

"It's super life," said Boston, who presented the discovery Friday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Boston.

If confirmed, the find is yet another example of how microbes can survive in extremely punishing conditions on Earth.

Though it was presented at a science conference and was the result of nine years of work, the findings haven't yet been published in a scientific journal and haven't been peer reviewed. Boston planned more genetic tests for the microbes she revived both in the lab and on site.

The life forms — 40 different strains of microbes and even some viruses — are so weird that their nearest relatives are still 10 percent different genetically. That makes their closest relative still pretty far away, about as far away as humans are from mushrooms, Boston said.

The Naica caves — an abandoned lead and zinc mine — are half a mile (800 meters) deep. Before drilling occurred by a mine company, the mines had been completely cut off from the outside world. Some were as vast as cathedrals with crystals lining the iron walls. They were also so hot that scientists had to don cheap versions of space suits — to prevent contamination with outside life — and had ice packs all over their bodies.

Boston said the team could only work about 20 minutes at a time before ducking to a "cool" room that was about 100 degrees (38 Celsius).

NASA wouldn't allow Boston to share her work for outside review before Friday's announcement so scientists couldn't say much. But University of South Florida biologist Norine Noonan, who wasn't part of the study but was on a panel where Boston presented her work, said it made sense.

"Why are we surprised?" Noonan said. "As a biologist I would say life on Earth is extremely tough and extremely versatile."

This isn't the oldest extreme life. Several years ago, a different group of scientists published studies about microbes that may be half a million years old and still alive. Those were trapped in ice and salt, which isn't quite the same as rock or crystal, Boston said.

The age of the Naica microbes was determined by outside experts who looked at where the microbes were located in the crystals and how fast those crystals grow.

It's not the only weird life Boston is examining. She is also studying microbes commonly found in caves in the United States, Ukraine and elsewhere that eat copper sulfate and seem to be close to indestructible.

"It's simply another illustration of just how completely tough Earth life is," Boston said.Jacqueline Kennedy and David Ormsby Gore met frequently during John F. Kennedy's presidency, even taking shared vacations with their spouses. But by 1967, both were widowed and bonding over their shared loneliness.

A year later, their relationship had turned romantic, at least on one side.

Ormsby Gore—a close friend of JFK and a former British ambassador to the US—proposed marriage to Jacqueline, who declined and wed Aristotle Onassis instead, reports the New York Times.

"If ever I can find some healing and some comfort—it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain," she wrote in one of 19 letters to Ormsby Gore to be sold at auction by Bonhams in London next month. "I can find that now—if the world will let us."

In a draft letter, Ormsby Gore described how his "pathetic plans" for the pair had been dashed. "As for your photograph I weep when I look at it," he wrote.

After marrying Onassis, Jacqueline replied, "We have known so much & shared & lost so much together. I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut."

A rep for Bonhams says it's rare to find items with "this quantity of insight into Jackie’s personal life and that level of intimacy."

Trump will hold a campaign rally at an airport hangar in central Florida on Saturday afternoon. The event in Melbourne comes as he seeks to regain his footing following a series of crises that have threatened his young administration.

For Trump, the rally offers an opportunity to recapture the energy of his upstart campaign and to connect with his supporters. Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump wants to "speak directly to people across this county in an unfiltered way, in a way that doesn't have any bias."

During an appearance Friday at a Boeing plant in South Carolina, Trump slipped back into his campaign's "America First" message with ease.

"America is going to start winning again, winning like never ever before," he said, as the company showed off its new 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft. "We're not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore in any way, shape or form."

Big rowdy rallies were the hallmark of Trump's presidential campaign. He continued to do them, although with smaller crowds, throughout the early part of the transition, during what he called a "thank you" tour.

The event Saturday is being put on by Trump's campaign, rather than the White House. Asked if it was a rally for the 2020 election, Sanders called it "a campaign rally for America." Trump himself promoted his appearance on Twitter: "Looking forward to the Florida rally tomorrow. Big crowd expected!"

Since taking office, Trump has lurched from one problem to the next, including the botched rollout of his immigration order, struggles confirming his Cabinet picks and a near-constant stream of reports about strife within his administration.

Trump's reset effort started Thursday with a marathon press conference where he defended his administration and denounced the "criminal" leaks that took down his top national security adviser. He used the platform to complain about the political press and to brag that his administration was a "fine-tuned machine."

On Friday, even as Trump sought to get out of Washington and talk about job creation, he continued to rail against the media online. He tweeted that "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"

Trump is set to spend the holiday weekend at what he calls his "Winter White House," his Mar-a-Lago resort. While there, he is also expected to continue deliberations on whom to appoint as his next national security adviser.

On Monday, Trump demanded the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn following revelations that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about Flynn's contacts with Russia. Trump's first choice to replace Flynn — retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward — turned down the offer.

The White House said Trump might interview national security candidates at his estate over the weekend.

FBI Director James Comey left a meeting with senators on the intelligence committee Friday afternoon. Neither Comey nor the senators would discuss the subject of the meeting, but it followed reports that the FBI had interviewed Flynn about his contacts in late December with Russian officials.

Trump tweeted Friday that "General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA — as are three others." Kellogg, who is serving as the acting national security adviser, traveled to South Carolina with Trump aboard Air Force One.

Associated Press writers Darlene Superville and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report.Researchers in Japan suggest there's a surprising neurological reason why people avert their gaze occasionally during conversation. Reporting in the journal Cognition, they write that eye contact actually "disrupts resources available to cognitive control processes during verb generation." In other words, when you need to come up with certain words under certain circumstances, maintaining eye contact depletes the very brain resources you need to find the word.

So you look away. To test this, the researchers asked 26 participants to make eye contact with a computer-generated face while playing a word association game, reports Business Insider.

Looking at the face didn't seem to interfere with their ability to come up with verbs easily associated to nouns—like the word "scissors" prompting the person to think of "cut." But when nouns were more difficult—for example, if they had too many associations or were a little obscure—it took participants longer to think of a verb while maintaining that eye contact.

As a post at Science Alert sums up: "While making eye contact and holding a conversation is certainly possible, this is evidence that they can both draw on the same pool of cognitive resources, and sometimes that pool starts to run a little dry." The researchers didn't parse out possible cultural influences, but Scientific American suggests that if looking away while thinking is cross-cultural, "perhaps cultures with less emphasis on eye contact enable deeper thinking during a given conversation." (Eye contact is forbidden in a certain Minnesota locale.)

This article originally appeared on Newser: Scientists Have a Theory on Why You Break Eye ContactMore than 300,000 years ago, a massive chunk of rock broke off from Australia's continental shelf, triggering the largest undersea landslide ever known, per Science Alert.

But scientists only know this thanks to a chance discovery. Researchers were mapping the Queensland Trough, a basin next to the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's eastern coast, when they noticed eight "hills" hundreds of feet tall more than half a mile below the surface.

After that discovery, they realized that a portion of Australia's continental shelf about 20 miles away "looks like a massive bite has been taken out of [it]," study author Robin Beaman tells Australia's ABC.

He put two and two together and concluded the "knolls were the remains of a very large undersea landslide,” per the BBC. Because coral fossils from the knolls date back 300,000 years, researchers believe the knolls broke off from the section of shelf known as the Gloria Knolls Slide at least 300,000 years ago in what Beaman dubs a "catastrophic collapse." Researchers say the landslide would have produced 7.7 cubic miles of debris. To put that in perspective, almost everyone on Earth could fit into one cubic mile. The force likely caused a tsunami up to 90 feet high, but the nearby Great Barrier Reef would've acted "like a giant porous breakwater," Beaman says. Since researchers found "a lot more marine life there than we ever anticipated," Beaman notes the site will serve as a great place for further research, including on cold water corals.

This article originally appeared on Newser: First Came a 'Catastrophic Collapse,' Then a TsunamiHawaii once again tops the list of happiest states in the country, according to a new poll.

In 2016, residents of the Aloha State scored highest on Gallup-Healthways' annual survey of well-being , with a score of 65.2 out of 100. This marks the sixth time that Hawaii has come out on top in the poll since Gallup-Healthways began conducting it in 2008 — a feat that no other state has accomplished.

Runners-up in the poll include Alaska (which also came in second in 2015), followed by South Dakota, Maine and Colorado.

Finishing last in the poll, the states with the lowest well-being scores, were Kentucky and West Virginia, which have held the bottom two spots for eight years in a row, according to Gallup-Healthways. [See the List of the Happiest U.S. States]

The rankings are based on interviews with more than 177,000 U.S. adults in all 50 states, conducted from January to December 2016. The researchers calculated a well-being score for each state, based on participants' answers to questions about different aspects of well-being, including their sense of purpose, social relationships, financial lives, community involvement and physical health.

In general, states in the northern Plains and Mountain West tended to have higher well-being scores than states in the South and Midwest. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy]

And despite the popular claim that 2016 was the "worst year ever," Americans' overall well-being ticked slightly upward last year. The country's average well-being score was 62.1 in 2016, up from 61.7 in 2015 and 61.6 in 2015, Gallup-Healthways said.

Some of the factors behind this increase include a rise in the percentage of Americans with health insurance in 2016, and a drop in the percentage of smokers, Gallup-Healthways said.

However, some markers of well-being declined in 2016. For example, the percentage of Americans with obesity or diabetes increased, and the percentage diagnosed with depression reached its highest level since Gallup began conducting the poll.

Want to move up on the happy list? States can implement initiatives to improve specific aspects of their residents' well-being, Gallup-Healthways said. For example, leaders in each state can work with grocery stores and restaurants to make it easier for customers to select healthy food options, which is a goal of the Gallup-Healthways' Blue Zones Project being carried out in California, Oregon, Iowa, Texas, Florida and Hawaii, Gallup-Healthways said.

Leaders can also invest in building infrastructure that will make it easier for residents to be active, such as projects that make areas more walkable, or create more bicycle lanes, Gallup-Healthways said.

Original article on Live Science .Professional wrestler George "The Animal" Steele died at age 79, the WWE said in a statement.

Steele, whose real name is William James Myers was one of the WWE's most wild and outrageous stars.

Known for his green tongue and hairy chest, "The Animal" received a master's degree from Central Michigan University and was a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Michigan.

While he was teaching, he began to book gigs in the pro-wrestling world. His first WWE appearance was in 1967 when he began his rivalry against WWE champ Bruno Sammartino.

The WWE Hall of Famer continued to make wrestling appearances through the 2000s.

He is survived by his wife Pat, their two sons Dennis and Randy and daughter, Felicia.Reba McEntire had already reached superstar status in the country music world by the time she landed the leading role on "Reba." But it was the hit sitcom that brought the country star into millions of households across the nation.

10 years after the show went off the air on Feb. 18 2007, McEntire told us she's still in touch with all of her old co-stars.

While they keep in touch in their personal lives, don't expect the co-stars to come back together for a "Reba" reboot.

McEntire told us a remake would be "impossible" because all of the former "Reba" stars are too busy.

"It would be very hard to do a 'Reba' reboot because Steve Howey is on 'Shameless,' Melissa [Peterman] is really busy on 'Baby Daddy'...Chris Rich is doing a movie in Oklahoma right now," McEntire shared told Fox News. "Joana Garcia just had a second baby and is loving life."

She added, "I stay in touch with all of them."

In fact, she had just gotten together with "most of the crew" of "Reba" for a friend's birthday party.

"Out of all the things I get to do, whether its' music, TV, Broadway, whatever it is, making the friends and getting to stay in touch with them that's the icing on the cake."

McEntire got us thinking. Where are the stars of "Reba" today?The longtime producer of the Grammy Awards is offering apologies to Metallica and Shirley Caesar after a technical glitch and a misprint marred their inclusion on the show.

The mic for Metallica's James Hetfield wasn't initially working when the band took the stage to perform with Lady Gaga, and Caesar, a lifetime achievement award honoree, was misidentified during the televised ceremony when a photo of another gospel star, CeCe Winans, was shown instead of her during a montage clip.

"These kinds of things are horrible when they happen," Ken Ehrlich said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday. "That's one of the risks of live television."

The Metallica glitch, for which the band has blamed a dead microphone, resulted in Hetfield making a decision to improvise and use Lady Gaga's mic.

Ehrlich has heard a different story from his crew about the problem.

"My guys say that the mic cable was connected," he said. "My guys' theory was that ... one of the extras (on stage) accidentally kicked out the cable that went to the mic."

Still, the end result was Hetfield's singing couldn't be heard for the first part of the performance.

"Obviously, we apologize to the band," Ehrlich said, calling the mishap "awful."

He added that he's worked with Metallica for years, so to see that happen was personally upsetting to him: "You hurt."

In the case of Caesar, the gospel legend, Ehrlich had a better understanding of what happened. When preparing for a clip to run of her for the show, footage of a classic Caesar, Winans and Whitney Houston performance was used, and Winans was mistakenly shown.

Ehrlich said he usually checks such footage but didn't get a chance to this year, since he was busy with the show and the Recording Academy's tribute to the Bee Gees, which taped in Los Angeles on Tuesday and will air at a later date.

"We obviously want to apologize to Shirley Caesar," he said. "It's unfortunate that happened."

Caeser released a statement Wednesday thanking Ehrlich for the apology and added, "these things happen sometimes."

Ehrlich was also frustrated that the mistakes have overshadowed some of the great performances that occurred on the show, including Beyonce, Bruno Mars and Adele, who had her own hiccup when she restarted her tribute to George Michael.

"When you do a three-and-a-half hour live show, it's fraught with danger," he said. "It was an adventurous show in many ways."

Ehrlich has produced the Grammys for years and has also produced other events, including the Emmy Awards.©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

New Privacy - New Terms of Use (What's New) - FAQWomen aren't the only ones who may feel depressed when welcoming a newborn: a new study from New Zealand says some men also experience depression during and after their female partners' pregnancies.

In the study of almost 4,000 men, about 6 percent had elevated depression symptoms at some point during their partners' pregnancies or the nine months after the birth, researchers found.

"I think it's important for couples to be aware that either of them can be depressed and they should be seeking help and seeking support," said the study's lead author Lisa Underwood, who is affiliated with the University of Auckland.

Underwood and colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry that 9 percent of men report depression at some point during their lives. About 3 percent report a depressive episode in the past year.

Pregnancy and childbirth may put men at an increased risk of depression, they add, though research typically focuses on women, who are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy and after childbirth.

Still, past research also links depressed fathers to emotional and behavioral problems among children, the researchers write.

For the new study, the team analyzed data collected from the partners of women who took part in the Growing Up in New Zealand study and were due to deliver between April 2009 and March 2010.

The researchers conducted in-home interviews with 3,826 fathers during their female partners' pregnancies. Another round of interviews were conducted with 3,549 of the fathers about nine months after their children's birth.

Underwood and her colleagues found that 2.3 percent of fathers had elevated symptoms of depression while their female partners were pregnant. During the postnatal period, 4.3 percent of fathers had elevated depression symptoms after childbirth.

The men's depression symptoms during pregnancy were tied to their being stressed or in poor health. After childbirth, symptoms were more likely in men who felt stressed during the pregnancy, or were no longer in a relationship with the child's mother, men who rated their health as only fair or poor, those who were unemployed or had a history of depression.

The researchers can't say whether symptoms of depression cause poor health and other issues, or vice versa, Underwood told Reuters Health.

"It definitely points to the fact that we need to be giving couples more support," she said.

Depression should raise flags about those other health concerns, said James Paulson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.

People should also think of depression's influence on the entire family, said Paulson, who wasn't involved with the new study.

"There are a lot of treatments for this," he told Reuters Health. "We've been dealing with depression for a long time. While we don't have tailored treatments for paternal depression, we do have interventions for depression and those are effective."

Those interventions include medications and psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can teach people how to address issues in their life that cause or worsen depression.

"We know that either parent's mental wellbeing impacts on the other, the relationship and family," Underwood said.

Sometimes people may feel guilty seeking treatments when they just had a baby come into their lives, Paulson said.

"Consider seeking treatment for yourself as a way to treat the system that includes your child," he said.No major injuries were reported following a wild ride for Joey Saldana during a sprint car race in Florida on Wednesday.

Saldana was battling for second during the DirtCar Winternationals at Volusia Speedway Park in Florida when the incident occurred (1:55 in the following video).

Coming off of Turn 2, Saldana clips the back wheel of Jason Johnson, sending Saldana’s car into a wild ride. Saldana’s No. 17 machine rolls over four times before clearing the catchfence down the backstraight. Fortunately, Saldana’s car comes back to land in front of the grandstands and then tumbles into a light pole without making contact with any of the spectators.

The race was red flagged immediately, but was later restarted with Donny Schatz holding off NASCAR driver Kyle Larson for the win.

MORE AUTO NEWS FROM FOX SPORTSRepublican Sen. John McCain has delivered a withering critique of President Donald Trump in a speech that highlights fractures within the GOP as the new administration struggles to overcome a chaotic start.

McCain spoke Friday at the Munich Security Conference. The Armed Services Committee chairman never mentioned the president's name while lamenting a shift in the United States and Europe away from the "universal values" that McCain says forged the Western alliance.

Trump has questioned NATO's value and sought instead to stoke a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has accused Putin of attempting to break the military alliance.

In his speech, McCain said "more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent."A little over a year ago, Honda showed off its totally cool Project 2&4 concept. The super bare-bones two-seat sports car with a motorcycle engine is in many ways closer to a go-kart than a traditional car. That's not a complaint either, since it sounds like a blast. At the time, we assumed that it was just an outlandish concept without any grounding in reality, but a new patent from Honda has us second-guessing the last part.

The company filed a patent for an automobile using a cast-aluminum backbone chassis. The first drawing (figure 1) in the patent shows just the chassis with a pair of seats, suspension, and four wheels. Although the patent says the frame could support just three wheels, or more than four. The layout shows an engine just behind the seats with power going to the rear. It's a setup that sounds fun on its own, and sounds even more fun when seeing that figure 4 shows a minimal body shell like that of the Project 2&4.

There are more interesting tidbits here, too. The cast-aluminum chassis is described as very light, stiff, and quick to produce. Everything else on the car is connected to it as well. Additional members for the seats, steering wheel, pedals, and gauge cluster, among others, all attach to this center point. The patent lists several advantages to this arrangement, and it allows for different seating configurations for either left- or right-hand-drive markets, or for just a single occupant. The frame even features provisions for inflatable roll-over protection, shown by items 110a, 110b, and 110c in figure 2.

The chassis is cast with specific areas for mechanical components. The spine that runs between the seats is hollow so a fuel tank could be placed there. At the rear, the frame curves around an area for the engine, and it's shaped to allow cooling air to run over the powerplant. The patent says that it wouldn't have to be an internal combustion engine either; it could use an electric motor. We imagine the area for the fuel tank could easily be changed to accommodate a battery pack. The whole chassis is suspended by a double-wishbone suspension setup, though the patent again says that this arrangement isn't required.

Exactly what this chassis could lead to is tough to say. Certainly a mid-engine Honda sports car isn't impossible, especially since the company already builds a miniscule one by the name of S660 for the Japanese market. However, this doesn't appear to be related to the tiny roadster. Odds are we'll likely see technologies based on the patent show up in less obvious places. Perhaps more cast aluminum components will be found under the skin of future Hondas. But if this hypothetical sports car did show up as a production vehicle, we'd love to see it appear in the States as a three wheeler, a la the Polaris Slingshot. It could be classified as a motorcycle and sold through Honda's powersports dealers. Regardless, it will be interesting to see what, if anything, comes of this patent.

POLARIS SLINGSHOT TEST DRIVE:Many of us began the year with resolutions to take the obvious steps to improve our health: eat more fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.

However, a month or so into 2017, how many of us are still on track with keeping up with these changes? If you’ve drifted a little, don’t worry: February is National Heart Month and is a great time to renew your efforts to take care of your body this year.

If you are growing tired of all the standard advice and need to shake up your routine, read on for some surprising heart-healthy foods to help restart or reinvigorate your efforts.

Beans: With the exception of a childhood song, beans don’t get much attention for their relationship to heart health. A good source of fiber and potassium, beans are rich in protein and offer an inexpensive, plant-based alternative to meat. Plus, you don’t need to eat a lot of them to benefit. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition suggests having just 1⁄2 cup of cooked beans daily offers heart-healthy benefits. In addition, a literature review of ten studies where participants added beans to their diets found that this change was associated with a reduction in LDL (bad) cholesterol. Try adding rinsed canned beans to your salad, soups, and stews, or swap beans for meat a few nights a week by serving bean burritos, a bean chili, or a bean and rice dish.

Kimchi: Fermented foods are getting a lot of attention lately in the United States, but many of these foods are long-standing staples in other cultures. Kimchi is one such food--made from fermented vegetables, it is an essential side dish in Korean cuisine. A recent study of 100 participants found that people consuming larger amounts of kimchi lead to greater reductions in LDL (bad) cholesterol levels after only seven days. Check out a local Korean restaurant to give kimchi a try, or pick up a jar at your local Asian market.

100 percent Grape Juice: Most of us have heard about the heart-healthy benefits of wine, but what about its non-fermented friend grape juice? Nearly 20 years of research suggests that, thanks to the deep-purple Concord grape, 100 percent grape juice can support a healthy heart. Concord grapes and its juice provide a unique mix of polyphenols, specifically flavonoids, which are associated with heart-health benefits like improved blood flow (or improved circulation). Just four ounces, or 1/2 cup, counts as one serving of fruit and should be a complement to, not a replacement for, a diet rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables to get a diverse intake of polyphenols throughout the day.

Eggs: Eggs have been the cornerstone of a healthy meal for generations, and for good reason. Eggs are an-all natural source of high-quality protein with one large egg containing six grams protein (12 percent daily value), 13 vitamins and minerals, all for seventy calories. However, for many it’s hard to tune out the decades of hearing that eggs, which contain dietary cholesterol, are not great for your heart. But recent research has changed that advice.

For example, one study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition suggests that eating one egg a day reduces risk for stroke by 12 percent. In addition, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans make no recommendations to limit the cholesterol we eat. Top your salad with a hardboiled egg or include a side of fresh fruit with your veggie omelet for a heart-healthy, nutrition powerhouse meal.

Papaya: The effects of lycopene (a healthy plant-based compound) on heart disease are well studied, and tomatoes tend to get all the attention as a good source of lycopene in the diet. While tomatoes do contain this powerful antioxidant that is responsible for its red shade, so do many other fruits and vegetables that come in crimson colors. One study that looked at the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes, carrots, and papaya found that the lycopene from papaya was 2.6 times more bioavailable than that from tomatoes. While more research is needed to investigate how upping your intake of papaya might benefit your heart, give this tropical fruit a chance by adding it to your snack rotation, smoothies, salads, and parfaits.

Dark Chocolate: As if you needed a reason to include chocolate in your diet, here’s some delicious news. A 2015 study that looked at participants with Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure compared the addition of dark chocolate (from 83 percent cocoa chocolate bars) to white chocolate bars in their diets showed that people who ate dark chocolate saw a reduction in their blood pressure compared to the people who ate white chocolate.

The authors attribute this difference to the high polyphenol content of the dark chocolate. Since chocolate is high in calories and added sugar, most experts agree that the recommended "dose" of dark chocolate is approximately one to two ounces a day.

Now, for as little as $10, a potential way to prevent new infections.

A new supplement called Uqora is a powder you mix with water when the risk of a UTI seems high—after strenuous exercise or sex, for example, reports Mashable.

Its main ingredient is called d-mannose, which is a sugar that binds with E. coli bacteria that cause the vast majority of UTIs (it will not work on the smaller number of cases caused by other bacteria), sweeping them from your bladder when you pee.

It also includes vitamins and a diuretic to help speed up that urination. The company was founded by Jenna Ryan, who suffered eight infections in 2014 and became so frustrated by her lack of options outside of antibiotics that she partnered with a molecular biologist (her own partner, as it happened) to sort out a solution that could help fend off an infection.

(Elite Daily reports that out of all infections treated in ERs in the US, only pneumonia is treated more frequently.) While it's backed by a board of three doctors, Uqora is a supplement and thus doesn't have to meet the strict standards of the FDA.

Still, its ingredients are "generally recognized as safe"; a 10-pack only costs $35, with a three-pack available for $10. (Cranberry juice doesn't stop a UTI, scientists say.)

He started hanging out with the members of the Vice Lords gang for safety. “Just for protection…my friends-we gotta get to school. So, we got each other’s back on the way to school,” he says. “And sometimes, that meant carrying a gun and [being] willing to use it.”

His first gun was a gift, given to him as a pre-teen. “I looked at it like that was love. I looked at it like this person loved me, for the simple fact that they wanted to see me protected. They gave me something that was going to protect my life,” he says.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

Last Monday, I met with a group of street guys on the West Side. They say the gangs provided structure that their parents did not. “Half of these guys don’t got no mom, either they was crack heads, dope fiends, boosters or something,” says a man who would only identify himself as a member of the Black Disciples. “They moms or fathers was lost to the same gang that we getting ourselves into now.”

“We more like a family than a gang… brothers,” says Kevin Gentry – associated with the Vice Lords. In the gang, someone was kind to them. Their role models sold drugs, had money, clothes cars and girlfriends. “The gangs have become family for a lot of young men here in Chicago and across the United States. They gravitate toward the guys with charisma. They gravitate toward the guys that might protect them. But they really are not protected out there. Too many people are being killed, it’s a false sense of security,” says Tio Hardiman from Violence Interrupters, a group that attempts to predict and prevent gangland shootings.

As of the 15th of February, Chicago racked up 326 shootings and 72 murders. That puts the city on the same pace as 2016, which saw the highest murder rate in decades.

VIDEO SHOWS CHICAGO GIRL'S ACCUSED KILLER BEATEN IN COURTHOUSE LOCKUP

On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was on a playground in the violent West Englewood neighborhood when she was struck by a stray bullet. About 4 miles away, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes was hit by a stray bullet while seated in the back of a car. Both of their young lives ended.

On Valentine’s Day, a pregnant woman – who is unidentified – began streaming video with her phone on Facebook Live. Her boyfriend, Lazarek Collins, was in the passenger seat and his 2-year-old nephew Lavontay White was in the back.

Collins was a documented gang member. It is believed the bullets were meant for him. However, when Collins was killed, so was little Lavontay. The pregnant woman was shot in the stomach, but survived. Even for Chicago, a city partially numb to the violence, the senseless slaying of a 2-year-old caught on video was horrific.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson again called for tougher gun laws. “Enough is enough,” he said.

Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner proposed sending state troopers to Chicago. Without being specific, President Donald Trump suggested sending in the feds.

Tracy Cannon – once associated with the Vice Lords – says it won’t matter. “I don’t care how many police they bring in. It’s not going to stop, man.”

Guys on the street say law enforcement made a bad situation worse. “They locked up these gang chiefs and everything went haywire,” says Charles Winters. Large organizations like the Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords subdivided over unresolved disputes. Absent leadership, cliques within the same gang will often do battle. “Ain’t like it used to be,” says Cannon. “Back then we had structure. Older guys would make us go to school. Even though we was gang banging, we would still go to school.”

Now, it’s a bullet-ridden free for all, with gangsters trying to gain respect by proving themselves to be ruthless. “Kids only care about nice clothes, fast money and how many kills they can get,” says Britt. “When they get a certain amount of kills or when they hurt a certain amount of people, they feared. They got the fear factor going on. The kids nowadays in Chicago, that’s what they want.”

The guy from the Black Disciples says the gang is all he’s even been able to rely on and he’ll never leave gangster life. “If I live by this gun and I live by these drugs, this product that I’m selling, and I’m pushing in this neighborhood. It’s putting food on my table and food in my kids’ mouths and a roof over they heads, then I’m not going to put it down,” he says.

Others say the violent gang life is for kids. If they live into their 20s and stay out of prison some walk away and get jobs. “You just get played out man,” says Cannon. “If you ain’t rich by now, you ain’t gonna get rich selling drugs.”

Michael Tobin joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Chicago-based correspondent.An expectant couple’s post on the anticipated summer arrival of their twins has been celebrated by thousands on social media for their openness about infertility and the struggles they faced while trying to get pregnant. In their post, Lauren and Garyt Walker placed two onesie’s inside a circle of 452 needles that they used during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.

“We thought about how to announce our two miracles to the world,” Lauren wrote in the Feb. 9 post. “Everything we could think of fell short of doing them justice. Doing ourselves justice, for every trial and tribulation we have been through these past years. Taking out these needles by the handful to take this photograph was… surreal.”

THIS WEEK IN PICTURES

Lauren shared that the couple had been trying to conceive for 953 days, had undergone a corrective surgery, two rounds of IVF and three failed embryo transfers.

“I sat down, looked at it and started to cry,” Lauren wrote. “Not because I was sad about what it took to get here, but because it was a representation of my world, our world, for the past two and a half years staring back at me. There was a lot of pain, hope, and fear behind each of these needles.”

Lauren shared that they are expecting a boy and a girl in August, and plan to name them Duke and Diana.

“The hardest part of the journey wasn’t having to do IVF,” she wrote. “Getting to that fork in the road is heartbreaking and difficult for anyone, but it was not my darkest hour. My darkest hour was going through an entire cycle and losing embryo after embryo; 5. Coming so far only to miscarry. Getting to where all the hope, the money, all of what could have been your children were gone. The End.”

Lauren said she shared their story in the hopes of helping other couples that are struggling. Her post has gotten more than 1,000 likes and 225 shares, with other commenters sharing their IVF stories.

“For anyone struggling, may our story give you comfort and hope,” she wrote. “They say ‘When you ask God for something He either says ‘yes’ and gives it to you. Or he says ‘OK’ and makes you wait. Or he says ‘no,’ makes you wait longer, and gives you something better.’ Had he answered or [sic] prayers way back then, in 2015, we wouldn’t have these two angels on their way today.”A critically endangered species of antelope is dying by the thousands from a deadly infectious disease outbreak in Mongolia, and scientists fear there could be "catastrophic consequences" for the threatened animals and their ecosystem.

Since December 2016, about 2,500 Mongolian saiga (Saiga tatarica mongolica) — a unique subspecies of saiga antelope — have died from a livestock virus. Scientists estimate the Mongolian saiga population to be about 10,000, meaning the deadly outbreak has killed about 25 percent of the endangered steppe-dwelling antelope. The virus, known as PPR or "peste des petits ruminants," was introduced to the Mongolian saiga population in September, from infected goats and sheep, scientists said.

Though the die-off rate has slowed, it could have repercussions throughout the local environment, said Amanda Fine, a veterinarian and associate director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) Wildlife Health Program in Asia. [ Photos: A 2015 Mass Die-Off of the Endangered Saiga Antelope ]

"The situation is tragic and widespread," Fine said in a statement. "Along with the impact to the saiga population, this event has the potential to produce cascading catastrophic consequences on the ecosystem. For example, ibex and argali may be affected, and rare snow leopards may suffer the effects of a diminished prey base."

PPR, which is also known as sheep and goat plague, is highly contagious and can infect up to 90 percent of an animal herd once introduced, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The disease is spread via body fluids, feces and close proximity, and symptoms include fever, anorexia, diffuclty breathing and more. After just a few days affected animals become depressed, very weak, and severely dehydrated, according to the FAO. The FAO and the World Organization for Animal Health are working to eradicate PPR by 2030, but the disease is known to have infected animal populations in more than 70 countries.

In Mongolia, a rapid-response team has begun collecting samples from the dead and diseased saiga in an effort to stop the spread of infection and determine how to support the species' recovery.

"The best way to prevent PPR is through further immunization of livestock in not only saiga range areas, but [also] other affected-species range areas," Fine said. "Stress-free conditions for recovering saiga and access to food and water resources should be provided in order to save the last population of Mongolian saiga from extinction."

The saiga face other threats aside from illness. People use the antelope's horns in traditional medicine, making the animals vulnerable to poaching. More than 90 percent of the saiga population has been lost in recent decades, according to WCS officials.

Original article on Live Science .A military wife captured mourning her fallen Green Beret husband in a video that has gone viral is being hailed as a “patriot” by those who witnessed the heartbreaking event.

Lisa Williams, whose flight arrived at the Raleigh-Durham Airport in North Carolina Tuesday, said passengers were asked to stay in their seats so they could let someone off the aircraft first, WPVI reported.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

Soldiers unloaded a flag-draped coffin from the plane’s cargo area and then T.J. Thomas, the wife of Officer Shawn Thomas, stepped off the plane to grieve the loss of her husband.

“It was an honor to fly home with this PATRIOT! God bless his wife and family. There was not a dry eye around me,” Lisa Williams wrote on a Facebook post. She said the plane remained silent as passengers started to cry.

AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY, AMERICA'S HEROES ARE NEVER BURIED ALONE

Seven Green Beret soldiers later loaded the coffin into a black hearse and paid their respects, while the pilot thanked passengers for waiting.

Thomas – a 35-year-old who had been deployed in Niger to help train local troops and residents in the fight against terrorism – died in a non-vehicle combat crash on Feb. 2, according to the Army Times.

He had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan seven times and earned two Bronze stars, four Good Conduct Medals and was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal for his work in central Africa, the Army Times reported. He was stationed at Fort Bragg.

Thomas was buried last week at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and is survived by his wife and four children, Fox 5 reported.

The video has more than 5 million views and Williams said Thomas reached out to her to thank her for capturing the moment.

9:50 a.m.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is offering assurances that the United States strongly supports NATO and "will be unwavering in our commitment to this trans-Atlantic alliance."

He says President Donald Trump "will stand with Europe."

Pence is addressing the Munich Security Conference in his first overseas trip as vice president.

The vice president's speech was aimed at reassuring skeptical allies in Europe about American foreign policy under Trump along with U.S. willingness to maintain international partnerships.

Pence's trip to Germany comes as Europeans are skittish that Trump may promote isolationist tendencies and not hold Russia accountable.A stunning video posted by the Eco Abrolhos tour company in western Australia shows a gruesome sight: a plethora of tiger sharks feeding on, and swimming around, a whale carcass.

The video shows the clear turquoise waters filled with sharks, blood from the dead whale, and two tour boats with passengers. Striking aerial footage shows the surrounding water teeming with tiger sharks.

Tour company Eco Abrolhos explained that the footage was shot near Dirk Hartog Island during the course of a 14-day cruise; that island is part of the Shark Bay World Heritage Site, which is home to seagrass beds, sea cows, and other marine life— including, of course, sharks.

According to the IUCN, tiger sharks can grow to be over 18 feet long and have a conservation status of "near threatened."

The video has racked up over a half a million views so far.A 74-year-old Texas man lost the home he once shared with his wife and son to a fire on Valentine's Day. But he could've lost his life if it weren't for his pet cat that alerted him.

Reed McIntosh says he was asleep when his home caught fire in Grand Prairie Tuesday morning. It was one of his five cats named Angel who woke him up and gave him the chance to get out of his home safely. Sadly, Angel and the rest of his pets didn’t make it.

FAMILY DISCOVERS WRONG HEADSTONE AT GRAVE OF 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL

McIntosh made a lot of memories in his home. It was where he and his wife, Elaine, raised their son. It's also where the 74-year-old mourned her passing from cancer in 2007. For the past decade, McIntosh says his sole source of comfort has been his five cats.

Early Tuesday morning, McIntosh was asleep in his bedroom when Angel, his 7-month-old cat, started pawing his face.

PLANE HITS DEER WHILE TAKING OFF FROM CHARLOTTE-DOUGLAS AIRPORT

“He did it again,” he recalled. “And I sort of sat up, like ‘what?!’”

That's when McIntosh heard some beeping that at first he thought was coming from his computer. But it was a smoke alarm going off near the garage. McIntosh says he got out and called 911.

Grand Prairie firefighters showed up and began fighting the flames and searching for the cats that were still inside.

“One of the gentlemen came out and said ‘We found them. They were all in your bedroom,’” he recalled. “I was like, ‘great!’ He said, ‘No, they're all gone. Sorry.’”

McIntosh says a woman with animal control brought the cats out who had died from smoke inhalation in a clothes basket so he could say goodbye.

“Which I thought was very thoughtful and brought them up on the porch, and I held them,” he said. “I loved them.”

McIntosh says he removed their collars for safe keeping. Removing Angel's collar was the toughest.

“If it hadn't been for Angel, I would've been dead,” he said. “I think that was destined to be his name. I think he was destined to be here to save me on a Valentine's Day. I'll never forget.”

The cause of the fire remains under investigation but does not appear to be suspicious.

McIntosh did have insurance but says no amount of money can ever replace his beloved cats.

He also ran an online business selling stuff on eBay. He says all of those items were lost in the fire, too. He set up a GoFundMe account to get help getting back on his feet.

Click here for more from Fox 4 News.Facebook didn’t start out as a political pulpit, and there’s no reason it has to be one. If you turn to Facebook to relax and share recipes, photos and life updates with your closest friends, that is absolutely your right. But at the same time, you don’t necessarily want to unfriend people you care about because they happen to be blowhards.

Here are some handy tools for damming the deluge of politics on Facebook. They’re not perfect, but they’ll drastically reduce the spite and vitriol you encounter on social media. I think you’ll be surprised how well they work.

Unfollow the blabbermouths

If only real life were this easy: You can “unfollow” a friend, which means all her posts will vanish from your screen. It’s like having the ability to tell her, “I’m not listening to you anymore,” and everything she says is muted.

Simply find a post from your friend, click the arrow in the top right corner of the post, and hit “Unfollow Theresa,” or whatever your friend’s name is.

Just as when you “unfriend” someone, she will not receive an alert that you’re no longer following her. You have to do this for every one of your loudmouth friends, but for all they know, you’re loving and sharing every single manifesto they post. This is probably the politest way to leave a conversation on social media.

Add a browser extension

There are better ways to protect yourself from political posts. If you use the Chrome browser, there is a special plug-in that will scrub your screen of almost all political posts or comments.

The key word is “almost.” The plug-in cleverly tracks the posts and links your friends share, but it can’t necessarily figure out when a meme has a political subtext. Also, the plug-in works only with Chrome. If you use Safari or Firefox, it is useless.

But if you rely heavily on Chrome, allowing or disallowing politics on your wall is as simple as a thumb-slide to the left or right. Click here to start cleaning up your feed using this browser extension.

One-stop solution

What if you could walk into a cocktail party and tell the guests, “Talk about whatever you want, but no mudslinging, no profanity-laced heated political debates!” This next solution is the ticket for your social media life.

Social Fixer is a plug-in designed to work with several browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. (Note: The developers have a solution for Microsoft Edge, but try it only if you are technically proficient.)

Once you install the plug-in, a preset filter keeps politics out of your Facebook feed. You can keep your friends without seeing their political opinions.

Social Fixer wasn’t designed just for politics, but for any keyword you find tiring or distasteful. Weary of cat videos? You can remove them with the click of a button. You can even get rid of sponsored content, which is a luxury unto itself.

The plug-in’s “stealth mode” is also interesting. Using it, you can check out people’s profiles without worrying about clicking the wrong button. Just about anything you can do that lets people know you were checking out their profiles is disabled.

Click here to start cleaning up your Facebook feed in an instant.

Curate your ads

Facebook makes a huge amount of its money from ads and sponsored posts, which is why we’re subjected to them every time we log on. You can’t remove the ads altogether, because they are the platform’s lifeblood, but you can discourage Facebook from posting those you don’t like.

Again, this is very simple: Just find that little arrow in the upper right corner of the ad and click, “Hide Ad.” Something else will replace it, and Facebook will learn to avoid similar ads in the future.

One more step to secure your account

Speaking of Facebook … At least once a day, I get a notification from Facebook that someone has just tried to hack my account.

If my account is any indication, the hackers and scammers trying to access Facebook accounts are upping their game. If they succeed, your account could be used to spoof your friends into sending them money, or worse. Don’t take chances. The fix is simple and takes just a moment to implement.

Drew J. Wade, a spokesman for the service, told the magazine that he is not aware of these agents guarding an education secretary in the past. The education secretary is traditionally guarded by a small security unit from the education department, the report said.

The report said that few other details are available about the security arrangement.

Despite her win, DeVos emerged bruised from her highly divisive nomination fight. Opposed by half the Senate, she faced criticism, even ridicule for lack of experience. At one point, she said some schools should have guns because of the threat of grizzly bears.

And there has been scathing opposition from teachers unions and civil rights activists over her support of charter schools and her conservative religious ideology.

President Trump accused Democrats of seeking to torpedo education progress. In a tweet before the vote, he wrote, "Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!" Pence tweeted later in the day that supporting DeVos was "a vote for every child having a chance at a world-class education."

In a separate development, DeVos announced Friday that a government website devoted to students with disabilities, which had been down for more than a week, has been restored and will be updated with input from interested parties. She also accused the previous administration of neglecting the website. The American Federation of Teachers disputed that contention.

The Associated Press contributed to this reportWhen I wrote my new book "And the Good News Is…" I fended off attempts by others to cut out parts about my dog Jasper (I have been known to go on and on about him, I know). I’m glad I won those battles because clearly he is more popular than me.

Out on the book tour for the last month, I’ve loved getting to meet some of the viewers of "The Five," fans of President George W. Bush, and even long lost family members (some of whom I’ve never met but who had followed me since I first stepped up to the podium in the White House Briefing Room).

But the one constant, the one thing they all asked about (no, not you, Greg Gutfeld), was Jasper.

“Where’s Jasper?”

“I thought I’d meet Jasper.”

“Don’t let them give you a hard time about Jasper.”

“When will Jasper be back on the show?"

“We love Jasper!”

There was even a family that had made “Jasper for President” T-shirts (and wore them!). Jasper’s was a bit big, but he can use it as a night shirt.

Thankfully, in anticipation of interest in America’s Dog I came up with a stamp that has his signature and paw print - people giggle and say “Oh, I got Jasper!” I prayed the ink didn’t run out on days such as in The Villages, Florida where the line stretched out the door and around the block.

Fans of Jasper brought him toys and treats, so many that I had to make an appeal on The Five and Facebook for folks to resist bringing him treats or to donate them in his name to a local shelter. As I explained, I didn’t want him to end up getting a new nickname, “Fatsper.”

I also got pictures of family pets that love Jasper, some framed. Someone made me a handmade quilt for Jasper, and another gave me a gem for myself made of, what else? Red Jasper. There were bracelets, greeting cards, and some even brought their own dogs to meet me (my favorite were the PTS service dogs -- they make great companions for their owners).

In Chapter 6 of my book I write about how family pets can be a great equalizer -- disagreeing with someone’s politics isn’t a reason to automatically dislike them. We can always find something to talk about, and one of the best topics is dogs.

And it turns out, they can help bring people together over a book, too. And that’s very good news indeed.

Sponsors of a House bill passed this week to protect landowners from what they say is a federal land grab expect the Senate to pass the bill and send it to President Trump.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, seeks to prevent the federal government from claiming hundreds of thousands of acres of land -- much of it privately owned -- along the Red River in Texas and Oklahoma. It was crafted in response to complaints from property owners that the government was trying to seize land along a 116-mile stretch of the river.

The Red River has eroded and shifted – up to two miles in some places – over the last 100 years, and dry land where the river once flowed belongs to the government, according to the Bureau of Land Management.

But Thornberry and others disagree, citing a 1923 Supreme Court ruling that sets the Texas-Oklahoma state boundary as following the meandering of the river.

"This bill very simply requires that there be a survery to determine what the federal government owns and what it does not own," Thornberry told Fox News on Friday.

"It does not dispose of any land and it does not change anybody's

rights," Thornberry said.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that the northern half of the river bottom was Oklahoma's and the southern half belonged to the government.



In 2007, officials from the Bureau of Land Management began surveying the river bottom to define Indian lands. Following their interpretation of the gradient boundary survey method, the BLM extended what it believes to be part of the riverbed, setting the boundary line more than a mile onto dry land into Texas.

A group of landowners -- including Ken Aderholt, whose home lies within disputed territory -- filed suit in 2015 against the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Interior. Aderholt and others say they’ve rightfully owned and diligently paid taxes on the land for decades.

"The United States' ownership of property is limited to bottom-half of the sandy riverbed outside of Texas," the lawsuit states. "Nonetheless, BLM asserts that its boundary extends well past the riverbed into Texas and, in some instances, more than a mile outside of its lawful territory. In doing so, BLM has seized private property, infringed upon the sovereignty of the local county governments, and interfered with law enforcement’s ability to discharge its duties arising under Texas law.

Thornberry said the tug-of-war has land owners in a "panic" because "they don’t know when or where the federal government may come in and take the land that they’re entitled to and have paid taxes on, some for generations."

The House bill, which was approved 250-171, would commission a survey of the disputed area under a method backed by the Supreme Court.

Thornberry said he's confident the bill will pass in the Senate, despite opposition from Democrats who say the bill could unfairly impact Native American tribes who have mineral rights in the area.

An official from the Bureau of Land Management could not be reached Friday for comment. BLM officials previously said they have no intent to force current landowners from their properties. Instead, they said says landowners can purchase land belonging to the U.S. if it coincides with their deed.

Robert Henneke, a lawyer with the Texas Public Policy Foundation who represents the landowners, said he believes the bill has the momentum it needs to pass in the Senate.

"Throughout this dispute, the Bureau of Land Management has blatantly disregarded both the Texas landowners' private property rights and the plain meaning of the Supreme Court Opinion that defines the boundary," Henneke told Fox News on Friday.

Thornberry and others lawmakers, he said, "will stop the attempted land grab by giving Texas and Oklahoma responsibility to determine the boundary correctly."

The remarkable find is thought to have come from a large plant-eater such as the Iguanodon, which walked the earth about 133 million years ago.

It is believed the creature must have died near water with its head buried in sediment in a swamp or boggy ground, allowing its brain to be "pickled" and preserved.

Dr Alex Liu, from Cambridge University's Department of Earth Sciences, said: "The chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small, so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing."

Analysis of the fossil has revealed similarities with the brains of birds and crocodiles - both close relatives of dinosaurs - living today.

Trump himself has been plagued by leaks about his meeting schedule and phone calls to heads of state. But the most damaging leaks to his month-old administration have been those that cost retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn his post as national security adviser. Flynn had to resign after information came out about his December phone call to a Russian ambassador.

Trump pulled the plug on Flynn for misleading Vice President Pence about the substance of the call, but said the discussion itself was not improper. It was the current or former government officials who he suspects turned classified information over to the press that broke the law, the president said.

" ... the leak environment has just kicked into hyper drive.” - Thomas Dupree, former deputy assistant attorney general

“The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy,” Trump tweeted this week. “Very un-American!”

In recent years, even leakers who claimed to be whistle blowers and cloaked their motives in patriotism have found the law takes a dim view of their activities. Trump on Thursday said the Justice Department will look into the issue, and it is a good bet that Flynn’s replacement, who has not yet been named, will also be charged with rooting out loose-lipped bureaucrats.

“Leaks are prevalent in Washington, [but] I think what makes this different is the leak environment has just kicked into hyper drive,” Thomas Dupree, former deputy assistant attorney general, told Fox News. “In the first few weeks of this administration, we have seen a multitude of leaks on a variety of subjects – from national security to immigration, to the conversation that Flynn had with the Russians – it’s just every direction.”

While some may see leaks as part of the Capitol Hill game, and “whistleblowers” to be admired, what’s happening now seems to have moved beyond giving background information to reporters and into the realm of criminality.

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., have written to the Department of Justice Inspector General requesting an official probe into how classified information has been handled.

“The release of classified information can, by definition, have grave effects on national security,” Chaffetz wrote in the letter.

Any leakers who are exposed could face serious time in prison.

“They [the penalties] can be pretty serious,” said Dupree “There are a number of provisions in the federal, criminal statutes – Title 18 and elsewhere – that provide everything from fines, to even jail time, for people who leak classified, highly sensitive, national security information.”

Some recent examples:

Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced to in 2013 to 35 years in prison for providing more than 700,000 government files to WikiLeaks. Manning’s sentence was later commuted by President Obama.

Jeffrey A. Sterling, who was sentenced to 3 and ½ years in prison for disclosing national defense information and obstructing justice after disclosing classified information to a New York Times reporter.

Shamai K. Leibowitz, a linguist for the FBI, who was sentenced to 20 months in prison for leaking secret documents to a blogger.

Although suspicion has swirled around a handful of former Obama administration insiders, no one has been identified as a leaker of information damaging to Trump. And none of the leaks themselves have been proven illegal. But Trump, who vowed during his campaign to “drain the swamp,” is finding the first order of business is plugging leaks.This is a RUSH transcript from "The O'Reilly Factor," December 20, 2016.

O'REILLY: "Personal Story Segment" tonight, transitioning from President Obama to President-Elect Trump. In an interview that aired yesterday, Michelle Obama said this about her husband taking office in 2008.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY OF UNITED STATES: There were people in Congress, there were leaders in Congress who did not support his presidency, which was not something that was good for the country. It was good for politics. But it wasn't good for the country. And that wasn't the right way to approach it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

O'REILLY: And joining us now from Austin, Texas, Karl Rove. So I thought it was a fairly smooth transition back in '08. Did I miss something, Mr. Rove?

KARL ROVE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, you left out the worst part of her quote. In the sentence before that she said, "You know, nobody helped us when we came in." And basically goes on then to say people were opposed to us. I'd like to quote to her the words of President Barack Obama upon being sworn in. "Throughout the current transition, President Bush and his administration have extended the hand of cooperation and provided invaluable assistance." The day after Donald Trump was elected, President Obama went out and said, "President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so we could hit the ground running. I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set years ago." So, you know, yeah.

O'REILLY: Yeah, I remember all that and so that was surprised that Mrs. Obama and then when I looked at the polls, 70 percent of Americans supported Barack Obama when he took the oath of office and were rooting for him to do well. I didn't see any overt partisanship on a Republican side. I didn't see any bitterness about John McCain or calling for the Electoral College to be abolished or blaming the Taiwanese on subverting the election. I didn't see any of that.

ROVE: Yeah.

O'REILLY: So I don't know what she is basing it on.

ROVE: Well, and neither do I because remember, she came in, her husband came in with 60 Democrats in the senate to 40 Republicans, 255 democrats in the House to 178. The problem with that, he had too many. So he didn't think he needed to talk to the Republicans. You may remember in February of 2009, the Republican House Members come down to offer their suggestions to him about the Stimulus Bill. And this is the famous meeting in the cabinet room where Eric Cantor begins to lay out the Republican ideas and Obama cuts him off by saying, "I won."

I happen to have dinner later that year with one of his the top White House advisors, small dinner, four of us and he said, "You know, I've always been surprised we didn't get more support from the Republicans on the Stimulus Bill." I said, "Well, let me ask you something. Did you ever go up there and solicit their ideas and listen to them about what they would recommend?" Oh, no, no, no, we didn't do that. I said, "Did, you ever read about what they put out in the newspapers and publicly about what they would recommend? Did you ever think about swapping some of those -- your elements out for what they were suggesting?" Oh, no, no. We had the exact right plan. I said, "Were you in a room when Obama says to Eric Cantor, "I won," and cuts him off?" He said yeah. I said, "Did you se anything wrong with it?" He said, "No, no, we won." I said, "Well, then why should you be upset about not getting more support if you say to people, people you're furniture, you have no right to be involved."

And it wasn't just the House and it wasn't just once it was constantly. You may remember that in 2009, the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee began to hold sessions to discuss the -- what they could contribute to health care reform and the Affordable Care Act and the White House let it be known that they -- neither they nor the Senate Democratic Leadership would be bound by any agreement reached by the committee members of the committee through which the bill had to go.

So, look, you know, right from the beginning, President Obama said, "You know what, I know there's a loyal opposition but I'm going to treat it like it's furniture." Think about what would have happened if George Bush had done that in 2001. We wouldn't have gotten the tax cut pass through the Democratic Senate where the quarter of the Democrats voting for the Bush tax cut because we sat down and negotiated with them and came to an agreement.

O'REILLY: All right. So Mrs. Obama to put it politely is practicing revisionistic history although as you pointed out there was some opposition but it was policy-based opposition. It wasn't because the president was a black man or that he was a liberal democrat. It was basically the Republicans wanted to be heard ...

ROVE: Yeah.

O'REILLY: And you say they weren't heard and that's pretty much the consensus.

ROVE: And not only that but, look, the Bush administration bent over backwards starting in June of 2008 to work with both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates to make them ready. We asked for -- we got the FBI to agree to accept people from both presidential campaigns who could be cleared, given their security clearances at the time of the election. We set up a software system to help them manage the hundreds of thousands of resumes that they would get. As soon as Obama was elected and began to name his people, their office, a number in the Bush administration called particularly important in the national security and homeland security area.

In fact, in January, early January of 2009, White House Chief Of Staff Josh Bolton from Bush administration suggested to his Democratic counterparts that they have an exercise, a table top exercise it was called, about the potential of a terrorist attack on the day of the inauguration. And so they got them together. They went through this exercise to help them understand what the available mechanisms and responses would be. And as luck would have it, or as luck would not have it, there was a serious credible threat about an attack on the mall on inauguration day and literally there is the chief of staff under George W. Bush and the incoming chief of staff while Bush is still president are in the situation room on a video conference coordinating this together. It's a responsibility of the Bush chief of staff that he's drawn his opposite number in.

O'REILLY: All right. Well, I'm glad that you corrected the record there because when I heard that when, I heard Mrs. Obama say that, didn't -- it didn't just add up for me.

ROVE: Yeah. Either a slander or she's calling her husband a liar. I don't know which one it was.

O'REILLY: No, no, no. I just think she is misguided. I wouldn't assign any other motive here.

The stream of lava is currently pouring into the ocean from a sea cliff near Kamokuna on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). When this massive lava chute hits the cool seawater below, the result is explosive steam.

Striking images show what looks like a giant bucket of red paint pouring into the ocean, surrounded by plumes of steam, ash, debris and gas. The ensuing steam explosions, which occurred Jan. 28 and Jan. 29, have tossed molten lava high up into the air, with some bits of molten rock catapulted to twice the height of the sea cliff. [See Amazing Video of Lava Fire Hose]

On Jan. 30, a crack opened in the sea cliff above the lava tube which feeds the new lava stream. Volcanologists flying over the site used a special thermal-imaging camera to reveal the crack, which is now a scorching 428 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the USGS. On Jan. 28, volcanologists gingerly stepped onto the unstable surface to measure the crack, and found that it is 11.8 inches wide and cuts deeply into the new solidified lava laid down on the older sea cliff. This hot crack could be a sign that the entire sea cliff could come tumbling down, according to the USGS.

Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park is home to Kilauea , one of the world's most active volcanoes . The massive volcano has been erupting for 30 years, and the system has more than 200 structures, including the Pu'u O'O crater, a steaming caldera filled with a lava lake known as Halema'uma'u. The firehose of lava is part of Kilauea's long eruption.

The continuous eruption is also growing the Big Island, with a constant stream of lava from Pu'u O'O crater laying down new rock on the island as well as streaming into the ocean.

Originally published on Live Science .Alaska’s Denali National Park just threw researchers a major, ancient bone.

In July, while a team was working alongside the National Park Service, it discovered four “significant” fragments, including an ossified tendon. These fragments were “clearly parts of bigger bones from a large animal,” wrote the team in a press release.

Pat Druckenmiller, curator of Earth sciences at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, said the tendon fragments probably belonged to a hadrosaur. These duck-billed larger ornithopod dinosaurs were herbivorous and are thought to have been the most abundant large animals in Alaska.

“Another larger fragment is composed of spongy bone originating from the end of a large animal’s limb. This microstructure shows the bone didn’t come from a crocodile or other slow-growing, cold-blooded animal. It is clearly from a medium-sized to large dinosaur,” wrote the team.

This discovery comes more than a decade after the first dinosaur evidence first surfaced. In 2005, animal tracks were found in the Cantwell Formation near Igloo Creek. Although thousands of tracks have been found in the park since then, the fragments represent the first identifiable bones from animals dating to the Cretaceous period.

Druckenmiller and Denali National Park will collaborate over the next several years and explore additional areas of the preserve, looking to make new discoveries, according to the team.

“This marks the beginning of a multi-year project to locate, document and study dinosaur fossils in Denali National Park,” Druckenmiller said. “This is a world-class site for tracks of dinosaurs and other animals that lived in Alaska during the Cretaceous Period. Now that we have found bones, we have another way to understand the dinosaurs that lived here 70 million years ago.”Archaeologists cleaning the forecourt of a high official’s tomb in Egypt poked through a hole and discovered another tomb behind it — one that was built for a man more than three millennia ago.

The team, led by Egyptology professor Jiro Kondo of Waseda University in Tokyo, was cleaning up the tomb of Userhat, a high official under Amenhotep III, the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, when they discovered the hole. Beyond it lay the transverse hall of a previously unknown tomb built for a royal scribe named Khonsu.

A frieze pattern near the ceiling is typical of the Ramesside period, around 1200 B.C.

The magnificently decorated T-shaped tomb runs 15 feet long from east to west and 18 feet from north to south. A carved picture on the wall of the entrance area shows four baboons worshipping the solar boat of the god Ra-Atum. Next to these images, hieroglyphics describe Khonsu as a “true renowned scribe.”

On another wall, Khonsu and his wife, with two ram-headed deities in the background, are shown worshipping the gods Osiris and Isis, who also are depicted in a seated position on another wall.

The discovery raises hopes that more unknown tombs may be found in the Luxor area of Egypt, according to a report on Waseda’s website.

The Viktor Leonov was spotted approximately 65 nautical miles northeast of Norfolk, Va., in international waters heading south, a U.S. official told Fox News. The U.S. territorial line extends 12 miles from the coast.

RUSSIA, ASSAD BOMBING OF CIVILIANS CONTINUES

The Russian spy ship likely was returning to the Caribbean and Havana Harbor, according to the official. The Viktor Leonov was last seen in Havana in January 2015, as the Obama administration helped thaw relations with Cuba.

Earlier this week, the Russian intelligence-gathering ship ventured as close as 30 nautical miles off the coast of Groton, Conn., home to a U.S. Navy submarine base. In addition to intercepting communications, the spy ship can also collect and analyze U.S. Navy sonar capability, according to officials.

U.S. SPIES REPORTEDLY KEEPING INTELLIGENCE FROM TRUMP

This comes as the U.S. military’s top officer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, is set to meet his Russian counterpart Thursday in Azerbaijan, the first time the military heads of both nations have met since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Dunford is set to meet with Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Valeriy Gerasimov in Baku, according to the Pentagon.

“The military leaders will discuss a variety of issues including the current state of U.S.-Russian military relations and the importance of consistent and clear military-to-military communication to prevent miscalculation and potential crises,” a Pentagon statement said.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also met his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for the first time Thursday in Germany.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday it was in the interests of both Russia and the United States to restore ties between the two nations' intelligence agencies, Reuters reported.

Adding to the list of meetings with Kremlin officials, Fox News exclusively reported yesterday that a sanctioned Iranian general, responsible for killing hundreds of American troops in Iraq, would meet with top Russian officials.

Qassem Soleimani is visiting Moscow in violation of United Nations Security Council sanctions barring him from traveling outside Iran. Russia, as a member of the UN Security Council, would also be in violation of the sanctions preventing Soleimani from traveling.

Soleimani heads Iran’s Quds Force, the external wing of the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is tasked with coordinating Iran’s proxy forces throughout the Middle East.

A man was arrested with an ID card that identified him as 46-year-old Ri Jong Chol. He was picked up Friday night.

Authorities were still trying to piece together details of the case.

Officials performed a second autopsy on Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, because the first procedure was considered inconclusive, an official said on Saturday.

North Korea has vowed to reject the results of any post-mortem and demanded that Malaysia turn over the body immediately.

Pyongyang's ambassador said on Friday, while speaking to reporters that Malaysian officials may be "trying to conceal something" and "colluding with hostile forces."

Kim Jong Nam suddenly fell ill at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday as he waited for a flight home to Macau. He told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. He died on the way to the hospital.

South Korea has accused its enemies in North Korea of dispatching a hit squad to kill Kim Jong Nam at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, saying two female assassins poisoned him and then fled in a taxi.

On Friday, Indonesia's police chief said the Indonesian woman arrested for suspected involvement in the killing was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.

The Indonesia police chief cited information received from Malaysian authorities, saying that Siti Aisyah, 25, was paid to be involved in "Just For Laughs" style pranks, a reference to a popular hidden camera show. The official said she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," the police chief said. "She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents."

Malaysian police were questioning four suspects — Aisyah, another woman who carried a Vietnamese passport; a man they said is Aisyah's boyfriend; and the North Korean man.

North Korea broke its silence on the case Friday night. Speaking to reporters gathered outside the morgue in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, North Korean Ambassador Kang Chol said Malaysia conducted the autopsy on Kim Jong Nam "unilaterally and excluding our attendance."

Kang said the fact that Malaysia has yet to hand over the body "strongly suggests that the Malaysian side is trying to conceal something which needs more time and deceive us, and that they are colluding with the hostile forces towards us who are desperate to harm us."

Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger half-brother, the North Korean leader. He reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.British high school student Tom Wagg already has a line on his resume most of us can only dream of. While interning at Keele University two years ago, the then-15-year-old found what looked to be a planet; telescopes in Chile were used to take a deeper look, and now astronomers in Switzerland and Belgium have confirmed his find.

Specifically, Tom discovered an exoplanet the size of Jupiter in the constellation Hydra some 1,000 light years away. And he did it right out the gate: "It was just my third day when I spotted what looked a good candidate, but I had already gone through more than 1,000 sets of data by then," Tom tells the BBC.

"It looks boring, but when you think about what you're actually doing it's amazing really." The BBC explains Tom didn't make the find via telescope, but rather, but poring over data collected by the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP).

He was looking for dips in brightness that might indicate a planet passing in front of its star. The one he spotted has for now been called WASP-142b—so-called because it's the 142nd planet found by the UK-led WASP, reports Gizmodo.

A competition has been established to settle on a name, and Tom says he plans to submit a contender. Let's hope his is given serious consideration: Keele University notes in a press release that "while astronomers worldwide have now found over 1000 extra-solar planets, Tom is possibly the youngest ever to have done so." (This intern did something pretty cool, too.)

More From NewserA professional wrestler from Pennsylvania has become the lucha libre’s most notorious villain, by playing the part of Donald Trump’s Number One Supporter to thousands of furious Mexican spectators.

Sam Polinsky, 27, from Pittsburgh, has quickly ascended to the top of the Mexican wrestling entertainment industry as Sam Adonis, enraging audiences by waving an immense Stars and Stripes with the U.S. president’s face blazoned across during his entire performance.

“Professional wrestling is a lot like movies or comic books, people really appreciate the bad guys,” he told Fox News before a recent appearance at the Arena Mexico, lucha libre’s greatest stage.

“It was an obvious move to become the ‘Donald Trump supporter’ character, and it got the exact response I was hoping for from the audience.”

“I know I’m doing my job when someone who had been perfectly calm five minutes before suddenly wants to jump the barrier and help the other Mexican wrestlers in beating me up.” - Sam Adonis

Armed only with his Trump-spangled banner, Adonis is the center of attention in every bout he appears in, attracting the hatred, abuse and often projectiles of the audience as he works them into a fever pitch.

“I pride myself on the ability to make people go absolutely crazy,” he said. “People scream curse words at me, throw their beers at me.”

“I know I’m doing my job when someone who had been perfectly calm five minutes before suddenly wants to jump the barrier and help the other Mexican wrestlers in beating me up.”

“I hated him, and his flag especially, he made me very angry,” said father-of-two Rafael Cruz, 50, who had flung pieces of jellied pork skin at the wrestler during his performance. “I was glad to see his own teammate hitting him, because I really wanted to beat him up too.”

“The audience lives vicariously through Sam Adonis, venting their anger at Donald Trump through me,” the wrestler told Fox News.

Sam Polinsky had spent five years wrestling professionally in the United Kingdom before his arrival in Mexico, where many of his friends in the industry had recommended lucha libre.

“I had played the villain in London as well, playing the very patriotic American and talking down to the rest of the world,” he told Fox News. “I’ve played the bad guy for so long that the Trump situation would have been stupid to ignore. When I got to Mexico, I just turned it up a notch.”

While the wrestler plays the villain as Donald Trump’s Number One Fan on stage, Sam Polinsky says his own politics aren’t far from what he does in the ring.

“I definitely have a lot of respect for Donald Trump, particularly in that he doesn’t change who he is for people that don’t like him. He is the way that he is and stands by it,” he told Fox News.

“I can’t claim to be the world’s biggest Trump supporter, but I definitely supported him more than Hillary Clinton.”

As the Mexican audience became more animated against Sam with every wave of his Trump flag, the show made uncomfortable viewing for many Americans who were in the audience.

“I hated it,” said Amy Johnson, a tourist from Seattle visiting Mexico City for the week. “I was excited to leave America and not have to think about the Donald Trump situation, yet I get here and it’s immediately in my face.”

“As an American it’s very embarrassing,” she said.

Marlon Torres, also from Washington State, took a more sympathetic view of Sam’s performance.

“He’s a professional wrestler who’s making the most of the current political feeling in Mexico, so I feel like, good for him,” he told Fox News after a show last week. “You have to do what you have to do, and the show needs a villain. Who better than a Donald Trump surrogate?”

“It was a great show, I loved getting my aggression out.”

The day of Sam’s performance also saw tens of thousands of Mexicans take to the streets of 20 cities across the country to march in protest of Donald Trump.

Mexico City in particular saw 20,000 protestors surround the capital’s iconic Angel of Independence, half a mile from the Arena Mexico, where the CMLL lucha libre show puts on performances three nights a week.

“At the end of the day, I feel like I’m taking a negative situation and turning it into a positive one,” said Sam.

“Our attendance across the various arenas has gone up significantly since Sam Adonis started performing,” said Sandra Granados, spokeswoman for the Mexican Lucha Libre Council. “Our regular audience members have responded very well to him, as they love to get up and vent their anger at Trump through this character.”

“We put on shows to entertain and let people get out a bit of aggression, and Sam Adonis does both very well,” she said, “although to keep the crowds happy he’s going to have to lose more often than he wins.”

Sam Adonis performs at the Arena Mexico every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

Alasdair Baverstock is a freelance writer based in Mexico.Reba McEntire had already reached superstar status in the country music world by the time she landed the leading role on "Reba." But it was the hit sitcom that brought the country star into millions of households across the nation.

10 years after the show went off the air on Feb. 18 2007, McEntire told us she's still in touch with all of her old co-stars.

While they keep in touch in their personal lives, don't expect the co-stars to come back together for a "Reba" reboot.

McEntire told us a remake would be "impossible" because all of the former "Reba" stars are too busy.

"It would be very hard to do a 'Reba' reboot because Steve Howey is on 'Shameless,' Melissa [Peterman] is really busy on 'Baby Daddy'...Chris Rich is doing a movie in Oklahoma right now," McEntire shared told Fox News. "Joana Garcia just had a second baby and is loving life."

She added, "I stay in touch with all of them."

In fact, she had just gotten together with "most of the crew" of "Reba" for a friend's birthday party.

"Out of all the things I get to do, whether its' music, TV, Broadway, whatever it is, making the friends and getting to stay in touch with them that's the icing on the cake."

McEntire got us thinking. Where are the stars of "Reba" today?Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is now the subject of intense speculation as to whether he broke the law by telling the FBI he never brought up U.S. sanctions during a discussion with the Russian ambassador before Donald Trump took office.

Here is a look at the relevant laws.

Is Deceiving the FBI a Crime?

To be sure, lying to the FBI can constitute a serious felony. If Flynn swore to tell the truth, it is perjury. If his statements were not under oath, it is obstruction of justice and/or making a false statement to law enforcement.

However, prosecution would depend entirely on the content and context of Flynn’s words during his recorded conversation with the ambassador. Did they speak specifically about sanctions? Or was it a general discussion about expelled diplomats --which was part of the sanctions package?

If the word "sanctions" was never mentioned, then it is a semantical distinction with a legal difference. Interpretation is the key. If Flynn interpreted his conversation with the ambassador differently than the FBI, there is probably no crime.

Also, the length of the discussion is critical. If the subject of sanctions was merely a passing reference with little substance, then Flynn's claim that he did not really recall all of the discussion seems more credible, making it a legally valid defense.

A successful prosecution of the above-mentioned crimes requires proof of “specific intent.” That is, that Flynn made a false statement with knowledge of its falsity, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake or faulty memory. The defendant must have acted “willfully and knowingly.”

If Flynn believed his statement to be true when he made it, even though it was false, the case against him cannot be proven. So far, there is no evidence which gives rise to such proof.

Did Flynn Violate The Logan Act?

The Logan Act prohibits private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with foreign governments. Again, it depends on what Flynn said. If he made no promise to lift sanctions, then he didn't interfere with anything. Hence, no illegality.

Moreover, Flynn will surely argue he was not acting as a private citizen, as the law defines it, but in a wholly different capacity --as a government representative about to assume office and that his communication with an official of a foreign nation is no different than what other incoming administrations have done (and should do). Indeed, it is precisely what President Obama did before he was sworn into office.

Flynn’s intent is relevant. If he intended to act on behalf of the incoming Trump Administration, then there is no violation of the Act.

Finally, the Logan Act was passed in 1799. It was a political slap by the Federalists at Thomas Jefferson. For more than two centuries it has never been enforced and no one has ever been prosecuted under the Act -- largely because lawyers, judges and legal scholars universally regard it as a patently unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment.

So, let’s dispense with the Logan Act drama. It is nothing more than an obscure "Jeopardy" question.

Gregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.President Trump is setting out to uncover the saboteurs leaking damaging details about his administration, as speculation intensifies over whether current officials or a cabal of Obama lieutenants – or both – are turning the faucets.

One former senior intelligence official told Fox News he suspects ex-intelligence and other security officials, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, were in some way involved in revealing details of Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador. Those details contradicted what Flynn had told Vice President Pence and other Trump officials, leading to his resignation as national security adviser earlier this week.

“There were rumors from Day 1 when Mike Flynn signed aboard Team Trump that people were going to come after him,” the source said, suggesting it was part of an effort to preserve the Iran nuclear deal and settle old grudges. “Individuals within the intelligence community that fired him once didn’t want him to come back.”

A Clapper spokesman put out a statement late Thursday appearing to distance the former intel boss from any leaks, voicing support for a probe while urging the new administration to take a sober approach to the investigation.

“Leaks need to be investigated, but those investigations should be conducted in a manner that is not disparaging of our dedicated IC professionals, nor destructive to the entire community,” Clapper spokesman Shawn Turner said.

How exactly Trump’s investigation proceeds is not yet clear. He said during his Thursday news conference he’s called on the Justice Department to “look into the leaks” that have buffeted the start of his White House tenure.

“Those are criminal leaks,” Trump said.

The White House also is said to be looking at hiring New York financier Stephen Feinberg to lead an intelligence community review.

Asked Thursday how he would plug the leaks, Trump seemed confident that with his new selections in place at key intelligence agencies, the faucet would finally turn off. He specifically cited his CIA director and director of national intelligence – the roles previously held by Brennan and Clapper, respectively.

“Our new people are going in,” Trump said.

Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, would have made a prime target for top Obama intelligence officials. Flynn had been pushed out of his prior role as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014 by Clapper, following management clashes with former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers.

A vocal critic of the Iran deal who, in February, delivered the Trump administration statement putting the Islamic Republic “on notice,” Flynn’s views also run counter to the aims of Brennan and former Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes.

Brennan, a longtime Obama loyalist, said in November it would be the “height of folly” if the Trump administration were to tear up the Iran deal, as the then-president-elect had publicly stated he aimed to do. Rhodes perhaps had the most metaphorical skin in the game. As Obama’s top foreign policy adviser, Rhodes had helped engineer a self-described “echo chamber” to promote, and ultimately push, the deal across the finish line.

“They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say,” Rhodes bragged to The New York Times in a fawning May profile.

Rhodes, in an email sent to The Atlantic, denied any involvement in the leaks.

“It’s totally absurd and doesn’t make any sense,” he wrote. “I don’t know who the sources are for these stories and I don’t even understand the false conspiracy theory—how would getting rid of Flynn be the thing that saves the Iran Deal? It’s an effort to make the conversation about anything other than the actual story of what happened with Russia.”

Certainly not everyone in the intelligence community agrees the outcome of the Flynn situation was the result of a leak conspiracy.

Former CIA covert operations officer and Fox News contributor Mike Baker said the entire situation would be moot if Flynn simply had been honest with Pence and others, regarding the fateful conversation he had with a Russian counterpart in December.

“Mike Flynn has nobody to blame except for Mike Flynn,” Baker told Fox News. “I suspect his conversations were completely uninteresting [with the Russians]…But what? You’re going to be less than transparent with those around you who are your bosses?”

But while Flynn certainly contributed to his downfall, the source who spoke to Fox News said the events leading up to Flynn’s implosion were likely orchestrated.

“They were laying all this out as a trip wire,” the official told Fox News.

Subsequent reporting has shown the intelligence community – still under the purview of those installed by the Obama administration – was listening in on Flynn’s conversations with foreign counterparts during the transition of power. This period followed on the heels of concerns regarding Russian meddling in the U.S. election to boost Trump.

So Flynn’s Dec. 29 phone conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak – on the same day Obama expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and announced sanctions as punishment for the hacking of Democratic operatives – would have been fertile ground for those seeking to undermine Trump.

Two weeks after they occurred, news of the phone conversations, courtesy of an anonymous senior U.S. government official, appeared in a Washington Post article. The article posed the question, “What did Flynn say, and did it undercut the U.S. sanctions?”

Reuters, on Jan. 13, wrote about the Flynn call citing three sources familiar with the matter. One source proffered that Russia would probably want to have a sense of Team Trump’s thoughts on the recent sanctions, intimating sanctions were indeed discussed – though all three sources admitted they didn’t know the contents of the conversation.

On Jan. 15, Trump tweeted a Fox News article and publicly questioned if Brennan had been leaking information.

“.@FoxNews ‘Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat. Does not fully understand.’ Oh really, couldn’t do much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?” Trump wrote.

The Washington Post on Feb. 9 cited “nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls,” to report that Flynn had explicitly referenced sanctions. Noting that the day after sanctions were announced Putin said he would not retaliate, one source implied the Flynn calls might explain Putin’s reaction: “Something happened in those 24 hours.”

In the final days of the Obama administration, Clapper and Brennan agreed that the Trump team should be informed about the Flynn call, fearing his public denials that sanctions were discussed may have put him in a position to be blackmailed, The Washington Post reported on Feb. 13, citing former and current officials.

However, no quid pro quo reportedly was discussed and the White House counsel determined nothing illegal took place.

Still, on Feb. 13, with the Flynn matter dominating news coverage, Trump asked for and received the resignation of Flynn, who had ardently supported Trump throughout his presidential campaign. Trump said Thursday he was not troubled by the call itself, but how Flynn handled the aftermath.

After sacking Flynn, Trump quickly turned his attention to the leaks themselves.

"Intelligence, papers are being leaked," Trump said during a news conference on Wednesday. "Things are being leaked. It's a criminal action -- criminal act -- and it's been going on for a long time. Before me. But now it's really going on."

He later emphasized that the "documents and papers" were "illegally -- I stress that -- illegally leaked."

Trump tweeted earlier Wednesday: "The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!"

While Baker agreed the leaks needed to be investigated and the culprits punished, he said notions of a so-called “deep state coup” should be rolled back: “The hysteria is such that the truth is somewhere in the middle.”The early Martian atmosphere likely didn’t contain enough carbon dioxide to keep the planet warm enough for liquid water, according to National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists.

New findings further complicate the mystery of how the chilly planet could have once been home to the lakes and rivers that left their marks on its surface.

Geological evidence from the Curiosity rover shows evidence of lake beds and river deposits on Mars that planetary scientists generally believe could have been formed only by the presence of liquid water billions of years ago. But they have pondered how a young Sun, shining more faintly than it does today, could possibly keep the red planet above freezing long enough for liquid water to shape the land.

One theory suggests Mars’s atmosphere, thin today, once contained much more carbon dioxide warming the planet as a greenhouse gas. Previous work has failed to find a sufficient quantity of carbonates, minerals expected to form on the surface of Mars if carbon dioxide were present in the atmosphere, and the new research throws another monkey wrench in this theory.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzes data from Curiosity’s analysis of rocks from Gale Crater, which scientists believe was home to an ancient and long-lived lake. The analyzed rocks were approximately 3.5 billion years old, dating from the time scientists believe was the end of Mars’s wet period.

The rover’s X-ray diffraction instrument, which identifies the minerals present in a rock sample, didn't turn up any carbonates. Using that evidence and the amount of other minerals present, the researchers calculated that the Mars atmosphere must have contained very little carbon dioxide. “What we see is a lot lower than the amount needed to produce the greenhouse effect to have lakes and rivers around at that time,” said Thomas Bristow, a research scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., and lead author on the paper. An atmosphere with plenty of carbon dioxide would be the simplest answer, Dr. Bristow said, but “it doesn’t seem that easy solution will work in this case.”

The puzzle remains of how Mars was once warm enough to support liquid water.

One potential explanation is that Mars was icy overall with brief repeated warm periods in which water melted and formed the suggestive features, said Paul Niles, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center who wasn’t involved in the research. “I think the key problem is how long these liquid water events lasted,” Dr. Niles said, but determining the date of geologic features on Mars is difficult. Meanwhile, chemical data like that from the new research seem to conflict with geological data, which makes for “a big divide” in scientific opinion, he said.

Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.Vice President Mike Pence vowed Saturday that the United States will "hold Russia accountable" even as President Donald Trump searches for new common ground with Moscow at the start of his presidency.

Pence, in an address to the Munich Security Conference, also offered assurances to European allies that the U.S. "strongly supports" NATO. He said the U.S. would be "unwavering" in its commitment to trans-Atlantic institutions like NATO.

In his first overseas trip as vice president, Pence sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by Trump's positive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin. The address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, aimed at ending violence in eastern Ukraine.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence was meeting later Saturday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference shortly before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

Pence also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion — along with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

The visit, which will include a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression, Trump's relationship with Putin and whether the new president may promote isolationist tendencies through his "America First" mantra.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," says Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

Pence's stature within the administration was also under scrutiny because of the recent dismissal of Trump's national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign Monday following reports he misled Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat, which the vice president learned about through media accounts about two weeks after the president was informed.

Pence is also expected to meet with the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. is embroiled in two separate wars. Trump has made clear his intention to defeat the Islamic State group. But he also said the U.S. may get a second chance to take Iraqi oil as compensation for its efforts in the war-torn country, a notion rebuffed by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who will be meeting with the vice president.

Trump's immigration and refugee ban has ruffled feathers with a number of Muslim-majority countries affected by the order currently tied up in court, including Iraq — a close ally in the fight against IS.

In Munich, the American allies were searching for clues from Pence as to how the Trump administration plans to deal with Russia in the aftermath of Flynn's departure, U.S. inquiries into Russia's involvement in the presidential election and Trump's past praise for Putin.

European countries along Russia's border were rattled about deeper U.S.-Russian ties after Trump suggested sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in exchange for a nuclear weapons deal and the president referred to NATO as "obsolete" in an interview before his inauguration. Trump has since tempered his language, telling foreign leaders in phone calls about the importance of the NATO alliance.

NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a military alliance of European and North American democracies created after World War II to strengthen international cooperation as a counter-balance to the rise of the Soviet Union. In 2014, the 28-member alliance created a rapid-reaction force to protect the most vulnerable NATO members against a confrontation with Russia.

The Ceuta regional government gave the figures, with officials saying it was believed to be the biggest border invasion in recent years. Ceuta is separated from the rest of Spain by the Strait of Gibraltar.

UGANDA WARNS OF STRAIN UNDER HUGE SOUTH SUDAN REFUGEE INFLUX

Some 700 migrants attempted to smash through several gates simultaneously at about 6 a.m., a Ceuta government official told The Associated Press. He refused to be identified, in accordance with government rules.

He said 498 migrants made it into Spanish territory, with two hospitalized due to injuries they sustained in the assault. He said 11 Spanish police were also hurt.

A Civil Guard spokesman said police clashed with the migrants at the Tarajal area of the fence. He declined to disclose his identity in line with internal policy. At least 10 members of Morocco's armed forces were also injured, he said.

More than 30 migrants were treated at a migrant center for bone fractures and other injuries. Some were also cut trying to scale the fence, which is topped with barbed wire, said Clemen Nunez, director of Ceuta's Red Cross emergency response team.

According to the Civil Guard, a surveillance camera showed hundreds of people approaching the fence, using tools and clubs to break one of the gates.

In video filmed by Faro TV Ceuta, some of the migrants can be seen with blood on their faces and bruises but mostly celebrating the arrival in Spanish territory. Some wrapped themselves with Spanish and European flags and screamed "Freedom, freedom!"

Hundreds of sub-Saharan African migrants are living illegally in Morocco and regularly attempt to enter Ceuta and Melilla, Spain's other North African enclave, in hopes of getting into Europe. Most are fleeing poverty, violence or both.

On Friday, 55 of them were rejected, according to the Civil Guard, because those who are intercepted on the spot can be returned to Morocco. But those that make it over the fences are usually taken to migrant centers and eventually repatriated or let go, many choosing to seek asylum or work informally in Spain or other European countries.

Before the latest arrival, the migrant center Ceuta was already struggling to cope with more than 600 people and making use of military tents in nearby parking lots.A critically endangered species of antelope is dying by the thousands from a deadly infectious disease outbreak in Mongolia, and scientists fear there could be "catastrophic consequences" for the threatened animals and their ecosystem.

Since December 2016, about 2,500 Mongolian saiga (Saiga tatarica mongolica) — a unique subspecies of saiga antelope — have died from a livestock virus. Scientists estimate the Mongolian saiga population to be about 10,000, meaning the deadly outbreak has killed about 25 percent of the endangered steppe-dwelling antelope. The virus, known as PPR or "peste des petits ruminants," was introduced to the Mongolian saiga population in September, from infected goats and sheep, scientists said.

Though the die-off rate has slowed, it could have repercussions throughout the local environment, said Amanda Fine, a veterinarian and associate director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) Wildlife Health Program in Asia. [ Photos: A 2015 Mass Die-Off of the Endangered Saiga Antelope ]

"The situation is tragic and widespread," Fine said in a statement. "Along with the impact to the saiga population, this event has the potential to produce cascading catastrophic consequences on the ecosystem. For example, ibex and argali may be affected, and rare snow leopards may suffer the effects of a diminished prey base."

PPR, which is also known as sheep and goat plague, is highly contagious and can infect up to 90 percent of an animal herd once introduced, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The disease is spread via body fluids, feces and close proximity, and symptoms include fever, anorexia, diffuclty breathing and more. After just a few days affected animals become depressed, very weak, and severely dehydrated, according to the FAO. The FAO and the World Organization for Animal Health are working to eradicate PPR by 2030, but the disease is known to have infected animal populations in more than 70 countries.

In Mongolia, a rapid-response team has begun collecting samples from the dead and diseased saiga in an effort to stop the spread of infection and determine how to support the species' recovery.

"The best way to prevent PPR is through further immunization of livestock in not only saiga range areas, but [also] other affected-species range areas," Fine said. "Stress-free conditions for recovering saiga and access to food and water resources should be provided in order to save the last population of Mongolian saiga from extinction."

The saiga face other threats aside from illness. People use the antelope's horns in traditional medicine, making the animals vulnerable to poaching. More than 90 percent of the saiga population has been lost in recent decades, according to WCS officials.

Original article on Live Science .Promising new research may make it possible to detect autism in babies before symptoms appear. Researchers scanned the brains of infants with autistic siblings considered at high risk of developing the disorder themselves.

They report in the journal Nature that brain changes identified in MRIs of infants allowed them to predict with 80 percent accuracy in the first year which ones would go to show autistic symptoms.

Children usually do not show signs of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), such as not making eye contact, until age 2 or older. Early intervention has been shown to ease and even reverse symptoms.

Lead author Joseph Piven tells CBS News "the first year of life (is) where the brain is most malleable" and responsive to treatment. Though small in scope, the first-ever study could lead to development of a tool to predict autism in high-risk infants—and perhaps in the general population—before their first birthday "to prevent these children from falling behind in social and communication skills," co-author Annette Estes tells the Guardian. One in 100 children develop autism, but that risk zooms to one in five for those with an autistic sibling, per Nature.

Scientists analyzed the brain scans of 106 babies at high risk and 42 at low risk for the disorder. Those in the high-risk group who later went on to develop ASD saw unusual growth of the outer surface of the brains in the first year of life, followed by "an overgrowth of the brain" in the second year, Piven tells CBS.

That brain growth was linked to ASD symptoms. ("Neural fingerprint" of mom's voice may help unlock secrets of autistic brains.)

This article originally appeared on Newser: Scientists May Be Able to Spot Autism in InfantsWith every autism article I consider there to be one caveat that greatly diminishes all of the incredible work the researchers are doing. Each new way researchers develop to determine an autism diagnosis or a child’s risk for diagnosis is a leg up in this ongoing battle we have with the disorder, but what we lack socially often negates whatever advancement we’ve made medically.

The autism rates in our country are at all-time highs, with 1 in 68 children being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around the age of 3. Thousands of parents, including me, wake each morning wondering when their child will be considered more than just a statistic by our government officials. There’s a new first-of-its-kind study using MRI technology to measure the brains of infants who have older siblings with autism to predict their chances of receiving an autism diagnosis before they ever show any symptoms. The study is small, but it has an 80 percent accuracy rate and achieves what I consider to be the most important facet of dealing with autism: early diagnosis.

Medically, we are doing what we can to fight this battle, but socially we’re a mess. I have written extensively on this topic because of my personal experiences with my 19-year-old son. We practiced early-intervention therapy with our son immediately after receiving his diagnosis and, fortunately, are financially able to continue to provide him with the services he needs to further develop his social and life skills. But, for inner city parents and families, the more we do for early diagnosis, the more helpless they feel. Many parents face a daily fight with public education officials to get their children the help that they need, which often results in schools providing the bare minimum for these kids.

We still have very little understanding of what causes autism, and why some children are more at-risk than others. The research in this area is ongoing, and must continue to receive federal funding so that we can work toward finding a cure. Until then, government officials cannot ignore our accomplishments in this field and the need for more therapeutic treatments. As the new Congress evaluates our country’s health care needs, you can expect parents of autistic and special needs children to be yelling the loudest. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos must work to enhance the proficiency of special education teachers and support curriculums in our public schools that give these children a fighting chance.

I applaud the researchers at the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities and other institutions who contributed to this latest work, but now I call on our politicians to take it a step further. As parents and physicians, we are working as hard as we can to develop early intervention therapies so that these children grow up to become valued members of our society, but we need Washington’s help to further our cause. Until we can find a way to provide for these children equally, we cannot truly celebrate medicine’s amazing accomplishments.

This is a rush transcript from "Sunday Morning Futures," December 18, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: One final stop.

Good morning, everyone. That's for being with us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to "Sunday Morning Futures".

President-elect Donald Trump holding his final rally of the year in Mobile, Alabama. So, what's his message about and what to expect in a New Year? We will speak to a Trump advisor live, coming up.

Plus, we can do stuff to you. That's President Obama's response to the Russians interfering with the U.S. election. How will we retaliate against Vladimir Putin?

Immigration showdown, a new report shows immigration lawyers are seeing a huge uptick in cases, some fearing Trump's immigration policy is about to hit them. What will change in the New Year? We talk about the lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, is with us live as we look ahead right now on "Sunday Morning Futures."

(MUSIC)

BARTIROMO: President-elect Donald Trump greeting tens of thousands of supporters in Mobile, Alabama, on Saturday this weekend.

Wrapping up his national "thank you" tour in the city he says ignited his campaign one year ago. Hitting on familiar campaign themes and promising better days ahead in his new administration.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: I actually think the next four years is going to be a lot easier, if you want to know the truth. We're going to do a great job. You the American people will now again be in charge. Your voice, your desires, your hopes, your aspirations we'll ever again fall on deaf ears, never again. The forgotten men and women of this country and they were forgotten. By the way, you're not forgotten any longer.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Jason Miller, Trump transition team communications director.

Jason, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.

JASON MILLER, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Good morning.

BARTIROMO: So, the thank you tour rolls on. What is he trying to do with this thank you tour and what should we expect this upcoming week from the Trump campaign?

MILLER: Well, I think with the "thank you" tour, what we're seeing first of all the president-elect going around the country and saying thank you very much to the hard working men and women who helped deliver the win last month.

But more importantly, I think we're looking ahead to the future, which is appropriate with the show that we're on right now and talking about what we're going to do once the president-elect is sworn in next month, when we talk about repealing and replacing Obamacare, getting in to some tax reform. We have some big things that are coming for America and this is just a little bit of a preview.

BARTIROMO: Yes. And in terms of foreign policy, Jason, talk to us about his views towards China, what is he expecting to do there? Of course we know that the rhetoric has been off for quite a bit. We should tell China that we don't want to waste the drone they stole back from us, let them keep it is what Donald Trump tweeted out about China taking the drone in the water. What is he trying to do there saying just keep it?

MILLER: Well, I think specific regard to the drone, let's be clear about what we would actually get back if we did get something back a chunk of metal and maybe a bag of wires. I mean, it would be a remnant of whatever it was once was.

I think in the broader picture, when we talk about China, when you start being tougher and start standing up for America first. And this is even bigger and broader than China, we're talking about America's place overall. And so, we see it with Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, we see it with Wilbur Ross, who's going to be our commerce secretary, someone's going to get in there and negotiate good trade deals and help American workers, the president-elect is putting together a team that's actually going to stand up and fighting for us.

BARTIROMO: Yes, and a lot of energy officials on the new Cabinet from Rex Tillerson, former CEO of ExxonMobil, Rick Perry running the energy department. We know that President-elect Trump has made a promise to tap into the energy resources of this country. Is that the theory?

MILLER: Well, absolutely, energy is going to be a big part of getting the economy going and we saw specifically with Governor Perry how during his watch in the state of Texas, they helped create 2.2 million jobs, many of those from the energy sector. And President-elect Trump really has an all of the above approach to energy, that we need to get our oil shale moving, need to get oil exploration. We need to be looking at all the different opportunities we can to get this going.

And there had been far too many burdensome regulations that President Obama and his administration have put on. And so, we're going to start repelling some of those bad regulations, we can get our economy moving. And really, that's I think we're going to have one of the biggest bumps that we're going to see.

BARTIROMO: Now, Jason, tomorrow, we all know that the Electoral College will officially put their votes forth. You've got some electors out there being threatened. The left is up in arms, basically saying, change your vote, don't vote for Donald Trump tomorrow on the official date.

What is your team expecting?

MILLER: Well, news flash for many of the partisan Democrats and those in the mainstream media who continue to try to delegitimize President-elect Trump's massive and historic win last month -- the elections over. Hillary Clinton lost. Now, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence are focused on going to work for the American people.

And whether it was this nonsense about the recount or nonsense about the popular vote, you have to win 270 electoral votes to be elected president and President-elect Trump actually got 306. This is all really just an effort to try to delegitimize the win. But that's not going to slow down the president-elect. He's focused for the American people, he's ready to go and we think that tomorrow will be a resounding victory in line with what the voters decided last month.

BARTIROMO: I mean, what happens if some of the electors do change their vote?

MILLER: Well, and let's be clear about that, you know. Possibly maybe there's one person who goes a different direction, but our team is very confident, our legal team and our electoral college team is confident that folks will be voting in line with the way that the voters intended, and I think that's ultimately sacred trust that the electors have, is they need to follow the will of the people and make good on this. And again, 306 electoral votes for President-elect Trump winning states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania -- I mean, very impressive win last month and I think it gives him a mandate to tail on these massive reforms when he's sworn in next month.

BARTIROMO: Yes, I was looking at a sound bite which President Obama was in just in the middle of the campaign. He said, Donald Trump should stop whining. The Electoral College is what it is and they're going to vote they want. I mean, this was obviously before the election. He was pretty sure that Hillary Clinton would win and here you have the left really doing the whining right now.

Let me ask you about that. I mean, I guess Hillary Clinton and President Obama could do some more to shut down these questions but they're not?

MILLER: Well, they could. And also I think this is really disrespectful to the American public who after eight years of gridlock and seeing a country that's being more divided, why would they try to divide the country further right now? I think what people want to see and this is why we're seeing the economy taking on the, as Stu Varney says, the Trump rally, or other people might say, the Trump bump.

Consumer confidence is up, that American swagger is back, that optimism, that we can going forward as a country, we can see real economic growth. Not just the growth we might see in New York, that we might see in places like Washington, D.C., but all across Middle America. We talked about the Rust Belt, the Upper Midwest, the states where Trump really tapped into something here about fighting for American jobs, and that spirit is back and we're energetic and optimistic as we look ahead.

BARTIROMO: Jason, what has been the conversation surrounding Russia? We all know that ExxonMobil has done a pretty significant deal in the Black Sea with Vladimir Putin before the sanctions were put in place. Is it of your mind that pretty soon into President Trump's administration, that the sanctions against Russia will be rolled back?

MILLER: Well, I'm going to leave that to Secretary of State Tillerson after his confirmation and also the president-elect to go over the very specifics on the foreign policy front. But I think there's one thing a broader point that a lot of folks are missing, is that we need help quite frankly in number of places around the world in defeating common foes. So, as we talk about ISIS, we talk about radical Islamic terrorism. If there are other countries who act in good faith to defeat common enemies, then we shouldn't be labeling these other countries right off the top. We should where we can work together.

But again, going back to the point I made a moment. This will be an administration that has an America first foreign policy. And that's something the president-elect has talked about continually on the campaign trail. I think that's what you'll see from his administration.

BARTIROMO: So, foreign policy is obviously a major priority. Give us what you see as the most important priorities that President-elect Trump is looking at after inauguration day in terms of his agenda?

MILLER: All right. Well, now, we're getting in to the good stuff because this is where President-elect Trump is really going to start making good on campaign promises. Heck, we've already seen it so far when we talk about the Carrier deal and all these different places where the president-elect has been standing up and fighting for American workers.

But right out of the gate, you'll see the wheels start moving to repel and replace Obamacare. You'll immediately start seeing, or pretty soon afterwards I think we'll start getting in to some tax reform. I know that's something that's very important to the president-elect. And I would say also, you'll see a number of executive orders on day one to repel and rescind some of these unconstitutional illegal executive orders put in place by the current president.

And so, I think anyone who voted for Donald Trump, anyone who voted for real change in this country is going to be excited after he's sworn in next month.

BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we'll be watching all the developments. It sure is a new day.

Jason, good to see you. Thank you so much.

MILLER: Hey, thank you so much, Maria.

BARTIROMO: Merry Christmas to you.

Jason Miller joining us there from Florida this morning.

President Obama says the U.S. will retaliate against Russia meanwhile for interfering with the U.S. election. So, how will the U.S. respond?

South Dakota Senator John Thune is with me next, live.

You can follow us on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let us know what you'd like to hear from Senator Thune.

We'll be right back as we look ahead on "Sunday Morning Futures".

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: In early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn't.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BARTIROMO: That was President Obama now promising payback after Russia failed to heed that warning. U.S. intelligence officials are confirming that Moscow did meddle in the presidential election but President-elect Trump is not buying it. The dispute over Russia's role fueling a public spat between Mr. Trump and White House officials last week.

Joining us right now is Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.

Senator, good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.

SEN. JOHN THUNE, R-S.C.: Thanks, Maria. Good morning.

BARTIROMO: So, where do you sit on this? We keep hearing that they meddled, but I'm not -- I'm not understanding how Russia meddled. Do you believe that Russia takes any responsibility for Donald Trump winning this election?

THUNE: I think they try to be disruptive. I don't think that any questions always wants to destabilize the American political system and I don't think that should come as any surprise to anyone. You know, the specific steps and actions that were taken in this election are being looked at and I hope when we have a full review by the Intelligence Committee, that we'll get to the bottom of it.

You know, at this point, trying to figure out what sort of retaliatory steps one might take I think are premature because we need to find out exactly what happened and then react to it accordingly. But, you know, clearly, there was an attempt this time around to mess with. But, you know, what the ultimate goal of that, whether it was designed to help Donald Trump win as a lot are alleging, you know, remains to be seen and I think we have to get to the bottom of it through the intelligence community before we can make that assessment.

BARTIROMO: Well, you know, it's interesting because Julian Assange was right here on FOX News the other night with Sean Hannity, and he said the leaks of the DNC e-mails actually came from a DNC insider. I don't know if we're supposed to believe Julian Assange, but he said this did not come from Russia.

THUNE: Right. And that's why I think, Maria, trying to -- people who are making these snap judgments right now based on a lot of the reporting that's out there, I think until we are able to hear from the intelligence committee hopefully in a coordinated way, if you get the DNI and the FBI and the CIA, all up in front of the intelligence committees in the Congress, with a report and assessment of what happened, I think we'll be able to make a better determination about what steps need to be taken moving forward.

But right now, there's just a lot of wild accusations flying back and forth. Clearly, there was an attempt to mess with this election, but what form that took and what its impact was I think remains to be seen. Until we know the answers to knows questions, I think it's a little bit again premature to start, you know, coming to conclusions about what the U.S. should do next.

BARTIROMO: I'm just trying to understand why, all of a sudden, Russia is this, you know, major, big enemy on the left? I mean, you know, President Obama, his entire eight years was basically trying to buddy up to the Russians. I don't know if you remember this moment back in 2012 when President Obama was about to get re-elected and he whispered to then Prime Minister Medvedev. Listen to this, Senator.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: After my election, I have more flexibility.

DMITRY MEDVEDEV, RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER: I understand. I'll transmit this information to Vladimir.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BARTIROMO: So, there's President Obama schmoozing then prime minister basically saying, I'll have more flexibility after I win this election. And now -- so how come President Obama and the Dems did not tell us how evil the Russians were these entire eight years?

THUNE: Irony of ironies, you know? The rhetoric has certainly changed coming out of the White House compared to what it was a few years ago, and that's why I think it's important -- obviously things of change, what's happened in Syria and the Russian involvement there. Their relationship with Iran I think bears a lot on our relationship and I think we need to look at the Russians as adversaries, and clearly history would suggest that that -- we should be very skeptical in terms of our relationship in dealing with them.

But this president has had a very checkered record when it comes with dealing with Russia and their allies in the Middle East and that region of the world. So, to now come out and make some of the statements that they're making, I think does -- it comes across a little bit ironic and perhaps hypocritical. But I think the broader point that you're making is, the relationship with Russia going forward is something now that the Trump administration is going to inherit and the Obama administration on their way out the door is making assertions about things that they might do to retaliate against Russia for meddling in the election.

BARTIROMO: Right.

THUNE: But this is largely now going to fall on the Trump administration in terms of how to respond to this and that's why it's important that we confirm these -- the national security team that he's trying to put in place, Rex Tillerson who was recently nominated for secretary of state, and the others I think need to respond to these positions as quickly as possible, so that they can begin to respond to some of these situations, not only in Russia but China and other places around the world where we have a lot of hot spots.

BARTIROMO: So, Senator, how does this impact the domestic agenda from your standpoint? What do you think is realistic in terms of new regulations, moving forward, let's call it the first 1 to 200 days?

THUNE: Well, I think, he has a really unique opportunity, Maria, because the previous administration did so many things by executive action that this administration can come in and undo the damage that's been done. You know, he could, for example, approve the Keystone Pipeline very quickly, which would immediately create a lot of jobs in the economy. He could roll back the Department of Labor overtime rules, which would be a devastating shot to the economy if they were implemented.

So, he could undo that damage, he could undo a lot of Obama's administration attack on affordable energy that has been waged largely through the EPA. These are all things that have had a profound negative impact on the economy.

Repealing and replacing Obamacare obviously is something Congress will have to be involved with, but we intend to be involved with that. We think that Obamacare has been extremely harmful across this country, skyrocketing premiums, insurance markets collapsing and dwindling choices for consumers in this country. And so, that's something that needs to be dealt with on day one.

The issue of tax reform was mentioned earlier by Jason Miller, is a huge issue when it comes to getting the growth rate back in our economy.

I think if this president focuses on getting that growth rate back up to two to four percent, creating better paying jobs, getting wages back up and policies that would create conditions that are favorable to that, along the lines of those I just mentioned, I think you'll have a lot of support among the American people and it will enable him to do many of the harder things that he'll have to do down the road.

BARTIROMO: Right. And it does feel like he's got real support on that in terms of who's going to lead on economic growth through tax reform. So that should --

THUNE: I think he does. In tax reform it is long overdue. Very hard. We all know that.

But I think he's got a position. He had a very decisive election victory. I think the American people indicated very quickly they want a different direction. If you came out of the exit polls said 62 percent of the people think the country's headed into the wrong direction, 52 percent think the economy should be the number one issue.

BARTIROMO: Yes.

THUNE: So, when it comes to economy and jobs and wages, there is a huge opening there for this president to chart a new direction and when you're hanging around in 1 percent to 2 percent growth, which is where we've been now for the past eight --

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You know, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, they all believed in strong borders. We don't. We fight for countries that most of you have never even heard of before so they have borders.

We will stop illegal immigration for good and we will have doors in that wall, and people will come in to that wall and they'll come through that wall by the tens of thousands. But they're coming in legally.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BARTIROMO: That was President-elect Donald Trump last night talking immigration in Alabama during the last stop of his "thank you" tour.

Mr. Trump reiterated his campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexico/U.S. border and suspend immigration from Middle East regions where vetting may be a problem. So, how much of this can he realistically get done in the next year?

Joining us right now to talk about that is Dan Patrick. He's the lieutenant governor of Texas.

Sir, it's good to have you on the program. Thanks for joining us, Governor.

DAN PATRICK, R-LT. GOV. OF TEXAS: Hi, Maria. Good morning. Good to be with you.

BARTIROMO: What do you want to see in terms of Trump meeting this promise?

PATRICK: Well, first of all, Maria, I think he will meet the promise. I think he'll keep his word. I think he could be the first president to actually address the issue of both securing the border and passing legal immigration reform which to be very honest with you, neither party has done when they had the opportunity, when they had the numbers, when they had the votes and that would tell you that neither the Democrats, maybe because they want future voters or the Republicans because they want cheap labor have wanted to address the issue. I think Donald Trump will.

The wall and -- I don't know what the final product will look like, but in my view and I've spent a decade or more on this issue as lieutenant governor, as a senator, I've been down to the border many times. It should be a combination of hard wall, fencing, technology, a natural barrier.

We can secure the border. There's no question in my mind with the emphasis and will power by a president to do it. It can be done. Secondly, with legal immigration reform, Maria, people would rather come to this country and not live in the shadows, not hide out.

They would rather come here and pay the U.S. government a couple of thousand dollars or whatever the number is to come here legally as opposed to paying the drug cartel thousands of dollars to come here, maybe be stuck in a stash house with a hundred people with one bathroom, maybe be extorted for future money as they work in this country. If we can combine legal immigration reform, which I think Trump can make history on and get done with border security, we'll solve that problem.

BARTIROMO: People feel like the private workplace is the last bastion that nobody really gets to or defends at all. I'm reading an article right now that says, despite promising during the 2014 to crackdown on Texas employers who hire undocumented workers, it was status quo last session in the state that you oversee.

So, let's talk about that. Illegal hiring practices in the Texas workplace. What can you do about it?

PATRICK: Well, I don't know who wrote the article but they're wrong. Last session, my first session as lieutenant governor, along with Greg Abbott, our governor who we work closely together with, we passed the first e- verify or all government employees.

This session will present a low bill number, I've assigned it a high priority to make sure all contractors working with government agencies that covers lots of private jobs will have to have the E-verify. And third step will be, then E-verify for all employees. We will also pass sanctuary cities this session.

Last session, it did get stuck in the House. We were one vote short in the Senate. This session, it will pass, in my view. We have the votes in the Senate to pass it.

So, between sanctuary cities, our second step in E-verify, we will address that issue.

The other thing, Maria, that we have done is when I campaigned, I campaigned that we would nearly triple the amount of money we put into border security. We increased our budget from $250 million to $800 million on the last session, on border security. It's made it a lot safer down the border area but we still need a partner in Washington.

And, first of all, our taxpayers shouldn't have to do this. This is a Washington responsibility that Obama never addressed. Let me tell you what, the people of the border patrol, they want to get the job done, but they've been handcuffed by the administration.

And I think when Donald Trump takes his office on January 20th, he'll give them the keys of that handcuffed and let the border patrol do what they can do.

BARTIROMO: Yes.

PATRICK: And working with us, it can make a big difference. I'll give you an example, Maria, about five years ago we only had a few hundred cameras on the border. Today, we have nearly 5,000 cameras and you cross that border, we instantly know where you are, it's just a matter of manpower to get to that spot to apprehend you.

BARTIROMO: Well, you make a really good point because I don't understand - -

(CROSSTALK)

PATRICK: Once we support the border, all of these things will work out.

BARTIROMO: I don't understand why sanctuary cities have been blown off for so long. I mean, the law is the law, how come sanctuary cities have been able to exist?

PATRICK: In large part, Maria, and I don't want to sound partisan, but this is the truth. Most of our cities are run by Democrats, and Democrats just are flaunting the law in this issue. They hire the police chiefs. They tell the police chiefs or they work with the local sheriff not to hold people that ICE has asked them to hold on retainer. They asked the police to turn their back.

I can tell you, I work closely with law enforcement. The rank and follow officers on the streets want to be able to do their job, once again. But Democrats who run most, not all but most of the cities have flaunted it.

Look at what's happening now. You have San Francisco, you have Rahm Emanuel in Chicago.

BARTIROMO: Exactly.

PATRICK: You have De Blasio in New York, basically telling the president- elect that they're going to ignore him.

BARTIROMO: Exactly.

PATRICK: In my view, if a mayor takes a position that we're not going to follow federal law and keep these criminals on detainer as asked for by ICE and they get out and commit a crime, they should be held liable for those crimes. If I were a family, if I were a victim's family, I'd be suing that mayor. When they let out someone, that they could have held, we could have deported out in this country, and that person goes on to commit another crime, likely we saw with Kate Steinle in San Francisco, and in many other places in this country.

If there's one issue, I campaigned with President-elect Trump, several times, four times or five times in Texas over the summer, and he would meet with these victims' families and I think it touched his heart. I think he's determined to do it and I wouldn't want to be any of these Democrat mayors who defy the president once he passes tough new laws on this issue.

BARTIROMO: Wow. It is quite extraordinary.

PATRICK: People want it. People want our borders secure. It's good for our economy, it's good for public safety and I believe Donald Trump will get it done.

And in Texas, we are finally glad, Maria, to have a partner and not an enemy in the White House.

BARTIROMO: Yes, it's quite extraordinary.

Governor, good to talk with you. Thanks so much.

PATRICK: Great, Maria. Merry Christmas.

BARTIROMO: And to you. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick there.

Up next, the cost of prescription drugs, major concerns for voters. What does the future hold for the cost of your medications under President-elect Donald Trump? I'll talk to the CEO of drug maker Allergan. I'll talk to him what he wants to see from this president, as we look ahead on "Sunday Morning Futures", next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Affordable drug pricing became a national talking point this year when the price of Mylan's EpiPen sky rocketed over 400 percent during the summertime.

So, what were the pharmaceutical industry look like under the Trump administration?

Joining me right now is the chairman and CEO of Allergan, Brent Saunders.

Brent, good to see you.

BRENT SAUNDERS, CEO OF ALLERGAN: Thanks for having me, Maria.

BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.

So, are you expecting big changes under a Trump administration?

SAUNDERS: I don't think so in the sense that a lot of people fear. I think that we finally have a government that appears to be pro-growth, pro- innovation and pro-deregulation, all things that could be really good for innovation and the bio pharmaceutical industry. So, I'm very optimistic that our future is bright.

That being said, we have to deal with one issue, which is drug pricing, and that has angered Americans, rightfully so. We're in an area of populism and this is an important issue. So, we need to self-regulate and self- control on this issue and I know people are skeptical whether we can do it, but I do believe this industry is filled with great people trying to do good things to solve on that need, and so we can be disciplined on prices.

BARTIROMO: How do you do it? Over the summertime, Hillary Clinton was very vocal. She basically said, look, if I become president, we're going to put a cap on drug prices. At that point, all of the pharmaceutical stocks sold off, people were worried about being overregulated. Now, you got Donald Trump in there saying, we're going to roll back regulations. But still, people do not want to see outsize prices for prescription drugs.

How do you keep the price down?

SAUNDERS: I believe people are right. They shouldn't see outsize price increase.

We have a social contract and I wrote about this on my blog over the summer and Allergan has committed to it, which says we need to invest in innovation for cures and treatment for medical needs and we need to charge a price for our medicines that allow us to invest in R&D, but we don't need to engage in price gauging activities or take serial double digit price increases. We can exercise self-restraint, such that our net prices at Allergan are mid-single digit, or just slightly above the cost of inflation.

So, Allergan, a very successful growth bio pharmaceutical company can deliver strong shareholder return, yet not engage in these types of practices. So, we're proving that it's possible.

That being said, I think we need the rest of the industry to do it and given the pro-growth government that we have coming in, if we get this particular issue under control, I think we're going to have a golden era of innovation. The worst thing we can do is have what Hillary Clinton was suggesting, a government takeover of the pharmaceutical industry. That will stifle innovation. That will really I think set us back in terms of solving some of these really important disease areas like cancer, Alzheimer's, autism, that we really need to solve in the next decade.

BARTIROMO: Because you want this to be a free market where people can invest in the drug industry thinking that they can make money from it. But if you're going to invest in a new product and you know that there's a limit because it's regulated, that you can't raise prices, than why would you invest?

SAUNDERS: So I hear from some people within the pharmaceutical industry that says we only, we take the price increases because the market allows us. I'm not sure that's true. I think you could say, well, Apple has a pattern on the iPhone and they could triple the price. But the problem is the customer's won't pay for. They'll move on to another phone, they'll go to Samsung, they'll go somewhere else.

In healthcare, because the patient doesn't actually always pay for the medicine, it's paid for by a middle man, there's not direct pricing power, they don't feel it. So, there's a perverse incentive there.

So, I think we as a pharmaceutical industry need to do our part by pricing our medicines, so they're affordable and accessible. And then we need the PBMs. The insurance companies and everyone else to play a part of this to solve it. It can be solved. I'm very optimistic to be solved.

BARTIROMO: And that's pharmacy benefit managers.

Let me move on to ObamaCare. This past week was the deadline to enroll in ObamaCare. We know what Donald Trump has said. He wants to repeal and replace.

As a pharmaceutical executive, tell me about ObamaCare. What do you want to see in the replacement?

SAUNDERS: Yes. I think we do want to see a replacement. I think we want it to be done thoughtfully. We don't want to see 20 million people just uninsured immediately. But I think we want to go to something like what Vice President-elect Pence has done in Indiana where there's some balance between Medicaid providing benefits but patients also having some accountability for their care and the use of health savings account, something also that incoming HHS Secretary Tom Price I think is a big supporter of.

So, we need to have the right incentives in place. We need to incentivize patients to take their health and own their health. We need pharmaceutical companies to be incentivized to find cures versus treatments, and we need physicians to be incentivize to help -- and insurance companies to help do preventive care, so that we don't have people in expensive emergency rooms. So, we need an overhaul of the incentive structure and I think some of these ideas could be built into the Affordable Care Act.

BARTIROMO: Well, the insurance companies have pulled out, a lot of them, because they're not making any money on it, they're going to lose a billion dollars on it, when you listen to some of them.

But this new study says that premium increases are adding $10 billion to the taxpayer's tab. We're going to see increases in the terms of the cost of Obamacare up more than 100 percent in certain states. You think that what you just said in terms of that replacement will help with the cost?

SAUNDERS: I think it is. But remember, the biggest problem you have with the current Affordable Care Act is really only sick people are enrolling in the exchanges. And so, therefore, it becomes more expensive and when the premiums become more expensive, the governments from the subsidies become more expensive, and then you have an extra $10 billion bill for the taxpayers.

So, we need a program that allows us to have a true insurance pool where health and sick people are in there that we incentivize preventive care, where we get treatments -- we get away from treatments and we move to cures, and we try to limit price increases and expenses, and we look at the friction cost of health care. There are a lot of people who don't contribute to solving disease, whether it'd be us or the doctors or the hospitals to really treat the patient. There are a lot of the middle man who are very profitable that are really friction cost when it comes to healthcare.

BARTIROMO: All right. My thanks to Brent Saunders, CEO of Allergan right there.

Responding to Russia, and will some GOP electors break away from Donald Trump, as the Electoral College votes tomorrow. We will handicap that electoral college vote when we come right back with our panel. That's up next. Stay with us.

BARTIROMO: “Saturday Night Live” having a little fun with the president- elect's perceived relationship with Vladimir Putin.

Joining us right now to talk more about Russia, Ed Rollins, former advisor to President Reagan, Steven Sigmund, senior vice president of the Global Strategy Group and a Democratic strategist, and Tony Sayegh, Republican political analyst, executive vice president of Jamestown Associates, and a Fox News contributor.

Good to see you all. Thanks so much for joining us.

ED ROLLINS, FORMER ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT REAGAN: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Was that apropos.

ROLLINS: It's a wonderful, wonderful exit.

BARTIROMO: What is the relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin from your standpoint?

ROLLINS: We'll find out. I have no idea what it is. He says he's never he's really met him. So, I think the critical thing is what is Tillerson's relationship and that's what he's going to be questioned very seriously on.

BARTIROMO: No surprise, Stephen, that Rex Tillerson has a relationship or a rapport, whatever you want to call it, with the head of Russia. They have oil and he did a gigantic deal in the Black Sea years ago.

STEPHEN SIGMUND, GLOBAL STRATEGY GROUP SR VP: I don't think it's surprising at all. He's the head of ExxonMobil.

BARTIROMO: And he's an oil company. He's going to have a relationship with anybody that has oil.

SIGMUND: Yes, he's going to have relationships with Russia. I mean, what's interesting about the "SNL" skit, what's interesting about them is that he -- you know, they keep sort of goading him and he keeps reacting to it, right? And from my opinion, like that's what he ought to stop doing, now that he's president-elect, he still continuing to campaign. You know what his opinion is about "Saturday Night Live" but now how he's going to suddenly create manufacturing jobs.

BARTIROMO: Yes, we wonder if he's going to keep tweeting once he's the president. It's a little different but on the same side of things -- I mean, this is how he has communicated with the American people, bypassing the media all together and it's worked for him.

TONY SAYEGH, REPUBLICAN POLITICAL ANALYST: He's figured out that traditional media has its limitations in getting his message out. So, he's found other ways to do so and successful I would add. But let's go back to the SNL skit.

Satire aside, the last eight years of the Obama administration has empowered Vladimir Putin more than any comments or tweet that Donald Trump ever uttered and the reality is, we've withdrawn from the world stage, allowed Russia to come into the Middle East, reassert geopolitical dominance for the first time since early 1970s, they're running Syria, they're essentially thrilled that we signed the Iran deal. We retreated from our missile defense as a sign of I think diplomacy but viewed by the Russians as weakness.

And now, you have the Democratic operatives and mainstream media who suggest that it's Donald Trump who is undermining our security and strength in the world because of some perceived coziness of which there's no substantiation with Vladimir Putin other than an "SNL" skit.

BARTIROMO: It's true.

SIGMUND: But that gives even more reason for why Trump should not be reacting to the notion of the Russians hacking our election with, you know, this is all a Democratic plot, right? I mean, he ought to be concerned about it. This is a sovereign nation that's trying to get into our sovereign electoral system, and this is a country that we had beat in a covert war for 50 years. So, he shouldn't be afraid of having buy partisan investigation into why, how and how to make it stop.

BARTIROMO: No, my point was, what happened to the whole eight years that we're coming off of? I mean, the president whispering to Medvedev saying, "I'll have more flexibility when I'm president", and yet all of a sudden now, the Russians are the evil monster. We haven't heard a peep about it in eight years.

ROLLINS: The critical thing is that president-elect needs to quite bragging about the great victory that he just had and basically go in January 20th and be a good president. And the Democrats have got to quite whining about having lost. It's over.

BARTIROMO: That's true. I want to get to this important issue of tomorrow, the Electoral College. Explain to us what's going on tomorrow. Can the election results change in any way tomorrow?

ROLLINS: Absolutely not. There may be one defection on the Republican. Trump won 36 states. He's entitled to those electors. The electors are made up pretty much of party people or campaign people including Bill Clinton. He's a New York elector. I mean, he'll go up to Albany and vote on Monday for his wife.

The bottom line is once they're done, it's just done. You're not going to have 20 or 30 people defecting and even if they did defect for some reason, it goes to the House of Representatives if we don't get 270, and we have a majority of the states.

BARTIROMO: Even if it goes to the House of Representatives, yes, because of the majority.

But some of these electors, Stephen, are getting death threats. The Dems want them to change their vote.

SIGMUND: That's outrageous. The same way it's outrageous when some Trump supporters send vial tweets to Democrats. I mean, you shouldn't do that, right? It's a wrong that happens. I think it's right that, you know, it could change a vote or two maybe, it could go of Donald Trump's historic victory of winning 46 out of 58 in the Electoral College history to maybe 47.

BARTIROMO: Or it will go even higher. Look what happened in Wisconsin. He had more votes than we knew.

SIGMUND: It could be, but it's not going to change the outcome. That doesn't matter.

ROLLINS: Thirty states went for him, 20 states went for her.

SAYEGH: And the truth of the matter is, the American people spoke in such a powerful way in this election, in a way that all the smart people, all the pundits, so many of the polls did not predict. The fact that you now have the liberals, from Hollywood to other operatives inside the Washington progressive triangle really trying to even suggest that the Electoral College should revisit, it's mandate to vote for who their states voted for just shows the kind of desperation. It's really a chapter that has to end.

SIGMUND: I hear you, but to be fair, like if a situation were reverse and Donald Trump had lost the Electoral College but won the national vote by almost 3 million, Republicans would be trying to do the same thing.

SAYEGH: There's no evidence of it.

SIGMUND: There's no evidence of it because it didn't happen.

BARTIROMO: Hold that though.

SIGMUND: Where you stand depends on where you sit.

BARTIROMO: We'll take a short break and move back with the panel right after this. Be back in a minute.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OBAMA: I don't think she was treated fairly during the election. The coverage of her and the issues was troubling.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BARTIROMO: President Obama criticizing the coverage of Hillary Clinton during the election. We're back with our panel.

And, Tony Sayegh, you have some issues with that.

SAYEGH: Well, listen, with all due respect to the president, he is giving an opinion that is devoid of any facts. In fact, it's contradicted by the evidence. An analysis was done at the end of the campaign, particularly on the coverage by the major networks, CNN, NBC, and CBS over the "Access Hollywood" tape about Donald Trump. Each of those networks dedicated eight, seven, and five minutes of broadcast coverage per 30 seconds they dedicated to the WikiLeaks scandal that involved Hillary Clinton.

BARTIROMO: Wow.

SAYEGH: When you look at WikiLeaks, from The New York Times to The Washington Post, to NBC, to CNBC, to "The Boston Globe," collusion, direct collusion between these media, objective media organizations and the Clinton campaign.

So, with all due respect to the president, I think he's completely wrong on this one and it really suggests that he's devoid from reality of what happened to the reality.

BARTIROMO: Not only that, but the media didn't create her issues, Steve. I mean, the e-mail scandal and the Clinton Foundation.

SIGMUND: It didn't create his issues either. But, look, there was tough media coverage on both sides. I mean, the notion that they didn't cover "WikiLeaks" when it was in the paper every day in October.

BARTIROMO: But they cover that Trump --

SAYEGH: The scale, the scale of coverage.

SIGMUND: They covered the "Access Hollywood" tape more, that's true, at least in a concentrated time. Look, the reality is the media covered both sides. She lost the last news cycle. But it is hard to say, you know, the candidate who had deeper on policy had an easier time in the media when they were, you know, covering empty podiums and press conferences about stakes.

ROLLINS: The policy was not relevant in this campaign. This campaign was about change. He was a candidate of change.

And I think the most important thing we look forward to is his Cabinet. He basically now has five members of Congress, a senator, four House members that are sort of the people who know most about government, along with Elaine Chao and the secretary of labor and undersecretary. Everybody else is kind of rookie. So, it's going to be -- plus the generals. So, it's going to be interesting to watch this Cabinet.

BARTIROMO: And also interesting to see all these business people. This is going to be an experiment because the left has been telling us that, you know, trumped up trickle-down economics do not work. We'll see if it actually works.

ROLLINS: Very conservative.

SIGMUND: Goldman Sachs economics works.

SAYEGH: The average Obama appointee has 17 years of academic or government experience. The average Trump appointee thus far has only 6.8 years of government experience. This is a drain the swamp election. You see that reflected in this election.

BARTIROMO: Wow. You got all the stats this morning.

Tony Sayegh, Stephen Sigmund, Ed Rollins, always a pleasure, gentlemen. Thank you so much. Have a great Sunday morning.

And that will do it for us, "Sunday Morning Futures". I'm Maria Bartiromo. I'll see you tomorrow morning on the Fox News Network. Join me then, 6:00 a.m., "Mornings with Maria".

First, though, "MediaBuzz" right now with Howie Kurtz.

Continue Reading Below

According to IBISWorld Industry data, the overall lingerie market only grew 1.9% from 2011 to 2016. However, the online sector has grown from 5% of market share in 2008, to nearly 15% in 2016, with estimates saying it could grow to 25% by 2022.

Morgan Hermand-Waiche, founder & CEO of Adore Me, a New York-based start-up specializing in e-commerce lingerie, says his company has seen some of that growth first-hand since the company launched in 2012 out of his Harvard dorm room.

“I started Adore Me still as a student, my Harvard Business School professors were my first investors,” Hermand-Waiche tells FOX Business. “Since its inception, [we] have experienced exponential growth. In 2012, our revenues were $1.1 million; in 2013, they grew to $5.6 million; by 2014, we were grossing $16 million; and in 2015, we raked in $42.6 million. We kept a very similar growth rate in 2016, but we can’t reveal revenue figures for 2016 yet.”

Hermand-Waiche says the company is also on track to break a new sales record this Valentine’s Day, as January 2017 was its biggest sales month to date, leading up to the hallmark holiday of love.

"Valentine's day has been crazy. The volume of sales have picked up three to five times on a daily basis compared to a few weeks ago," he adds.

While those numbers may seem small in comparison to Victoria’s Secret and parent company L Brands annual sales of $12.57 billion in 2016, Adore Me was ranked No. 9 on Crain’s Fast 50 in 2016 -- as well as being ranked No. 2 as the fastest-growing private retail company on Inc.’s 500 list in 2015.

Meanwhile, another startup called Negative Underwear, which college friends Lauren Schwab and Marissa Vosper launched in 2014 while attending the University of Pennsylvania, is positioning itself as the “anti-Victoria’s Secret” brand.

The company’s motto is “Less fake—more real,” and “In a world of pushed up and overdone, we’re intentionally not.”

“We offer a luxury quality product at a more accessible price, an aesthetic that aligns with the ‘less is more’ mantra, a brand ethos and voice that resonates with the contemporary female and high-touch customer service experience to help guide the customer to finding product she loves,” Lauren Schwab, co-founder of Negative Underwear, tells FOX Business.

Like Adore Me, Schwab says Negative Underwear is committed to an e-commerce strategy that offers customers the highest-quality product at the best price.

“I believe that women have had enough with the ‘Mean Girls’ attitude of certain brands, making them feel bad about their bodies,” Hermand-Waiche adds.

At the same time, both Negative Underwear and Adore Me say they still believe in having a presence on Main Street.

“We recognize that buying a well-fitting bra online is hard. Offline opportunities have been important to the growth of our business because they allow our customers to feel and try the product in person and experience the brand on a much personal level,” Schwab says.

Adore Me also recently recognized the same, opening its first brick-and-mortar pop-up store last February in Manhattan. Hermand-Waiche says since the company has expanded its line to big box retailers such as Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor and Hudson’s Bay.

“We still take pride in our online DNA. In addition to our website, we have a state-of-the-art mobile app, and over 70% of our traffic comes in from mobile. This has made us a go-to for the millennial shopper, and indeed, over 75% of our customers are millennials,” says Hermand-Waiche.In prehistoric times, home life revolved around fire pits.

Expected to be announced by the end of March, the next-gen Samsung Galaxy S8 models will sport bigger displays than current models -- 5.8 inches and 6.2 inches respectively, according to recent reports, most notably in the Guardian and Venture Beat.

Samsung, for the first time, may also standardize on curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) “dual-edge” displays. To date, the mainstream Galaxy models have not had a curved display. For example, the Galaxy S7 (5.1 inches) does not have a curved display, while the pricier S7 Edge (5.5 inches) does. A display with curved edges provides more display area without increasing the overall size of the phone.

One neat trick that Samsung is expected to pull off with the S8 is covering the front of the phone with more display area by shrinking the bezels, or display borders, on the top and bottom of the phone, as affiliate Samsung Display has hinted at in recent videos. Samsung is also expected to adjust the aspect ratio (the ratio of the width to the height of the screen) of the display. Both of these developments will allow Samsung to minimize an increase in the overall size of the phone.

APPLE'S IPHONE 'X' MIGHT COST AS MUCH AS A MACBOOK

Other highlights, as pointed out by Evan Blass at Venture Beat, are new processors that boost overall performance by 11 percent while also being more energy efficient.

“That improved power consumption will be critical, because despite the vastly increased display sizes, battery capacity is said to be a relatively conservative…for the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch designs, respectively,” Blass wrote.

And a rumored standard feature that will undoubtedly please consumers is the 64GB of baseline storage – up from 32GB on the Galaxy S7. The option for an additional 256GB microSD card will remain.

Other reported specs include a USB-C port for charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack (which Apple dropped on the iPhone 7), a 12-megapixel rear camera and front-facing 8-megapixel selfie camera.

WHAT TO EXPECT WITH APPLE'S 2017 IPHONE 'X'

Samsung is also rumored to ditch the physical home button in favor of software buttons. And the fingerprint sensor will be on the back of the phone. Note that neither of these latter rumored changes would be groundbreaking. The Google Pixel, for example, has no physical home button and has the fingerprint sensor on the back.

And the price? Blass expects both models to be pricier than the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Possibly $100 more. Both are expected to go on sale April 21.

OLED iPhone 8/X will follow Galaxy S8

Samsung and Apple are locked in a tight market share battle. This week market researcher Gartner said Apple shipped more phones in the fourth quarter than Samsung, the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014.

And reports about the Galaxy S8 are vying with a flurry of new reports about Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 (or iPhone X as some on Wall Street are calling it), due later this year.

APPLE WATCH SALES SPIKED OVER THE HOLIDAY: SMARTWATCHES ARE HERE TO STAY

MacRumors cited an analyst report this week that said the OLED iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display “with 5.15 inches of usable screen space.” While the iPhone 8’s display is expected to take up the entire front of the phone, a portion of that space will be devoted to “virtual buttons.”

The overall physical size of the phone is said to be similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, which would allow for easier one-handed operation.

“Such a size is possible with a 5.8-inch [display] panel because there will be no extra space outside of the display,” MacRumors said, referring to the elimination of bezels.

Apple is also expected to increase battery capacity -- without increasing the size of the phone -- by adopting an advanced stacked circuit board.

Samsung and Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.Kentucky residents may want to avoid opening their own stock of Pappy Van Winkle bottles because the bar down the road might pay big bucks for it.

On Wednesday, a Kentucky House Committee cleared legislation that would give restaurants and bars the right to purchase unopened, privately-owned bottles of rare liquor.

It’s an attractive proposition for restaurateurs and bar owners because under the new law, they would be getting their hands on something current liquor distributors may not be able to provide. It would also allow them to bolster their menus with brand-new cocktails featuring the vintage liquors, a growing trend across the country.

Liquor collectors, too, would be allowed to sell their spirits directly to drinking and eating establishments, rather than resorting to online sales or the black market.

On Wednesday, Eric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers’ Association, said he believes there are more vintage bourbons in Kentuckians’ liquor cabinets than “anyplace else in the world."

"It just stands to reason, because we are the birthplace of bourbon and we have been producing the great majority of the world's bourbon for now over 200 years,” adds Gregory.

Proponents also believe tourism would flourish if bars were allowed to buy up all that bourbon and serve it.

However, selling liquor without a license is still illegal in Kentucky, and if the proposed legislature passes, it will only apply to the state.

Even the online sale of liquor between collectors is illegal. Over the past two years, at least two Pennsylvania residents have been busted for trying to sell whiskey on Craigslist. Both Bob Monk and Wade Collingsworth were charged with misdemeanors after making arrangements to sell bottles of Pappy Van Winkle bourbon in separate incidents in Dec. 2015 and Dec. 2016, respectively.

Kentucky's bill, known as House Bill 100, cleared the House Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations Committee unopposed.

Last year, the Kentucky Distillers' Association reported that its member distilleries added over $1 billion to the state's economy.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.A stray black hole may be responsible for turning a gas cloud into a speeding cosmic bullet trillions of miles long.

The wandering black hole was discovered lurking just outside a supernova remnant, a shell of expelled material left behind after a massive star explodes. Using the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in Chile and the 45-meter Radio Telescope at Nobeyama Radio Observatory, astronomers found that the black hole had been previously hidden by a compact gas cloud emerging from the remnant.

The cloud itself has now been named "the Bullet," because of its long, cone shape and its incredible speed — part of the cloud is moving away from the supernova remnant at more than 60 miles per second, "which exceeds the speed of sound in interstellar space by more than two orders of magnitude," Nobeyama Radio Observatory scientists said in the statement. The researchers now suspect that the black hole might have played a role in forming the gaseous "bullet." [The Strangest Black Holes in the Universe]

The supernova remnant, called W44, is located 10,000 light-years from Earth. The Bullet, which is about 2 light-years long [11.76 trillion miles], is so energetic that it moves backward against the rotation of the Milky Way galaxy, according to the Nobeyama Radio Observatory statement.

"Most of the Bullet has an expanding motion with a speed of 50 km/s [31 miles per second], but the tip of the Bullet has a speed of 120 km/s [75 miles per second]," Masaya Yamada, lead author of the new study and a graduate student at Keio University in Japan, said in the statement . "Its kinetic energy is a few tens of times larger than that injected by the W44 supernova. It seems impossible to generate such an energetic cloud under ordinary environments."

So what could possibly send such a huge amount of molecular gas streaming out of the supernova remnant at such high speeds? The discovery of the hidden black hole may offer an explanation.

The researchers developed two possible scenarios for how the Bullet might have formed. The first, called the explosion model, suggests that the cloud passed by a static black hole and was pulled in by the black hole's strong gravitational forces. This could have created a powerful explosion of gas that was spit back out into space, Nobeyama scientists said.

Another theory, called the irruption model, proposes that a high-speed black hole tore through the dense molecular cloud, and the black hole's powerful gravitational pull left a stream of gas in its wake. Further research is required to determine which model best explains the origin of the Bullet, according to the study, published Dec. 29, 2016, in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Although millions of black holes are thought to exist in the Milky Way, it is often difficult to locate them because they are completely black. However, this study has revealed a new way for astronomers to detect these types of elusive, stray black holes — by their influence on molecular gas clouds — that would otherwise float alone in space and remain unnoticed with no observable emissions, the scientists said in the statement.

Original article on Space.com .Death is more like the slow shutdown of a computer than the flipping off of a light switch, says a scientist, explaining a new study that shows genes in the body remain alive for about two days after the heart stops.

In the study of mice and zebrafish, University of Washington researchers found that gene activity generally decreased after death, as would be expected, per New Scientist.

But 548 zebrafish genes and 515 mouse genes showed peak levels of messenger RNA—which genes use to communicate with cells—up to 48 hours after death in what researchers termed the "twilight of death." In other words, "not all cells are 'dead' when an organism dies," study author Peter Noble tells Seeker.

He believes the same thing occurs in humans, too. The activated genes were associated with fetal development, stress, immunity, inflammation, and cancer, says Noble, who suggests the cells may be "attempting to repair themselves" just as if the body were alive.

It's also possible that they're activated simply because the genes that normally suppress them do turn off after death. Researchers note that a similar activation of cancer genes may explain why organ transplant recipients are more prone to get cancer, though more research is needed to determine possible strategies to rectify this, per a release.

Researchers say a measurement of mRNA in the body after death may also result in more precise times of death, possibly down to the minute. (Scientists are working to reverse death.)

This article originally appeared on Newser: 2 Days After Death, Some Life Continues in BodyIn the face of growing workplace automation, a number of commentators have painted a grim future for American workers. But most human capital leaders see a much brighter future— one where automation helps revitalize U.S. manufacturing and increases the demand for skilled workers.

According to global talent management firm Randstad Sourceright’s survey of over 400 corporate HR leaders, automation and robotics are likely to have a positive impact on U.S. business growth in 2017, and will be one of the driving forces behind new hiring trends over the next several years.

Regardless of how you feel about robots, the move toward automation and artificial intelligence cannot be stopped. About 15 percent of global HR leaders say that robotics completely transformed their businesses in 2016, and more than double (31%) expect automation to have an even greater influence in 2017.

Rather than feeling threatened by this new technology, nearly two-thirds (65%) of the HR leaders we spoke with said they see artificial intelligence and robotics having a positive impact on their businesses over the next three to five years. Across all the major industry sectors surveyed, respondents were optimistic about technology’s ability to reduce costs, improve quality and increase output.

It is easy to assume that these productivity gains are made at the expense of workers. In reality, this technology actually has increased demand for flexible, mobile workers with skills and agility that machines are not even close to matching. While 26 percent of those surveyed said their businesses increased the use of automation and robotics in 2016, over 34 percent said they hired extensively over the same period just to keep up with company growth.

In fact, the HR leaders we surveyed indicated that a scarcity of skilled workers was driving employment demands in certain areas—like marketing, sales and IT/technical—where robotics will likely never displace the advantage of human intelligence. Indeed, well over one-third of respondents anticipate hiring more workers in these areas over the next year.

But workers with the right combination of skills and experience are hard to come by. Many workers are structuring their work hours in ways that allow them to work many different jobs, across several geographical locations. As a result, more companies are rethinking their talent management to account for more short-term, offsite workers. Of the HR leaders we surveyed, more than two-thirds (66%) said they are considering moving toward a talent management model that would more easily integrate contingent workers. They see the shift toward flexible talent as a sound strategy that can help companies access a larger pool of talent, such as parents with young children and retirees who may not want a traditional 9-to-5 job.

For some commentators, the investment in automation and contingent employees signals an upheaval in the economy that will not benefit American workers. But that perspective may be short-sited. In fact, automation and robotics can make U.S. manufacturing more cost-competitive, while increasing the number of high-paying, skilled jobs available for humans. Instead of 50 foreign workers being paid rock bottom wages to complete a job by hand, the same job will be accomplished by one skilled U.S. worker running a robot and earning a middle-class salary. This combination of increased automation and a more mobile, contingent workforce can reduce manufacturing costs and make it easier for companies to build their factories in the U.S. The end result is a better educated, higher paid American workforce.

Change can be difficult. We are witnessing a major shift in the way business does business. But most HR leaders see technology as providing workers with new opportunities (and also with new priorities). These recent changes in workforce management need not be seen as the catastrophe some suggest. If Randstad Sourceright’s 2017 Talent Trends Report is any indication, robots are far more likely to benefit American workers than replace them.

Scientists at Northumbria University used motion-capture technology to record the movements of young women dancing to a drum beat.

Their movement patterns were then rendered as 39 computer avatars - removing all their physical features - before 200 people watched 15-second clips and rated their dance moves.

IT AIN’T GOT THAT SWING: PUTIN'S UNUSUAL WALK SHAPED BY KGB

The study, published in the Scientific Reports journal, identified that those getting higher scores for their dancing exhibited three types of movement when they strutted their stuff - greater hip swing, more asymmetric movements of the thighs and intermediate levels of arm movement.

Report author Dr Nick Neave, associate professor of psychology at the university, said dance moves have two functions for women.

He told The New York Times: "One is, they're showing off their reproductive quality, perhaps their hormonal status, to males.

SCIENTISTS HAVE A THEORY ON WHY YOU BREAK EYE CONTACT

"Another is, they're showing off how good they are to female rivals.

"When you look at males and females walking, the key difference is, males have this shoulder swing and females have this hip swing."

He added that asymmetric limb movements could also signal good motor control.A fourth suspect was arrested in connection to the North Korean leader’s half-brother, Malaysian police announced Saturday.

A man was arrested with an ID card that identified him as 46-year-old Ri Jong Chol. He was picked up Friday night.

Authorities were still trying to piece together details of the case.

Officials performed a second autopsy on Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, because the first procedure was considered inconclusive, an official said on Saturday.

North Korea has vowed to reject the results of any post-mortem and demanded that Malaysia turn over the body immediately.

Pyongyang's ambassador said on Friday, while speaking to reporters that Malaysian officials may be "trying to conceal something" and "colluding with hostile forces."

Kim Jong Nam suddenly fell ill at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday as he waited for a flight home to Macau. He told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. He died on the way to the hospital.

South Korea has accused its enemies in North Korea of dispatching a hit squad to kill Kim Jong Nam at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, saying two female assassins poisoned him and then fled in a taxi.

On Friday, Indonesia's police chief said the Indonesian woman arrested for suspected involvement in the killing was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.

The Indonesia police chief cited information received from Malaysian authorities, saying that Siti Aisyah, 25, was paid to be involved in "Just For Laughs" style pranks, a reference to a popular hidden camera show. The official said she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," the police chief said. "She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents."

Malaysian police were questioning four suspects — Aisyah, another woman who carried a Vietnamese passport; a man they said is Aisyah's boyfriend; and the North Korean man.

North Korea broke its silence on the case Friday night. Speaking to reporters gathered outside the morgue in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, North Korean Ambassador Kang Chol said Malaysia conducted the autopsy on Kim Jong Nam "unilaterally and excluding our attendance."

Kang said the fact that Malaysia has yet to hand over the body "strongly suggests that the Malaysian side is trying to conceal something which needs more time and deceive us, and that they are colluding with the hostile forces towards us who are desperate to harm us."

Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger half-brother, the North Korean leader. He reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.The early weeks of the Trump administration have widened divides between liberal and conservative Jews, setting off quarrels over anti-Semitism, Israel and the Holocaust.

Well before the 2016 election, discussion over Israel had become so barbed among Jews that Jewish groups began organizing civility training so relationships and holidays wouldn't be ruined. But those disputes have erupted with a new intensity since Donald Trump won the presidency.

They were on display most prominently this week, during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's first visit to the Trump White House and a pair of news conferences during which the president would not directly address questions about anti-Semitism. On Thursday, in one of the most remarkable moments of a riotous back-and-forth with reporters, Trump shut down a Hasidic reporter from an Orthodox magazine who had taken pains to preface his question by saying he knew Trump wasn't anti-Jewish.

Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights group that has been highly critical of Trump, called the president's response "mind-boggling."

THE YEAR IN PICTURES

But Mort Klein, president of the hawkish Zionist Organization of America, who has championed Trump as a great ally of Israel, said Trump must have been frustrated by the "relentless and outrageous allegations" of anti-Semitism against him and his White House strategist Steve Bannon. "If there was a hint of anti-Semitism, I would be at their throat," Klein said.

American Jews have been especially on edge because of a surge of anti-Semitic harassment over the course of the presidential campaign and continuing this year. Last month, Jewish community centers and other institutions in 27 states and Canada received what is being investigated as a coordinated series of telephone bomb threats over a period of days, according to the Secure Community Network, formed by Jewish organizations to protect their institutions.

Many Jewish groups and others had seen animus in the White House statement last month on International Holocaust Remembrance Day that did not mention Jews. The president's aides defended the statement as "inclusive" of all who were killed by the Nazis.

TRUMP TOUTS PROSPECT FOR 'GREAT' MIDEAST PEACE DEAL, PRODS NETANYAHU ON SETTLEMENTS

At a news conference with Netanyahu last Wednesday, Trump opened by calling Israel a symbol of "survival in the face of genocide." But when an Israeli reporter asked Trump about the rise in anti-Semitic harassment during the campaign and since his election, he responded by touting his Electoral College total and promising "peace in this country." Netanyahu then took up the question, saying he had known the president, his family and some of his aides for many years and "there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest."

The response rankled some American Jews. Alana Newhouse, editor-in-chief of Tablet, the online Jewish magazine, addressed the prime minister: "I won't tell you what to be afraid of in your country, and you don't tell me what I should fear in mine."

The next day, a confirmation hearing was held for David Friedman, the combative attorney Trump chose as U.S. envoy to Israel. Friedman, who has deep ties to the Israeli settler movement, had said the Anti-Defamation League sounded like "morons" for accusing Trump of anti-Semitism, and he had called supporters of the dovish pro-Israel lobby J Street "worse than kapos," a reference to Jews who helped the Nazis imprison fellow Jews during the Holocaust.

At the hearing, Friedman apologized for using inflammatory language in the past, and said he regretted not expressing his views of J Street in a more respectful manner. Greenblatt said he had spoken with Friedman about his remarks regarding the ADL and had accepted his apology.

Rabbi Rick Jacobs, head of the liberal Union for Reform Judaism, the largest American Jewish movement, said he met for 90 minutes with Friedman at the nominee's request, "He simply wanted to have a conversation directly," Jacobs said in a phone interview. "He knows how offensive it was."

On Friday, Reform Jewish leaders announced they opposed Friedman's nomination, the first time the movement had ever opposed a president's choice for the position. The ZOA's Klein, meanwhile, said Friedman has "the potential to be the greatest U.S. ambassador to Israel ever."

Jewish issues came to the fore again in a remarkable way during Trump's question-and-answer session on Thursday.

The reporter from the Brooklyn-based Orthodox Ami Magazine, Jake Turx, sporting curly sidelocks and a skullcap embroidered with his Twitter handle, rose to ask his question. While Hillary Clinton won 71 percent of the Jewish vote, Orthodox Jews who backed Trump have taken comfort in his support for Israel, his many Jewish friends and advisers, and especially his Orthodox Jewish daughter, Ivanka, who converted, and her husband and close presidential aide Jared Kushner. Turx opened his question to Trump by noting the president was a "zayde" — which is Yiddish for grandfather — then started to ask about the increased reports of anti-Jewish harassment and hate crimes.

But Trump quickly interrupted, saying "not a fair question," and when Turx tried to continue, said "quiet, quiet, quiet ... I find it repulsive. I hate even the question."

The internal Jewish debate will likely rage on in the coming weeks as Trump's policies on Israel, refugees and immigration take shape.

At Friedman's hearing, three young Jews who belong to the activist group IfNotNow, which opposes Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, stood up to interrupt the proceedings. They shook groggers, or noisemakers, used on the holiday of Purim to drown out the names of enemies of the Jewish people.A very simple thought occurred to me while I was scanning my own merchandise and swiping my own credit card while checking out at a Home Depot in Massachusetts this past weekend: Why does everyone seem to be okay with this?

There was no human being getting paid to ring up and bag my merchandise. Nor was there a worker at several other checkout lines. And no one was raising any red flags about the fact that machines had obviously put people out of work.

I had a similar experience at a CVS recently.

Why does our culture seem to applaud every technological advance uncritically, without considering its impact on the employment of human beings? Sure, it will be cool and convenient when Amazon starts delivering packages by drone, within 30 minutes, but it will also put many delivery personnel and, perhaps, postal workers out of work.

I have the same nagging question about self-driving vehicles, which everyone seems to be waiting for with bated breath. How many jobs will remain for taxi drivers and Uber drivers and traffic cops?

There now are “dark factories” that manufacture products without needing people to put them together or package them. The factories can run without lights, because no human being is inside.

Why does our culture seem to applaud every technological advance uncritically, without considering its impact on the employment of human beings.

Sure, people are employed to create the technology and build the machines and factories that operate automatically to churn out product. But whole buildings will soon be snap-together affairs created largely through 3-D printing. And there are lots of folks in America who aren’t trained or can’t be trained to participate in designing and implementing new technologies of that order. Millions are tradesmen and craftsmen and service people.

They are among President Trump’s “forgotten people.”

Silicon Valley inventors and entrepreneurs are very quick not only to defend their version of human rights, but also to make a buck without regard to whether their products erode human self-worth, autonomy and the ability to make a living.

It would seem wise for companies like Home Depot and CVS and Amazon to consider the impact of mechanization on their workers, not just their bottom lines. And because companies may be too self-serving in that regard, it might be wise for consumers to mount some opposition to the ones that decide machines are better at doing jobs than people are.

There are lots of folks who won’t buy meat because they decry the slaughter of animals. There are lots of folks who won’t buy from companies because their politics aren’t aligned. Why aren’t more people unwilling to buy from companies that are racing to deploy machines that put them out of work?

I think it’s because technology is inherently fascinating. It has the pull of an addictive drug on the psyches of human beings. We want more and more and more of it, without thinking very much about whether we are improved by it.

We humans don’t want to turn out to have been “too clever by half,” inventing things that ultimately dispirit and defeat us.

The government would be wise to engage in a new and comprehensive actuarial (and psychological) assessment of the impact of mechanization on every sector of the workforce, to determine whether rampant unemployment is likely.

Here’s a potential Trump tweet:

Dr. Keith Ablow is a psychiatrist and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team.U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is being guarded by the agents from the U.S. Marshals Service after a bruising nomination process, Politico reported.

Drew J. Wade, a spokesman for the service, told the magazine that he is not aware of these agents guarding an education secretary in the past. The education secretary is traditionally guarded by a small security unit from the education department, the report said.

The report said that few other details are available about the security arrangement.

Despite her win, DeVos emerged bruised from her highly divisive nomination fight. Opposed by half the Senate, she faced criticism, even ridicule for lack of experience. At one point, she said some schools should have guns because of the threat of grizzly bears.

And there has been scathing opposition from teachers unions and civil rights activists over her support of charter schools and her conservative religious ideology.

President Trump accused Democrats of seeking to torpedo education progress. In a tweet before the vote, he wrote, "Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!" Pence tweeted later in the day that supporting DeVos was "a vote for every child having a chance at a world-class education."

In a separate development, DeVos announced Friday that a government website devoted to students with disabilities, which had been down for more than a week, has been restored and will be updated with input from interested parties. She also accused the previous administration of neglecting the website. The American Federation of Teachers disputed that contention.

Bakir Izetbegovic, Muslim Bosniak member of the county's tripartite presidency, announced Friday that Bosnia will ask the U.N. Court of Justice to reconsider its 2007 ruling that cleared Serbia of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war.

Kevin Wellons, of Warner Robins, Ga., was traveling aboard the Carnival Elation, which set out Saturday from Jacksonville, Fla., for a five-day cruise to the Bahamas.

On Monday, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Wellons’ wife reported him missing, telling cruise officials that she had last seen him around 2:30 a.m.

“A full search of the vessel and subsequent review of camera footage indicates the individual went overboard at approximately 2.45 am on February 13,” a Carnival Cruise Line spokeswoman explained in an emailed statement to Fox News.

WFTV reported that Wellons fell from the Elation’s 11th deck.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," Karnavian said.

Karnavian added that Aisyah “was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents.”

The police chief’s comments come after a relative of Aisyah said in an Indonesian television interview that the suspect had been hired to perform in a comedy movie that had her traveling to China.

Indonesian immigration officials have said Aisyah traveled to Malaysia and other countries, but they did not get into specifics.

Kim Jong Nam, elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, died Monday after falling ill at the airport in Kuala Lumpur.

South Korea has accused its enemies in North Korea of dispatching a hit squad to kill Kim Jong Nam, saying two female assassins poisoned him before escaping in a taxi.

The second woman who was arrested carried a Vietnamese passport, according to police, who also arrested Aisyah’s boyfriend.

Authorities are waiting for autopsy results that could shed light on why Kim Jong Nam suddenly fell ill while waiting for a flight home to Macau.

AS INVESTIGATION SWIRLS, BODY OF KIM JONG UN'S HALF-BROTHER IS UNCLAIMED

Dizzy and in pain, he told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. Within two hours, Malaysian officials said, he was dead.

Kim Jong Nam, who was 45 or 46, had lived in exile for years and was estranged from his younger half-brother. He reportedly fell out of favor with the North Korean regime in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

Although Kim Jong Nam was believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau, police in Malaysia say nobody has come forward to claim the body or provide DNA samples in the aftermath of what appeared to be an assassination.

North Korean diplomats in Malaysia have requested custody of Kim Jong Nam's body, arguing that he had a North Korean passport. The officials objected to an autopsy, but Malaysian authorities went ahead with the procedure anyway because they did not receive a formal complaint.

DID A SOUTH KOREAN NEWS REPORT DOOM KIM JONG UN'S BROTHER?

Investigators were still trying to piece together details of the case, and South Korea has not said how it concluded that North Korea was behind the killing.

In Indonesia, Aisyah's family and former neighbors said they were stunned by her arrest, describing her as a polite and quiet young mother.

From 2008 to 2011 she and her then-husband lived in a home with flaking red paint in a narrow alley of Tambora, a densely populated neighborhood in western Jakarta.

Her former father-in-law, Tjia Liang Kiong, who lives in a nearby middle-class neighborhood and last saw Aisyah on Jan. 28, described her as respectful.

"I was shocked to hear that she was arrested for murdering someone," he said. "I don't believe that she would commit such a crime or what the media says — that she is an intelligence agent."

Aisyah's mother, Benah, said by telephone that the family comes from a humble village background and has no ability to help her.

"Since we heard that from the television, I could not sleep and eat. Same as her father, he just prays and reads the holy Quran. He even does not want to speak," said Benah. "As villagers, we could only pray."

According to Kiong, Aisyah only completed junior high school and moved to Malaysia with her husband in 2011 to seek a better life after the garment-making shop they ran from their home went out of business. The couple left their nearly 2-year-old son in Jakarta under the care of Kiong and his wife.

She and her husband divorced in 2012.

Malaysia, which is approaching developed-nation income levels, is a magnet for millions of Indonesians, who typically find work there as bar hostesses, maids and construction and plantation workers.

Malaysia said Friday it wants DNA samples from Kim Jong Nam's family as part of the post-mortem procedure and that officials were not yet willing to hand the body over to the North Koreans.

"If there is no claim by next-of-kin and upon exhausting all avenues (to obtain DNA), we will finally then hand over the body to the (North Korean) embassy," said Abdul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official.

He would not speculate on how long that process might take.

The three suspects were arrested separately on Wednesday and Thursday.

The women were identified using surveillance videos from the airport, police said. Early Friday, police took the pair back to the crime scene at the budget terminal "for further investigations," Abdul Samah said. Local media reported that police wanted to recreate the crime scene to establish new leads.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.A powerful Pacific storm blew into Southern and Central California on Friday with wind-driven heavy rains that downed power lines and electrocuted a man, killed a motorist in a submerged car and disrupted hundreds of flights at airports.

With the storm feeding on an atmospheric river of moisture stretching far out into the Pacific, precautionary evacuations of homes in some neighborhoods were requested due to the potential for mudslides and debris flows.

More than 300 arriving and departing flights were delayed or canceled at Los Angeles International Airport.

In the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, a falling tree downed power lines and hit a car. A 55-year-old man was electrocuted and pronounced dead at a hospital, police and fire officials said.

Winds gusting to 60 mph or more lashed the area. Heavy rains turned creeks and rivers into brown torrents and released slews of mud from hillsides burned barren by wildfires. Several stretches of freeways and highways were closed by flooding.

"It's crazy," said Robin Johnson, an academic adviser at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "It's just pouring down rain. The wind is just going nuts."

"At one point the wind was so strong I'm surprised it didn't blow my windows out," retiree Phoenix Hocking said in a Facebook message from Carpinteria. "I now have a pond in my patio. And my dog is starting to grow flippers so he can go out and do his business."

In the desert town of Victorville, several cars were washed down a flooded street. A helicopter rescued one person from the roof of a car but another motorist was found dead in a submerged vehicle, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said.

Elsewhere in the county, a 20-mile stretch of State Route 138 in the West Cajon Valley was closed at the scene of a summer wildfire.

Mud sloshed over concrete rail barriers and about two dozen vehicles, including big-rigs and a school bus, were either mired in mud or became unable to turn around on the closed road and some were abandoned, Sherwin said.

Two people in a car were rescued and four students on the bus were removed and taken to a school office, he said.

Another road in the area was covered with 2 feet of mud.

In LA's Sun Valley, 10 cars were trapped in swift-moving water on a roadway and eight people had to be rescued, the Fire Department reported.

Using ropes and inflatable boats, firefighters rescued seven people and two dogs from the Sepulveda basin, a recreation and flood-control area along the Los Angeles River. One person was taken to a hospital with a non-life threatening injury.

The storm took aim at Southern California but also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco. It was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.

The National Weather Service said it could end up being the strongest storm to hit Southern California since January 1995.

Rain and wind wiped out play in golf's Genesis Open at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where a eucalyptus tree cracked.

Hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines had toppled in the Los Angeles area and at one point more than 60,000 city power customers were without electricity.

A 75-foot tree fell onto an apartment building near the University of California, Los Angeles, narrowly missing someone who was in bed, fire officials said. Four of the six apartments have been declared unsafe to enter, prompting the evacuation of 16 college students.

"I was just sitting in bed trying to enjoy a Friday morning of no class," one resident told KCAL-TV. "I had a giant, like, thunder popping sound and then next thing I knew a branch was coming through the ceiling."

Her leg was scratched by debris and "I was covered in sawdust," she said.

Her thought now was, "Where am I going to live?"

Another tree smashed a carport and vehicles in the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta.

Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Orange County closed because the weather. High surf pounded beaches.

By evening, Ventura County and northern Los Angeles County had seen 24-hour rain totals of up to 7 ½ inches, with the San Marcos mountain pass in Santa Barbara County receiving nearly 8 ½ inches.

Farther south, downtown Los Angeles had received about 1 ½ inches of rain while some areas saw up to 4 inches.

The storm system was moving "very slowly" eastward and Los Angeles County was expected to see more rain through Saturday, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.

The city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles, ordered evacuation of 180 homes below a burn scar. Up the coast, evacuations were urged for parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County and around an 11½-square-mile burn scar west of Santa Barbara.

Santa Anita Park near Pasadena canceled all its horse races Friday.

In Northern California, officials monitoring the stricken Oroville Dam on the Feather River said they were confident the reservoir would handle any runoff from expected storms because ongoing releases have been lowering the lake's level since its spillways were damaged last week.

It was the most extraordinary news conference ever held by a president of the United States.

It was also the harshest indictment of the media ever delivered from the White House.

And it was riveting. You could not turn away. Trump unplugged.

And it was, like all things Trump, a Rorschach test. Those who support this president thought it was a brilliant takedown of a corrupt media. Those who oppose this president thought he seemed somewhat crazed—unhinged, as CNN anchor Jake Tapper put it.

Trump scored some points, as he always does, by denouncing fake news. And he was over the top at times. He even said, jokingly, that today’s headlines would be about him “ranting and raving”—but that actually, the administration, rather than being chaotic, is running like a “fine-tuned machine.” Okay, maybe a bit of hyperbole there.

The president is justified in complaining about an unprecedented flood of illegal leaks that are clearly aimed at damaging him. But that doesn’t mean the information is wrong. The Washington Post was accurate, based on unnamed sources, in reporting that Michael Flynn not leveling with the vice president about his past contacts with the Russian ambassador. That’s why, despite his argument that the press treated Flynn unfairly, Trump fired him.

The president is also right that the tone of his coverage has been unrelentingly negative.

But when the president criticized yesterday’s Wall Street Journal report that some spies are withholding sensitive intelligence from him, he said the paper never called him, as if you can just ring him up in the Oval Office. The story’s fourth paragraph quoted a White House official as denying the allegations. Trump also said a New York Times piece on earlier contacts with Russia by aides and associates was “discredited.” The jury is out on that, and there is, as the Times said, an FBI investigation.

Trump really went off on CNN’s Don Lemon, although not by name, saying his nightly show is stacked with anti-Trump panels. Whether that’s true or not, it feels like a small argument for the president to make.

What was most revealing, in regard to CNN and the media more generally, was Trump saying some journalists have “hatred” for him. He told me that in campaign interviews, but now he’s the commander-in-chief. So he has deep-seated grievances about the way he’s been covered since 2015.

Of course, Trump can get even – and get better press – by accomplishing some of the big-ticket items on his agenda. And that would be real news, not fake.

Call it the Oval Office virus. After less than a month in office, President Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate embraced WikiLeaks and a torrent of leaks about his rival Hillary Clinton’s campaign, has become a champion of government secrecy. In a rowdy, 77-minute press conference Thursday, Trump said he had personally instructed the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation into the leak of embarrassing information about his conversations with foreign leaders and former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn’s contacts with Russia. While it is unusual for a president to ask for such a criminal investigation, or to discuss it publicly, no law prevents him from doing so. “It could be perceived as a political witch hunt,” warned Susan Hennessey, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and former intelligence agency lawyer.

Trump launched his war on leaks—and leakers—two Saturdays ago at a charity dinner at Mar-a-Lago, his “winter White House” in Palm Beach, Florida. When I interviewed him at the Red Cross ball, Trump denounced the leaks of transcripts of his phone conversations with leaders of Australia and Mexico as “disgraceful” and “very dangerous . . . for this country,” and blamed the unauthorized release of the information on “Obama people.” Political holdovers from the previous administration still serving on his White House and National Security Council staff, he said, were being “replaced.”

When leaks continued this week, Trump and top aides expanded the category of likely culprits to include the “intelligence community”—specifically, the “NSA and FBI?” he tweeted. “Just like Russia,” he fumed. White House spokesman Sean Spicer then chimed in, adding Justice Department officials to the legion of suspected loose lips.

Trump is hardly the first president to resent leaks. Barack Obama vowed to run the most open and “transparent” government possible, but wound up overseeing at least nine leak investigations and prosecuting more whistleblowers than all his predecessors combined. David Sanger, my former colleague at the New York Times and a veteran Washington insider, called Obama’s White House the “most closed, control-freak administration I’ve every covered.”

Samsung Group chief Jay Y. Lee was arrested early on Friday over his alleged role in a corruption scandal rocking the highest levels of power in South Korea, dealing a fresh blow to the world's biggest maker of smartphones and memory chips.

Continue Reading Below

The 48-year-old Lee, scion of the country's richest family, was taken into custody at the Seoul Detention Centre after waiting there overnight for the decision. He was being held in a single cell with a TV and desk, a jail official said.

Lee is a suspect in the influence-peddling scandal that led parliament to impeach President Park Geun-hye in December, a decision that if upheld by the Constitutional Court would make her the country's first democratically elected leader forced from office.

Shares in flagship Samsung Electronics fell 1.4 percent, while shares in Samsung C&T Corp, the de facto holding company of Samsung Group, were down 2.8 percent compared with the wider market's drop of 0.2 percent.

Prosecutors have up to 10 days to indict Lee, Samsung's third-generation leader, although they can seek an extension. After indictment, a court would be required to make a ruling within three months.

No decision had been made on whether Lee's arrest would be contested or whether bail would be sought, a spokeswoman for Samsung Group said.

Samsung and Lee have denied wrongdoing in the case.

"We will do our best to ensure that the truth is revealed in future court proceedings," the Samsung Group said in a brief statement after Lee's arrest.

The same court had rejected a request last month to arrest Lee, but prosecutors on Tuesday brought additional accusations against Lee, seeking his arrest on bribery and other charges.

"We acknowledge the cause and necessity of the arrest," a judge said in his ruling.

The judge rejected the prosecution's request to arrest Samsung Electronics president Park Sang-jin.

SENSITIVE TIME

While Lee's detention is not expected to hamper day-to-day operation of Samsung firms, which are run by professional managers, experts said it could hinder strategic decision-making at South Korea's biggest conglomerate, or chaebol.

Samsung has been in the midst of an ongoing restructuring to clear a succession path for Lee to assume control after his father was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014.

Decisions that could be complicated by Lee's arrest include deliberations over whether to reorganize the group under a holding company structure, as well as its plan to abandon its future strategy office, a central decision-making body that came in for criticism during the scandal.

Staff moves have also been in limbo. Samsung, which employs around half a million people, has yet to announce annual personnel promotions and changes, which it typically does in December.

One employee at Samsung Electronics’ chip division said colleagues were unsettled that prosecutors had singled-out Samsung.

"The mood is that people are worried," said the employee.

However, another Samsung Electronics employee described the situation as business as usual.

"It wouldn't make sense for a company of that size to not function properly just because the owner is away."

Both declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the matter.

Lee's incarceration comes as Samsung Electronics tries to get past the disastrous rollout last year of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were prone to fires. It is under pressure for the upcoming launch of its next flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, to be a success.

Some worried about the impact on Samsung, a flag-bearer for South Korea's technological and manufacturing prowess.

"We express concern and regret that South Korea's leading company, which is at the forefront of global competition, faces a management vacuum," the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry said.

ZEROING-IN

Lee's arrest gives a boost to prosecutors who have zeroed-in on Samsung Group to build their case against President Park and her close friend Choi Soon-sil, who is in detention and faces charges of abuse of power and attempted fraud.

Both Park and Choi have denied wrongdoing.

Prosecutors have focused on Samsung's relationship with Park, 65, accusing the group of paying bribes totaling 43 billion won ($37.74 million) to organizations linked to Choi to secure government backing for the 2015 merger of two Samsung units.

If parliament's impeachment is upheld, an election would be held in two months. In the meantime, Park remains in office but stripped of her powers.

Her would-be successors praised the decision to arrest Lee.

"We hope it marks a beginning to end our society's evil practice of cozy ties between government and corporations and move toward a fair country," said Kim Kyoung-soo, a spokesman for Moon Jae-in, a member of the liberal opposition Democratic Party who is leading opinion polls in the presidential race.

(Additional reporting by Ju-min Park and Cynthia Kim; Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Lincoln Feast)SpaceX is gearing up to launch its 10th commercial cargo mission on Saturday morning (Feb. 18), ferrying supplies and an assortment of science investigations to the International Space Station — including a deadly superbug, an advanced lightning sensor, a tool for new autonomous rendezvous capabilities and more.

Perched atop an upgraded Falcon 9 booster, the Dragon spacecraft will lift off from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39A — marking the first time a vehicle has launched from the historic pad since the final, 2011 shuttle mission.

Once in orbit, the Dragon will spend two days chasing down the International Space Station. The six crewmembers on board have been preparing for the Dragon's arrival, which is slated for Monday, Feb. 20. At approximately 11:30 a.m. EST, European astronaut Thomas Pesquet will use the space station's 57.7-foot robotic arm to grapple the craft, assisted by NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough. [These SpaceX Rocket Landing Photos Are Simply Jaw-Dropping]

The vehicle will remain berthed at the space station for about a month. During that time the crew will unload its provisions, including close to 5,500 lbs. of research supplies and science experiments. When Dragon's mission is over, it will carry an estimated 5,000 lbs. of cargo back to Earth.

At a news briefing on Wednesday, Feb. 8, several researchers detailed their experiments, which are currently tucked inside the Dragon.

This mission includes a plethora of student-designed investigations, including one led by a pair of 17-year-old students from Craft Academy at Morehead State University in Morehead, Kentucky. The students, Danielle Gibson and Will Castro, kicked off the briefing by outlining an experiment that will evaluate smooth muscle cells from rats (a type of cell commonly found in arteries and veins) to test theories about how muscles contract in the microgravity environment. Gibson and Castro explained that "significant physiological differences" have been observed when muscles contract in space versus on the ground. The goal of their research is to explore those differences in more detail, which could lead to better treatments for health conditions such as high blood pressure.

Paul Reichert of Merck Research Laboratories, whose investigation is also heading to the station, said that it focuses on the crystallization growth of human monoclonal antibodies — a type of protein that researchers suspect may play a role in combating myriad diseases , including cancer. Crystallizing proteins lets scientists better understand how they function, allowing for the creation of more effective treatments.

"This research will improve the way we produce products here on Earth," Reichert said during the briefing.

Michael Freilich, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, was on hand to discuss two of the agency's Earth science payloads that will be carried in the Dragon's trunk: the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) instrument and the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS).

Both payloads will be externally mounted on the station, with SAGE III set to measure the Earth's natural sunscreen — ozone — along with other gases and aerosols, or tiny particles in the atmosphere. To make its measurements, SAGE III will lock its view onto the sun or moon and scan the thin sliver of Earth's atmosphere visible as it passes by.

The new LIS will help scientists better understand lightning , which strikes 45 times per second around the world, by taking measurements 24 hours a day.

The sensor will record several measurements including the number of strikes, and the frequency and energy output of each strike. A similar instrument is installed on the GOES-16 satellite, which launched in November 2016 and is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). [Earth from Space: The Amazing Photos by the GOES-16 Satellite]

Both sensors will work in tandem, allowing scientists to study data from multiple latitudes across the globe. Ben Reed, deputy division director of the Satellite Servicing Projects Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, discussed Raven , a technology demonstration that's designed to test autonomous rendezvous capability on the International Space Station.

Current spacecraft operate in low-Earth orbit, which means they can be controlled from the ground. In the future, robotic spacecraft might be operating thousands of miles from Earth, beyond the reach of the space station or ground control. Advanced autopilot systems are needed to help such spacecraft safely navigate and rendezvous with other objects.

The goal of the Raven investigation is to study the feasibility of a real-time spacecraft navigation system that would provide the eyes and intelligence a spacecraft needs to see a target and steer toward it safely. The researchers hope that the investigation will help to enable future exploration missions near Earth and beyond, including satellite servicing and repair.

Developed by the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO), Raven is equipped with visible light, LIDAR and infrared sensors to scan vehicles visiting the space station over a two-year period.

The next research investigation that was presented may sound like something out of a science-fiction horror story, but the researchers explained there's no danger to the crew. As part of a NASA-funded study, led by Dr. Anita Goel, Nanobiosym is partnering with CASIS — the company tasked with managing the space station's national laboratory — to send a batch of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (aka MRSA) into space, sealed in three levels of containment.

MRSA is common in hospitals, and in the United States alone, MRSA is notorious for killing more Americans in a single year than the combined total of deaths from emphysema, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease and homicide.

So why would NASA want to send such a deadly strain of bacteria into space? Dr. Goel explained that by exposing the bacteria to a microgravity environment, researchers may be able to better understand how MRSA mutates.

MRSA is renowned for its resistance to antibodies. "Microgravity may accelerate the rate of bacterial mutations," Dr. Goel told Space.com. "If we can predict future mutations before they happen, we can build better drugs."

Follow us @Spacedotcom , Facebook and Google+ . Original article on Space.com .The discovery of a pair of fossilized skulls from dome-headed dinosaurs is shedding light on how these bizarre creatures called pachycephalosaurs evolved, researchers say.

Both of the skulls are relatively complete. One, discovered in the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, dates to about 76.5 million years ago. The other, found in the Kirtland Formation of New Mexico, is about 73.5 million years old, the researchers said.

The location of these skulls — in the southern Mountain states — indicates that pachycephalosaurids may have diversified in the south before they moved north and gave rise to the pachycephalosaur known as Stegoceras, said study lead researcher David Evans, an associate professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. [Dinosaur Detective: Find Out What You Really Know]

Pachycephalosaurids (which means "thick-headed lizards") were bipedal, herbivorous and possibly head-butting dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period (145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago). At that time, a vast seaway divided the eastern part of North America (called Appalachia) from the western part (called Laramidia). Most pachycephalosaurid fossils are found in northern Laramidia, such as modern-day Alberta and Montana, making the two newfound skulls in southern Laramidia rather remarkable discoveries, Evans said.

"There have been some fragmentary specimens that have been found as far south as Texas, but having good quality material and relatively complete skulls has been a true rarity," Evans told Live Science. "The two new specimens really stand out in terms of their completeness, and this allows us to get a much better understanding of their anatomy and their relationships."

Both of the pachycephalosaurids were small — about the size of a German shepherd, but the Utah specimen was about 20 percent larger than the New Mexico one, Evans said.

Bony bumps

Despite their small differences in size, both had unique bony knobs on the back of the skull, which "is very different from what we've seen in other species before," Evans said. The different boney knobs suggested that they were two new genuses (also called genera) and species, Evans said.

The pachycephalosaurids likely used these bony knobs as ornamentation — as a way to distinguish between different species and to woo mates, Evans said. Perhaps these ornaments, much like the pachycephalosaurids' domed heads, grew larger as the creature matured, he said.

Interestingly, a variety of dinosaur groups, including pachycephalosaurids, Tyrannosaurs and Ankylosaurs, moved north around 80 million years ago. It's unclear what caused this northward move, but one idea is that the seaway changed shape, expanding into swaths of land that dinosaurs once inhabited and causing them to leave behind their southern stomping grounds, Evans said.

Perhaps one of the pachycephalosaurid populations in the south moved north, and eventually gave rise to Stegoceras, Evans said. In other words, the two new findings suggest that the "Stegoceras lineage may actually have originated in the southern part of North America, which is unexpected," Evans said. "It tells an interesting story about the evolution of this group that we didn't know before."

The study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, was presented Oct. 27 at the 2016 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Salt Lake City.

About 75 minutes later, those hopes got crushed with a follow-up message that said they got the first one by mistake.

The misfired emails from the Ivy League university told the applicants that they had been admitted to the Master’s program at the Mailman School of Public Health on Wednesday.

Columbia said in a statement issued Friday that the letters were sent out “due to human error,” but had no further details on the nature of that error.

The school immediately discovered the mistake and quickly sent off apology emails within an hour, the statement said.

“We deeply apologize for this miscommunication,” Julie Kornfield, the Vice Dean of Education at the School of Public Health, said in the statement.

“We value the energy and enthusiasm that our applicants bring to the admissions process, and regret the stress and confusion caused by this mistake. We are working assiduously to strengthen our internal procedures in order to ensure that this mistake does not happen in the future.”

Click for more from NYPost.comIn a Mexican cave system so beautiful and hot that it is called both Fairyland and hell, scientists have discovered life trapped in crystals that could be 50,000 years old.

The bizarre and ancient microbes were found dormant in caves in Naica, Mexico, and were able to exist by living on minerals such as iron and manganese, said Penelope Boston, head of NASA's Astrobiology Institute.

"It's super life," said Boston, who presented the discovery Friday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Boston.

If confirmed, the find is yet another example of how microbes can survive in extremely punishing conditions on Earth.

Though it was presented at a science conference and was the result of nine years of work, the findings haven't yet been published in a scientific journal and haven't been peer reviewed. Boston planned more genetic tests for the microbes she revived both in the lab and on site.

The life forms — 40 different strains of microbes and even some viruses — are so weird that their nearest relatives are still 10 percent different genetically. That makes their closest relative still pretty far away, about as far away as humans are from mushrooms, Boston said.

The Naica caves — an abandoned lead and zinc mine — are half a mile (800 meters) deep. Before drilling occurred by a mine company, the mines had been completely cut off from the outside world. Some were as vast as cathedrals with crystals lining the iron walls. They were also so hot that scientists had to don cheap versions of space suits — to prevent contamination with outside life — and had ice packs all over their bodies.

Boston said the team could only work about 20 minutes at a time before ducking to a "cool" room that was about 100 degrees (38 Celsius).

NASA wouldn't allow Boston to share her work for outside review before Friday's announcement so scientists couldn't say much. But University of South Florida biologist Norine Noonan, who wasn't part of the study but was on a panel where Boston presented her work, said it made sense.

"Why are we surprised?" Noonan said. "As a biologist I would say life on Earth is extremely tough and extremely versatile."

This isn't the oldest extreme life. Several years ago, a different group of scientists published studies about microbes that may be half a million years old and still alive. Those were trapped in ice and salt, which isn't quite the same as rock or crystal, Boston said.

The age of the Naica microbes was determined by outside experts who looked at where the microbes were located in the crystals and how fast those crystals grow.

It's not the only weird life Boston is examining. She is also studying microbes commonly found in caves in the United States, Ukraine and elsewhere that eat copper sulfate and seem to be close to indestructible.

"It's simply another illustration of just how completely tough Earth life is," Boston said.Drake Parties in London Up in Da Pub!©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Scott Brown with me right now, well aware, of course, as the former Massachusetts senator is, that Germany did take in a record number of refugees from Syria and elsewhere.

That migration wave, whether it was voluntary or not, has been a bane of existence for many in Germany, kind of very unpopular, very, very risky, didn't like many of the settlers moving in their area.

Ironically, Berlin was not among those areas. Nevertheless, that is probably going to be closely scrutinized.

The senator with me right now.

What do you think, Senator?

SCOTT BROWN, R-FORMER SENATOR: Well, I think that Germany, the very fabric of Germany that we grew up has changed dramatically as a result of the refugees coming in.

And there is an attack, Neil, on good and civilized people, democracies, just people who want freedom and the ability to live their lives free of terror. So there is that attack coming and we need to be vigilant and diligent.

And certainly I know your thoughts and my thoughts and everybody in America's thoughts go out to the good people of Germany. But make no mistake. There's a war. And it's going be a long and drawn-out war. And we have to really join forces with all people of good will who want to fight terror, whether they be the Russians, whether they be -- you name it. We have to go and stop it.

CAVUTO: If you think about it, Germany has -- I'm not saying been terror- proof, but has not seen anything approaching the magnitude of what has happened in Brussels or Nice or Paris, or elsewhere, largely because they're considered to be very vigilant against this sort of stuff.

Something slipped through. Something happened. We don't know the exact order of events, whether this driver picked up speed as he was going onto a blockaded street and then moved on to the sidewalk. But they weren't ready for that. What do you make of that?

BROWN: Well, if I'm not mistaken, it's probably, what, 9:15 on a Monday night.

(CROSSTALK)

CAVUTO: And 10:15 there. They don't -- go ahead, at that time when the attack happened, yes.

BROWN: Right.

So, that being said, it wasn't a crowded Saturday -- Friday, Saturday, Sunday. What that tells me is maybe their guard was let down somewhat. But as was referenced earlier in your show, Neil, if somebody wants to do this, they are going to find a way to hit the softest of soft targets and hit the most vulnerable, because that's what they're trying to do is to disrupt our way of life, make us not do those things.

And the only thing we can do is continually to go out and continuing to go to those parties and continuing to go to those areas to make sure that they don't change the way of life that we have come to know and love.

CAVUTO: Do you ever get a sense, though, that somehow the warnings that the State Department issues -- and I take nothing of the State Department issuing them -- but we don't hear about them?

For some reason, Americans were left unawares that this warning was out there. And I'm wondering if there's a better way of communicating that to anyone and everyone.

BROWN: Yes, I think there is, Neil.

And the way we use social media today, anyone who is traveling overseas, there should be an automatic way to set up on Twitter or Facebook to get those instantaneous type of alerts that we get every day when there's a tornado or a hurricane or some type of weather alert coming.

There's no reason why, when I'm traveling in Germany, that I can't be tied into the State Department Web site somehow. And then they say, by the way, don't go downtown Berlin because -- in the Christmas areas, because we're expecting a problem. It makes sense that we should be able to that at this day and age.

CAVUTO: All right, Senator, thank you very, very much.

BROWN: All right, Neil.

CAVUTO: I know we were booked originally to talk about other things. And thank you for your indulgence of all this breaking news.

THOMAS NEUENDORF, BERLIN POLICE SPOKESMAN (via translator): The investigation of the truck continues. We know that the co-driver in the truck died. The rescue workers couldn't help the co-driver anymore. The suspect was arrested nearby a few hundred meters away from the scene of the attack.

MIKE FOX, EYEWITNESS: We were in the market. As we were leaving the large truck came through. It went just past me, past my girlfriend. I think it missed me by three meters. I saw one guy being dragged away with blood on his face. I helped several other people lift the side of one the stalls up so they could pull two other people from under.

(END VIDEO CLIPS)

BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: One eyewitness there in Berlin as that truck plowed through a Christmas market. Getting world that at least nine are dead according to authorities, some 50 people injured. The interior minister is now saying that the suspect was arrested and in fact is believed to be the driver of the truck. They are not officially calling it terrorism but saying that a lot points to an attack.

Meantime you have the attack in Ankara, Turkey, the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey also happening today. Donald Trump just moments ago tweeting, the president-elect saying "Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland, and Germany and it's only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking." Switzerland is a shooting in a mosque in Zurich.

Let's bring in our panel: syndicated columnist George Will, Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for The Washington Times, and Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post. OK, George, thoughts on this day and what we're seeing about the threats evolving?

GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: If the president-elect is right and all three of these were terror attacks, it's not clear that -- how they link together. Let's assume and stipulate it was a terror attack in Germany. In Zurich, it was an attack on a mosque. And in Turkey it seems to have been an attack on the Russians who are paying the price, at least their ambassador is, for Russia intervening in the civil war in Syria.

They all have one thing in common, and that is they are approximate to the Middle East. That is, Europe is not separated by a broad ocean as we are. So I would say that in the ranking of national security threats, terrorism still ranks a distant fifth for the president-elect to deal with, below Iran, below North Korea, below China and the South China Sea, and below the dismemberment of a European nation, a nuclear armed Putin. So these telegenic and awful attacks, as they are, are a long way from us and a long way from being the most serious threat that the president-elect faces.

BAIER: We haven't seen something as brazen as that attack in Ankara in quite some time. It was a Turkish policeman who fatally shot the Russian ambassador to Turkey. And he was shouting at the time, "Don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria." A 22-year-old member of Ankara's riot police squad, he was later killed in a shootout, three people wounded. It's pretty stark to see this, and we're not airing the actual footage, which is airing other places.

MERCEDES SCHLAPP, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: This targeted assassination clearly is showing the pressure that exists between the Russia -- Russia obviously having its impact in Aleppo where they are marginalizing ISIS in that area. With that being said, I just saw photos of Palmyra that ISIS was able to take control of the Russian military base. So you are seeing this tension between Russia, between ISIS. And then, of course, that puts pressure on the Russian-Turkish relations, which as we know back in November of 2015, the Turkish shot down the Russian plane, which created a lot more tension in that area. The key will be how will Putin try to ensure that there is security amongst the diplomatic offices which he says he's going to do. But that of course is not going to stop ISIS from going after Russia.

BAIER: Chuck?

CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: You know, it's a wonder this didn't happen sooner given how brazen, how extensive, how one-sided Russia's intervention has been in Syria. Honestly, I don't know if it's ISIS or some other Sunni extremist group that's tired of standing by and letting Russia get off scot-free, but this kind of thing was bound to happen in retaliation.

I'd have a similar point about what's going on in Germany, assuming -- again, we don't know 100 percent sure, but it looks like the truck attack on Nice. It looks a little bit like the car attack on Ohio State University that occurred in this country. There have been a number of people who have come in to Germany and either become radicalized or were already radicalized when they came in with the wave of refugees and have committed other crimes prior to this one. And I would say that for Chancellor Merkel, this is just another indication of how important it's going to be for her political future and the stability of Germany to somehow get control of this security situation internally. These Christmas markets are all over Germany, many of them just in Berlin, and every little town has one. And I have to imagine everybody in the country is feeling a little bit nervous that theirs might be in some way targeted as well.

BAIER: They are soft targets, George. And France has already issued a warning for Christmas markets to be wary. On November 23, a security official was quoted in "The Daily Mirror" saying this, "The entire continent is vulnerable to attack as we have seen in France, Germany, and Belgium, but particularly in the run-up to Christmas. It is a Christian period of festivities bringing together large crowds of soft target civilians and will attract attention from those who wish to inflict harm." This is our issue. We are a free people that are soft targets, frankly. And fighting that is often very difficult.

WILL: It is difficult. The one thing we don't have that Europe has -- the European what they call dish cities, the ghettoes where Muslim immigrants live together with the satellite dishes keeping them in touch with, constantly imbibing the culture, including some of the extremist culture. We in this country simply don't have that.

BAIER: Quickly, Mercedes.

SCHLAPP: And also, let's look at the European intelligence services. The failure of surveillance, the failure to track many of the terrorist suspects, the limited resources, that's one of the reasons why you see in the case of the Paris attacks that there wasn't enough French officials to basically be able to monitor many of these jihadists in the area. I think you are seeing similarity happening in Germany, in the U.K. So I think that what's happening is they are not sharing that information effectively among the European countries.

BAIER: I asked Sebastian Gorka this, but is it going to be tough to -- for the incoming president to differentiate how his administration deals with these terror threats from overseas differently than the way the Obama administration did?

LANE: President-elect Trump seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on let's do different rhetoric. Let's call it Islamic terrorism and that will make a difference. OK, if you had called whatever happened today Islamic terrorism right when it happened, how much difference would that have made operationally in terms of what did you? Similarly, I would say if you want to bring overwhelming force to bear on ISIS, which is his prescription, you will have to look at the experience of Putin in Syria because that will inevitably bring on some kind of backlash from the other side.

There was no human being getting paid to ring up and bag my merchandise. Nor was there a worker at several other checkout lines. And no one was raising any red flags about the fact that machines had obviously put people out of work.

I had a similar experience at a CVS recently.

Why does our culture seem to applaud every technological advance uncritically, without considering its impact on the employment of human beings? Sure, it will be cool and convenient when Amazon starts delivering packages by drone, within 30 minutes, but it will also put many delivery personnel and, perhaps, postal workers out of work.

I have the same nagging question about self-driving vehicles, which everyone seems to be waiting for with bated breath. How many jobs will remain for taxi drivers and Uber drivers and traffic cops?

There now are “dark factories” that manufacture products without needing people to put them together or package them. The factories can run without lights, because no human being is inside.

Why does our culture seem to applaud every technological advance uncritically, without considering its impact on the employment of human beings.

Sure, people are employed to create the technology and build the machines and factories that operate automatically to churn out product. But whole buildings will soon be snap-together affairs created largely through 3-D printing. And there are lots of folks in America who aren’t trained or can’t be trained to participate in designing and implementing new technologies of that order. Millions are tradesmen and craftsmen and service people.

They are among President Trump’s “forgotten people.”

Silicon Valley inventors and entrepreneurs are very quick not only to defend their version of human rights, but also to make a buck without regard to whether their products erode human self-worth, autonomy and the ability to make a living.

It would seem wise for companies like Home Depot and CVS and Amazon to consider the impact of mechanization on their workers, not just their bottom lines. And because companies may be too self-serving in that regard, it might be wise for consumers to mount some opposition to the ones that decide machines are better at doing jobs than people are.

There are lots of folks who won’t buy meat because they decry the slaughter of animals. There are lots of folks who won’t buy from companies because their politics aren’t aligned. Why aren’t more people unwilling to buy from companies that are racing to deploy machines that put them out of work?

I think it’s because technology is inherently fascinating. It has the pull of an addictive drug on the psyches of human beings. We want more and more and more of it, without thinking very much about whether we are improved by it.

We humans don’t want to turn out to have been “too clever by half,” inventing things that ultimately dispirit and defeat us.

The government would be wise to engage in a new and comprehensive actuarial (and psychological) assessment of the impact of mechanization on every sector of the workforce, to determine whether rampant unemployment is likely.

Here’s a potential Trump tweet:

CVS putting workers out of work with self-scanning checkout! U.S. needs more jobs, not more gadgets!

Instead, they apparently removed all the seats from the upper floor of the Sydney-bound bi-level rail car and stacked them neatly in the back of a car.

Police say the train, which was actively operating when the vandalism took place, was traveling between Lithgow and Katoomba in New South Wales when the crime occurred.

“It must’ve taken 10, 15 minutes or something, to do the whole thing," said Steve Mateer, a passenger who discovered the scene, in an interview with 7 News Sydney. "And with stations about five minutes apart, I don’t really know how they did that.”

“It was bewildering,” added Mateer. “I looked at the guy behind me, who walked in through the door behind me, and he was equally as shocked as I was.”

Mateer says he was able to snap a photo before the train’s staff moved him along, but not before one surveyed the scene for himself and remarked, “You gotta get out of here, this isn’t good.”

NSW Trains is currently working with the authorities to search for the suspects.

“We have CCTV vision from a range of cameras around our trains and we are working closely with police to identify those responsible,” authorities said.Callista and I have great affection and respect for Bob Michel, and the news of his passing at age 93 brought back a lot of memories. He was a great colleague, mentor, and friend.

I learned an immense amount from Bob in our 16 years serving together – especially during the five years I served as whip while he was leader. Bob taught me lesson after lesson about leading people in a legislative environment.

He was always a citizen first and a politician second. And Bob, like Senator Bob Dole, represented what Tom Brokaw called "the Greatest Generation."

Both grew up with solid middle American values. Both took patriotism and hard work for granted. Both served in the Army in Europe. Both were wounded. Both overcame their wounds and went on to serve in public office.

We are fortunate to still have Senator Dole with us. I am sure he joins in reflecting on what a remarkable citizen leader Bob Michel was.

After Michel fought the Axis powers in Europe – earning two Bronze stars, a Purple Heart, and four Battle Stars – he came home to Peoria, Illinois. There, he graduated from Bradley University and married his lifetime love, Corinne Woodruff. Both loved music (Bob had a great singing voice, and Corinne was a talented pianist). They had four children and remain a close-knit family.

Bob was also a fan of the Chicago Cubs. I am glad he got to see them break their “curse” and win the World Series last year. I’m told Bob watched every game with rapt attention.

After overcoming the wounds he suffered in World War II, Bob continued his life of service to America. He came to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1949 as an assistant to Congressman Harold Velde. In 1957 Bob replaced Velde and served for 38 years – including six as Republican whip and 14 as minority leader. He was the longest serving minority leader in American history.

Bob used to tell those of us in Congress great stories about the lessons he learned serving as bartender for private sessions with Senator Everett Dirksen and long-time Republican Whip Congressman Les Arends, both of Illinois. He left deep impressions on all who worked with him.

Former Congressman Bob Walker, who was my close ally in working for a House Republican majority, caught the essence of Bob Michel in a note he wrote to Bob's family, which he has allowed me to quote:

"So sorry for your loss. But in a larger sense, it is truly a loss to all of us and to the nation. For all 50 years that I was on the Hill and working with the Hill, Bob Michel was a giant and an inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, he was the shining example of a legislator's legislator. No one was more respected by all of his colleagues for his leadership, his integrity, his courage and his sense of principle. Barb and I truly mourn with you on the loss of a great man and great American."

Bob Michel became minority leader three years after I arrived in Congress in 1978. As Michael Barone noted in the Reagan years, Bob was possibly the most effective minority leader in history.

The passage of the Reagan and Bush agendas owed a lot to Bob's skills and leadership – and his ability to successfully play the hand he was dealt. You can see that in the way he held the House GOP and the Bush administration together when the 1990 tax increase fight threatened to spin out of control. He could also work with Tip O'Neill and Dan Rostenkowski to get a lot done for Reagan. I could never have done that.

On the other hand, I was prepared to run a national campaign to elect a House GOP majority for the first time in 40 years. Bob was willing to tolerate my forcing the pace in 1993, and he very generously backed me for over a year as we pushed to elect a majority. He could easily have insisted I wait until his retirement, but that would have made the Contract with America campaign impossible.

Bob was deeply devoted to his family and his wife Corinne, and her passing in 2003 left a sadness that nearly equaled their intense partnership and happiness. Callista and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the Michel family.

Bob’s was a life worth living and an inspirational model for us all.

She’s become a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue fixture since making her debut in 2012, appearing on the cover with Chrissy Teigen and Lily Aldridge in 2014 and featuring in this year's edition.

This article originally appeared on Page Six.The bloody scenes of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s scorched-earth campaign in Eastern Aleppo have faded from the news, yet the killing in Syria continues. As you read this, thousands of peaceful activists are still being murdered in the Assad’s regime’s industrial-scale torture system, and nearly 1 million Syrians are still trapped under siege.

But even if you are unmoved by these crimes, you should still be paying attention. The events in Syria have consequences that are reshaping the modern world order: American credibility has been damaged, our allies have been weakened, our enemies have grown in strength… and Syria isn’t over yet.

Over the past six years we have learned that when America – the strongest power in the world – fails to exercise leadership in the face of global crisis, malicious actors will gladly step in. As a result, the world is more dangerous and unstable than it has been in decades. The Trump Administration can avoid the errors of its predecessor by acknowledging the full range of the threats that Syria’s ongoing war poses to American interests and then acting with urgency bring the bloodshed to an end.

The Syria conflict has created the perfect breeding ground for religious extremists of all stripes. Iran has imported foreign fighters from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to join with Hezbollah and a slew of new Syrian sectarian paramilitary groups to create a Shiite coalition to prop up the Assad regime.

The path forward in Syria is difficult and complicated, but it is a path that the U.S. must forge because there is no other actor up to this task.

The conflict also allowed for the rise of a new al-Qaeda affiliate, and birthed the monster known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). Ignored and even supported by the Assad regime as it attacked the legitimate Syrian opposition, ISIS was given safe haven to grow and spread its hateful ideology around the world.

From 2011 to 2017 the Obama Administration pursued a Syria policy that was somehow both ill-defined and inflexible at the same time. In lieu of either intervention or disengagement, its approach was confusing and half-hearted, and often went against the advice of the nation’s national security, defense, and diplomatic officials.

America’s capricious and inept efforts to support various actors on the ground both weakened moderate Syrian groups and alienated regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Obama administration acknowledged that the Assad has committed atrocities, aided the rise of ISIS, and now stands in the way of peace in Syria, yet it was unwilling to take steps to deter Assad and his backers.

The Syrian carnage today stands as indisputable proof of the folly of this course of action.

The secondary consequences of the conflict are too numerous to count. Here are some of the big ones: waves of refugees have destabilized Syria’s neighbors and weakened the European Union, with anti-refugee propaganda playing a key role in Brexit and a similar wave of fear-driven nationalism threatening to engulf France.

In the U.S., this anti-refugee sentiment is creating political turmoil and distracting us from the very real terror threats we face.

Russia and Iran are growing threats to international peace and stability, as both countries have leveraged their interventions in Syria to expand their influence and become increasingly aggressive. Russian obstruction at the UN Security Council has allowed the Syrian government to continue to launch chemical attacks and commit other war crimes with impunity. Russia itself has been directly implicated in using internationally banned arms such as cluster munitions.

Vladimir Putin tested the Obama Administration’s will in Syria, and called its bluff. Only a fraction of Russian airstrikes in Syria have targeted ISIS or al-Qaeda-linked groups. Instead they support Assad’s efforts to destroy all domestic opposition, hitting civilian targets like hospitals and schools in a massive collective punishment campaign that threatens to drive millions more people from the country.

The path forward in Syria is difficult and complicated, but it is a path that the U.S. must forge because there is no other actor up to this task. American leadership can help prevent the worst humanitarian crisis of our time from deepening further and can halt the destabilizing forces it has unleashed on the world: the refugees, the growth of terror, and the empowerment of Russia and Iran.

The price of inaction in Syria has been incredibly high, but it can and will increase unless we prioritize ending this war. It is incumbent upon our political and military leaders to make sure that Syria does not get lost in the bitter partisanship of the moment.

Global stability and American security are bipartisan issues: we all benefit when our power is exercised responsibly and effectively on the world stage. If we fail, we all pay the price together.

Valerie Szybala is Executive Director and co-founder of The Syria Institute, an independent, non-profit, non-partisan research institution based in Washington, DC.Vice President Pence on Saturday worked to assure NATO allies that the United States would be “unwavering” in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.

Pence, in his first overseas trip as vice president, told the Munich Security Conference that President Donald Trump intends to "stand with Europe." He sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by the U.S. president’s positive statements about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

"Today, on behalf of President Trump, I bring you this assurance: The United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in its commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance," Pence said.

MCCAIN IN GERMANY SAYS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN ‘DISARRAY’

During his address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, to end violence in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence met afterward with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference just before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

The vice president’s comments come just weeks after Trump called NATO obsolete, according to a Bloomberg Politics reports about an interview the then-president elect gave to a German paper.

“It’s obsolete, first because it was designed many, many years ago,” Trump said. “Secondly, countries aren’t paying what they should” and NATO “didn’t deal with terrorism.”

On Saturday, Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace agreement aimed to end fighting in Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence also reinforced the Trump administration's message that NATO members must spend more on defense.

NATO's 28-member countries committed in 2014 to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. But only the U.S. and four other members of the post-World War II military coalition are meeting the standard, Pence said.

Failure to meet the commitment, he said, "erodes the very foundation of our alliance."

"Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment and, for most, that means the time has come to do more," Pence said.

James Jeffrey, a U.S. ambassador to Iraq during the Obama administration, said Pence looked "like an adult.” The question is will Trump listen to him?"

The visit, which will include a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression and Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Pence has also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion. Pence also planned to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

The Associated Press contributed to this reportMany of us began the year with resolutions to take the obvious steps to improve our health: eat more fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.

However, a month or so into 2017, how many of us are still on track with keeping up with these changes? If you’ve drifted a little, don’t worry: February is National Heart Month and is a great time to renew your efforts to take care of your body this year.

If you are growing tired of all the standard advice and need to shake up your routine, read on for some surprising heart-healthy foods to help restart or reinvigorate your efforts.

Beans: With the exception of a childhood song, beans don’t get much attention for their relationship to heart health. A good source of fiber and potassium, beans are rich in protein and offer an inexpensive, plant-based alternative to meat. Plus, you don’t need to eat a lot of them to benefit. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition suggests having just 1⁄2 cup of cooked beans daily offers heart-healthy benefits. In addition, a literature review of ten studies where participants added beans to their diets found that this change was associated with a reduction in LDL (bad) cholesterol. Try adding rinsed canned beans to your salad, soups, and stews, or swap beans for meat a few nights a week by serving bean burritos, a bean chili, or a bean and rice dish.

Kimchi: Fermented foods are getting a lot of attention lately in the United States, but many of these foods are long-standing staples in other cultures. Kimchi is one such food--made from fermented vegetables, it is an essential side dish in Korean cuisine. A recent study of 100 participants found that people consuming larger amounts of kimchi lead to greater reductions in LDL (bad) cholesterol levels after only seven days. Check out a local Korean restaurant to give kimchi a try, or pick up a jar at your local Asian market.

100 percent Grape Juice: Most of us have heard about the heart-healthy benefits of wine, but what about its non-fermented friend grape juice? Nearly 20 years of research suggests that, thanks to the deep-purple Concord grape, 100 percent grape juice can support a healthy heart. Concord grapes and its juice provide a unique mix of polyphenols, specifically flavonoids, which are associated with heart-health benefits like improved blood flow (or improved circulation). Just four ounces, or 1/2 cup, counts as one serving of fruit and should be a complement to, not a replacement for, a diet rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables to get a diverse intake of polyphenols throughout the day.

Eggs: Eggs have been the cornerstone of a healthy meal for generations, and for good reason. Eggs are an-all natural source of high-quality protein with one large egg containing six grams protein (12 percent daily value), 13 vitamins and minerals, all for seventy calories. However, for many it’s hard to tune out the decades of hearing that eggs, which contain dietary cholesterol, are not great for your heart. But recent research has changed that advice.

For example, one study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition suggests that eating one egg a day reduces risk for stroke by 12 percent. In addition, the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans make no recommendations to limit the cholesterol we eat. Top your salad with a hardboiled egg or include a side of fresh fruit with your veggie omelet for a heart-healthy, nutrition powerhouse meal.

Papaya: The effects of lycopene (a healthy plant-based compound) on heart disease are well studied, and tomatoes tend to get all the attention as a good source of lycopene in the diet. While tomatoes do contain this powerful antioxidant that is responsible for its red shade, so do many other fruits and vegetables that come in crimson colors. One study that looked at the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes, carrots, and papaya found that the lycopene from papaya was 2.6 times more bioavailable than that from tomatoes. While more research is needed to investigate how upping your intake of papaya might benefit your heart, give this tropical fruit a chance by adding it to your snack rotation, smoothies, salads, and parfaits.

Dark Chocolate: As if you needed a reason to include chocolate in your diet, here’s some delicious news. A 2015 study that looked at participants with Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure compared the addition of dark chocolate (from 83 percent cocoa chocolate bars) to white chocolate bars in their diets showed that people who ate dark chocolate saw a reduction in their blood pressure compared to the people who ate white chocolate.

The authors attribute this difference to the high polyphenol content of the dark chocolate. Since chocolate is high in calories and added sugar, most experts agree that the recommended "dose" of dark chocolate is approximately one to two ounces a day.

Trump made the comments during a tour of a Boeing plant in South Carolina. The message appeared to be also directed at Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 and corporate rival, Bloomberg reported.

“We are looking seriously at a big order,” Trump said, referring to the F/A-18. He said, “If the price (of the F-35) doesn’t come down, we would. The F-18’s a great plane and now put a stealth component onto it.”

Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, was seen at the factory holding a brochure for the F/A-18 XT, which is the advanced Super Hornet, DefenseNews.com reported.

Trump has called the costs of the F-35 program “out of control.” He has been critical of both Lockheed and Boeing and appears to be comfortable pitting the two aerospace giants against each other.

Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing, said in January that he has spoken to Trump about the Air Force One program and “discussed fighter aircraft.”

The U.S. Air Force plans to buy 1,763 of the F-35A model jets, Bloomberg reported. The report said that there is likely not much Boeing could do to compete with the fifth-generation F-35, which is equipped with a more advanced radar system.

The Dallas Morning News reported that Lockheed cut about $600 million from the F-35 program. The planes used to cost $102 million each, now they are under $100 million.

The F-35 program made up 20 percent of Lockheed's total 2015 revenue of $46.1 billion. And U.S. government orders made up 78 percent of its revenue last year.

The F-35 program directly or indirectly supports more than 146,000 U.S. jobs, according to the company's website. Lockheed assembles the F-35s in Fort Worth, Texas.

Lockheed said at the time that it has worked to lower the price of the F-35 by more than 60 percent and said it expects the aircraft to cost $85 million in 2019 and 2020.

In December,Trump tweeted Thursday that based on the “tremendous” cost overruns of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, he had asked the aerospace giant's competitor, Boeing, to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."

Should Kid Rock decide to run for Senate in 2018 he may have some stiff competition.

Days after the Michigan Republican Party told Fox News that Rock would make an "awesome" candidate, right-wing guitar god Ted Nugent said he would consider running for the same seat.

"I'm always very interested in making my country and the great state of Michigan great again and there is nothing I wouldn't do to help in any way I possibly can," Nugent told The Daily Caller.

TRUMP-THEMED HOLLYWOOD PROJECTS ARE TAKING OVER

Michigan GOP press officer Sarah Anderson told Fox News that they have not spoken with Nugent.

"There's a lot of excitement here in Michigan and we think Ted Nugent would be a great candidate to win against Debbie Stabenow," Anderson said. She said of Rock, "I think [Kid Rock] would be awesome," adding she would not "be surprised if there was a movement for him to run."

Unlike Nugent, Rock has not responded to rumors that he is considering running.

If Rock and Nugent both decide to run, the primary winner would face off against Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow who has held her seat since 2000.

Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, told Rolling Stone in 2013 he considers himself more of a libertarian but has supported several Republican politicians, most recently throwing his support behind President Donald Trump. Nugent has also been outspoken about his politics also supporting Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Amy Duggar alleged in a teaser for "Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars" that her father physically abused her growing up.

"My dad was like, ‘Amy, did you brush your teeth?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah daddy.’ And he was like, ‘No you didn’t.’ And he picked me up by my throat, all the way up to the ceiling. He was like, ‘You will brush your teeth,'" Duggar said in the clip obtained by People. "And I was scared s--tless."

Duggar is the niece of "19 and Counting" stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. This is the first time she has identified her alleged abuser.

Duggar and her husband Dillon King decided they needed counseling after seven months of marriage.

She told Fox News earlier this month she is "grateful" for the opportunity to appear on "Marriage Boot Camp." However, she wishes she could have dealt with the alleged abuse "behind closed doors."

"It’s not that I regret saying his name… Well, I regret talking about it on camera, but it’s something that just literally blew out of my mouth and the doctors could tell that I was bothered by something," she said.Kielkowski's first attempt to swim to the ship to capture images was thwarted by the coast guard.

The New York Daily News reported that the 36-year-old actress and model was hospitalized on Wednesday after suffering a blood infection and is in need of a kidney transplant.

The 40-year-old “That ‘70s Show” star told ET in a statement on Friday that Phillips has been “quietly dealing with kidney disease” for years.

Baby best friend... 💗👩‍👧👧🏼😎 A post shared by Bijou Phillips Masterson (@bijouphillips) on Dec 16, 2016 at 9:05am PST

MILA KUNIS ON ASHTON KUTCHER: 'WE WENT THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE I THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY'

“Bijou was born with small kidneys and has been quietly dealing with kidney disease for the last five years, including being on the transplant list,” said Masterson’s statement. “In an effort to heal her body she has led a stress-free life with a vegan diet, which eventually wasn’t enough, and she’s been privately having dialysis.”

“She recently found out one of her friends is a match and is optimistic that she will have a transplant soon,” he added.

Phillips is the daughter of late singer John Phillips of 1960s group The Mamas & the Papas. She previously got her start as a model before acting, and has been featured in films like “Hostel” and “Almost Famous.” She also made an appearance in the TV series “Raising Hope” alongside her husband.

Phillips and Masterson married in 2011 and welcomed a daughter, Fianna Francis, in 2014.

The New York Daily News also added Fianna turned 3 years old the day before Phillips was rushed to a Santa Barbara hospital.

Masterson’s publicist and Phillips’ manager didn't immediately return Fox News' requests for comment.Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt was narrowly confirmed Friday afternoon to lead the federal agency he built a career fighting.

The Senate voted 52-46 to install Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after a heated debate.

While Democrats have blasted the nominee for his push to roll back regulations and his past statements challenging the science behind climate change, his bid more recently was complicated by a dispute over documents.

On the eve of his confirmation, Pruitt was ordered by an Oklahoma judge to hand over thousands of emails between his office and fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries and the National Coal Council to the Center for Media and Democracy, which requested the collection of emails in 2014.

CMD is accusing Pruitt and the Oklahoma attorney general’s office of ignoring multiple open records requests.

Oklahoma County District Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons said “there was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested.”

As of Thursday night, the attorney general’s office had provided only 411 of the more than 3,000 emails CMD requested. The 411 emails were turned over earlier this week. The open records request was made two years ago.

Pruitt’s office maintains they have done nothing wrong and that they handle requests on a “first-come, first-served system.”

Democrats used the developments to push for a delay in Pruitt’s confirmation vote but were repeatedly denied.

“Scott Pruitt and Senate Republicans have made a mockery of the confirmation process, permitting the nominee to escape scrutiny and hide his deep ties to the fossil fuel industry,” Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce said in a written statement. “What is he hiding in all of these emails?”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed efforts to postpone it as another delay tactic by Democrats that was “unprecedented, harmful and pointless.”

“It’s one thing to obstruct to get some outcome, really these are a collection of futile gestures, not changing the outcome of these nominations,” he said from the Senate floor Friday.

Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., pushed back on the accusations from Republicans that Democrats are purposely trying to stall the vote to get back at Trump.

“We have a nominee here who has sued the EPA 18 times!” Franken said. “We don’t think this nominee is qualified. It has nothing to do with us not recognizing the results of the election.”

Open records aside, Pruitt’s nomination has been controversial from the start.

As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sued the very department he was tapped by President Trump to run 14 times, often joining forces with the country’s largest fossil fuel companies against the EPA. He’s also openly questioned the science of climate change and challenged data that says humans contribute to global warming.

Pruitt’s also argued the EPA should have most of its authority stripped. His open antipathy for the department had many wondering why he’d want to lead it.

The New York Times reported that employees of the EPA have been calling their senators to urge them to vote against Pruitt. The display of defiance foreshadows turmoil between those employed by the agency and a man who has built a career on fighting it.

“It seems like Trump and Pruitt want a complete reversal of what EPA has done,” Nicole Cantello, an EPA lawyer who heads the Chicago branch of the union representing EPA’s 15,000 employees nationwide. “I don’t know if there’s any other agency that’s been so reviled. So it’s in our interest to do this.”

Republican lawmakers supporting Pruitt say he’s the right man to “modernize the agency” and will work to make sure the EPA doesn’t overstep its authority.

“He has consistently fought against federal intrusion,” Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. “The EPA must accept the limits of federal power.”

Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, also supported Pruitt’s nomination. He argues Pruitt will clean up the EPA which he says has abused its power over the past eight years.

“We’ve had an agency that doesn’t list mistakes, ignores rule of law… and believes it has the power to regulate every nook and cranny of American life.” Sullivan said in a floor speech. “It’s been an enormous power grab. They regulate puddles.”

Despite the pushback, Pruitt’s confirmation seemed to be a done deal. Two Democratic senators, North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, announced earlier they would vote in favor of his confirmation.

On the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine opposed it. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., skipped the vote to attend a conference in Germany.Columbia University sent acceptance emails to 277 prospective grad students, making their academic dreams come true.

About 75 minutes later, those hopes got crushed with a follow-up message that said they got the first one by mistake.

The misfired emails from the Ivy League university told the applicants that they had been admitted to the Master’s program at the Mailman School of Public Health on Wednesday.

Columbia said in a statement issued Friday that the letters were sent out “due to human error,” but had no further details on the nature of that error.

The school immediately discovered the mistake and quickly sent off apology emails within an hour, the statement said.

“We deeply apologize for this miscommunication,” Julie Kornfield, the Vice Dean of Education at the School of Public Health, said in the statement.

“We value the energy and enthusiasm that our applicants bring to the admissions process, and regret the stress and confusion caused by this mistake. We are working assiduously to strengthen our internal procedures in order to ensure that this mistake does not happen in the future.”

READ MORE FROM THE NEW YORK POST.A newfound amoeba species whose funnel-shaped shell resembles a wizard's hat has been named after one of the most famous warlocks: Gandalf, of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.

The blob-like aquatic creature now goes by the scientific name Arcella gandalfi.

"New amoeba species are very rarely discovered because they're so tiny and not widely studied," study principal investigator Daniel J. G. Lahr, an assistant professor of zoology at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, said in a statement.

Most amoebae are single-celled organisms that sort of crawl to get around. The newly identified A. gandalfi is a camoeba, a type of amoeba that can create a carapacearound its soft body. [ Extreme Life on Earth: 8 Bizarre Creatures ]

The discovery occurred after Lahr began receiving reports of the amoeba's existence in bodies of freshwater in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Tocantins, Paraná and Amapá, and the city of Rio de Janeiro.

However, the specimens from these regions were so small, it was nearly impossible to examine their anatomy and determine whether they belonged to a new species, Lahr said.

Luckily, Lahr got a little help from a friend — Jordana de Carvalho e Féres, a biologist who works for an environmental consultant firm in Espírito Santo. She had a sample from Rio de Janeiro with 180 specimens and another sample from Amapá, and said she could use her expertise in identifying zooplankton , tiny free-floating marine organisms, to help classify the new critter.

The two agreed to study the amoeba in Lahr's lab in São Paulo, where they could use advanced microscopy and partner with other university researchers.

"We succeeded in isolating the organism from the samples, performed all [of] the necessary measurements and produced images to make sure it really was a new species," Lahr said.

In the end, they found that the funnel shape of A. gandalfi was unique in the genus Arcella, one of the largest groups of amoebae with carapaces that grow in wetlands, damp soils and bogs, he said.

Hats off

A. gandalfi is an itty-bitty creature. It ranges in color from light yellow to brown, and its carapace has a diameter of 0.0032 inches and a height of 0.0028 inches.

Despite its minute size, A. gandalfi is considered large for a single-celled organism, especially one in the genus Arcella. There are about 200 Arcella species, and most are half that size. "It's just one cell, and yet it's capable of building this funnel-shaped carapace," Lahr said.

It appears that A. gandalfi lives only in South America, he said. The amoeba is so unique that he and his colleagues are calling it a flagship species — a key species for a habitat that can serve as an icon of an environmental cause, just as the polar bear has become a symbol for climate change.

However, despite the amoeba's exceptional "wizard's hat" carapace, it's not clear why A. gandalfi, — or other amoebae, for that matter — make carapaces. One idea is that amoebae make these structures to protect themselves against predators. [ 5 Key Facts About Brain-Eating Amoeba ]

But Lahr said he doesn't find this idea convincing. "The camoebians are strongly predated, and we often find their carapaces ingested by a class of protozoans called ciliates, for example," he said. "For these microorganisms, the shell is not protective like armor plating, as it is in the case of arthropods [such as insects and arachnids], which are preyed on by animals of the same size."

Rather, the carapace might protect against dryness. These amoebae are often left high and dry when water levels fluctuate, and the carapace likely helps them stay moist, Lahr said.

"We think they're able to maintain a humid microenvironment inside the shell when it's dry outside, by storing even a tiny amount of water," Lahr said.

The carapace might also shield the creature from ultraviolet (UV) radiation .

"Their habitats are aquatic, and they're often exposed to sunlight, so protection against UV rays must be a very important factor," Lahr noted. "A multicellular organism has a number of protective barriers against UV radiation, including a layer of keratin, as well as skin pigments. In the case of single-cell organisms like amoebae, their DNA is basically exposed."

The newly identified organism isn't the only new creature that looks like a hat. In December 2016, researchers formally gave a hat-shaped spider the name Eriovixia gryffindori , because it looked like the Sorting Hat from J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series.

The findings were published online in December 2016 in the journal Acta Protozoologica .

FAA officials said that PSA Airlines 5320, a CRJ 700 aircraft returned to the airport about 12:15 p.m. after declaring an emergency. The crew reported striking a deer on take off from Runway 36 Center shortly before noon.

Forty-four passengers were on board at the time, according to officials with American Airlines. All people on board were evacuated and taken to the airport terminal on airport buses.

The flight was headed to Gulf Port, MS, according to the flight schedule. Airport officials said Runway 18L-36R was closed.The rest of the airport remained open. Runway 18L/36R reopened shortly after 2 p.m.

Fire crews were on scene after fuel from the plane began to leak onto the runway. Fire Chief Justin Field Justin Field said the deer damaged a fuel cell on the right wing of the plane, causing the leak. Crews could be seen spraying down the runway with foam to prevent the fuel from igniting. It took firefighters about 20 minutes to clean up the runway.

Airport officials said large animal strikes are not common. However, the airport property includes thousands of fenced acres and includes vast areas of undeveloped land.

They meet with them in person, they check out their online portfolio and reviews, and they ask around to see if anyone has heard of them or worked with them. And, for many people, this process turns out just fine. However, when you’re talking thousands — or hundreds of thousands — of dollars, and something as personal as your family home is part of the equation, it might be worth putting extra effort into the interview stage before you sign a contract.

My No. 1 suggestion: Ask to see a project your potential remodeler has already completed.

Pictures only show so much. Getting into the space and examining it with your own eyes — and hands — can help ensure that the quality is on par with what you expect. Here are a few things to look for.

Tile

A good tile installation is one in which all the tiles are square (meaning they all butt up to each other at 90 degree angles), level and installed so that there aren’t any tiles jutting out or caving in. The grout lines also should be level, evenly sized throughout and as thin as possible. I know there are exceptions. Some designers like to pick funky-shaped tiles or install them in funky ways. But a good rule of thumb is that the tiles should look smooth and evenly placed, and the grout should be skinny.

Paint

When observing the quality of a paint job, walk up to the area in question, close your eyes and feel it. Do you feel any rough patches, drip marks or overall inconsistencies? If the answer is yes, then it isn’t a high-quality paint job. Other markers of a decent paint job include clean cut-ins at the ceiling (no wobbly lines between the wall color and the ceiling color) and an even finish throughout (for example, if the walls are supposed to be matte, they should look matte everywhere).

Trim

A quality trim installation is similar to a quality tile installation in the sense that it is very geometrical and straight. Look up at the crown molding: Are the corners mitered together seamlessly? Check out the casing around the doors and windows: Are they level, and do they have neat corners?

The answers to both of these questions should be yes. In addition, you shouldn’t be able to see any nail holes in the trim or any obvious seams. This means the trim carpenter filled in the nail holes with putty and took to heart the phrase “measure twice, cut once.”

Doors and Cabinets

When you’re invited into someone else’s home, it’s hard to check the quality of doors and cabinets without getting too personal and gawking at all their stuff. ("Hey, do you mind if I open every door and drawer in your master bathroom vanity?” is kind of a weird question if you don’t know someone very well.)

However, a good, quick test for doors and cabinets is to open and close a few of them to ensure they move smoothly, without sticking. Side note: If a house’s foundation moves (I’m looking at you, Texas foundations!) and there has just been a period of excessive rain or drought, it’s likely that doors may stick because of extraneous conditions, not because of the contractor’s level of craftsmanship.

Countertops

Countertops with weirdly placed seams or big gaps that have been filled with caulk are a sign that the original templating of the tops wasn’t done well. You remember that whole “measure twice, cut once” thing? If you see odd seams or gaps, the countertop fabricators probably didn’t follow that rule.

Lighting

Look up and see if all the can lights are in line and evenly spaced. Ensure that there aren’t any flickering or flashing lights. While this could be because a lightbulb is getting old, it also could mean that there’s something faulty in the light fixture’s wiring.

Double check to make sure dimmers are functional. A common mistake I’ve seen, specifically with the introduction of LED lights, is that the LED bulb and the dimmer aren’t paired correctly, and lights that should dim don’t dim at all, or they flicker and act funny.

While that covers many of the features you can see for yourself on a project, be sure to ask the contractor a couple of questions about the remodel. Inquire about the scope of work and the customer’s requests or expectations. Were there any challenges (unexpected or anticipated), and, if so, how were they resolved? How long ago was this remodel completed? Have there been any warranty issues? Answers to important questions such as these can be just as important as the level of craftsmanship.

All this being said, it isn’t a requirement to see a completed project before choosing a contractor. You may decide that, since your best friend or parents (or someone else whose opinion you trust) have remodeled with a certain contractor and had a great experience, that’s all the “background checking” you want.

However, no matter what your situation is, there is truly no harm in asking to see some prior work. If your potential contractor refuses it altogether, I would suggest it’s time to look at some other options. As I said, your home and your money are valuable and shouldn’t be left in the hands of someone you don’t have complete faith in.An Iranian-American pastor freed last year from an prison in Iran is facing jail time and community service in Idaho after pleading guilty to violating a restraining order his estranged wife filed against him.

SHADOWY IRANIAN GENERAL VISITS MOSCOW, VIOLATING SANCTIONS

Saeed Abedini, 36, who converted from Islam to Christianity in 2000 and then worked in Iran as a Pentecostal minister, was released by his government Jan. 16, 2016. His release came after years of global pressure from human rights and Christian groups.

Shortly after he arrived in Idaho last year, his wife, Naghmeh, filed a restraining order against him and filed for legal separation. She described years of emotional and physical abuse, the Idaho Statesman reported.

PASTOR FREED FROM IRAN DESCRIBES HIS HARROWING EXPERIENCE AS A PRISONER

An Idaho county magistrate on Monday sentenced him to 180 days in jail, all but five days of which were suspended, after Abedini pleaded guilty to violating the restraining order last May. The magistrate also ordered him to do community service and fined him $1,000, half of which was suspended.

In exchange for his guilty plea, the court dropped two other counts of violating the restraining order in June 2016.

"This was a personal matter that I won't share in public," he said. "I will write something in my book in the future."

Outside of court, Abedini has consistently denied harming his wife.

The sentence of Abedini, who brought his family to the U.S. in 2005, was not his first such brush with U.S. law. In 2007 he pleaded guilty to domestic abuse in the same Ada County Magistrate Court and was put on probation for a year.

Between 2005 and 2016 Abedini made several missionary trips to Iran and was briefly detained on several such visits. In 2009, however, Iranian authorities arrested him and sentenced him to eight years in prison. During his imprisonment he became a cause célèbre among human rights activists and international Christian groups, including one led by the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of famed evangelist Billy Graham.

His release last year came after President Obama negotiated the release of four Iranians in exchange for the U.S. releasing seven Iranian prisoners.

Stargazers around the world received a treat on Sunday thanks to the rare celestial phenomenon of a blood-red ‘supermoon’ eclipse. A supermoon occurs when a new or full moon is at its closest to the Earth. Sunday’s was only the sixth supermoon eclipse since 1900. The next supermoon eclipse will occur in 2033.

(REUTERS/Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency) malmo,-swedenAccording to the news media, it was something close to the end of Western civilization. One Ellen producer even compared it to “doomsday.” In reality, it was just a press conference. And President Donald Trump spent much of it calling out the media for being “dishonest” and producing, “very fake news.”

After eight years as serving as Obama’s palace guard, the news media are utterly unable to handle criticism, especially from this president. Journalists envision themselves as they were under Nixon, once more fighting a corrupt president. Only this time there is no Woodward and Bernstein. This time all the press have is Bernstein’s son Jacob who works for The New York TImes. Except he just humiliated his paper by calling the First Lady a “hooker.”

Americans know the media have chosen sides and journalists and the 1st Amendment are diminished by it. Yesterday’s press conference overreaction was more proof.

NBC political director Chuck Todd, who has called Trump a “political streaker” and whose wife is a Democratic consultant, lost any remaining pretense of objectivity. “This not a laughing matter. I'm sorry, delegitimizing the press is unAmerican,” he Tweeted. Todd’s pretends it’s OK for the press to delegitimize a president, just not OK for him to fight back. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called the press conference “unhinged.” The Daily Beast reported that journalists were stunned. One allegedly said: “This is insane.”

ABC’s chief political analyst Matthew Dowd underlined that argument and remarked that Trump “looked smaller and actually more insecure in his position.” He said it “was reminiscent of Captain Queeg in a Caine Mutiny and somebody saying, ‘I’m going to search for their strawberries.’” In the movie, Humphrey Bogart’s Queeg became the boogeyman of a WWII ship’s crew and was portrayed as paranoid and delusional -- so much so that he is relieved of command. (Of course, Dowd didn’t mention how Queeg was unfairly targeted by disloyal officers, as seen in this clip by the great Jose Ferrer.)

Dowd is promoting a popular liberal fantasy of impeachment or even resignation that somehow leads to Hillary Clinton in office. Politico has even written about how people are betting on it. CNN commentator Sally Kohn wrote a now-infamous Tweet that envisioned a series of outlandish events that went from impeachment to “President Clinton” in five easy steps, under the header “Straightforward from here.” That’s the sentiment Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski tweeted -- a line that liberals are repeating endlessly: “This feels like a fake Presidency.”

Trump didn’t care about any of that. He let the press have it, skewering the D.C./New York/Los Angeles media axis as not speaking “for the people, but for the special interests.” He took aim at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the BBC and CNN. He particularly criticized CNN host Don Lemon for “the hatred and venom coming from his mouth” and the “almost exclusive anti-Trump” nature of the panels on his show.

Lemon and his network are easy targets. He’s become famous for saying hilariously stupid things like asking if the missing Malaysian jet was swallowed by a black hole "just like the movie Lost.” Even liberal sites such as Talking Points Memo mock him. He even got drunk during the New Year’s Eve telecast and then got his ear pierced live on TV. CNN eventually pulled the feed after he became too embarrassing.

But this was more than just an attack on the press. The president took his case to the people that things were going well, “because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.”

The major network anchors seemed overwhelmed. “President Trump unloads in a fiery, combative press conference listing successes, airing grievances, placing blame, denying allegations. A scene unlike anything we’ve heard from a president in memory,” vented NBC anchor Lester Holt. CBS’s Scott Pelley called it “the president's first extraordinary solo news conference,” while David Muir summed it up as a “combative scene.”

No matter which side you preferred, both left and right found something to enjoy. Huffington Post called it a “77-MINUTE MELTDOWN” and Salon said: “President Trump implodes in unhinged 77-minute press conference.” It’s odd to see Salon think anyone else is unhinged. Time magazine released its new cover, depicting Trump sitting in the Oval Office in the middle of storm of swirling papers. Yes, even that famous Trump hair and Trump tie were drifting in the wind.

The allegedly unbiased Washington Post called the presser an “erratic performance.” Then White House bureau chief Philip Rucker depicted the exchange in a thoroughly one-sided manner. “With his young presidency besieged by disorder and discord, the commander in chief was at once angry and jovial,” wrote Rucker. Neutral journalism.

Univision’s billionaire CEO Haim Saban got just the anti-Trump snark you would expect from a man who spent millions of dollars “to put Clinton in the White House.” His website Fusion asked simply, “WTF just happened in that Trump press conference?” Maybe the fact that Fusion doesn’t know is why it has lost so much money.

Things were completely different on the right, not that most journalists care.

Talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh said the press conference worked well for “rallying people who voted for him to stay with him” and that “this was one of the most effective press conferences I have ever seen.” The result, according to Limbaugh, was obvious. “The press is going to hate him even more after this.” Though it’s hard to envision that possible.

Former diplomat Richard Grenell’s comments were similar to Trump in attacking the press. “Yesterday, @CNN mocked Trump for not speaking to the main stream press. Today, they mock his ‘marathon press conference’ with them.”

One of the key aspects of the Trump v. Press battle is the increasingly left-wing activism of CNN, despite its periodic claims it has no agenda. A highlight of the combat was periodic Trump opponent and CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta almost begging for better treatment. “Just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you. Just wanted to pass that along if I can,” he told the president. Trump shot right back and told Acosta to, “ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job.” Zucker is the boss of CNN and led NBC when Trump began with The Apprentice more than a decade ago.

For his part, Zucker said the war with Trump wasn’t hurting the network. “They wear those insults as a badge of honor, because it means they are doing their jobs,” he claimed, adding that “morale is incredibly high.”

Its standards certainly aren’t as high. Zucker’s staff “put together a clip of Trump’s most outlandish hand gestures at today’s mammoth news conference — all set to classical music, as if POTUS were a conductor,” reported Mediaite.

CNN’s Reliable Sources email headlined its “special edition” as a “Stress Conference” and ended with senior reporter Dylan Byers trying to tell Trump how to be president. “Dylan Byers asks: At a certain point, the attacks must get old... right? At a certain point the President of the United States needs to start acting like the President of the United States and stop offloading blame for his failures on the press…” Perhaps, at a certain point, the media might start acting neutral. But that’s not likely to ever happen. So why should Trump stop defending himself?

Immensely powerful flares from Proxima b's parent star likely stripped some of life's key building blocks from the Earth-size alien world's atmosphere long ago, according to the study, which investigated the life-hosting potential of planets circling the small, dim stars known as red dwarfs.

Red dwarfs are the most common stars in the Milky Way, making up about 75 percent of the galaxy's 1 trillion or so stellar inhabitants. Whereas red dwarfs are substantially cooler than sun-like stars, they tend to be more active, blasting out potent "superflares" more frequently, especially when red dwarfs are young. [Proxima b: Closest Earth-Like Planet Discovery in Pictures]

The new study took such characteristics into account, developing a new model of red dwarf "habitable zones" — the range of distances from a star at which liquid water should be stable on a world's surface — that considers more than just a parent star's heat.

"By the classical definition, the habitable zone around red dwarfs must be 10 to 20 times closer in than Earth is to the sun," study lead author Vladimir Airapetian, a solar scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement . "Now we know these red dwarf stars generate a lot of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions at the habitable zones of exoplanets through frequent flares and stellar storms."

This is bad news from a habitability perspective. The team's modeling results suggest that such radiation can strip the electrons off molecules in orbiting planets' atmospheres. These electrons escape into space easily, and they drag the newly created, positively charged ions with them as they go.

Light elements, such as hydrogen, are lost fairly easily via this process. And superflare radiation can kick the "atmospheric erosion" up a notch, driving off oxygen and nitrogen — key building blocks of life — as well, the new study found.

"Considering oxygen escape alone, the model estimates a young red dwarf could render a close-in exoplanet uninhabitable within a few tens [of millions] to a hundred million years," NASA officials wrote in the same statement. "The loss of both atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen would reduce and eliminate the planet’s water supply before life would have a chance to develop."

The team's work suggests that this fate has likely befallen the recently discovered Proxima b, which orbits within the "traditional" habitable zone of the red dwarf Proxima Centauri. (This star is the sun's nearest neighbor, lying just 4.22 light-years from Earth.)

"We have pessimistic results for planets around young red dwarfs in this study, but we also have a better understanding of which stars have good prospects for habitability," Airapetian said. "As we learn more about what we need from a host star, it seems more and more that our sun is just one of those perfect parent stars to have supported life on Earth."

The new study was published this week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Originally published on Space.com .One city in Iowa is rolling out the red carpet for bees in order to save the human race. The Gazette reports the population of pollinating insects has been cut in half over the past 70 years, and that spells trouble for humans who enjoy having food to eat.

Part of the problem is that the natural habitats of bees and monarch butterflies have been fast disappearing, replaced by parking lots, lawns, and other signs of human development, according to Popular Science.

Now Cedar Rapids is hoping to reverse the trend by converting 1,000 acres of unused land into prime bee real estate. Cedar Rapids Mayor Ron Corbett tells the Gazette this project and others like it are "critical to the future of both pollinators and people." The 1,000 Acre Pollinator Initiative, led by Cedar Rapids Parks Superintendent Daniel Gibbins, will plant seeds for 39 species of wildflowers and seven species of prairie grass on 188 acres of land this spring.

Potential public land that has been identified includes some of the less-trafficked parts of golf courses and airports, sewage ditches, and more. The project, which has $180,000 in funding so far, hopes to reach its 1,000-acre goal within five years.

Gibbins says 99.9% of Iowa's natural habitat is gone, and this project will help all sorts of animals, not just bees. "Everything that's native here relies on native vegetation," he tells Popular Science.

Plus, the wildflowers will look pretty. (The White House may have doomed a bumblebee species.)

Not a month into his term, President Donald Trump has been the victim of unprecedented leaks of confidential and classified information, often targeting him directly.

And while he is not the first chief executive to grapple with a determined and resourceful enemy from within, driven by ideological opposition to his conservative policies, Trump is the first to see such activity this early in his presidency, with those bureaucrats opposed to him making use of digital age technology, such as private email accounts and encryption apps, that previous leakers did not have.

“There’s a major issue with national security here,” said Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “I would ask [the president and his aides] to take every precaution that they have in their toolbox, because we are dealing with such unprecedented leaks…I don’t think there’s any measure that goes too far. If they have to stop sending emails, if they have to stop the distribution lists of discussions with foreign leaders, all of that’s going to have to be done and done in short order.”

To contend with so resourceful and determined an enemy within, however, Trump may find his options more limited than he would prefer. One element of policymaking that can mitigate against unauthorized leaks – namely, speed, and the implementation of policies so quickly that the bureaucracy does not have time to subvert them – the Trump White House already has tried, with decidedly imperfect results, in the issuance of its executive order on immigration.

“The president needed to take the time to really look at that executive order, to vet it properly,” former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta told Fox Business News’ Maria Bartiromo on February 5. “Instead, they rushed it out, rushed it out very quickly. It clearly had some problems – even they recognize the problems in implementing this – and it created more trouble than dealing with the problem that he was facing.”

Another option is to try to operate in secrecy from the bureaucracy, with information kept to a tight coterie of White House advisers. President Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, famously tried this approach, formulating and conducting foreign policy largely as a two-man team in the bombing of Cambodia, the diplomacy that led to the opening of China, and the nuclear arms control accords they negotiated secretly with the Soviet Union.

Nixon’s taping system captured an exchange between the two men, from June 13, 1971, in which they mused aloud about their modus operandi:

NIXON: Well, I just wish that we operated without the bureaucracy.

KISSINGER: [laughing] Well, Mr. President --

NIXON: We do.

KISSINGER: [Laughs.] All the good things that are being done --

NIXON: Yeah.

KISSINGER: -- are done without --

NIXON: We do. We do. We do.

Yet the Nixon-Kissinger approach also led, directly or indirectly, to a number of negative outcomes: the wiretapping of seventeen National Security Council aides and newsmen; the establishment at the Pentagon of a spy ring that pilfered Kissinger’s briefcase and “burn bags,” collecting 5,000 classified documents over a thirteen-month period; and the pair of illegal break-ins, undertaken by a leak-plugging group that called itself “the Plumbers,” that triggered the Watergate scandal that ultimately toppled Nixon from office.

“The reason that Kissinger's channel with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin worked so well,” said Richard A. Moss, a historian at the U.S. Naval War College and author of Nixon’s Back Channel to Moscow: Confidential Diplomacy and Détente, “is because it was kept really in a very small circle of people in the White House. I'm not sure that that's possible nowadays. The national security staff that Kissinger had at his disposal was approximately forty people strong; the current National Security Council is over 400 people.”

President Trump is known to harbor a soft spot for Nixon – a congratulatory 1987 letter from the ex-president was reported to be among the effects the incumbent planned to display in the Oval Office – and like the Quaker from California, the real estate developer from Queens has long seen himself as an outsider figure subjected to a vicious campaign of attacks, internal and external, by members of an entrenched establishment elite.

Yet sources said the Trump White House, while aware of its massive problem with leaks, is also aware of the need to employ measures to combat it that do not themselves stray over the line, as Nixon’s did, into illegality.

One such option is the use of so-called “false flag” operations. The Wikileaks archive of the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman in 2016, revealed that Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, proposed to Podesta that they plant a false rumor among the campaign staff, about when the former secretary of state would announce her presidential candidacy, to see if the erroneous date would leak and the leaker or leakers could be identified. “Would be good to do this soon since I'm nervous about our planning circle widening,” Mook wrote in March 2015.

Even before being sworn in, Trump revealed a certain familiarity with the technique. During his news conference on January 11, the president-elect recounted how he had withheld word of a pending meeting with intelligence officials from all relevant parties just so he could be in a position to trace the identity of a leaker.

“And what I did is I said, ‘I won't tell anybody. I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence’…Nobody knew – not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know – I didn't tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.”

Police say about 10,000 people joined the "Walk for Life" march and rally Saturday starting at dawn at the Rizal Park, carrying placards that read "Choose life" and "No to death penalty." Organizers gave a larger estimate of the crowd.

It's the latest sign of the dominant Roman Catholic Church's increasing activism against a government crackdown that has left thousands of drug suspects dead and efforts by pro-Duterte legislators to re-impose capital punishment as early as next month. Duterte has been antagonistic to the influential church, once calling it "the most hypocritical institution."A photo posted by Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert) on Nov 3, 2016 at 10:18pm PDT

Miranda Lambert called out a subset of supposed fans who flooded a recent Instagram post of hers with negative comments about her relationship with singer-songwriter Anderson East.

After posting a “really personal” photo of herself riding her horse, Leiani, the “Mama’s Broken Heart” singer blasted fans who criticized a photo she posted showing her with East at the 2016 CMA Awards from the night before (November 2).

“Last night I was all dolled up and ‘out on the town’ with my sweet man at the CMA awards in Nashville. I was excited about the night and posted a picture,” she wrote. “Just now when I looked I realized so many comments were judgmental and negative.”

Lambert continued, calling out fans — many of which seem to believe Lambert is still pining over her ex-husband, Blake Shelton, based solely on her body language with East — who left rude comments after analyzing the photo.

I had a great time last night celebrating country music at the CMA awards with my sweet ❤️ by my side! @andersoneast I'm a lucky girl! #cma50thanniversary #countrymusic #nashville #myBAMAboy #anothervice Thanks to our wonderful Glam team for making us feel so special!

“Cowardly people hiding behind a keyboard or a cell phone writing their useless comments about our eyes and clothes and body language,” she wrote. “What a bunch of bull sh—t. Thank y’all for reminding me why I read books, write songs, and spend most of my time with animals and people I trust and love.”

The “Little Red Wagon” singer — who divorced Shelton last August and confirmed her relationship with East in December — then ended her post with a quote from Maya Angelou, warning users about the power of words.

“And one last thing…..” Lambert wrote, before quoting Angelou: “Words are things. You must be careful, careful about calling people out of their names, using racial pejoratives and sexual pejoratives and all that ignorance. Don’t do that. Some day we’ll be able to measure the power of words. I think they are things. They get on the walls. They get in your wallpaper. They get in your rugs, in your upholstery, and your clothes, and finally in to you.”

Next: Miranda Lambert Is Going to Marry a Six-Year-Old BoyThere’s a show on CBS called “Ransom” that airs Saturday nights and apparently no one tunes in.

“Ransom” has a 0.6 Nielsen rating in the key 18 to 49 demographic – that is considered by TV insiders a monumental flop, according to The Wrap.

In the past, CBS has used Saturday nights to air reruns of crime dramas, unaired episodes of killed shows or episodes of “48 Hours.” “Ransom” is an international co-production, so CBS may be taking a calculated risk running a scripted show on Saturdays.

On RottenTomatoes, critics have the series sitting at just 43 percent fresh and only 40 percent of the audience liking it.

Comments on the Rotten Tomatoes discussion board include: “Very weak pilot. It didn't catch my attention;” “What a horrible show and complete ripoff of Bull. Just dumb;" and "Absolutely unwatchable.”

JOSH ELLIOTT FIRED BY CBS AFTER ON-AIR FLUB

“Ransom” is about an experienced crisis and hostage negotiator, Eric Beaumont (Luke Roberts), and his team, who are brought in to save lives when no one else is able to. Eric understands criminals and uses his insight into human behavior to resolve the most difficult kidnap and ransom scenarios. Eric’s team is played by Brandon Jay McLaren, Nazneen Contractor and Sarah Greene.

“Ransom” boasts a 46 (out of 100) Metascore from TV reviewers measured by Metacritic, and a dismal 1.4 (out of 10) user rating.

One commenter on Metacritic says the show is, “Another incredibly stupid show from CBS. They've got that formula perfected. Stupid story lines, stupid writing, really cute actors for a stupid audience.”

One Twitter user begs CBS to “please stop making shows about hackers; or your strange weird idea of what a hacker is. It’s embarrassing.”

CBS CLAIMS TO BE 'VERY CLOSE' TO RENEWING 'BIG BANG THEORY'

In CBS’ defense, they do have the number one comedy on television with “The Big Bang Theory” and the number one drama with "NCIS."

Eric and Donald Jr. attended a private luncheon Saturday afternoon with business partners of Hussain Sajwani, the billionaire who runs DAMAC Properties, the developer that partnered with Trump on the golf course.

Photographs shared on social media by a real estate broker who attended the luncheon showed the two Trumps there.

Trump's two sons, who now run the Trump Organization, are scheduled to attend a gala at the golf course Saturday night.

The ceremony in the Mideast city-state home to the world's tallest building marks the first major event abroad that the two Trump sons will attend together since their father's inauguration.It’s a discovery that's straight out of “Jurassic Park.” Scientists have found a tiny section of a dinosaur’s tail trapped in amber, and not only that, it has feathers.

Dating to about 99 million years ago, or the mid-Cretaceous period, the amber containing the eight dinosaur vertebrae originally came from Myanmar. While scientists have known since 1996 that some non-avian dinosaurs had feathers, and even suspected that fact 10 years before that, this new find can teach them more about how feathers have evolved over millions of years. The feathered tail in question came from a juvenile dinosaur, likely a small coelurosaur.

"The new material preserves a tail consisting of eight vertebrae from a juvenile; these are surrounded by feathers that are preserved in 3D and with microscopic detail," Ryan McKellar of the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada, said in a statement. He said the tail "was long and flexible, with keels of feathers running down each side." McKellar is a coauthor on a new study describing the discovery.

DINOSAUR-KILLING ASTEROID'S CRATER YIELDS NEW CLUES

The find shows the feathers’ barbs, and the microscopic barbules on them, in incredible detail; the feathers don’t have a well-defined central shaft, or rachis, a fact that tells scientists more about feather evolution. The top part of the tail was darker-- a chestnut brown-- than its underside. The amber even contains remains of soft tissues that have carbonized.

Ancient bugs, like a beetle and ants, can also be seen trapped in the amber.

Paul Olsen, a paleontologist and a professor in Earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University, described the specimen as “almost shocking in its detail.”

“This a remarkable find providing unprecedented detail for a previously poorly understood phase of feather evolution,” he told FoxNews.com in an email. “It is a wonderful complement to other non-avian dinosaur fossils, that while more complete than this tail fragment, can not provide the kind of extremely fine detail preserved in amber.”

The discovery is described in a new study in the journal Current Biology.

The trove was found prior to the construction of two soccer fields in Carnoustie by experts from GUARD Archaeology, working on behalf of the local government. A spokesman for GUARD Archaeology told Fox News that excavations at the site have just finished.

The artifacts, which date to around 1,000 B.C. to 800 BC, have delighted archaeologists. “It is very unusual to recover such artefacts in a modern archaeological excavation, which can reveal so much about the context of its burial,”said GUARD Archaeology Project Officer Alan Hunter, who directed the excavation, in a statement.

LONG-LOST DARK AGE KINGDOM DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND

The excavation site contains a host of archaeological features, including 12 circular houses that probably date the Bronze Age, as well as two halls likely dating to the Neolithic period, one of which is the largest of its type ever found in Scotland, estimated to be 6,000 years old. Clusters of large pits were also discovered, one of which contained the haul of metalwork.

In addition to the bronze spearhead and sword, archaeologists also found a lead and tin pommel from the end of a sword’s hilt, a bronze scabbard mount and chape (the metal point of a scabbard), and a bronze pin.

Archaeologists say that the spearhead’s gold ornament is particularly noteworthy, with the precious metal likely used to enhance the weapon’s visual impact.

A FARMER’S STORY OF MOLES COULD HAVE LED TO A LOST CITY

The Carnoustie excavation also unearthed rare organic remains, such as a wooden scabbard that encased the sword blade, fur skin around the spearhead and textile around the pin and scabbard.

Expand / Contract The Carnoustie Bronze Age sword (© GUARD Archaeology Ltd).

'Organic evidence like Bronze Age wooden scabbards rarely survive on dryland sites so this just underlines how extraordinary these finds are,' said GUARD Project Officer, Beth Spence, in the statement.

Because the remains discovered at Carnoustie are so fragile, archaeologists removed the entire pit and its surrounding subsoil and transported it to GUARD Archaeology’s lab, where it was CT scanned and X-rayed by the School of Veterinary Medicine at Glasgow University. Scan and X-ray data helped experts remove the artifacts from the block of soil. The bronze sword, pin, and scabbard fittings were unearthed near the spearhead.

MEDIEVAL SIN-WASHING WELL IS UNCOVERED

This is just the latest fascinating archaeological discovery in Scotland. Experts, for example, have spent the last few years piecing together the history of a long-lost early medieval kingdom in southern Scotland.

New Privacy - New Terms of Use (What's New) - FAQThis year’s flu vaccine is offering moderate protection against the main family of viruses causing illness, data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

The data comes as what has been a pretty active flu season is near its apex in many parts of the country.

“We won’t know when the peak has occurred until we’ve passed it and have a couple of weeks to look back,” said Lynnette Brammer, head of domestic influenza surveillance at the CDC. “We hopefully are approaching the peak but we may not be there yet.”

Overall, getting a flu shot cut one’s risk of contracting flu and needing to see a doctor by 48 percent this season, when the effectiveness of the various components of the vaccine were assessed together, according to the report published in the CDC’s online journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

Far and away the most common cause of influenza so far this year is the influenza A virus family known as H3N2. Seasons when H3N2 viruses dominate are typically harsh because the virus is especially hard on older adults. Older adults also get less benefit from flu vaccines than healthy younger people.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

As well, the H3N2 component of the flu vaccine has not worked as well as other components in recent years. Flu vaccines are combination vaccines, protecting against three and sometimes four different flu strains.

Mixed effectiveness

This year is not an exception. The CDC data, drawn from five surveillance sites across the country, suggest that the H3N2 component of the 2016-17 flu vaccine offered about 43 percent protection against medically attended influenza.

To put that in context, the influenza B component of the vaccine this year appears to offer about 73 percent protection. The CDC could not estimate vaccine effectiveness for the influenza A H1N1 component of the vaccine because those viruses haven’t played much of a role so far this winter.

“It’s not as good as we would like to see, and we’ve seen higher for some of the seasons — more for H1N1 and for [flu] B,” said Brendan Flannery, an epidemiologist with the CDC’s influenza division.

“But for H3N2, it’s as good as we have seen for some of the H3N2 seasons that have been well matched.”

In the last H3N2-dominant flu season, in 2014-15, the target virus in the vaccine was not well matched to the viruses that were making people sick. That year data suggested the vaccine offered virtually no protection against H3N2 viruses.

The need for better vaccines

“Forty percent to 50 percent is a lot better than zero, but what it really begs the question is: Why are we not working hard to get new and better flu vaccines?” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy and a long-time advocate for the development of more effective flu vaccines.

“Last year we spent over a billion dollars researching new HIV vaccines — an amount that I think is an important investment. But the best estimate we can come up with is we only spend about $35 million globally on … research on new game-changing flu vaccines.’’

The US findings mesh with vaccine effectiveness results seen elsewhere this season.

Last week Canadian researchers reported they are seeing about 42 percent protection from the H3N2 component of the vaccine north of the border. And European scientists reported vaccine effectiveness of 38 percent for H3N2 on Thursday.

Jacqueline Katz, deputy director of the CDC’s influenza division, said a theory behind the poor performance of the H3N2 component of the vaccine relates to the way flu vaccine is produced.

Most influenza vaccine is produced in hen’s eggs; the viruses have to adapt to grow in eggs. That’s true of all families of flu but for some reason the H3N2 viruses adapt in ways that introduce important differences. In essence, the viruses produced in the eggs are different from the viruses circulating in people and don’t adequately prime immune systems to recognize and fend off those viruses. In some years those differences are more pronounced than others.Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is now the subject of intense speculation as to whether he broke the law by telling the FBI he never brought up U.S. sanctions during a discussion with the Russian ambassador before Donald Trump took office.

Here is a look at the relevant laws.

Is Deceiving the FBI a Crime?

To be sure, lying to the FBI can constitute a serious felony. If Flynn swore to tell the truth, it is perjury. If his statements were not under oath, it is obstruction of justice and/or making a false statement to law enforcement.

However, prosecution would depend entirely on the content and context of Flynn’s words during his recorded conversation with the ambassador. Did they speak specifically about sanctions? Or was it a general discussion about expelled diplomats --which was part of the sanctions package?

If the word "sanctions" was never mentioned, then it is a semantical distinction with a legal difference. Interpretation is the key. If Flynn interpreted his conversation with the ambassador differently than the FBI, there is probably no crime.

Also, the length of the discussion is critical. If the subject of sanctions was merely a passing reference with little substance, then Flynn's claim that he did not really recall all of the discussion seems more credible, making it a legally valid defense.

A successful prosecution of the above-mentioned crimes requires proof of “specific intent.” That is, that Flynn made a false statement with knowledge of its falsity, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake or faulty memory. The defendant must have acted “willfully and knowingly.”

If Flynn believed his statement to be true when he made it, even though it was false, the case against him cannot be proven. So far, there is no evidence which gives rise to such proof.

Did Flynn Violate The Logan Act?

The Logan Act prohibits private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with foreign governments. Again, it depends on what Flynn said. If he made no promise to lift sanctions, then he didn't interfere with anything. Hence, no illegality.

Moreover, Flynn will surely argue he was not acting as a private citizen, as the law defines it, but in a wholly different capacity --as a government representative about to assume office and that his communication with an official of a foreign nation is no different than what other incoming administrations have done (and should do). Indeed, it is precisely what President Obama did before he was sworn into office.

Flynn’s intent is relevant. If he intended to act on behalf of the incoming Trump Administration, then there is no violation of the Act.

Finally, the Logan Act was passed in 1799. It was a political slap by the Federalists at Thomas Jefferson. For more than two centuries it has never been enforced and no one has ever been prosecuted under the Act -- largely because lawyers, judges and legal scholars universally regard it as a patently unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment.

So, let’s dispense with the Logan Act drama. It is nothing more than an obscure "Jeopardy" question.

Sergey Lavrov addressed the Munich Security Conference hours after Vice President Mike Pence told the gathering Saturday that the U.S. will "hold Russia accountable" even as the new administration searches for common ground with Moscow.

Lavrov said Russia wants "pragmatic relations, mutual respect, understanding our special responsibility for global stability."

He added: "We have immense potential that has yet to be tapped into, and we're open for that inasmuch as the U.S. is open for that as well."

More broadly, Lavrov said he hopes "responsible leaders" will choose to create a "just world order - if you want you can call it a post-West world order."Los Angeles authorities are investigating a report that Justin Bieber allegedly head butted a man during an argument at a Sunset Strip restaurant.

According to the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, a witness reported seeing the 22-year-old pop star fighting with two bartenders at a West Hollywood restaurant before head butting a patron early Saturday morning.

The department also stated Bieber and the bartenders left by the time deputies arrives. The restaurant was not named.

The patron allegedly hit by Bieber had no visible injuries and did not file a police report. However, an investigation has been proceeded in case the person wants to pursue a case later.

Emails sent by the Associated Press to Bieber’s representatives were not returned.

It had an elegant bronze handle, and when it was tugged and twisted slightly, the casing fell away to reveal an enormous hidden sword.

“She had no idea it was there,” said Mark Howell, a spokesman for America’s Transport Safety Administration (TSA).

The cane was a gift from her son, and she’d been leaning on it for years-- but she agreed to surrender the cane in order to make her flight.

“It happens a lot, actually,” Howell said about the agency routinely discovering hidden weaponry.

“People pick them up at a thrift store and the sword isn’t found until we X-ray it.”

According to the Charlotte Observer, a 57-year-old man was also arrested at the same airport on Monday after officers found a gun in his carry-on luggage.

He was charged and released on a $5,000 bond.

However, Howell stated that about 99 percent of the time, passengers don’t intentionally pack guns in their carry-on bags.

“The most common excuse is ‘oops, I forgot to take it out before I came to the airport,’ or their husband or wife packed the bag for them.”

According to the TSA website, seized items are simply “terminated” unless passengers arrange for them to be checked or mailed elsewhere.C-SPAN released a survey Friday that asked historians to rank past presidents and former-President Obama was voted the country's 12th best, right behind Woodrow Wilson and in front of James Monroe.

Historians were asked to essentially grade the presidents on items like “public persuasion” and “moral authority.” Politico reported that Obama rated high in the category of “equal justice for all,” but received low marks for his relationship with Congress.

Of course, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of a presidency so soon after the president left office.

"Although 12th is a respectable overall ranking, one would have thought that former President Obama’s favorable rating when he left office would have translated into a higher ranking in this presidential survey," Edna Greene Medford, a Howard University professor and member of C-SPAN's historical advisory board, told Politico.

Abraham Lincoln retained the top position, and George Washington came in a close second.A Times Square Mickey Mouse is up to his ears in trouble for swiping cash from an unsuspecting tourist, cops said Monday.

Lester Mengersen, 52, was decked out as the friendly mouse and hustling for tips on Broadway at 8 p.m. Friday when he conned a 21-year-old Tennessee tourist into forking over $120 for a photo, a police source said.

The out-of-towner later noticed that his credit card was missing, checked his bank statement and learned $310 had been stolen from his account, the police source said.

In less than an hour, cops traced the missing credit card back to Mengersen, who was charged with petite larceny, according to cops.

Mengersen, of Clifton, NJ, was slapped with a desk-appearance ticket and is scheduled to appear in court again April 10.

Disney's California Adventure theme park announced they'll be kicking off a "Summer of Heroes" with the opening of the Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout! ride on May 27.

Inspired by the hit Marvel film franchise, Guardians of the Galaxy will replace the old Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, which had been in operation since 2004, but closed earlier this year on Jan. 3. Like the Tower of Terror, the new “Guardians of the Galaxy”-themed attraction will be a free-fall ride, but “with all-new visual and audio effects and music inspired by the popular film soundtracks,” according to Disney.

Mission Breakout! will take riders on a mission to “help Rocket [Raccoon] bust his pals out of the Collector’s Fortress.” In a previous blog post, they also describe the ride as a “randomized” experience, “so you never know which adventure you will get!”

The attraction’s opening coincides with the release of “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2,” which hits theaters on May 5.

Plans for Mission Breakout! were first announced at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016-- but the news was initially met with criticism by Tower of Terror fans on social media.

Even as the opening date of the Guardians ride draws closer, nostalgic Tower fans are still tweeting about their disappointment with Disney.

This week, Disney also announced several smaller attractions as part of their “Summer of Heroes,” including superhero encounters with the Avengers, an “awesome dance-off” opportunity with costumed "Guardians" characters, and plenty of superhero-themed souvenirs and foods throughout the park.Callista and I have great affection and respect for Bob Michel, and the news of his passing at age 93 brought back a lot of memories. He was a great colleague, mentor, and friend.

I learned an immense amount from Bob in our 16 years serving together – especially during the five years I served as whip while he was leader. Bob taught me lesson after lesson about leading people in a legislative environment.

He was always a citizen first and a politician second. And Bob, like Senator Bob Dole, represented what Tom Brokaw called "the Greatest Generation."

Both grew up with solid middle American values. Both took patriotism and hard work for granted. Both served in the Army in Europe. Both were wounded. Both overcame their wounds and went on to serve in public office.

We are fortunate to still have Senator Dole with us. I am sure he joins in reflecting on what a remarkable citizen leader Bob Michel was.

After Michel fought the Axis powers in Europe – earning two Bronze stars, a Purple Heart, and four Battle Stars – he came home to Peoria, Illinois. There, he graduated from Bradley University and married his lifetime love, Corinne Woodruff. Both loved music (Bob had a great singing voice, and Corinne was a talented pianist). They had four children and remain a close-knit family.

Bob was also a fan of the Chicago Cubs. I am glad he got to see them break their “curse” and win the World Series last year. I’m told Bob watched every game with rapt attention.

After overcoming the wounds he suffered in World War II, Bob continued his life of service to America. He came to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1949 as an assistant to Congressman Harold Velde. In 1957 Bob replaced Velde and served for 38 years – including six as Republican whip and 14 as minority leader. He was the longest serving minority leader in American history.

Bob used to tell those of us in Congress great stories about the lessons he learned serving as bartender for private sessions with Senator Everett Dirksen and long-time Republican Whip Congressman Les Arends, both of Illinois. He left deep impressions on all who worked with him.

Former Congressman Bob Walker, who was my close ally in working for a House Republican majority, caught the essence of Bob Michel in a note he wrote to Bob's family, which he has allowed me to quote:

"So sorry for your loss. But in a larger sense, it is truly a loss to all of us and to the nation. For all 50 years that I was on the Hill and working with the Hill, Bob Michel was a giant and an inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, he was the shining example of a legislator's legislator. No one was more respected by all of his colleagues for his leadership, his integrity, his courage and his sense of principle. Barb and I truly mourn with you on the loss of a great man and great American."

Bob Michel became minority leader three years after I arrived in Congress in 1978. As Michael Barone noted in the Reagan years, Bob was possibly the most effective minority leader in history.

The passage of the Reagan and Bush agendas owed a lot to Bob's skills and leadership – and his ability to successfully play the hand he was dealt. You can see that in the way he held the House GOP and the Bush administration together when the 1990 tax increase fight threatened to spin out of control. He could also work with Tip O'Neill and Dan Rostenkowski to get a lot done for Reagan. I could never have done that.

On the other hand, I was prepared to run a national campaign to elect a House GOP majority for the first time in 40 years. Bob was willing to tolerate my forcing the pace in 1993, and he very generously backed me for over a year as we pushed to elect a majority. He could easily have insisted I wait until his retirement, but that would have made the Contract with America campaign impossible.

Bob was deeply devoted to his family and his wife Corinne, and her passing in 2003 left a sadness that nearly equaled their intense partnership and happiness. Callista and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the Michel family.

Bob’s was a life worth living and an inspirational model for us all.

If so, you’re not alone.

A majority of Americans — 57 percent, in fact — are suffering from post-election stress, according to a survey released this week by the American Psychological Association (APA). Nearly half of those surveyed, which included both Democrats and Republicans, reported that the political climate was either a very significant or somewhat significant source of stress. Two-thirds, or 66 percent, said they were stressed about the future of the nation, according to the APA.

"The research is very clear on the fact that uncertainty or a lack of control is a very strong source of stress,” Dr. Jim Diaz-Granados, executive director of education at the APA, told Fox News. “If you look at the campaign and into the election, we certainly are at a time of a lot of change and a lot of uncertainty, and I would say that probably the level of predictability is less, and so it would be reasonable to surmise that stress would increase.”

He noted that any kind of change, be it negative or positive — like getting married or buying a new home — can trigger a stress response.

“Those also contribute to feelings of stress, so again back to the idea of ‘there’s been a lot of change going on,’ and so I think people are reacting to that,” Diaz-Granados said.

After noticing a rising number of Americans seeking mental health help after the election, the APA decided to analyze stress levels for the first time in its annual survey, which it has conducted for the past 10 years.

Previously, Americans ranked work- and money-related concerns as their top stressor, but since the inception of the survey, the APA has never seen the the No. 1 stressor rank as high as post-election stress does this year.

“The only ones that have come close to being two-thirds were around 59 to 62 percent, so it was quite striking to see the extent to which people were identifying this as a significant source of stress,” Diaz-Granados said.

While many communities across the country saw spikes in requests for counseling after the election, crisis lines have meanwhile been flooded with similar cries for help.

If the latest findings from the APA are any indication, Americans are still struggling to find ways to cope post-election.

To help better manage your post-election stress, Diaz-Granados offered the following tips:

1. Prioritize self-care

“Exercise is a particularly very effective way of dealing with stress,” Diaz-Granados said. “It’s a way of losing yourself in the exercise, whether it’s running cycling or walking.” Physical exercise can help reduce stress and release endorphins, a natural reliever of depression and anxiety symptoms. Diaz-Granados advised consuming a nutritious diet, too, because during times of high stress, people may turn to alcohol or fatty foods to help cope.

2. Get involved

Seeking out opportunities in your community can help reduce stress, said Diaz-Granados, who has a doctorate in psychology. “Finding places to volunteer for folks who have a passion or interest — certainly, that is a very good way of taking a break from the election [talk].”

3. Seek help if you need it

“It’s important to know that when you are feeling stress, and especially over a long period of time, or chronically day in and day out, that that can have physical consequences,” like headache or stomachache, Diaz-Granados said. “We really do advise people to take care of that and be aware of their feelings of stress, and to take a break, and also seek professional help if they need to.”

4. Limit your exposure to social media

In this day and age, it may be tempting to check your Facebook or Twitter feed on the regular, but limiting your exposure to online chatter yet making an effort to stay informed can help you stay sane. “Given the environment that we’re in, one of our recommendations is that people need to be mindful of that," Diaz-Granados said.More than 100 pounds of Marijuana have been seized at the U.S. - Mexico Border on Wednesday, according to officials with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

In a statement released Friday, the incident happened at the Port of Sasabe, about 74 miles southwest of Tucson.

Officers found the drugs hidden inside a shipment of mesquite firewood, after a narcotics-detection canine was alerted to a truck, the statement said.

The Marijuana was discovered, after officers loaded the firewood off the truck, and split them in half. The drug, according to the statement, is worth an estimated $53,000.

The person driving the truck, identified as a 41-year-old man, was reportedly turned over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In reaction to the executive order, Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Boston announced Wednesday they would be removing paintings and shroud objects in black fabric that were either created by immigrant artists or donated to the museum by immigrants to highlight foreign-made contributions.

The Davis Museum describes the de-installation as “Art-Less" -- a “protest” that began on Feb. 16 and will end on Tuesday, Feb. 21.

DISNEY RAISES TICKET PRICES AGAIN

In all, the museum says it will remove 120 works of art, including paintings, bronze and wood sculptures, ceremonial masks from Europe, the Americas, and Africa, plus contemporary and modern pieces-– about 20 percent of the art on display in the museum’s permanent galleries.

“We’re hoping to articulate the contributions of immigrants here at Davis in response to the anxiety this executive order has raised and continues to raise,” Davis Museum director Lisa Fischman told the Boston Globe. “We thought a lot about works that we have, and how they came to be here.”

The impact of “Art-Less” on the African galleries will be the most noticeable as nearly 80 percent of the galleries’ objects were donated by the Klejman family, who immigrated to the U.S. from Poland after World War II.

Claire Whitner, the museum’s assistant director of curatorial affairs who is overseeing the project, told the Globe the initiative will affect “every permanent collections gallery.”

The impacted works will be identified with labels stating either that the work was “made by an immigrant” or “given by an immigrant.” The museum is inviting other institutions to join the project, offering labels for public download on its website.

One painting scheduled to be removed over Presidents' Day weekend is a portrait of George Washington, painted by Swedish-born artist Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller. The painting was donated to the museum by the Munn family, also immigrants from Sweden.

In New York City, however, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is using a different tactic to highlight immigrants' artistic contributions.

MoMA has redesigned its fifth-floor permanent-collection galleries to feature contemporary art from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, three of the seven countries whose citizens have been subject to the ban.

According to Architectural Digest, works by Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid and Iranian artist Charles Hossein Zenderoudi have replaced pieces from renknowned artists like Picasso and Matisse. The works will be on display at the Manhattan museum for several months.

Accompanying the newly installed pieces is a statement from the museum that reads:

“This work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States, according to a presidential executive order issued on January 27, 2017. This is one of several such artworks from the Museum’s collection installed throughout the fifth-floor galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum, as they are to the United States."Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and world’s richest man, said in an interview Friday that robots that steal human jobs should pay their fair share of taxes.

“Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, Social Security tax, all those things,” he said. “If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level.”

Gates made the remark during an interview with Quartz. He said robot taxes could help fund projects like caring for the elderly or working with children in school. Quartz reported that European Union lawmakers considered a proposal to tax robots in the past. The law was rejected.

Recode, citing a McKinsey report, said that 50 percent of jobs performed by humans are vulnerable to robots, which could result in the loss of about $2.7 trillion in the U.S. alone.

“Exactly how you’d do it, measure it, you know, it’s interesting for people to start talking about now,” Gates said. “Some of it can come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don’t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It’s OK.”

Last month, Gates told FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo that he is excited to work with President Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to the U.S. government’s support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization he said.

“How we continue that type of outreach and how it helps our security that we are helping those countries to be healthy and be stable,” he said. “There will be some great conversations and be some ideas about new investments that can be made.”Is love in the air?

You’ve likely heard of a “supermoon,” when the full moon appears brighter than usual because it’s closer to Earth. Friday night, something different will happen, in effect. The full moon will be darker.

That’s because the Earth’s natural satellite will experience something called a penumbral eclipse. A full lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is right in between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow onto the moon. In a penumbral eclipse, it’s just the edge of the Earth’s shadow (the penumbra) that ends up on the moon, meaning the moon should just appear to be a little darker on one side. (The full, dark part of the shadow is called the umbra.)

Tonight's full moon swings south of Earth's dark umbral shadow but passes through the fainter penumbral shadow.https://t.co/i4QByc8zW3 pic.twitter.com/sxMJhROXxY — EarthSky (@earthskyscience) February 10, 2017

This phenomenon will be at its maximum at 7:43 tonight, EST, according to Space.com. The best place will be the eastern side of the U.S. If you are outside and in a dark area at that time, look up to the east and check the moon for shading. Don’t worry, that’s not an alien spaceship casting a shadow on the moon. It’s just our own planet.

Because it’s February, the full moon is also called the Full Snow Moon, according to a tradition.

Finally, there’s a green comet soaring past Earth, and on February 11, it’ll be closest to us— although still over 7 million miles away. But don’t strain your eyes. A telescope or binoculars are essential to glimpse this comet, called 45P, as EarthSky explains.

Merkel's address to the Munich Security Conference on Saturday came amid concern about the Trump administration's approach to international affairs and fears that it may have little interest in working in multilateral forums.

Merkel said that "acting together strengthens everyone." But she conceded: "We must see that the multilateral structures are in many places not efficient enough."

She added: "I am firmly convinced that it is worth fighting for our common international multilateral structures, but we must improve them in many places."

The Martian surface is presently cold and dry, but there is plenty of evidence suggesting that rivers, lakes and seas covered the Red Planet billions of years ago. Since there is life virtually wherever there is liquid water on Earth, scientists have suggested that life might have evolved on Mars when it was wet, and life could be there even now.

"In all the environments we find here on Earth, there is some sort of microorganism in almost all of them," said Rebecca Mickol, an astrobiologist at the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, and the lead author of the study. "It's hard to believe there aren't other organisms out there on other planets or moons as well." [Mars Methane - Could It Mean Life? (Video)]

Mickol and her team detailed their findings in the paper "Low Pressure Tolerance by Methanogens in an Aqueous Environment: Implications for Subsurface Life on Mars," which was published in the journal Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres.

Previous research detected methane, the simplest organic molecule, in the Martian atmosphere. While there are abiotic ways to produce methane — such as volcanic activity — much of this colorless, odorless, flammable gas in Earth's atmosphere is produced by life, such as cattle digesting food.

"One of the exciting moments for me was the detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere," Mickol said. "On Earth, most methane is produced biologically by past or present organisms. The same could possibly be true for Mars. Of course, there are a lot of possible alternatives to the methane on Mars and it is still considered controversial. But that just adds to the excitement."

On Earth, microbes known as methanogens produce methane, also known as natural gas. Methanogens typically live in swamps and marshes, but can also be found in the guts of cattle, termites and other herbivores, as well as in dead and decaying organic matter.

Methanogens are among the simplest and most ancient organisms on Earth. These microorganisms are anaerobes, meaning they do not require oxygen. Instead, they often rely on hydrogen for energy, and carbon dioxide is the main source of carbon atoms they use in creating organic molecules.

The fact that methanogens neither require oxygen nor photosynthesis means they could live just beneath the Martian surface, shielded from harsh levels of ultraviolet radiation on the Red Planet. This could make them ideal candidates for life on Mars.

However, the area just below the surface of Mars is exposed to extremely low atmospheric pressures, normally considered inhospitable to life. The surface pressure on Mars on average ranges from one-hundredth to one-thousandth that of the surface pressure of Earth over the course of the Martian year, too low for liquid water to last on the surface. In such thin air, water easily boils. (In contrast, the pressure at the highest point on Earth's surface, the top of Mount Everest, is about one-third that of Earth's surface pressure at sea level.)

To see if methanogens might survive such extremely thin air, Mickol and Timothy Kral, the senior author of the study and an astrobiologist at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, experimented with four species of methanogens. They included: Methanothermobacter wolfeii, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Methanococcus maripaludis. Previous experiments on these four species over the course of more than 20 years generated a lot of data on these organisms and their rates of survival in simulated Martian conditions. [Water on Mars: Wet Martian Discovery Explained (Infographic)]

The more recent set of experiments, which took about a year, involved growing the microbes in test tubes within liquids as a proxy for the fluids potentially flowing through underground Martian aquifers. The microbes were fed hydrogen gas, and the liquids were covered with cotton swabs, which in turn were covered with dirt simulating what might be found on the Martian surface. The insides of each test tube were then subjected to low pressures.

Oxygen kills these methanogens, and maintaining a low-pressure, oxygen-free environment "was a difficult task," Mickol said. Moreover, water evaporates quickly at low pressure, which can limit how long the experiments can last and can also clog the vacuum system with water.

Despite these problems, the researchers found that these methanogens all survived exposure of lengths varying from 3 to 21 days at pressures down to roughly six-thousandths of Earth's surface pressure. "These experiments show that for some species, low pressure may not really have any effect on the survival of the organism," Mickol said.

The scientists are also measuring methane to see whether methanogens are actively growing at low pressure and producing methane.

"The next step is to also include temperature," Mickol said. "Mars is very, very cold, often getting down to -212ºF at night, and sometimes, on the warmest day of the year, at noon, the temperature can rise above freezing. We'd run our experiments just above freezing, but the cold temperature would limit evaporation of the liquid media and it would create a more Mars-like environment."

Mickol stressed that these experiments do not prove life exists on other planets. "That being said, with the abundance of life on Earth, in all the different extremes of environments found here, it's quite possible there exists life — bacteria or tiny microorganisms — somewhere else in the Universe," she said.

But scientists only know this thanks to a chance discovery. Researchers were mapping the Queensland Trough, a basin next to the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's eastern coast, when they noticed eight "hills" hundreds of feet tall more than half a mile below the surface.

After that discovery, they realized that a portion of Australia's continental shelf about 20 miles away "looks like a massive bite has been taken out of [it]," study author Robin Beaman tells Australia's ABC.

He put two and two together and concluded the "knolls were the remains of a very large undersea landslide,” per the BBC. Because coral fossils from the knolls date back 300,000 years, researchers believe the knolls broke off from the section of shelf known as the Gloria Knolls Slide at least 300,000 years ago in what Beaman dubs a "catastrophic collapse." Researchers say the landslide would have produced 7.7 cubic miles of debris. To put that in perspective, almost everyone on Earth could fit into one cubic mile. The force likely caused a tsunami up to 90 feet high, but the nearby Great Barrier Reef would've acted "like a giant porous breakwater," Beaman says. Since researchers found "a lot more marine life there than we ever anticipated," Beaman notes the site will serve as a great place for further research, including on cold water corals.

And if the National Football League wants to avoid getting blindsided, it might want to think twice about what that advice means.

Just a week after Houston hosted Super Bowl LI, the League suggested that if the Lone Star State legislature passes a proposed bill requiring people to use the bathroom, locker room or shower rooms and changing room assigned to their biological gender, Texas may forfeit high-profile sports events in the future. Why? Because gay rights groups consider the law tantamount to legalized discrimination against trans-gender people.

The NFL’s threat is nearly identical to one issued by the National Basketball Association and the NCAA, the governing body for collegiate sports, against North Carolina, which has already enacted a similar law.

Earlier this week, Bellwether looked at the nasty standoff between North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature and opponents of the law. The NBA moved this year’s All-Star game, slated for Charlotte, to New Orleans, as punishment for North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill. And the NCAA has threatened to shut the Tar Heel state out of future sports events unless the law, officially known as HR2, is repealed.

North Carolina isn’t backing down, and Texas probably won’t, either, when its bill comes up for a vote next month. "The NBA and the NFL have lost their minds, as well as their moral compass, " says Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. "They are shaking in their sneakers because they're so afraid of political correctness."

“The far left is out of touch on this issue,” says Texas Republican State Senator Lois Kohlkorst, the bill’s chief sponsor. “What I find frustrating is that most people who say they oppose this bill haven’t even read it.”

A former college athlete, Kohlkorst says that the proposal, formally called SB6 but shorthanded as the bathroom bill, covers more than restrooms. For example, if SB6 fails to become law, a player on the men’s basketball team who self-identifies as female can choose the girls’ locker room to suit up and shower in. She warns, “The thought of 15- and 16 –year-old boys and girls showering together at school is something we should think about.”

Women’s groups are now voicing alarm. “We’re hearing from women, especially rape victims, who are offended and traumatized by the thought of a man being in these most intimate places with them,” Kolkhorst says. “This cuts through party lines and goes to our shared system of values.”

She cites internal polling showing SB6 is favored by every ethnic group in Texas but one: white liberal Democrats.

Certainly, trans-gender people – by which I mean those who have undergone medical alteration to make them what they choose to be – should not endure discrimination. But what about those who have not taken such steps? How should they prove they are the gender they say they are? An anatomy exam? Wouldn’t that be the most humiliating test of all?

The NBA and the NCAA declined to talk last week when I called about the North Carolina law. The NFL has issued a statement saying it is inclusive and opposed to discrimination of any kind, but won’t comment further.

Yet none of these sports associations have opened their players’ locker rooms to the opposite gender. Nor have they taken steps to ensure that spectators can enter any bathroom in the stadiums where their games are played.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott thinks the NFL is sticking its faceguard where it doesn’t belong. “The NFL has its own problems,” Abbott told Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel. “The NFL coddled players who refused to stand for the National Anthem. The NFL has its own problems with regards to violence against women. The last thing the NFL needs to do is tell states how to operate.”

NFL referees are pretty good at recognizing offside, when one team wanders into an opponent’s space. Perhaps a quick glance in the mirror would help end this latest, unnecessary scrimmage, and help everyone make the right call.

Concerns about Soros' involvement most recently were raised by the Hungarian prime minister, who last week lashed out at the Soros "empire" and accused it of deploying "tons of money and international heavy artillery."

But days earlier, Republican lawmakers in Washington started asking questions about whether U.S. tax dollars also were being used to fund Soros projects in the small, conservative-led country of Macedonia.

Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., led a group of House lawmakers in writing to Ambassador Jess Baily -- an Obama appointee -- demanding answers. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also expressed concerns about USAID money going to Soros' Open Society Foundations as part of a broader concern that the U.S. Embassy has been taking sides in party politics.

“I have received credible reports that, over the past few years, the US Mission to Macedonia has actively intervened in the party politics of Macedonia, as well as the shaping of its media environment and civil society, often favoring groups of one political persuasion over another,” Lee said in his letter.

Together, the concerns reflect growing conservative pushback against Soros' operations in Europe.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week ripped the Hungary-born billionaire's "trans-border empire." Orban has been one of the central European voices speaking out against the push by E.U. leaders to absorb Syrian refugees and has been criticized for his hardline stance.

Soros' Open Society Foundations -- one of the billionaire's biggest groups operating across the globe -- fired back, saying Orban was trying to deflect attention from other issues.

“The Open Society Foundations for over 30 years have supported civil society groups in Hungary who are addressing profound problems in education, health care, media freedom and corruption," Laura Silber, the organization's chief communications officer, said in a statement to The Associated Press. "Any attacks on this work and those groups are solely an attempt to deflect attention from government inability to address these issues."

The group's stated goal is “to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens” but critics claim it's a front for Soros’ hard-left political maneuverings.

Former Macedonian PM Nikola Gruevski says Soros has a "decisive influence" on his country’s politics.

“If it were not for George Soros behind it with all the millions he pours into Macedonia, the entire network of NGOs, media, politicians, inside and out ... the economy would be stronger, we would have had more new jobs,” he said in a recent interview with Macedonia’s Republika newspaper.

Macedonia, while small, is a broadly conservative country. It has a flat rate tax of 10 percent, a small-government philosophy and a ruling conservative party (VMRO-DPMNE) that has greeted the election of President Trump warmly and pledged to work with him.

Lee’s staff recently met with Macedonia lawmakers, who also passed on a white paper from a citizen’s initiative called “Stop Operation Soros” which alleges U.S. money has been funding hard-left causes in the country -- including violent riots in the streets, as well as a Macedonian version of Saul Alinsky’s far-left handbook “Rules for Radicals.”

In an extensive 40-page dossier, the group alleges USAID money is being used to fund activists and exclusively left-wing media groups as a way to sway the country’s politics.

The Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

On the Soros connection, Lee’s letter asked if the Mission has “selected the Open Society Foundations as the major implementer of USAID projects in Macedonia” and if the group has been perceived to have political bias in Macedonia.

In a reply dated Feb. 9, the State Department told Lee that the Mission in the country has worked to advance U.S. interests “in a non-biased, non-partisan, objective and transparent manner.” The letter claimed U.S. government assistance has not funded partisan political activities in Macedonia, but noted that from 2002 to the present, USAID had provided three grants to Foundation Open Society – Macedonia (FOSM).

One of these grants is outlined on the USAID website. Between 2012 and 2016, USAID gave almost $5 million in taxpayer cash to FOSM for “The Civil Society Project,” which “aims to empower Macedonian citizens to hold government accountable.” USAID’s website links to www.soros.org.mk, and says the project trained hundreds of young Macedonians “in youth activism and the use of new media instruments.”

The letter from the State Department to Lee said USAID also recently funded a new Civic Engagement Project which partners with four organizations, including FOSM. It was not clear how much this project would cost, but Smith put the figure at $9.5 million.

“The money is very significant, in fact there is still money in the pipeline, from 2017 to 2021, 9.5 million,” Smith said in a recent radio interview with the Family Research Council's Tony Perkins. “It’s one thing to do election monitoring, which is a very noble cause to make sure there’s free and fair elections, but it’s quite another thing to be backing parties that Soros and his gang want to see in control of that country.”

It isn’t the only time Soros has worked with the State Department. Among the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta released by Wikileaks was one from 2011 in which Soros urged Hillary Clinton to take action in Albania over recent demonstrations in the capital of Tirana.

Soros asked Clinton to “bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements” and appoint a senior European official as mediator.

Within a few days, an envoy was dutifully dispatched.

Former Macedonian PM Gruevski cited the WikiLeaks emails as proof “[Soros] can go visit top leading American officials whenever he wants to, arranges meetings day in day out and has significant influence.”

While Soros has often been a bogeyman for the American right, the liberal businessman has kept a steady pressure and funding of left-wing causes within America as well.

“This guy is a spider with lots of webs,” GOP strategist Brad Blakeman told Fox News' "Strategy Room." “He controls numerous third-party groups, where he uses his influence. We’ve seen it internally with Black Lives Matter, the demonstrations taken place after the inaugural -- this is what he does.”

After violent left-wing activists rioted at Berkeley in protest of a lecture by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, The Daily Caller reported that the main group behind the protests -- Refuse Facism -- was backed by The Alliance for Global Justice -- which in turn is backed by The Tides Foundation, a Soros-funded group.

Soros also has donated to Media Matters and has been a major financial contributor to the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank founded by Podesta.

The AP cited an 11-page “draft memo” that reportedly called for tapping up to 100,000 troops to track down illegal immigrants in border and non-border states. The memo reportedly said governors in the 11 states cited in the plan could choose whether to have troops participate.

But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the report “100 percent not true.”

“It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this,” he said, adding there is “no effort” to use the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.

While immigration agents have been stepping up enforcement against illegal immigrants, prompting protests from Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists, a Department of Homeland Security official also said Friday the department is “not considering mobilizing the National Guard."

The story shoot-down comes after President Trump held an extraordinary, marathon press conference Thursday during which he repeatedly accused the media of spreading “fake” news.

Trump included his own share of distortions during the press conference, like claiming his presidential election win was the most decisive in decades.

“I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan,” Trump said.

That’s incorrect. Former President Barack Obama won 332 electoral votes in 2012 and 365 in 2008, compared to 304 for Trump (he won 306 in November, but two later defected).

Trump’s administration, though, has seized on various reports based on anonymous sources and draft memos to further its narrative that the press is spreading falsehoods.

Late Thursday, CIA Director Mike Pompeo also denied allegations that the agency was hiding intelligence from President Trump, after The Wall Street Journal reported some officials were opting not to tell the president how they collected information.

"The CIA does not, has not, and will never hide intelligence from the president, period. We are not aware of any instance when that has occurred," Pompeo said in a statement, calling the reports “dead wrong.”A powerful Pacific storm blew into Southern and Central California on Friday with wind-driven heavy rains that downed power lines and electrocuted a man, killed a motorist in a submerged car and disrupted hundreds of flights at airports.

With the storm feeding on an atmospheric river of moisture stretching far out into the Pacific, precautionary evacuations of homes in some neighborhoods were requested due to the potential for mudslides and debris flows.

More than 300 arriving and departing flights were delayed or canceled at Los Angeles International Airport.

In the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, a falling tree downed power lines and hit a car. A 55-year-old man was electrocuted and pronounced dead at a hospital, police and fire officials said.

Winds gusting to 60 mph or more lashed the area. Heavy rains turned creeks and rivers into brown torrents and released slews of mud from hillsides burned barren by wildfires. Several stretches of freeways and highways were closed by flooding.

"It's crazy," said Robin Johnson, an academic adviser at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "It's just pouring down rain. The wind is just going nuts."

"At one point the wind was so strong I'm surprised it didn't blow my windows out," retiree Phoenix Hocking said in a Facebook message from Carpinteria. "I now have a pond in my patio. And my dog is starting to grow flippers so he can go out and do his business."

In the desert town of Victorville, several cars were washed down a flooded street. A helicopter rescued one person from the roof of a car but another motorist was found dead in a submerged vehicle, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said.

Elsewhere in the county, a 20-mile stretch of State Route 138 in the West Cajon Valley was closed at the scene of a summer wildfire.

Mud sloshed over concrete rail barriers and about two dozen vehicles, including big-rigs and a school bus, were either mired in mud or became unable to turn around on the closed road and some were abandoned, Sherwin said.

Two people in a car were rescued and four students on the bus were removed and taken to a school office, he said.

Another road in the area was covered with 2 feet of mud.

In LA's Sun Valley, 10 cars were trapped in swift-moving water on a roadway and eight people had to be rescued, the Fire Department reported.

Using ropes and inflatable boats, firefighters rescued seven people and two dogs from the Sepulveda basin, a recreation and flood-control area along the Los Angeles River. One person was taken to a hospital with a non-life threatening injury.

The storm took aim at Southern California but also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco. It was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.

The National Weather Service said it could end up being the strongest storm to hit Southern California since January 1995.

Rain and wind wiped out play in golf's Genesis Open at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where a eucalyptus tree cracked.

Hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines had toppled in the Los Angeles area and at one point more than 60,000 city power customers were without electricity.

A 75-foot tree fell onto an apartment building near the University of California, Los Angeles, narrowly missing someone who was in bed, fire officials said. Four of the six apartments have been declared unsafe to enter, prompting the evacuation of 16 college students.

"I was just sitting in bed trying to enjoy a Friday morning of no class," one resident told KCAL-TV. "I had a giant, like, thunder popping sound and then next thing I knew a branch was coming through the ceiling."

Her leg was scratched by debris and "I was covered in sawdust," she said.

Her thought now was, "Where am I going to live?"

Another tree smashed a carport and vehicles in the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta.

Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Orange County closed because the weather. High surf pounded beaches.

By evening, Ventura County and northern Los Angeles County had seen 24-hour rain totals of up to 7 ½ inches, with the San Marcos mountain pass in Santa Barbara County receiving nearly 8 ½ inches.

Farther south, downtown Los Angeles had received about 1 ½ inches of rain while some areas saw up to 4 inches.

The storm system was moving "very slowly" eastward and Los Angeles County was expected to see more rain through Saturday, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.

The city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles, ordered evacuation of 180 homes below a burn scar. Up the coast, evacuations were urged for parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County and around an 11½-square-mile burn scar west of Santa Barbara.

Santa Anita Park near Pasadena canceled all its horse races Friday.

In Northern California, officials monitoring the stricken Oroville Dam on the Feather River said they were confident the reservoir would handle any runoff from expected storms because ongoing releases have been lowering the lake's level since its spillways were damaged last week.

Officials in Washington, D.C.'s public health laboratory had to repeat Zika tests for nearly 300 pregnant women, including two women who were mistakenly told they tested negative for the mosquito-borne virus that has been shown to cause birth defects.

A routine check of lab practices in December revealed that all of the lab's Zika tests were coming back negative, raising concerns about their accuracy, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.

CDC experts, who have been working with the lab since mid-January, discovered that technicians doing Zika testing were skipping a step, causing all of the test results to be negative, said Dr. Wendi Kuhnert-Tallman, who co-leads the CDC's Zika lab task force.

The faulty tests were performed between July 14 and Dec. 14 of 2016, the lab said in a statement on its website.

A total of 409 specimens were sent for re-testing, including samples from 294 pregnant women. CDC is re-testing all 294 of the samples from pregnant women, and the remaining 115 tests from men and non-pregnant women were sent to other CDC-approved public health labs.

So far, the D.C. lab said it has received 62 test results from pregnant women back from the CDC. Of these, 60 tested negative and two tested positive. Confirmatory tests were only able to determine that the women had been recently infected with a flavivirus, a family of viruses that includes Zika, dengue and Chikungunya.

"What that means is that we did see evidence of past infection, but we can't say for sure it's Zika," Kuhnert-Tallman said.

Zika has been shown to cause a range of birth defects when pregnant women are infected, including vision and hearing problems, developmental delays and microcephaly or small head size, a sign that the brain had not developed properly.

Kuhnert-Tallman said CDC has completed about 100 more tests, and results are being sent back to the lab and the doctors who ordered them. Another 129 are still pending.

"We anticipate those will be finalized within two to three weeks," Kuhnert-Tallman said.

The District of Columbia Department of Forensic Sciences Public Health Laboratory has ceased Zika testing and will not resume until it demonstrates to the CDC that it is performing the tests correctly, Kuhnert-Tallman said.It was only a matter of time until Donald Trump-themed Hollywood TV shows and movies were going to hit the screens. According to Deadline, a Trump inspired mini-series titled “Trump: It Happened Here,” written by political reporter Scott Conroy, is being shopped around.

The industry-trade publication claims to have gotten a sneak peek scripts for the series. According to Deadline, Conroy’s series will feature all of President Trump’s key players — Hope Hicks, Steve Bannon, Jeb Bush and even CNN’s Jeff Zucker — but it begins with Mark Burnett pitching “The Apprentice” to Trump.

And Conroy’s project is not the only Trump-inspired piece in the works. Deadline reports writer Mark Boal and producer Megan Ellison are working on a drama about the 2016 election. Ellison wrote “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty.”

Switching gears to the big screen, a Michael Bay drama titled “Little America” got the greenlight in January, which will feature a Trump-inspired society.

As we wait for these shows and movie to be made, there has been no shortage of President Trump skits on “Saturday Night Live.” Each week, the show grows its cast with more A-list celebs playing members of Trump’s team.

Dan Gainor, vice president of business and culture for the Media Research Center, said Hollywood will likely try to portray Trump in a negative light.

“Hollywood tried desperately to set the agenda for the 2016 election. It's no surprise they will try harder in 2017 to write the script for America,” he told Fox News. “… They tried to demonize Trump, attacking him in nearly 30 shows before the election. Now, they will only be worse.”

And Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore, told Fox News it is not unusual for television and movies to mirror real-life.

“I think movies and television generally reflect the world and point of view at the time,” he said. “And the point of view of the people on the creative side of the business if you are writing a movie or TV show in today’s world and environment, often that will seep into your narrative. It happens all the time. If you look at movies from 10 years ago, they seem to have a different point of view, a different perspective, than movies 10 years before that.”

He didn’t start with the usual alphabet: AP, ABC, CBS, NBC. He started with the New York Post, whose representative asked him when Trump would start building that wall he promised on the southern border.

New York Times reporter Michael Grynbaum tweeted within minutes: “Priorities, Day 1: Spicer calls on NY Post, CBN, Univision, Fox News. So far top newspapers & broadcast networks shut out.”

CNN media reporter Brian Stelter was wowed: “He's literally AND symbolically going over the heads of the reporters from the biggest newspapers and TV networks.”

Spicer eventually came around to the front row. But this was a really refreshing start to the Trump press policy.

When I was a White House correspondent for the Christian weekly news magazine World in 2001 and 2002, I knew that those of us back in Row 7 were going to be lucky to get a question in minute 44 of a 45-minute briefing. This is the order the major media expect, even in Republican administrations -- a caste system, where the "prestigious" press outlets hog the spotlight.

When I was a White House correspondent for the Christian weekly news magazine World in 2001 and 2002, I knew that those of us back in Row 7 were going to be lucky to get a question in minute 44 of a 45-minute briefing. This is the order the major media expect, even in Republican administrations -- a caste system, where the "prestigious" press outlets hog the spotlight.

Instead, Spicer popped all over the room, to the back rows, to the people standing on the sides, and then back to the elite media.

This may not last, but it suggests a different approach.

After the briefing, CNN’s Jake Tapper insisted he was “not griping,” but insisted normally, for “decades,” the Associated Press had the tradition of the first question. This would be the same AP that just quoted disgraced former CBS anchorman Dan Rather as Spicer’s chief critic.

Tapper said “The Associated Press is an organization a lot of newspapers, news organizations use. It’s considered impartial, down the middle. He did not call on Associated Press first. He did call on them, but he didn’t call on them first, second, third, or fourth. He called on The New York Post – which is, I think it’s fair to say, Donald Trump’s favorite newspaper.”

Using Tapper’s logic, would it then be odd for Obama to start with The New York Times, which might be Obama’s favorite newspaper? Especially when Tapper’s CNN colleague Jeff Zeleny – then with the Times – asked Obama at the end of his first 100 days what “enchanted” him as president.

Minutes late, CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin questioned former Bush White House spokesman Ari Fleischer with smirking condescension: “Listen, I’m all for bucking tradition and calling on different people. But the fact that Sean chose the New York Post to get the very first question, care to comment on that?” Fleischer acknowledged he and his boss observed the liberal-media tradition, but Trump is “entitled” to make changes. “Nothing is sacrosanct. It’s not written in stone.”

In my White House briefing days, and today, the liberal majority in the White House press corps think conservative media are going to ask softball questions to Republican press secretaries. But often – like the New York Post today – they end up pressing Republicans about their campaign promises to Republican voters, something liberal reporters will lobby to stop from happening.

When I had a spot in the press room all those years ago. I asked Fleischer questions about whether the Bush administration was waffling to the left on issues, and whether they were working effectively with congressional Republicans on confirmations.

Liberal reporters could define those answers from the president’s spokesman as “news” just as much as their own favorite issues or controversies.

After all, how could the circus possibly compete with Donald Trump?

The president proved once again that he is the greatest show on Earth. Lions and tigers and elephants are kid stuff next to his high wire act.

Next time, the White House ought to sell popcorn.

Amid feverish reports of chaos on his team and with Democrats fantasizing that Russia-gate is another Watergate, Trump took center stage to declare that reports of his demise are just more fake news.

Far from dead, he was positively exuberant. His performance at a marathon press conference Thursday was a must-see-TV spectacle as he mixed serious policy talk with standup comedy and took repeated pleasure in whacking his favorite piñata, the “dishonest media.”

The bodies of Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, were found Tuesday along the edge of Deer Creek in Delphi, about three-quarters of a mile from an abandoned railroad bridge where they were dropped off to go hiking. The teens were reported missing Monday after they failed to meet family members to be picked up.

WOMAN CHAINED IN METAL BOX SAYS CAPTOR BRAGGED ABOUT DOZENS OF VICTIMS

Police said there are no suspects yet and that they will not release the girls’ cause of deaths, citing the ongoing investigation.

Sgt. Kim Riley said parents should keep a close eye on their children. “I think people need to be cautious and careful,” Riley said. “Parents should make sure they know where their children are and what their children are doing, and if nothing else, know what’s going on in their lives. That’s the most important thing I can say at this point in time.”

Late Wednesday, police released a photo of a man taken on the Delphi Historic Trails on Feb. 13, around the time Williams and German were walking, FOX 59 reported.

Investigators want to talk with him about what he may have seen, and would also like to speak with anyone who was parked at High Bridge Trail Head on Feb. 13, between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.

Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said the deaths are very upsetting for residents of Delphi, a community of about 3,000 residents. He and Riley urged the public to provide any tips they might have to help authorities in the investigation.

"It is disturbing. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're confident of that. ... And bring justice," Leazenby said during a news conference.

Delphi is known for its historic courthouse square and a restored section of the historic Wabash & Erie Canal that offers trips on a replica 19th century canal boat.

News of the girls' deaths shook the community, where the teens were both eighth-graders at Delphi Community Middle School.

Greg Briles, the superintendent of Delphi Community School Corporation, called their deaths a "senseless tragedy" in a Wednesday afternoon tweet. "Our worst fears were confirmed today in the senseless loss of our 2 DCMS students," he wrote on Twitter.

Delphi resident Richard Gardiner said Wednesday after the police announcement that the girls' killings had left him and other residents stunned.

"I've lived around this town for 50-plus years and things like this are happening every day in bigger cities, like Chicago and Indianapolis and what not," he told WLFI-TV. "And in a small community when it happens, everybody goes berserk."

A local publication, the Carroll County Comet, reported in January that German and Williams were both honor roll students in the fall semester.

German's Facebook page includes several photos of her clowning around with friends, including one from November showing her and another girl flashing the peace sign, prompting one Facebook friend to comment, "You goofy girls."

The super model walked the red carpet in a bright red jumpsuit alongside her two daughters Alexa Ray Joel and Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook who posed with their mom for Sports Illustrated.

"[I] never thought I'd be posing with my daughters 38 years after my debut," she gushed adding how excited she is to see her "daughters' dreams come true."

She also told us how the idea came about for the mom-and-daughter trio to pose together.

"[A] Sports Illustrated editor came up with the idea for [the] mom and daughters shoot," Brinkley said. [The editor] saw Sailor and thought she was my mini-me [and] Alexa has [a] Sofia Loren look."

Fox News' Tamara Gitt contributed to this report.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Friday told the Munich Security Conference that President Trump’s administration is in “disarray” and has “a lot of work to do.”

McCain has emerged as one of Trump’s most vocal critics from his own party. Most recently, there has been a public fued between the administration and McCain over the Yemen raid that resulted in the deaths of civilians and the loss of a Navy SEAL.

McCain, who did not call out Trump by name, pointed to the resignation of Trump’s former national security adviser to illustrate his point.

"I think that the Flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do,” McCain said, according to Reuters. “The president, I think, makes statements (and) on other occasions contradicts himself. So we’ve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says.”

McCain pointed to the “profound concern across Europe” that the U.S. is laying down its “mantle of global leadership.”

“I can only speak for myself, but I do not believe that that is the message you will hear from all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend,” he said.

Vice President Pence gave a speech Saturday morning where he assured NATO that the U.S. "will be unwavering in our commitment to this trans-Atlantic alliance."

The Washington Post ran a headline, in an analysis article, “John McCain just systematically dismantled Donald Trump’s entire worldview.” The paper reported that “it was a striking display from a senior leader of a party when it comes to a president of the same party.

McCain’s comments came days after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told fellow NATO members to increase military spending by year's end or risk seeing the U.S. curtail its defense support — a stark threat given Europe's deep unease already over U.S.-Russian relations.

Echoing Trump's demands for NATO countries to assume greater self-defense responsibility, Mattis said Washington will "moderate its commitment" to the alliance if countries fail to fall in line.

The Associated Press contributed to this reportTwo F-15s caused a ‘sonic boom’ as they raced from their base in Homestead, Fla., Friday to intercept an unresponsive general aviation aircraft that flew near Palm Beach during a stay by President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

The jets flew at supersonic speeds and residents were startled by the loud boom, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, said in a statement. The two fighters were able to establish communication with the aircraft. This incident occured at about 7 p.m. ET. No further details were immediately available.

"The intent of military intercepts is to have the identified aircraft re-establish communications with local FAA air traffic controllers and instruct the pilot to follow air traffic controllers' instructions to land safely for follow-on action," the statement read.

Earlier this month, a private plane got within 2 nautical miles of Air Force One, which is closer than permitted, while flying over Florida and the incident is being investigated by authorities, Bloomberg reported.

The planes were flying on a parallel route and there was no risk of a collision during the incident, which occurred 30 miles out on Feb. 3, sources told the news agency. President Trump arrived safely at Palm Beach International Airport.

The report said that when Air Force One is in flight, Secret Service agents work with FAA supervisors and monitor for threats.Nina Agdal Busts Out of Bikini In SI Swimsuit Return

No more words. Just watch. Good times.Rashad Britt grew up in the Henry Horner projects on Chicago’s West Side, known for gangs and violence. He started hanging out with the members of the Vice Lords gang for safety. “Just for protection…my friends-we gotta get to school. So, we got each other’s back on the way to school,” he says. “And sometimes, that meant carrying a gun and [being] willing to use it.”

His first gun was a gift, given to him as a pre-teen. “I looked at it like that was love. I looked at it like this person loved me, for the simple fact that they wanted to see me protected. They gave me something that was going to protect my life,” he says.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

Last Monday, I met with a group of street guys on the West Side. They say the gangs provided structure that their parents did not. “Half of these guys don’t got no mom, either they was crack heads, dope fiends, boosters or something,” says a man who would only identify himself as a member of the Black Disciples. “They moms or fathers was lost to the same gang that we getting ourselves into now.”

“We more like a family than a gang… brothers,” says Kevin Gentry – associated with the Vice Lords. In the gang, someone was kind to them. Their role models sold drugs, had money, clothes cars and girlfriends. “The gangs have become family for a lot of young men here in Chicago and across the United States. They gravitate toward the guys with charisma. They gravitate toward the guys that might protect them. But they really are not protected out there. Too many people are being killed, it’s a false sense of security,” says Tio Hardiman from Violence Interrupters, a group that attempts to predict and prevent gangland shootings.

As of the 15th of February, Chicago racked up 326 shootings and 72 murders. That puts the city on the same pace as 2016, which saw the highest murder rate in decades.

VIDEO SHOWS CHICAGO GIRL'S ACCUSED KILLER BEATEN IN COURTHOUSE LOCKUP

On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was on a playground in the violent West Englewood neighborhood when she was struck by a stray bullet. About 4 miles away, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes was hit by a stray bullet while seated in the back of a car. Both of their young lives ended.

On Valentine’s Day, a pregnant woman – who is unidentified – began streaming video with her phone on Facebook Live. Her boyfriend, Lazarek Collins, was in the passenger seat and his 2-year-old nephew Lavontay White was in the back.

Collins was a documented gang member. It is believed the bullets were meant for him. However, when Collins was killed, so was little Lavontay. The pregnant woman was shot in the stomach, but survived. Even for Chicago, a city partially numb to the violence, the senseless slaying of a 2-year-old caught on video was horrific.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson again called for tougher gun laws. “Enough is enough,” he said.

Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner proposed sending state troopers to Chicago. Without being specific, President Donald Trump suggested sending in the feds.

Tracy Cannon – once associated with the Vice Lords – says it won’t matter. “I don’t care how many police they bring in. It’s not going to stop, man.”

Guys on the street say law enforcement made a bad situation worse. “They locked up these gang chiefs and everything went haywire,” says Charles Winters. Large organizations like the Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords subdivided over unresolved disputes. Absent leadership, cliques within the same gang will often do battle. “Ain’t like it used to be,” says Cannon. “Back then we had structure. Older guys would make us go to school. Even though we was gang banging, we would still go to school.”

Now, it’s a bullet-ridden free for all, with gangsters trying to gain respect by proving themselves to be ruthless. “Kids only care about nice clothes, fast money and how many kills they can get,” says Britt. “When they get a certain amount of kills or when they hurt a certain amount of people, they feared. They got the fear factor going on. The kids nowadays in Chicago, that’s what they want.”

The guy from the Black Disciples says the gang is all he’s even been able to rely on and he’ll never leave gangster life. “If I live by this gun and I live by these drugs, this product that I’m selling, and I’m pushing in this neighborhood. It’s putting food on my table and food in my kids’ mouths and a roof over they heads, then I’m not going to put it down,” he says.

Others say the violent gang life is for kids. If they live into their 20s and stay out of prison some walk away and get jobs. “You just get played out man,” says Cannon. “If you ain’t rich by now, you ain’t gonna get rich selling drugs.”

MARINE VET SPEAKS OUT ABOUT VIRAL VIDEO SUPPORTING TRUMP TRAVEL BAN

Gary Blough said he came upon the group in Daytona Beach as they were taking the turtle and slamming it down as hard as they could on its shell. He asked them to leave the animal alone and then tried to help the turtle back into the water.

“While I had my head turned, two of them started hitting me in the back of the head and punching me," Blough told Fox 35. "Next thing I know we’re in a scuffle and I’m fighting three of them at the same time defending myself.”

Expand / Contract Johnnie Beveritt and Ryan Ponder (Fox 35)

VETERAN SAID HE WAS ASKED TO LEAVE POST OFFICE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS SERVICE DOG'S IDENTIFICATION

He said the group began to punch and kick him, leaving him with a severely swollen eye and a bump on the back of his head.

After other people came to see the commotion, the suspects reportedly took off, but police later caught up with them nearby, charging all three with aggravated battery and animal cruelty.

“One of its legs was up here,” said Blough to Fox 35, pointing toward some bushes next to an apartment building. “When he got slapped . . . it shot stuff outside. So, I don’t doubt the turtle died.”

Police identified the two adult suspects as Ryan Ponder, 23, and Johnnie Beveritt, 18. The third suspect was a 16-year-old boy.

Authorities told Fox 35 that when another officer went to check on the turtle later, it was gone; they believe the turtle died and sank into the water.

Blough's wife was horrified by what she saw.

“My husband, who is disabled, tried to save a poor animal's life and he gets beaten up,” said Jennifer Blough.

Ponder and Beveritt reportedly were held on $15,000 bond at the Volusia County Jail. The teen is being held at a juvenile detention facility.

A man was arrested with an ID card that identified him as 46-year-old Ri Jong Chol. He was picked up Friday night.

Authorities were still trying to piece together details of the case.

Officials performed a second autopsy on Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, because the first procedure was considered inconclusive, an official said on Saturday.

North Korea has vowed to reject the results of any post-mortem and demanded that Malaysia turn over the body immediately.

Pyongyang's ambassador said on Friday, while speaking to reporters that Malaysian officials may be "trying to conceal something" and "colluding with hostile forces."

Kim Jong Nam suddenly fell ill at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday as he waited for a flight home to Macau. He told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. He died on the way to the hospital.

South Korea has accused its enemies in North Korea of dispatching a hit squad to kill Kim Jong Nam at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, saying two female assassins poisoned him and then fled in a taxi.

On Friday, Indonesia's police chief said the Indonesian woman arrested for suspected involvement in the killing was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.

The Indonesia police chief cited information received from Malaysian authorities, saying that Siti Aisyah, 25, was paid to be involved in "Just For Laughs" style pranks, a reference to a popular hidden camera show. The official said she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," the police chief said. "She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents."

Malaysian police were questioning four suspects — Aisyah, another woman who carried a Vietnamese passport; a man they said is Aisyah's boyfriend; and the North Korean man.

North Korea broke its silence on the case Friday night. Speaking to reporters gathered outside the morgue in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, North Korean Ambassador Kang Chol said Malaysia conducted the autopsy on Kim Jong Nam "unilaterally and excluding our attendance."

Kang said the fact that Malaysia has yet to hand over the body "strongly suggests that the Malaysian side is trying to conceal something which needs more time and deceive us, and that they are colluding with the hostile forces towards us who are desperate to harm us."

Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger half-brother, the North Korean leader. He reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

Philip Tuimur, the regional police boss for Kenya's coastal region, said the man and woman were under investigation Saturday for joining a banned group, which is a criminal offense.

A senior police source who insisted on anonymity because the source was not authorized to discuss the case said the two were arrested by Turkish authorities while entering from Syria in November after having gone for training with the IS group.

For those who can’t swing a micro island, either due to the size or the layout of their kitchen, perhaps a petite peninsula can fill the need for more storage or countertop space. Here’s how.

The main difference between a kitchen island and a peninsula is that the former is open and unattached on all four sides, whereas the latter is open on just three sides. Because of this, a peninsula tends to be a fixed piece of cabinetry in a kitchen, unlike an island, which can be a freestanding piece of furniture or even a cart on wheels.

RELATED: Buffet, Server, Sideboard, Credenza: Which One Do You Need?

But what a peninsula lacks in flexibility it more than makes up for in function. As with an island, the base can be used for extra storage, and the surface can be used for cooking prep or as a casual place to sit around. It’s therefore a terrific alternative in a kitchen where an island simply isn’t an option.

One advantage peninsulas have over islands is that they can act as a friendly barrier to keep kitchen visitors at bay. This is crucial if your kitchen is on the smaller side. The chef or chefs can be prepping a meal without having to dodge people perched around an island.

By putting the seating area on the outer edge of the peninsula, away from the work zone, your kids or guests can sit nearby and visit with you while you work, but not be underfoot or in the way of any cabinets you need to access.

Keep in mind that if your peninsula is going to serve as a place for people to sit at, you’re going to want to include an overhanging countertop for knee space. The National Kitchen & Bath Association recommends allowing 15 inches of clear knee space for a standard 36-inch-high kitchen countertop, and 12 inches for a 42-inch bar-height countertop.

I’ve worked in less space than this, but be aware that if you go less than 10 inches, it can start to get uncomfortable to sit for long periods of time.

A peninsula also can house appliances, allowing for the setup of specialized work zones. Place a wine or beverage refrigerator in a peninsula alongside a cabinet to store glassware, and you have a nice little wine/beverage nook that guests can access without getting underfoot in the main work zone. Or create an area just for the kids by putting a microwave and a refrigerator drawer at an accessible height in the base of the peninsula.

RELATED: Create a Beverage Nook With a Wine Rack

This is another advantage of a peninsula, as it can be a challenge to feed electrical or plumbing lines into a stand-alone island.

Of course, you don’t have to include a base cabinet or appliances beneath a projecting peninsula-style countertop to get function out of it. Perhaps all you need is an extra little surface area for two people to gather around. By cutting the base cabinetry out of the equation, you can give more area over to knee space.

This is an option that would probably work in even the tiniest kitchens. If yours is a very tight space, try putting the extending piece of countertop on a hinge so that you can lower it out of the way when it’s not in use.Pro wrestlers come and gone

It’s becoming an unofficial holiday for families, couples and solo travelers who are looking for a break from the snow and just want a jumpstart on some warm weather fun.

Get your tickets now: Last-minute deals are not uncommon on discount carriers like Spirit and Frontier, but – and this is important – they’re rare during the summertime, holidays and other peak travel periods like Spring Break.

More importantly, discounters don’t always have the cheapest prices (we know, we’ve checked) so whenever you shop, you must compare fares.

So how can you save money during this busy travel time?

Forget those bulging bags: Pack light so you can use a carry-on, free on most airlines. If your airline charges a fee, it can still be a deal because carry-ons don’t get lost. If your basic economy fare does not allow carry-ons in the cabin, they do allow one small bag if stowed under the seat, and the following tips can help with that.

Still not sure about what goes and what stays? Check out our list on what not to pack for spring break:MacBooks don't have to be budget busting.

Apple got a lot of flak for raising prices when it introduced the redesigned MacBook Pro line last October. For instance, the cheapest new MacBook Pro model goes for a not-so-cheap $1,499 direct from Apple. And MacBook Pro models with Apple’s new Touch Bar technology – which replaces the standard function keys with a touch-display strip – start at a heart-arresting $1,799 for the 13-inch model and $2,399 for the 15-incher.

The good news is that major retailers like Best Buy are offering hefty – and regular – discounts on both the new models and prior-generation MacBooks, making them competitively priced with the best Windows laptops.

Here’s a quick overview of some of the best deals that are available now from Best Buy, which told Fox News that the MacBook sale is good through Feb. 20. That said, the price cuts below at Best Buy are representative of the kind of on-again, off-again deals that you can expect in the coming months. Deals end but invariably pop up again weeks or months later.

APPLE'S IPHONE 'X' MIGHT COST AS MUCH AS A MACBOOK

13-inch MacBook Pro, newest (2016 non Touch Bar) model: $1,249.99 at Best Buy this week, $250 off the $1,499.99 regular price. This comes with the 6th Generation Intel Core i5 “Skylake” processor, 8GB RAM, a 256GB flash (solid-state) drive, and Apple’s high-resolution Retina display.

A few things to keep in mind about the new 2016 non-Touch-Bar MBP 13: Apple appears to be positioning it as a new-and-improved 13-inch MacBook Air, which may get phased out (though, of course, Apple could always change its mind). And like the MacBook Air, the new MacBook Pros are thin and light, with the 13-inch model weighing in at 3 pounds and measuring 0.59-inches thick (versus 3.5 pounds and 0.71 inches for the previous-generation MBP 13).

13-inch MacBook Pro (2015): $999.99 this week at Best Buy, $300 off the regular price of $1,299.99. This is equipped with the 5th Generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB Memory, a 128GB flash drive, and Retina display. This is one of the best deals. Not only because of the sizable discount but you’re still getting a plenty-fast 2015 Pro model for the price of a MacBook Air (which doesn’t have a Retina display).

12-inch MacBook newest (2016) model: $1,249.99, $350 off regular price of $1,599.99.

This packs a 6th Generation Intel Core M5 processor, 8GB Memory, 512GB flash drive, and a Retina display. The 12-inch MacBook is Apple’s tablet-like, ultra-light MacBook, weighing in at only 2 pounds. This model has always been pricey because it’s expensive to build – and pack all the components into – a laptop that’s only 2 pounds and 0.52 inches at its thickest point. But at $1,249.99 it’s a good deal and worth a serious look if you like toting around a laptop that’s almost as light as an iPad.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Feb. 11, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.

Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 102 consecutive weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 245,000 in the latest week. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's data and no states had been estimated.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 500 to 245,250 last week.

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid slipped 3,000 to 2.08 million in the week ended Feb. 4. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims rose 4,250 to 2.08 million.

(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)The Weekly Standard’s Steve Hayes said Friday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that President Trump’s visit to a Boeing assembly plant in North Charleston, SC was a successful stop that highlighted the president’s jobs agenda…unlike the press conference that Trump used to assail the media a day earlier.

“[The Boeing] event was quite a good event for Donald Trump. I think this is the kind of event that, if you ask Republicans on Capitol Hill, they'd say, 'Please, more of this, and a lot less of what we saw from the president yesterday,’” Hayes said. “If you look at this presidency almost a month in, the problem is, the sideshows are distracting from the agenda. And there’s no question about that.”

Hayes went on to cite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s assertion that Trump’s approval rating would be up to 15 points higher if he focused more on the policy ideas that he ran on to get elected and less on “the sideshows.”George Soros' alleged meddling in European politics has caught the attention of Congress.

Concerns about Soros' involvement most recently were raised by the Hungarian prime minister, who last week lashed out at the Soros "empire" and accused it of deploying "tons of money and international heavy artillery."

But days earlier, Republican lawmakers in Washington started asking questions about whether U.S. tax dollars also were being used to fund Soros projects in the small, conservative-led country of Macedonia.

Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., led a group of House lawmakers in writing to Ambassador Jess Baily -- an Obama appointee -- demanding answers. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also expressed concerns about USAID money going to Soros' Open Society Foundations as part of a broader concern that the U.S. Embassy has been taking sides in party politics.

“I have received credible reports that, over the past few years, the US Mission to Macedonia has actively intervened in the party politics of Macedonia, as well as the shaping of its media environment and civil society, often favoring groups of one political persuasion over another,” Lee said in his letter.

Together, the concerns reflect growing conservative pushback against Soros' operations in Europe.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week ripped the Hungary-born billionaire's "trans-border empire." Orban has been one of the central European voices speaking out against the push by E.U. leaders to absorb Syrian refugees and has been criticized for his hardline stance.

Soros' Open Society Foundations -- one of the billionaire's biggest groups operating across the globe -- fired back, saying Orban was trying to deflect attention from other issues.

“The Open Society Foundations for over 30 years have supported civil society groups in Hungary who are addressing profound problems in education, health care, media freedom and corruption," Laura Silber, the organization's chief communications officer, said in a statement to The Associated Press. "Any attacks on this work and those groups are solely an attempt to deflect attention from government inability to address these issues."

The group's stated goal is “to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens” but critics claim it's a front for Soros’ hard-left political maneuverings.

Former Macedonian PM Nikola Gruevski says Soros has a "decisive influence" on his country’s politics.

“If it were not for George Soros behind it with all the millions he pours into Macedonia, the entire network of NGOs, media, politicians, inside and out ... the economy would be stronger, we would have had more new jobs,” he said in a recent interview with Macedonia’s Republika newspaper.

Macedonia, while small, is a broadly conservative country. It has a flat rate tax of 10 percent, a small-government philosophy and a ruling conservative party (VMRO-DPMNE) that has greeted the election of President Trump warmly and pledged to work with him.

Lee’s staff recently met with Macedonia lawmakers, who also passed on a white paper from a citizen’s initiative called “Stop Operation Soros” which alleges U.S. money has been funding hard-left causes in the country -- including violent riots in the streets, as well as a Macedonian version of Saul Alinsky’s far-left handbook “Rules for Radicals.”

In an extensive 40-page dossier, the group alleges USAID money is being used to fund activists and exclusively left-wing media groups as a way to sway the country’s politics.

The Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

On the Soros connection, Lee’s letter asked if the Mission has “selected the Open Society Foundations as the major implementer of USAID projects in Macedonia” and if the group has been perceived to have political bias in Macedonia.

In a reply dated Feb. 9, the State Department told Lee that the Mission in the country has worked to advance U.S. interests “in a non-biased, non-partisan, objective and transparent manner.” The letter claimed U.S. government assistance has not funded partisan political activities in Macedonia, but noted that from 2002 to the present, USAID had provided three grants to Foundation Open Society – Macedonia (FOSM).

One of these grants is outlined on the USAID website. Between 2012 and 2016, USAID gave almost $5 million in taxpayer cash to FOSM for “The Civil Society Project,” which “aims to empower Macedonian citizens to hold government accountable.” USAID’s website links to www.soros.org.mk, and says the project trained hundreds of young Macedonians “in youth activism and the use of new media instruments.”

The letter from the State Department to Lee said USAID also recently funded a new Civic Engagement Project which partners with four organizations, including FOSM. It was not clear how much this project would cost, but Smith put the figure at $9.5 million.

“The money is very significant, in fact there is still money in the pipeline, from 2017 to 2021, 9.5 million,” Smith said in a recent radio interview with the Family Research Council's Tony Perkins. “It’s one thing to do election monitoring, which is a very noble cause to make sure there’s free and fair elections, but it’s quite another thing to be backing parties that Soros and his gang want to see in control of that country.”

It isn’t the only time Soros has worked with the State Department. Among the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta released by Wikileaks was one from 2011 in which Soros urged Hillary Clinton to take action in Albania over recent demonstrations in the capital of Tirana.

Soros asked Clinton to “bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements” and appoint a senior European official as mediator.

Within a few days, an envoy was dutifully dispatched.

Former Macedonian PM Gruevski cited the WikiLeaks emails as proof “[Soros] can go visit top leading American officials whenever he wants to, arranges meetings day in day out and has significant influence.”

While Soros has often been a bogeyman for the American right, the liberal businessman has kept a steady pressure and funding of left-wing causes within America as well.

“This guy is a spider with lots of webs,” GOP strategist Brad Blakeman told Fox News' "Strategy Room." “He controls numerous third-party groups, where he uses his influence. We’ve seen it internally with Black Lives Matter, the demonstrations taken place after the inaugural -- this is what he does.”

After violent left-wing activists rioted at Berkeley in protest of a lecture by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, The Daily Caller reported that the main group behind the protests -- Refuse Facism -- was backed by The Alliance for Global Justice -- which in turn is backed by The Tides Foundation, a Soros-funded group.

Soros also has donated to Media Matters and has been a major financial contributor to the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank founded by Podesta.

Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com. He can be reached here or on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.His state is hosting the Republican convention in just about 40 days, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich told Fox News he’s “absolutely” prepared to go to Cleveland without endorsing presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump.

The former presidential candidate, who suspended his campaign last month, made clear he still has deep reservations about the brash billionaire businessman – and that he feels no special obligation to come around just because the Party is coming to his town.

“It’s trending poorly,” Kasich told Fox News’ Bill Hemmer, when asked if he’d support Trump.

“We’re like two companies, you know, we have a different vision, a different value system and a different objective. … The divisiveness, the division, the name-calling, it just doesn’t go down well with me.”

Kasich revealed that he and Trump did speak about two weeks ago. He said the “ball is in his court.”

But he categorically ruled out being Trump’s running mate.

“There was never a chance of that,” Kasich said. “There was never ever, ever any consideration.”

It’s unclear whether Kasich is even under consideration, though Trump told Bloomberg Politics in a piece published Wednesday he’s narrowed his short-list down to about four or five people. Trump reportedly said that list includes former rivals, and at least one who has not endorsed him.

Trump did not name names.

Kasich is hardly the only prominent GOP figure still reluctant to get behind Trump. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also hasn’t done so since suspending his presidential campaign – and a steady procession of GOP figures, even those who have endorsed Trump, have condemned his recent claims that a federal judge weighing a Trump University case has a conflict of interest due to his Mexican heritage.

Kasich called those comments “just terrible.”

He also challenged Trump on policy, including his stated reluctance to take on certain entitlements.

“Are you kidding me? Of course, we have to deal with entitlements,” Kasich said.

Despite these comments, Kasich said he’ll still give Trump a chance, speculating, “He can change.”

He added: “I'm not going to endorse Hillary Clinton, that's for sure.”

Meanwhile, Trump has tried to move past the internal party tensions over his presumptive nomination. His staff was meeting Thursday in Washington with congressional members and aides. As the final GOP primaries were held Tuesday, he also issued a lengthy written statement explaining and defending his comments on the federal judge, in a bid to put the controversy behind him.

And at least one senior Washington lawmaker, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, backed him up – while causing some controversy for himself in the process. According to The Des Moines Register, Grassley likened Trump’s comments to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor once touting the judgment of a “wise Latina.”

“I think that you don’t have any more trouble with what Trump said than when Sotomayor said that — when she was found saying in speeches that, quote, ‘A wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male,’” he reportedly said. “I don’t hear any criticism of that sort of comment by a justice of the Supreme Court.”Rashad Britt grew up in the Henry Horner projects on Chicago’s West Side, known for gangs and violence. He started hanging out with the members of the Vice Lords gang for safety. “Just for protection…my friends-we gotta get to school. So, we got each other’s back on the way to school,” he says. “And sometimes, that meant carrying a gun and [being] willing to use it.”

His first gun was a gift, given to him as a pre-teen. “I looked at it like that was love. I looked at it like this person loved me, for the simple fact that they wanted to see me protected. They gave me something that was going to protect my life,” he says.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

Last Monday, I met with a group of street guys on the West Side. They say the gangs provided structure that their parents did not. “Half of these guys don’t got no mom, either they was crack heads, dope fiends, boosters or something,” says a man who would only identify himself as a member of the Black Disciples. “They moms or fathers was lost to the same gang that we getting ourselves into now.”

“We more like a family than a gang… brothers,” says Kevin Gentry – associated with the Vice Lords. In the gang, someone was kind to them. Their role models sold drugs, had money, clothes cars and girlfriends. “The gangs have become family for a lot of young men here in Chicago and across the United States. They gravitate toward the guys with charisma. They gravitate toward the guys that might protect them. But they really are not protected out there. Too many people are being killed, it’s a false sense of security,” says Tio Hardiman from Violence Interrupters, a group that attempts to predict and prevent gangland shootings.

As of the 15th of February, Chicago racked up 326 shootings and 72 murders. That puts the city on the same pace as 2016, which saw the highest murder rate in decades.

VIDEO SHOWS CHICAGO GIRL'S ACCUSED KILLER BEATEN IN COURTHOUSE LOCKUP

On Saturday, 12-year-old Kanari Gentry-Bowers was on a playground in the violent West Englewood neighborhood when she was struck by a stray bullet. About 4 miles away, 11-year-old Takiya Holmes was hit by a stray bullet while seated in the back of a car. Both of their young lives ended.

On Valentine’s Day, a pregnant woman – who is unidentified – began streaming video with her phone on Facebook Live. Her boyfriend, Lazarek Collins, was in the passenger seat and his 2-year-old nephew Lavontay White was in the back.

Collins was a documented gang member. It is believed the bullets were meant for him. However, when Collins was killed, so was little Lavontay. The pregnant woman was shot in the stomach, but survived. Even for Chicago, a city partially numb to the violence, the senseless slaying of a 2-year-old caught on video was horrific.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson again called for tougher gun laws. “Enough is enough,” he said.

Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner proposed sending state troopers to Chicago. Without being specific, President Donald Trump suggested sending in the feds.

Tracy Cannon – once associated with the Vice Lords – says it won’t matter. “I don’t care how many police they bring in. It’s not going to stop, man.”

Guys on the street say law enforcement made a bad situation worse. “They locked up these gang chiefs and everything went haywire,” says Charles Winters. Large organizations like the Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords subdivided over unresolved disputes. Absent leadership, cliques within the same gang will often do battle. “Ain’t like it used to be,” says Cannon. “Back then we had structure. Older guys would make us go to school. Even though we was gang banging, we would still go to school.”

Now, it’s a bullet-ridden free for all, with gangsters trying to gain respect by proving themselves to be ruthless. “Kids only care about nice clothes, fast money and how many kills they can get,” says Britt. “When they get a certain amount of kills or when they hurt a certain amount of people, they feared. They got the fear factor going on. The kids nowadays in Chicago, that’s what they want.”

The guy from the Black Disciples says the gang is all he’s even been able to rely on and he’ll never leave gangster life. “If I live by this gun and I live by these drugs, this product that I’m selling, and I’m pushing in this neighborhood. It’s putting food on my table and food in my kids’ mouths and a roof over they heads, then I’m not going to put it down,” he says.

Others say the violent gang life is for kids. If they live into their 20s and stay out of prison some walk away and get jobs. “You just get played out man,” says Cannon. “If you ain’t rich by now, you ain’t gonna get rich selling drugs.”

Lisa Williams, whose flight arrived at the Raleigh-Durham Airport in North Carolina Tuesday, said passengers were asked to stay in their seats so they could let someone off the aircraft first, WPVI reported.

Soldiers unloaded a flag-draped coffin from the plane’s cargo area and then T.J. Thomas, the wife of Officer Shawn Thomas, stepped off the plane to grieve the loss of her husband.

“It was an honor to fly home with this PATRIOT! God bless his wife and family. There was not a dry eye around me,” Lisa Williams wrote on a Facebook post. She said the plane remained silent as passengers started to cry.

AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY, AMERICA'S HEROES ARE NEVER BURIED ALONE

Seven Green Beret soldiers later loaded the coffin into a black hearse and paid their respects, while the pilot thanked passengers for waiting.

Thomas – a 35-year-old who had been deployed in Niger to help train local troops and residents in the fight against terrorism – died in a non-vehicle combat crash on Feb. 2, according to the Army Times.

He had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan seven times and earned two Bronze stars, four Good Conduct Medals and was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal for his work in central Africa, the Army Times reported. He was stationed at Fort Bragg.

Thomas was buried last week at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and is survived by his wife and four children, Fox 5 reported.

The video has more than 5 million views and Williams said Thomas reached out to her to thank her for capturing the moment.

High levels of unemployment, even among the educated, create immense pressure on young people to find work, and more so for a secure government job.

In the congested southern city of Hyderabad, the open grounds outside the City Central Library turn into a giant outdoor classroom every day when hundreds of young college students and job-seekers, armed with books and other study materials, sit and prepare for examinations till late at night. Many of them bring their own chairs, which they chain overnight to the outer metal grill of the building.

P. Venkateshwarlu, a 27-year-old preparing for a government accountant's job, said he found the quiet ambience of the library grounds more conducive for studying.

"My room is small and noisy. The serenity of the library premises helps," Venkateshwarlu said as he set up his chair with a wooden board that would serve as a desk for the next few hours.

Several international companies have their India headquarters in Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states. Every year, millions of young people from small towns and villages head to the city in search of education and jobs. Scores of colleges and cram schools have come up near the library, preparing aspirants in their search for admission to university or a secure job.

Among the crowds of students sitting and studying are many young women who find the library a safe place to study.

"I find this a calm place to prepare for my examinations," said V. Chandrika, a 19-year-old college student who lives in a hostel nearby. "I feel inspired to work hard just by watching everybody else here working till late in the evening."Days after his apparent assassination, Kim Jong Nam's body remained under guard in a Malaysian morgue Friday, with no one in his immediate family stepping forward on behalf of a man who lived in fear of his half brother, the powerful and mercurial ruler of North Korea.

South Korea was quick to accuse its enemies in North Korea of dispatching a hit squad to kill Kim Jong Nam at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, saying two female assassins poisoned him and then fled in a taxi.

THIRD PERSON ARRESTED IN KILLING OF KIM JONG UN'S HALF-BROTHER

Although Kim Jong Nam is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau, police in Malaysia say none has come forward to claim the body or provide DNA samples in the aftermath of what appeared to be a well-executed hit.

North Korean diplomats in Malaysia have requested custody of Kim Jong Nam's body, arguing that he had a North Korean passport. The officials objected to the autopsy, but Malaysian authorities went ahead with the procedure anyway because they did not receive a formal complaint.

(Star TV via AP) (Star TV)

Investigators were still trying to piece together details of the case, and South Korea has not said how it concluded that North Korea was behind the killing.

Malaysian police were questioning three suspects — two women and a man — and waiting for autopsy results that could shed light on why Kim Jong Nam suddenly fell ill at the airport as he waited for a flight home to Macau.

Dizzy and in pain, he told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. Within two hours, Malaysian officials said, he was dead.

Kim Jong Nam, who was 45 or 46, had lived in exile for years and was estranged from his younger half brother, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He reportedly fell out of favor in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

DID A SOUTH KOREAN NEWS REPORT DOOM KIM JONG UN'S BROTHER?

Yoji Gomi, a Japanese journalist who wrote a book about Kim Jong Nam, said he criticized the family regime and believed a leader should be chosen "through a democratic process."

Gomi said he met Kim Jong Nam by chance at Beijing's international airport in 2004, leading to exchanges of 150 emails and two interviews in 2011 — one in Beijing and another in Macau — totaling seven hours.

Kim Jong Nam appeared nervous during the interview in Macau, Gomi said.

"He must have been aware of the danger, but I believe he still wanted to convey his views to Pyongyang via the media," Gomi said. "He was sweating all over his body, and seemed very uncomfortable when he responded to my questions. He was probably worried about the impact of his comments and expressions. The thought now gives me a pain in my heart."

Malaysia said Friday it wants DNA samples from Kim Jong Nam's family as part of the post-mortem procedure and that officials were not yet willing to hand the body over to the North Koreans.

"If there is no claim by next-of-kin and upon exhausting all avenues (to obtain DNA), we will finally then hand over the body to the (North Korean) embassy," said Abdul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official.

He would not speculate on how long that process might take.

Meanwhile, investigators were focused on getting details from three suspects in their custody: 25-year-old Indonesian woman Siti Aisyah; a Malaysian man believed to be her boyfriend; and a young woman who was picked up carrying Vietnamese travel documents.

The three were arrested separately on Wednesday and Thursday.

The women were identified using surveillance videos from the airport, police said. Early Friday, police took the pair back to the crime scene at the budget terminal of the airport "for further investigations," Abdul Samah said. Local media reported that police wanted to recreate the crime scene to establish new leads.

In Indonesia, Aisyah's family and former neighbors said they were stunned by her arrest, describing her as a polite and quiet young mother.

Between 2008 and 2011 she and her then-husband lived in a home with flaking red paint in a narrow alley of Tambora, a densely populated neighborhood in western Jakarta.

Her former father-in-law, Tjia Liang Kiong, who lives in a nearby middle-class neighborhood and last saw Aisyah on Jan. 28, described her as respectful.

"I was shocked to hear that she was arrested for murdering someone," he said. "I don't believe that she would commit such a crime or what the media says — that she is an intelligence agent."

Aisyah's mother, Benah, said by telephone that the family comes from a humble village background and has no ability to help her.

"Since we heard that from the television, I could not sleep and eat. Same as her father, he just prays and reads the holy Quran. He even does not want to speak," said Benah. "As villagers, we could only pray."

According to Kiong, Aisyah only completed junior high school and moved to Malaysia with her husband in 2011 to seek a better life after the garment-making shop they ran from their home went out of business. The couple left their nearly 2-year-old son in Jakarta under the care of Kiong and his wife.

She and her husband divorced in 2012.

Malaysia, which is approaching developed-nation income levels, is a magnet for millions of Indonesians, who typically find work there as bar hostesses, maids and construction and plantation workers.

Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla said Aisyah probably had been manipulated.

"From the information we have received and also what was circulating in the media, what has happened in Kuala Lumpur is Kim Jong Nam and Aisyah were victims," Kalla said. "Aisyah was a victim of some sort of manipulation or fraud."Donald Trump, [was] largely elected president because he promised to reform Washington. Millions of Americans are fed up with intellectually dishonest politicians were not looking up for them.

Mr. Trump portrayed the nation's capital as a swamp. Here’s what he said on November 7 in Sarasota, Florida:

"I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we all are about to say. When we win tomorrow, we are going to drain the swamp!"

But for every action, there is a reaction. And the law of unintended consequences is now hitting President Trump. And that's because the swamp is inhabited by many different creatures -- some of whom want to destroy the president.

Right now, the national media despises Mr. Trump, as we have pointed out, and backed up with facts.

Also, some folks working for the federal government want to damage the president. – That’s why you are seeing the leaks from intelligence agencies and other federal bureaucracies.

Now, all presidents have to deal with leaks. But in this political climate, the press gleefully, gleefully accepts information from anonymous sources and spins it negative against Trump.

As we pointed out on Wednesday night, the public and press don't know what General Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador. We will know. But we don't now.

Also, whether there is any truth to allegations that people working on the Trump campaign had meaningful contact with the Russia government. We don't know.

Here’s what civil rights activist Al Sharpton said on February 15 on the Tom Joyner radio show:

“If there was dialogue and negotiations with the Russians, with the Russians, which is clearly against the law, and clearly an act that cannot be pardoned. If the president knew while it was going on, and it did not stop it, or in some way authorized it, that can be impeachable.”

That’s just bull.

It’s not against the law for anyone to talk with any Russian. General Flynn had no power other than being a private citizen, when the call with the Russian ambassador to took place. In order for him to have committed a crime, he would have had to attempt to formally attempt to undermine the Obama administration’s Russian policy. So Sharpton is full of it, as always.

Now, there is a report Thursday that says General Flynn may have lied to the FBI. And we've mentioned that. If it’s true, that is a crime. So, we'll see.

As "Talking Points" reported last night, there are two goals here. First, to leak the Trump campaign to the Russian hackers, who disrupted the Clinton campaign. And the second, to try to prove that President-elect Trump was undermining President Obama on Russian policy back in December. That is what the media goal is, that’s what they want.

Also, as we said Wednesday night, if there’s truth to those allegations, they should be taken very seriously, when the facts are presented.

When President Trump first mentioned draining the swamp in Washington, I don't believe he understood how extensive the problem really is. After eight years of President Obama, there are many people working in the federal government who like the former president and who despise Mr. Trump.



Eliminating all of them, and stopping the leaks, would pretty much be impossible. Also, trying to get fairness out of the anti-Trump press is impossible, as well.

So, the Trump administration has its hands full.

Adapted from Bill O’Reilly’s “Talking Points Memo” on February 16, 2017.Professional wrestler George "The Animal" Steele died at age 79, the WWE said in a statement.

Steele, whose real name is William James Myers was one of the WWE's most wild and outrageous stars.

Known for his green tongue and hairy chest, "The Animal" received a master's degree from Central Michigan University and was a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Michigan.

While he was teaching, he began to book gigs in the pro-wrestling world. His first WWE appearance was in 1967 when he began his rivalry against WWE champ Bruno Sammartino.

The WWE Hall of Famer continued to make wrestling appearances through the 2000s.

He is survived by his wife Pat, their two sons Dennis and Randy and daughter, Felicia.Todd Krieg can't feel anything below his chest after he was paralyzed in a dirt bike accident in 2014, so he and fiancee Amanda Diesen figured they'd need help conceiving a child someday.

Not so: The couple recently found themselves unexpectedly pregnant, and their somewhat irreverent pregnancy announcement quickly went viral after they posted it on social media this week.

It features Diesen, 25, holding an ultrasound photo as Krieg, 23, makes a triumphant face in front of a brick wall reading, "It still works!" "It kind of started out as a joke, because I was like, that's so inappropriate," Diesen tells People.

"But we ended up doing it," says Krieg. Diesen got the idea for the photo while trying to find pregnancy announcements featuring dads in wheelchairs; one of the few she found featured the dad holding a sign reading, "I did that." The couple met in September 2015 at a paralysis center in California where Diesen was working as a recovery specialist.

After falling in love, Diesen returned to Krieg's hometown in Ohio with him. They currently live with his parents, and they tell Today they "definitely weren't trying to have a baby," figuring they'd get married first and then start trying in a few years.

During their pregnancy announcement photo shoot, Krieg proposed. As for the mechanics of how, exactly, "it still works," Diesen explains, "Todd does not feel it when stuff is going on, but is occasionally able to reach climax." Krieg adds that, after one of those times, "We were like, 'Uh-oh, we should get a pregnancy test.'" In their contest entry for a Brides wedding competition, the couple says doctors told them it would be "nearly impossible to conceive naturally," but now a little boy is on the way in August.

(Another moving pregnancy announcement.)

On the roster: Dear reporters (again): This is not about you - E-P-Yeas beat nays to confirm Pruitt - Meet Trump’s pick for Labor secretary - Power Play: One month later…- Date night!

DEAR REPORTERS (AGAIN): THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU

The only people more obsessed with media coverage than President Trump are the members of the media themselves.

Understanding that, Trump knew the way to gain some altitude after a rough takeoff in his first month in office.

“That’s how I won,” Trump taunted at his White House press conference on Thursday, “I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure.”

And he’s right. Pugilistic press conferences in which he turned reporters into foils and objects of derision helped him win the presidency. So too did rallies in which he directed his supporters’ disgust at members of the political press penned in the back of the hall like veal calves waiting to be made into scaloppini.



Reporters know this and yet cannot resist Trump’s trolling. He even accurately previewed the coverage of his schticky presser.

“Tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, ‘Donald Trump rants and raves,’” Trump said in a comedic accent that sounded like your Great Aunt Matilda complaining about slow service at her country club.

And he called it. Here’s a sampling of choice adjectives from the headlines of major media outlets: “chaotic,” “combative,” “erratic,” “puzzling” and “wild.”



Rather than focusing on actual news, coverage of the event sounded like reviews for an experimental Broadway show in which the critics themselves played a starring role. So deep is the self-regard of journalists that even when they know it is hurting them, they cannot resist an opportunity to talk about themselves and their profession.



Let’s get one thing straight: Media criticism is the asbestos abatement of journalism. It’s a dirty job that should be left to experienced professionals, but generally avoided by everyone else.

In 2017 America, however, everyone from the president to your barista sounds like they’re working up a think piece for the Columbia Journalism Review. So it pains us to have to repeat for a second time what should be an obvious truth to the other members of our profession: This is not about you.

Your readers and viewers do not care whether you are offended by the president’s evident distain for you and our profession. Trump hates you. So do many of his supporters. That is not going to change. Get over it.

How much does Trump hate you?

Look at the way he spoke to Jake Turks, a reporter for an Orthodox Jewish newspaper in Brooklyn. Trump called on him looking for a “friendly reporter.” Turks was evidently trying to oblige the president with a softball question that giving Trump the opportunity to declare his love for Jewish Americans and denounce anti-Semitism, something he has done many times before.

Instead, Trump shamed the young man, telling him to “sit down,” interrupting him even before he could finish. Trump called it “not a fair question.” Neither did Trump think that American Urban Radio Network’s correspondent April Ryan was asking a fair question either when she wanted to know whether Trump was going to include the Congressional Black Caucus in his strategy for dealing with decaying inner cities.

But Trump mocked her, insinuating that she was in the tank for the CBC.

“Tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?” Trump scoffed, “Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours? Set up a meeting.”

Let’s stipulate that these are not nice things to say. Let’s stipulate further that no prior president would have said this to them in a press conference. Let’s also stipulate that they were hurtful to their targets’ feelings.

But you did not get into this business to have your feelings valued and respected by your subjects. If you are doing it right, you came here to serve your readers and viewers and fulfill your patriotic obligation as a practitioner of the only profession with its own line item in the Bill of Rights.

If you become part of the story, you are failing in a catastrophic way. Actual reporters debated with a sitting president of the United States about the ratings of their network, the validity of their reporting and the fairness of their questions.

Voters do not care about your feelings. And they don’t care about you, except for in your ability to fairly, quickly and accurately bring them the story in its proper context. All of the bellyaching about Trump’s media bashing represents time that would be better spent on covering the actual news.

If you doubt any of that, just look at how successful Trump was in shifting the conversation away from tumult and division within his administration, a failed cabinet nomination and lingering questions about Russian efforts to compromise him and his team.

The story has changed, and Trump’s base, which was starting to have reason to wonder when all of the #MAGAing was going to get started and whether their man was in over his head, are back on their feet and cheering.

Never forget, that for many Republicans, the media is an object of more intense hatred than are Democrats (insofar as they see any difference between the two).

Now, as Noah Rothman points out, media bashing is a dry well for Trump or any Republican. Just as most Americans don’t care about the hurt feelings and worries of reporters, they don’t spend too much time feeling sorry for politicians who complain about their coverage. You don’t change any minds in the middle by fixating on your bad press clippings.

Similarly, many conservative journalists and pundits use media criticism as a crutch to avoid addressing thornier questions about the new administration. Rather than taking a clear-eyed view of what’s going on, they cop out and join Trump in mauling the mainstream media for unfair coverage or past failures to hold Democrats to account.

Get over that, too. We are far enough down the path with the new administration and there are more than enough policy proposals on the table to move beyond reflexive media criticism.

The truth is Trump is pretty unpopular for a new president with just a 42 percent job approval rating by the Gallup benchmark, but Americans are positive about his qualities as a leader and as a change agent.

Like other presidents who have had bumpy beginnings, Trump may, like Bill Clinton in 1993, right his ship and learn how to be an effective executive, or, like Jimmy Carter 40 years ago, he may remain capsized.

We don’t know. That’s what we’re here to figure out. So go do it.

THE RULEBOOK: FREEDOM TO SERVE

“A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible, free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 25

TIME OUT: THE MAN COMES AROUND

Rolling Stone: “While the legend of Johnny Cash is heavily steeped in the five decades worth of songs that he wrote, recorded and performed via his unmistakable boom, the Man in Black was also an incredibly productive poet who was just as happy to let his pen do the talking… With the help of author Paul Muldoon, [John Carter Cash] pored over his father’s vast catalog of unreleased material to find the pieces that both resonated the deepest and felt most complete. Their combined efforts resulted in a rich collection of poems written by Cash throughout his life…Love, mortality, addiction, humor, spirituality, pain, wonder, hope, heartbreak, freedom and resignation all weave in and out of Cash’s poetry – just as they did in his songs – in an attempt to paint the most accurate portrait of his true self.”

E-P-YEAS BEAT NAYS TO CONFIRM PRUITT

USA Today: “The Senate voted Friday to confirm Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency despite a last-ditch effort by Democrats to delay the vote after a judge ruled that Pruitt must release about 3,000 emails relating to his communication with oil, gas and coal companies while he served as Oklahoma's attorney general. The vote was 52-46 to confirm Pruitt. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine voted against Pruitt's confirmation. Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia joined the rest of the Republicans in voting to approve him.”

MEET TRUMP’S PICK FOR LABOR SECRETARY

Miami Herald: “When the Justice Department named R. Alexander Acosta the new U.S. attorney in South Florida in 2005, he was largely an unknown to federal prosecutors in Miami. Many viewed him with suspicion because he had never tried any criminal cases, and some feared he would carry the torch of the arch-conservative bosses that President George W. Bush had picked to run the Justice Department — John Ashcroft and his successor, Alberto Gonzales. Acosta, who grew up in Miami, had lost touch with his roots after attending Harvard University and pursuing a career in Washington. But the Republican gradually reconnected with South Florida, won over his skeptics and gained the respect of leaders in the local legal and law enforcement establishment.”

FLYNN MISLED FBI ABOUT RUSSIA TALKS

WaPo: “Former national security adviser Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U.S. officials said. The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense. But several officials said it is unclear whether prosecutors would attempt to bring a case, in part because Flynn may parse the definition of the word ‘sanctions.’ He also followed his denial to the FBI by saying he couldn’t recall all of the conversation, officials said. Any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“It’s not just West Virginians with sloppy thumbbbs! I’m glad to know my favorite prognosticator is mobile. How about those West Virginia miners? I’m from Washington State, but my chest still swelled with pride. No one says we still get 60% of our power from coal mines. Why not? Keep it up. Balance is needed.” – Ace Weems, Silverdale, Wash.

[Ed. note: It’s been a long time since coal constituted 60 percent of the nation’s electric load. A combination of cheap natural gas, increasing production costs for coal and enormous regulations on both the extraction and burning of coal, have left America’s most abundant fuel in pretty poor shape these days, relative to the past century. Coal is now the source of something less than 40 percent of the nation’s electricity. And whatever Trump does, that’s not likely to spike anytime soon because of other market forces. The great relief for the industry is that the decline may be arrested or even just slowed.]



“I’m coming to your defense, and I’m sure I won’t be the only one. In the sample sentence, ‘honing’ would be correct, just as you first used it. The Free Dictionary defines honing: ’to focus the attention or make progress achieving an objective.’ I think that definition works great and I’ve used it that way many times. I look forward to the Halftime Report every day. Keep up the good work.” – Danny Bass, Burleson, Texas

DATE NIGHT!

C-VILLE Weekly: “When the time is right, they crawl. Once a year, over the span of a couple warm, wet nights, a local population of more than 1,000 spotted salamanders makes the 100-yard trek from their forested homes to their vernal pool breeding grounds, crossing Rio Mills and Polo Grounds roads. Though they can grow to be about 8 inches long, the salamanders often go unnoticed by drivers in the middle of night and have a fatal encounter…Donning headlamps and with their vehicles parked along the road…a small group of volunteers take to the Route 29 site each year to perform a ‘salamander rescue night,’ during which they carry the critters across the road and talk with any amused or confused drivers who are interrupted by the group’s samaritanship…But the largest success for spotted salamander fans? A proposed underpass system that would allow the polka-dotted amphibians to migrate under the roads safely. A 40-foot apron at the entrance to the tunnels would guide the salamanders along the path to safety.”

His father and his brother, joined by several doctors and nurses at Mayo Clinic, watched as he studied his swollen features. He was just starting to heal from one of the rarest surgeries in the world — a face transplant, the first at the medical center. He had the nose, cheeks, mouth, lips, jaw, chin, even the teeth of his donor. Resting in his hospital bed, he still couldn’t speak clearly, but he had something to say.

He scrawled four words in a spiral notebook:

THIS WEEK IN PICTURES

“Far exceeded my expectations,” he wrote, handing it to Dr. Samir Mardini, who read the message to the group.

“You don’t know how happy that makes us feel,” Mardini said, his voice husky with emotion as he looked at the patient-turned-friend he had first met nearly a decade earlier.

The exchange came near the end of an extraordinary medical journey that revolved around two young men. Both were rugged outdoorsmen and both just 21 when, overcome by demons, they decided to kill themselves: One, Sandness, survived but with a face almost destroyed by a gunshot; the other man died.

Their paths wouldn’t converge for years, but when they did — in side-by-side operating rooms — one man’s tragedy offered hope that the other would have a second chance at a normal life.

‘Please don’t let me die’

It was two days before Christmas in 2006 when Andy Sandness reached a breaking point.

He’d been sad and drinking too much lately. That night after work while “super, super depressed,” he grabbed a rifle from a closet. He stared at it for a while, then put a round in the chamber. He positioned the barrel beneath his chin, took a deep breath and pulled the trigger.

Instantly, he knew he’d made a terrible mistake. When the police arrived, an officer who was a friend cradled him in his arms as Sandness begged, “Please, please don’t let me die! I don’t want to die!”

He was rushed from his home in eastern Wyoming, treated at two hospitals, then transferred to Mayo Clinic. When he woke, his mother was holding his hand. She’d always been a strong woman but that day, her face was a portrait of unfathomable pain. The bullet had obliterated his mouth, so he motioned for a pen and paper.

“I’m sorry,” he wrote.

“I love you,” she replied. “It’s OK.” But all Sandness could think about was how he’d hurt his family — and just wonder what was next.

The answer came quickly when he met Mardini, a plastic surgeon whose specialty is facial reconstruction. As a newcomer at Mayo, the doctor was on call Christmas Eve. Over the next few days, he reassured Sandness that he’d fix his face as best he could.

“I just need you to be strong and patient,” he said.

It would take time and much surgery. And despite their skills, the doctors couldn’t miraculously turn him back into that guy with the orthodontist-perfected smile

Sandness couldn’t bear to see himself, so he covered his hospital room mirror with a towel. He had no nose and no jaw. He’d shot out all but two teeth. His mouth was shattered, his lips almost non-existent. He’d lost some vision in his left eye. He needed breathing and feeding tubes at first.

Mardini and his team removed dead tissue and shattered bones, then connected facial bones with titanium plates and screws. They reconstructed his upper jaw with bone and muscle from the hip; they transferred bone and skin from a leg to fashion the lower jaw. They used wires and sutures to bring together his eyelids, which had been spread apart because of the powerful blast.

They made progress, even if it didn’t always look that way.

After about eight surgeries over 4½ months, Sandness returned home to Newcastle, Wyoming, a hamlet of 3,200, where friends and family embraced him. He worked at a lodge, in the oil fields, and as an electrician’s apprentice.

But his world had shrunk. When he ventured to the grocery store, he avoided eye contact with children so he wouldn’t scare them. Occasionally, he heard them ask their mothers why he looked that way.

He sometimes lied when folks asked what had happened. “I would tell them it was a hunting accident,” he says. “I felt like they didn’t need to know.” He had almost no social life; on a rare night out to shoot pool, a guy taunted him about his appearance. He retreated to the hills, where he could hunt elk and fish walleye, unseen.

“Those were real tough times for him,” says his father, Reed. “He was insecure. Who wouldn’t be?”

Sandness learned to adapt. His mouth was about an inch wide — too small for a spoon — so he tore food into bits, then sucked on them until he could swallow the pieces. He wore a prosthetic nose but it constantly fell off outdoors; he carried glue to reattach it. It discolored often, so he had to paint it to match his skin.

“You never fully accept it,” he says. “You eventually say, ‘OK, is there something else we can do?'” There was, but the prospect of 15 more surgeries Mardini had mapped out scared him. He didn’t want more skin grafts, more scars or dental implants. Even then, he’d still look deformed.

Over the next five years, Sandness made yearly visits to Mayo. Then in spring of 2012, he received a life-changing call.

Mardini told him it looked like Mayo was going to launch a face transplant program and Sandness might be an ideal patient. The doctor had already begun traveling to France, Boston, and Cleveland to meet doctors who’d done face transplants.

Mardini tried to temper his patient’s enthusiasm. “Think very hard about this,” he said. Only about two dozen transplants have been done around the world, and he wanted Sandness to understand the risks and the aftermath: a lifelong regimen of anti-rejection drugs.

But Sandness could hardly contain himself. “How long until I can do this?” he asked.

He followed Mardini’s advice to research the surgery. It was far more complicated than he’d imagined, but he was undeterred.

“When you look like I looked and you function like I functioned, every little bit of hope that you have, you just jump on it,” he says, “and this was the surgery that was going to take me back to normal.”

A second chance

Three more years passed as Sandness waited.

By then, Mayo Clinic had completed a long internal review to get the face transplant program approved. Sandness had to undergo a rigorous psychiatric and social work evaluation to address, among other things, a key question: Should this surgery be performed on someone who’d attempted suicide?

Several factors were in his favor: His resilience and motivation, a strong support network of family and friends, a long-standing rapport with Mardini, and a gap of several years since the shooting. Doctors also noted others with self-inflicted injuries, such as excessive drinkers, have received liver transplants.

“I don’t think there’s anybody who doesn’t deserve a second chance,” Mardini says.

Asked by the doctors what he expected from the transplant, to make sure he had realistic goals, Sandness said he wanted a working nose, the ability to bite, swallow, chew, and to “get good stares as opposed to bad stares.”

These incremental steps benefited everyone, says Dr. Hatem Amer, Mayo’s medical director of reconstructive transplantation.

“He wasn’t rushing us, and we weren’t rushing him,” he says. “He really understood what he was embarking upon.”

Sandness says he was concerned both about the possibility of rejection and potential side effects of anti-rejection drugs, including skin cancer, infection, diabetes, and weakening of the bones.

Mardini and his team devoted more than 50 Saturdays over 3½ years to rehearsing the surgery, using sets of cadaver heads to transplant the face of one to another. They used 3-D imaging and virtual surgery to plot out the bony cuts so the donor’s face would fit perfectly on Sandness.

In January 2016, Sandness’s name was added to the waiting list of the United Network for Organ Sharing.

Mardini figured it would take up to five years to find the right donor: a man with matching blood and tissue types, roughly the same size as Sandness, within a 10-year age range and a close skin tone.

But just five months later, Mardini got a call: There might be a donor. He phoned Sandness, cautioning it was just a possibility.

The next day, Mardini got the final word: The donor’s family had said OK.

The decision came from a 19-year-old newlywed mourning the sudden loss of her husband.

In early June, Calen “Rudy” Ross fatally shot himself in the head. His devastated widow, Lilly, was eight months pregnant.

Despite her grief, she was committed to carrying out her husband’s wishes: On his driver’s license, Ross, who lived in Fulda, Minn., had designated he wanted to be an organ donor. Lilly met with a coordinator from LifeSource, a nonprofit group that works with families in the upper Midwest to facilitate organ and tissue donation.

Since Ross had been healthy and just 21, his heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys could be transplanted. But additional screening determined he could do even more: He was a good match for a man awaiting a face transplant at Mayo Clinic.

In a second conversation, LifeSource broached the idea to Lilly.

“I was skeptical at first,” she says. “I didn’t want to walk around and all of a sudden see Calen.” She was reassured the donor had his own eyes and forehead and would not be recognizable as her husband. After consulting with her husband’s best friend, she gave her consent.

A CT scan, other tests, and a photo sent to Mardini by LifeSource confirmed the two men were a good match. Mardini said when the doctors studied Ross’s photo, “we got chills when we actually saw how close they were in hair color, skin — just the overall look. It could be his cousin.”

Late on June 16, Sandness was wheeled into surgery, accompanied by Mardini, who was showing him photos of his two small children. Over the years, the two say they’ve become as close as brothers.

“There was not a second of doubt that everything was going to go well,” Sandness says.

“Everybody went into this totally knowing their role, knowing what to expect,” Mardini recalls. “Every step has been thought out 1,000 times.”

Mardini had a parting message: “We’re looking forward to seeing you with a new face.”

In adjoining operating rooms, some 60 surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, and others had gathered for what would be a 56-hour marathon.

The surgery that started shortly before midnight Friday was over early Monday morning.

It took about 24 hours to procure the donor’s face, which involved taking bone, muscle, skin and nerves, and almost the same time to prepare Sandness. His entire face was rebuilt below his eyes, taking an additional 32 hours. The medical team rotated, many taking four-hour breaks through the weekend.

One of the most intricate parts of the surgery was identifying facial nerve branches on both men and stimulating them with an electric current to determine their function. That allowed doctors to make the correct transfers, so when Sandness thinks about smiling or closing his eyes, for example, those movements actually happen.

After the surgery ended, Mardini proclaimed it “a miracle.”

Sandness, who was sedated for several days, wasn’t allowed to see himself immediately. His room mirror and cell phone were removed. His father, Reed, served as his eyes.

“I said, ‘Andy, I’ve never lied to you. I’m telling you you’re going to be happy with what you see,'” he recalls. “He was quizzing me and the nurses all the time.”

Three weeks later, when he finally did see his face — a scene captured on a Mayo video — his father says it “was just a real tearful, hard-to-hold-back time … beyond our wildest dreams.”

Sandness was overwhelmed. “Once you lose something that you’ve had forever, you know what it’s like not to have it,” he says. “And once you get a second chance to have it back, you never forget it.”

Just having a nose and mouth are blessings, he says. “The looks are a bonus.”

Months earlier, both he and Lilly Ross had expressed interest in learning about each other. She particularly wanted him to know about her husband, an adventurous, spontaneous guy.

Last fall, she wrote to Sandness and the five others who received her husband’s organs. She described Ross, her high school sweetheart, as a “giving person” who loved hunting, trapping, and being with his dog, Grit. “I am filled with great joy knowing that he was able to give a little of himself to ensure a better quality of life for someone else,” she wrote.

As for the face transplant, she thought of her baby son when she agreed to it. “The reason that I decided to … go through with it was so that I can later down the road show Leonard what his dad had done to help somebody,” she said in a video produced by LifeSource.

Lilly was given photos of Sandness before and after the transplant. That’s when she learned of uncanny similarities between the two men — not just their passion for the outdoors, but the way they stood in their hunting photos. “It was amazing how good he looked and how well he’s doing,” she says of Sandness. “I’m excited for him that he’s getting his life back.”

She also noticed one small detail — a small bare patch in the middle of his bearded chin, just as on her husband’s face.

Both she and Sandness hope to meet one day. For now, he wrote her a letter of appreciation. Referring to her husband’s favorite things, he said: “He’s still going to continue to love hunting and fishing and dogs — through me.”

Andy Sandness can pinpoint the day he looked normal.

About three months after the transplant, he was in an elevator when a little boy glanced at him, then turned to his mother without appearing scared or saying anything. “I knew then,” he says, “that the surgery was a success.”

Last December, he had follow-up surgery to tighten skin on his face and neck and build up bone around his eyes so they’re not so recessed.

His facial muscles are growing stronger. He received speech therapy to learn to use his tongue in a new mouth and jaw, and enunciate clearly.

He’s thrilled to smell again, breathe normally, and be eating foods that were off-limits for a decade: apples, steak, and pizza that he shared with his doctors.

His transformation isn’t just visible. After the shooting, he says, when he dreamed, he still had his old face. Now, his new face appears in his dreams.

Sandness, now 31, plans to return to Wyoming, work as an electrician and, he hopes, marry and have a family someday.

For now, he savors his anonymity. Recently, he attended a Minnesota Wild game. He bought some popcorn. He watched some hockey. He didn’t see any stares or hear any whispers.

He was, as he says, “just another face in the crowd.” Just thinking about that makes him smile.I confess: I was irritated. I’d had a silly squabble with my wife one morning and driven to my office in a fog of grumpiness.

To be clear, no vows were at stake. It was a dumb dispute over preference, not principle.

I rolled into the parking lot and pulled my chair up to my desk. For an hour I watered my pride until it grew heavy and collapsed on its stem. She was right, I was wrong, and no amount of debate gymnastics could change the fact that it didn’t matter anyway.

I picked up my phone and texted an apology. But before I could follow-up with the requisite heart emoji, she’d already replied. “Thank you and I’m sorry too. I want you to know that I love you. Have a great day!”

A thankful smile wriggled its way from the inside out and I was struck yet again by my wife’s ability to forgive my countless shortcomings. That gift of grace and a short memory are just two of the many things I appreciate about her. “I’m a lucky guy,” I said to the family photos on my wall.

On a whim, I grabbed a large, lined notepad on my desk and began a list of things I love about my wife that I’d planned to share later in the day. It started with her ability to forgive, her sense of timing, her eyes and her faith.

When the lines were filled, I flipped to a second page and continued.

Loves America. Hides notes in my suitcase. Loves her in-laws.

When the list hit 20, I opened my laptop and launched my day. But a few hours later, when an issue with one of our children arose, I revisited the list.

Solves problems. Loves our kids. Sees the good in others.

The next day, because the list kept staring at me, I resumed what had become an interesting experiment. I also began to categorize and check for repeats.

Great hair. Holds my hand. Puts God first.

At home I began watching for things to add to my list. Fearful I’d forget them, I started writing them in the notes app on my iPhone.

Grows her talents. Supports my dreams. Is a peacemaker.

When the list topped 100, I wondered — can I hit 200? More? Could it be, I thought, that there are 365 things I love about my wife?

Challenge accepted.

Over the next few days, I pondered every imaginable thing I love about the woman I chose to spend this life and the next with. The more I identified, the more I loved and I began seeing her differently. I better appreciated the enormous work she does as a wife, mother, homeschooler, professional photographer and active Christian.

Soon I’d hit 365 unique things I love and I knew I needed to share them.

Back at my desk, I cut 365 white slips of paper and began writing down each and every item. I wrote until my hand hurt. I wrote until the handwriting was so sloppy it looked like a language I’d invented. I wrote until I was done.

That night, I attached two small wooden boxes to one another and asked my daughter to decorate the front. Then 365 slips went into the front half and the other side remained empty.

The next morning I put the contraption on her dresser and left the house earlier than normal. Then I ended the experiment where it began — with a text message.

The instructions were simple. Read one slip each day and put it the other box. No cheating. No reading ahead.

She was grateful, to be sure, but we haven’t talked about it much since. That wasn’t the point.

Every single day, whether I’m home or at work, still sleeping or on a plane, my wife is reminded of just one of the things I love about her.

Now, I know what you’re thinking, am I up for it?

Well, are you?

Whether it’s your husband or wife, are you up to the 365 Things Challenge?

I invite you to do it my way, your way, do it anyway you like. Just do it. Join me.

Then, when the year is up, maybe we’ll do it all over again.

Curling, a sport that has links with medieval Scotland and is more suited to the Canadian prairies, has taken a small foothold in the Middle East.

Just how new are Qatar's players to the sport? Some of them in Japan for the Asian Winter Games in Sapporo had never experienced snow before.

The fledgling curlers are doing their best to get up to speed but it's a huge challenge when you live in a desert climate. The Qatari women can only train one day a week on ice that is not quite up to international standards.

It's a tough road ahead. Qatar lost 17-1 to Japan on Saturday in a preliminary round game at Sapporo Curling Stadium.

"For now, we are training more to get experience and know more about the game and its strategies," said skip Maryam Binali, who has been throwing stones for just 11 months.

"We learned a lot from the Japanese team today because they are more experienced but hopefully we will do well."

University student Binali said she likes the sense of teamwork that the sport provides.

Players in Qatar train on a public rink shared by figure skaters and ice hockey players. There are only two ice rinks in Doha so ice time comes at a premium.

Soccer is the most popular sport in Qatar but the country is looking to broaden its sporting horizons — even to winter sports.

The Qatari women's team is coached by Hungarian Lajos Belleli, who is a seven-time Hungarian national champion.

"(Curling) is totally new and strange, a winter sport in one of the hottest countries in the world," Belleli said. "Curling is totally new there so I have to convince people that this will be good for them, which is not easy but a nice challenge."

So far there are just seven female players — and 15 male curlers — in Qatar, which is the only country in the Middle East that has joined the World Curling Federation.

Qatar could take inspiration from Japan, a country that has rapidly developed in the sport.

Japan's women's team is ranked sixth and won the silver medal in the 2016 world championships.

"Curling is a sport that traditionally has only been played in countries that have winter sports," said Kate Caithness, president of the World Curling Federation. "But we can play the sport anywhere and want to make it a truly global sport."Los Angeles authorities are investigating a report that Justin Bieber allegedly head butted a man during an argument at a Sunset Strip restaurant.

According to the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, a witness reported seeing the 22-year-old pop star fighting with two bartenders at a West Hollywood restaurant before head butting a patron early Saturday morning.

JUSTIN BIEBER HIT AT CELEBRITY HOCKEY GAME

The department also stated Bieber and the bartenders left by the time deputies arrives. The restaurant was not named.

The patron allegedly hit by Bieber had no visible injuries and did not file a police report. However, an investigation has been proceeded in case the person wants to pursue a case later.

Emails sent by the Associated Press to Bieber’s representatives were not returned.

This isn’t the only legal the “Sorry” singer is facing. Cleveland police are also investigating him after a Las Vegas man reported that Bieber punched him in June.A non-verbal Disney enthusiast may see her fairytale ending come to life after landing a chance to pitch her story ideas to the creators of Disney Junior’s "Doc McStuffin’s" TV Show. Erin Feeney, who has cerebral palsy and is confined to a wheelchair, learned of her unique opportunity after attending the Disney on Ice show “Follow Your Heart” in Chicago, Fox 5 NY reported.

The show’s writer, Shea Fontana, met with 25-year-old Feeney after the show and told her she had read her work before coming to Chicago. Feeney’s book, “Kids in Toyland,” was recently made into a prize-winning movie short, Fox 5 NY reported. Fontana called Feeney talented, and said "Doc McStuffin’s" would be a great fit for her ideas.

“'Doc McStuffin's' is all about kids having this acceptance, and realizing that no matter what, no matter what life throws at them, they can follow their dreams,” Fontana told Fox 5 NY.

Feeney’s father, Kevin, said simply getting the opportunity to meet a Disney writer is an exciting opportunity for the family.

“Just getting the opportunity, it’s wonderful, it’s almost like a first job,” Kevin told Fox 5 NY.” “How many people actually get their dreams [to] come true? So we’re excited about it.”The National Aviation Hall of Fame is reassuring a congressman that it has no plans to sell a century-old wooden propeller signed by one of the Wright brothers.

The 8 ½ foot spruce propeller from 1915 is the only known airplane artifact with the signature of one of the aviation pioneer siblings, Orville Wright. It is not on public display but is kept at the hall at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton.

The possibility of a sale came up recently when Republican Rep. Mike Turner said his office received complaints about financial mismanagement at the hall of fame and he called for its trustees to "cease and desist" any talk about selling artifacts to raise money, the Dayton Daily News (http://bit.ly/2ksXV2F ) reported.

Hall President and Vice Chairman Michael Quiello denied Turner's allegations and said that any talk about selling the signed propeller was put aside more than two years ago.

The propeller was bought by a former trustee for $37,000 and donated to the hall in 2004. Trustees later rediscovered it in the collection, and the board had it appraised in 2013. It was pegged then at $275,000.

Quiello said the expense to conserve the propeller for public view didn't fit the hall's business and financial plans, and trustees considered selling it for display at another aviation-related site, such as the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington or the Wright airplane factory in Dayton, where a redevelopment project is planned.

"The board now realizes we have something that is not only an artifact, it's a national treasure and this should not be sold to a highest bidder to be placed in somebody's office, or placed in somebody's bar, or sold to a foreign businessman so he can put it on his wall someplace," he told the newspaper. "This belongs literally to the people of the United States and anybody interested in aviation."

The propeller is believed to have been on a Wright-built float plane and, according to an appraisal history, was signed in November 1944 at Orville Wright's Oakwood home.

Information from: Dayton Daily News, http://www.daytondailynews.comTwo F-15s caused a ‘sonic boom’ as they raced from their base in Homestead, Fla., Friday to intercept an unresponsive general aviation aircraft that flew near Palm Beach during a stay by President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

The jets flew at supersonic speeds and residents were startled by the loud boom, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, said in a statement. The two fighters were able to establish communication with the aircraft. This incident occured at about 7 p.m. ET. No further details were immediately available.

"The intent of military intercepts is to have the identified aircraft re-establish communications with local FAA air traffic controllers and instruct the pilot to follow air traffic controllers' instructions to land safely for follow-on action," the statement read.

TRUMP HINTS AT 'BIG ORDER' OF F/A-18 SUPER HORNETS

Earlier this month, a private plane got within 2 nautical miles of Air Force One, which is closer than permitted, while flying over Florida and the incident is being investigated by authorities, Bloomberg reported.

The planes were flying on a parallel route and there was no risk of a collision during the incident, which occurred 30 miles out on Feb. 3, sources told the news agency. President Trump arrived safely at Palm Beach International Airport.

The report said that when Air Force One is in flight, Secret Service agents work with FAA supervisors and monitor for threats.A 26-year-old man has been critically injured by a shark while spear fishing on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

Queensland Ambulance Service Supervisor Ange Timmins says the man was bitten repeatedly on a leg on Saturday as he dived near Hinchinbrook Island off the coast of Queensland state.

She says his friends brought him by boat to the town of Cardwell where ambulance officers stopped his bleeding and stabilized his condition.

He was flown by helicopter in a critical condition 150 kilometers (90 miles) north to the Cairns Base Hospital.Editor's note: The following article originally appeared in City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute.

Call it the Oval Office virus. After less than a month in office, President Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate embraced WikiLeaks and a torrent of leaks about his rival Hillary Clinton’s campaign, has become a champion of government secrecy. In a rowdy, 77-minute press conference Thursday, Trump said he had personally instructed the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation into the leak of embarrassing information about his conversations with foreign leaders and former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn’s contacts with Russia. While it is unusual for a president to ask for such a criminal investigation, or to discuss it publicly, no law prevents him from doing so. “It could be perceived as a political witch hunt,” warned Susan Hennessey, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and former intelligence agency lawyer.

Trump launched his war on leaks—and leakers—two Saturdays ago at a charity dinner at Mar-a-Lago, his “winter White House” in Palm Beach, Florida. When I interviewed him at the Red Cross ball, Trump denounced the leaks of transcripts of his phone conversations with leaders of Australia and Mexico as “disgraceful” and “very dangerous . . . for this country,” and blamed the unauthorized release of the information on “Obama people.” Political holdovers from the previous administration still serving on his White House and National Security Council staff, he said, were being “replaced.”

When leaks continued this week, Trump and top aides expanded the category of likely culprits to include the “intelligence community”—specifically, the “NSA and FBI?” he tweeted. “Just like Russia,” he fumed. White House spokesman Sean Spicer then chimed in, adding Justice Department officials to the legion of suspected loose lips.

Trump is hardly the first president to resent leaks. Barack Obama vowed to run the most open and “transparent” government possible, but wound up overseeing at least nine leak investigations and prosecuting more whistleblowers than all his predecessors combined. David Sanger, my former colleague at the New York Times and a veteran Washington insider, called Obama’s White House the “most closed, control-freak administration I’ve every covered.”

Lisbon's growing popularity with foreigners is compelling the Portuguese government to adapt a military airport for commercial flights.

The government says it plans to modify the little-used Montijo air base on the south side of the River Tagus because the capital's sole international airport is nearing its capacity of 22 million passengers a year.

The number of visitors to Lisbon grew by more than 8 percent last year, after a 5 percent increase in 2015.

Officials said Wednesday they hope the new airport will be operational by 2022. The modification work, which requires approval from environmental authorities, is expected to cost up to 400 million euros ($422 million).

Passengers arriving in Montijo will travel 13 kilometers (8 miles) by ferry or 32 kilometers (20 miles) by road into Lisbon.The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored its sixth straight record high on Thursday, but just barely, while the S&P 500 edged lower due to declining energy stocks.

It was a mixed day on wall Street as investors digested recent gains and sold banks that have been big winners in the "Trump rally" that has seen the S&P 500 rise about 5 percent so far in 2017, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 4 percent.

Signs of an improving economy and promises by President Donald Trump to cut corporate taxes and reduce financial regulations have been behind much of the recent gains. Now, with a strong fourth-quarter earnings season mostly complete, many investors say they need concrete signs of progress from Trump to justify more gains.

"Some of the excitement and enthusiasm over earnings and those Trump growth initiatives is starting to shift to more practical, day-to-day events," said Jeff Kravetz, a Phoenix-based regional investment director of the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank.

The energy sector declined 1.37 percent, following oil prices lower as traders weighed swelling U.S. inventories against possible renewed efforts by major oil producers to reduce a price-sapping glut.

About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, just above the daily average of 6.8 billion over the last 20 sessions.Donald Trump, [was] largely elected president because he promised to reform Washington. Millions of Americans are fed up with intellectually dishonest politicians were not looking up for them.

Mr. Trump portrayed the nation's capital as a swamp. Here’s what he said on November 7 in Sarasota, Florida:

"I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we all are about to say. When we win tomorrow, we are going to drain the swamp!"

But for every action, there is a reaction. And the law of unintended consequences is now hitting President Trump. And that's because the swamp is inhabited by many different creatures -- some of whom want to destroy the president.

Right now, the national media despises Mr. Trump, as we have pointed out, and backed up with facts.

Also, some folks working for the federal government want to damage the president. – That’s why you are seeing the leaks from intelligence agencies and other federal bureaucracies.

Now, all presidents have to deal with leaks. But in this political climate, the press gleefully, gleefully accepts information from anonymous sources and spins it negative against Trump.

As we pointed out on Wednesday night, the public and press don't know what General Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador. We will know. But we don't now.

Also, whether there is any truth to allegations that people working on the Trump campaign had meaningful contact with the Russia government. We don't know.

Here’s what civil rights activist Al Sharpton said on February 15 on the Tom Joyner radio show:

“If there was dialogue and negotiations with the Russians, with the Russians, which is clearly against the law, and clearly an act that cannot be pardoned. If the president knew while it was going on, and it did not stop it, or in some way authorized it, that can be impeachable.”

That’s just bull.

It’s not against the law for anyone to talk with any Russian. General Flynn had no power other than being a private citizen, when the call with the Russian ambassador to took place. In order for him to have committed a crime, he would have had to attempt to formally attempt to undermine the Obama administration’s Russian policy. So Sharpton is full of it, as always.

Now, there is a report Thursday that says General Flynn may have lied to the FBI. And we've mentioned that. If it’s true, that is a crime. So, we'll see.

As "Talking Points" reported last night, there are two goals here. First, to leak the Trump campaign to the Russian hackers, who disrupted the Clinton campaign. And the second, to try to prove that President-elect Trump was undermining President Obama on Russian policy back in December. That is what the media goal is, that’s what they want.

Also, as we said Wednesday night, if there’s truth to those allegations, they should be taken very seriously, when the facts are presented.

When President Trump first mentioned draining the swamp in Washington, I don't believe he understood how extensive the problem really is. After eight years of President Obama, there are many people working in the federal government who like the former president and who despise Mr. Trump.



Eliminating all of them, and stopping the leaks, would pretty much be impossible. Also, trying to get fairness out of the anti-Trump press is impossible, as well.

So, the Trump administration has its hands full.

Adapted from Bill O’Reilly’s “Talking Points Memo” on February 16, 2017.Cassie De Pecol, a 27-year-old traveler from Connecticut, just became the fastest person to visit every country in the world. She is also the first woman to visit every sovereign nation.

She left for her world tour in July 2015, and on February 2 she visited Yemen, the 196th and final country on her list. Her entire journey around the world took 18 months and 26 days, smashing the previous record of three years and three months.

De Pecol is now completing the paperwork to be officially recognized by Guinness World Records.

A post shared by Cassie De Pecol | Official (@expedition_196) on Feb 3, 2017 at 12:26pm PST

De Pecol completed her whirlwind world tour as an ambassador for the International Institute of Peace Through Tourism. Throughout her trip, De Pecol met with mayors and ministers of tourism, presenting them with the organization’s “Declaration of Peace.”

Throughout her journey, De Pecol boarded over 255 flights, planted trees in over 50 countries and went through five passports. She spent between two and five days in each country.

De Pecol told CNN that some of the hardest moments in her journey came when trying to secure visas.

“There have been cases when I post on my Facebook, 'Hi I need help getting into Libya' or 'I need help getting into Syria,' and at that point it's kind of trusting in the unknown, trusting in people," she said.

In order to fund her journey, De Pecol saved $10,000 in babysitting money. She acquired the rest of her $198,000 budget through sponsors. De Pecol also exchanged promotional coverage for stays at eco-hotels around the world.

She also filmed the entire journey and hopes to release her travels as a documentary.

Next up, De Pecol plans to visit Antarctica. But before that, she will race in an Olympic Triathlon in San Diego next month, and in June she will teach a course in how to secure funding to travel the world.After a recent spate of Girl Scout robberies, one California trooper has a happy ending to her ordeal.

Harshita Phardwaj, a 12-year-old scout from Union, Calif. was selling cookies at a booth outside of a Safeway grocery store when she was robbed at gunpoint on Feb. 8.

After the incident, Phardwaj's chapter was reportedly very shaken.

"They are very emotional," Heather Berlew-Hayden of the Girl Scouts of Northern California told KGO. "Very concerned about the safety of other people doing this."

A NEW TYPE OF GIRL SCOUT COOKIE IS FINALLY HERE

The teenage suspect allegedly approached the young cookier seller and her mother, who was watching her, and asked about buying cookies before leaving. A short time later, he returned, brandishing a handgun and demanded cash from the scout's mother before fleeing the scene, according to Union City Patch.

Phardwaj and her mother went unharmed but the thief made off with all the money the scout had earned that night.

While investigating the incident, the Union City police department decided to do more than just seek out the suspect. They decided to cover the lost funds by donating money and buying Phardwaj's remaining cookie supply. In all, the police raised about $1,000 for the local troop.

"At that time, we did what we could to make it, loving and compassionate and healing," said Union City officer Lisa Gratez.

With Girl Scouts out in full force, there was yet another robbery this week.

On Wednesday, three thieves stole $200 worth of Girl Scout cookie sales outside a King Soopers store in Denver, according to ABC 7 Denver.

The store has since announced that they will be reimbursing the local troop for the stolen cookie funds.

Burlew-Hayden is advising scouts across the country to remain vigilant while selling cookies.Anti-racism groups and others plan a rally in Paris in support of victims of police violence, after a young black man was allegedly raped with a police baton in an incident that prompted violent protests in poor suburbs.

Paris police announced a security perimeter in the area of Saturday's rally, and far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen issued a statement urging the government to ban it out of respect for the police.

The 22-year-old man, identified publicly only by his first name Theo, was hospitalized for two weeks. Theo, who worked with local youth in his hometown of Aulnay-sous-Bois northeast of Paris, has become a symbol for minorities who stand up to police violence.

Four officers have been charged in the case, but deny intentional wrongdoing.An ancient marble slab that wound up on display in a midtown Manhattan art gallery after being stolen in Greece 30 years ago has been returned to Greek officials.

The large sarcophagus fragment worth $500,000 was stolen from a burial ground near the port city of Thessaloniki and its whereabouts had long been a mystery despite an international search.

The 400-pound artifact dates from 200 A.D. and depicts a battle between Greek and Trojan warriors, the New York Post reported.

The Royal-Athena Galleries agreed to forfeit the piece when presented evidence of its theft, the paper reported.

The owner of the gallery declined to comment, Courthouse News Service reported.

The Consul General of Greece, Konstantinos Koutras thanked New York State prosecutors for recovering the fragment.

“Sadly, in the past, our country has suffered from the cruel and continued smuggling of its antique artifact, and even to this day, a very important part of our heritage remains scattered throughout the world,” he said.

The piece will be part of an exhibit at the National Archeological Museum in Athens that is open to the public.If an invite-only rooftop lounge or hidden basement club doesn’t feel exclusive enough for you, there’s now a luxury yacht that is being called the “world’s largest floating private members’ club.”

Quintessentially One, as the 720-foot yacht will be called, will go around the world all year, popping up at select high-profile events. The yacht will not only host exclusive parties, but also have an onboard restaurant and hotel where rooms start at about $2,500 per night.

⭐️ #Business • Will this be the largest super yacht?: Concierge company, Quintessentially is building what they say… https://t.co/xfDJjcI1wO pic.twitter.com/Og2m9QmloZ — مدينة تلمســان 🇩🇿 (@Tlemcen_City) February 14, 2017

The yacht is run by Quintessentially, a luxury concierge service which provides services like restaurant reservations, tickets to sold-out events, and opulent travel planning. Membership to the service costs about $18,700 per year.

The yacht will dock where the ultra-wealthy tend to congregate — like the Cannes Film Fest, Monaco Grand Prix, Rio’s Carnival, etc. — and offer overnight accommodations.

“Where the traditional cruise model is to go somewhere, dock and get off, we will dock and people will want to get on,” Aaron Simpson, Quintessentially’s co-founder and chairman, told The Guardian.

The “superyacht” will include 12 residential suites and 112 “lower berth” rooms in a boutique hotel. Guests onboard the yacht will have access to a library, spa, gym, marina, “beach area,” shopping, and a bar/nightclub.

The yacht cost about $264 million to construct. About one-fifth of that was provided by five millionaire friends, who will each have their own suites aboard the vessel.

The ship is scheduled to make its maiden voyage in 2019.Although less than 1 percent of Americans have celiac disease, gluten-free diets remain all the rage in the United States. Yet, a new study suggests a potentially harmful ingredients may be hiding in this trendy type of food.

Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago report that rice flour, which is used as a substitute for wheat, tends to accumulate toxic metals that can increase the risk of cancer, heart disease and neurological illness. The arsenic and mercury get into the rice via fertilizers, soil and water, and other studies have previously linked the toxic metals to rice.

Though preliminary, the latest findings suggest the possible risks of the diet, if adopted voluntarily, may outweigh its much-touted yet clinically unproven benefits, which include bloating and weight gain.

For the study, authors surveyed about 7,480 people about their diet habits, and found that among the 73 people who reported eating gluten free, levels of arsenic in their urine and mercury in their blood were more concentrated than that of the other survey respondents. In fact, compared with the gluten eaters, arsenic levels were nearly twice as high and mercury levels were 70 percent higher in the gluten-free participants.

Seeing as about one-quarter of Americans reported eating gluten free in 2015 — a 67 percent increase from 2013, according to UIC — it’s safe to say you likely know someone who’s consuming said toxic metals.

“In Europe, there are regulations for food-based arsenic exposure, and perhaps that is something we here in the United States need to consider,” study author Maria Argos, assistant professor of epidemiology in the UIC School of Public Health, said in a news release. “We regulate levels of arsenic in water, but if rice flour consumption increases the risk for exposure to arsenic, it would make sense to regulate the metal in foods as well.”

Although consuming those metals is linked with poor health outcomes, Argos noted that more study needs to be done before drawing conclusions about whether going gluten-free itself poses a serious health danger.

However, “These results indicate that there could be unintended consequences of eating a gluten-free diet,” Argos said in the release.

Other experts have noted that gluten-free diets, which are necessary for people with celiac, as gluten can be deadly, also may lead to greater consumption of sugar, fat and calories, which manufacturers add to help make up for lost taste.They say “Don’t mess with Texas” for a reason.

And if the National Football League wants to avoid getting blindsided, it might want to think twice about what that advice means.

Just a week after Houston hosted Super Bowl LI, the League suggested that if the Lone Star State legislature passes a proposed bill requiring people to use the bathroom, locker room or shower rooms and changing room assigned to their biological gender, Texas may forfeit high-profile sports events in the future. Why? Because gay rights groups consider the law tantamount to legalized discrimination against trans-gender people.

The NFL’s threat is nearly identical to one issued by the National Basketball Association and the NCAA, the governing body for collegiate sports, against North Carolina, which has already enacted a similar law.

Earlier this week, Bellwether looked at the nasty standoff between North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature and opponents of the law. The NBA moved this year’s All-Star game, slated for Charlotte, to New Orleans, as punishment for North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill. And the NCAA has threatened to shut the Tar Heel state out of future sports events unless the law, officially known as HR2, is repealed.

North Carolina isn’t backing down, and Texas probably won’t, either, when its bill comes up for a vote next month. "The NBA and the NFL have lost their minds, as well as their moral compass, " says Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. "They are shaking in their sneakers because they're so afraid of political correctness."

“The far left is out of touch on this issue,” says Texas Republican State Senator Lois Kohlkorst, the bill’s chief sponsor. “What I find frustrating is that most people who say they oppose this bill haven’t even read it.”

A former college athlete, Kohlkorst says that the proposal, formally called SB6 but shorthanded as the bathroom bill, covers more than restrooms. For example, if SB6 fails to become law, a player on the men’s basketball team who self-identifies as female can choose the girls’ locker room to suit up and shower in. She warns, “The thought of 15- and 16 –year-old boys and girls showering together at school is something we should think about.”

Women’s groups are now voicing alarm. “We’re hearing from women, especially rape victims, who are offended and traumatized by the thought of a man being in these most intimate places with them,” Kolkhorst says. “This cuts through party lines and goes to our shared system of values.”

She cites internal polling showing SB6 is favored by every ethnic group in Texas but one: white liberal Democrats.

Certainly, trans-gender people – by which I mean those who have undergone medical alteration to make them what they choose to be – should not endure discrimination. But what about those who have not taken such steps? How should they prove they are the gender they say they are? An anatomy exam? Wouldn’t that be the most humiliating test of all?

The NBA and the NCAA declined to talk last week when I called about the North Carolina law. The NFL has issued a statement saying it is inclusive and opposed to discrimination of any kind, but won’t comment further.

Yet none of these sports associations have opened their players’ locker rooms to the opposite gender. Nor have they taken steps to ensure that spectators can enter any bathroom in the stadiums where their games are played.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott thinks the NFL is sticking its faceguard where it doesn’t belong. “The NFL has its own problems,” Abbott told Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel. “The NFL coddled players who refused to stand for the National Anthem. The NFL has its own problems with regards to violence against women. The last thing the NFL needs to do is tell states how to operate.”

NFL referees are pretty good at recognizing offside, when one team wanders into an opponent’s space. Perhaps a quick glance in the mirror would help end this latest, unnecessary scrimmage, and help everyone make the right call.

"Our study shows that prescription-drug monitoring programs are a promising component of a multifaceted strategy to address the opioid epidemic," Ryan Mutter, one of the study authors, said in a phone interview. He is a health economist at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration in Rockville, Maryland.

Mutter and other researchers analyzed annual nationwide surveys of drug use and health from 2004 until 2014, when 36 states implemented prescription-drug monitoring programs, or PDMPs.

PDMPs are state-run electronic databases designed to track prescribing of controlled substances and to identify people at high risk of using opioids for nonmedical purposes. Every state except Missouri now has a drug-monitoring program. Some states have mandatory programs requiring physicians to participate, and other states have voluntary programs.

The study, reported in the journal Addictive Behaviors, found that in states where physicians were required to check an electronic database before writing an opioid prescription, the odds that two or more doctors would be giving pain relievers for nonmedical purposes to a single patient were reduced by 80 percent. States that implemented voluntary monitoring programs showed a 56 percent reduction in the odds of doctor-shopping.

States with mandatory prescription-drug monitoring programs reduced the use of painkillers for nonmedical purposes by an average of 20 days a year, the study found. States with voluntary prescription-drug monitoring program reduced the use of painkillers for nonmedical purposes by an average of 10 days a year.

"Overall, this, as well as other studies, suggests there's promise for prescription-drug monitoring programs," Dr. Stephen W. Patrick said in a phone interview. "But they aren't a panacea."

"We really need a comprehensive approach. It isn't one thing that will help get us out of the opioid epidemic," said Patrick, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. He treats newborns struggling with the symptoms of withdrawal from opioids prescribed to their mothers and was not involved in the new study.

Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1999, deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled, as have sales of opioids, including the painkillers oxycodone (Oxycontin) and hydrocodone (Vicodin).

The number of PDMPs has expanded rapidly across states since 2000, but prior studies have shown mixed results about their effectiveness, the study authors write.

One previous study found that drug-monitoring programs help prevent 10 opioid-overdose deaths a day in the U.S., yet improvements could save another two people a day. States with the most robust programs - ones that tracked a greater number of potentially addictive medications and updated their databases at least weekly - saw the biggest drops in overdose deaths, the previous study showed.

Public health advocates worry that an unintended consequence of drug-monitoring programs could be that opioid users would seek drugs illegally and turn to heroin, the authors write. But the current study found that PDMPs did not lead to an increase in people starting to use heroin.

Lead author Mir M. Ali said in a phone interview he found it "reassuring" that drug-monitoring programs were not responsible for opioid users substituting heroin. Ali is a health economist at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

"In any situation where you're limiting supply, people might begin to substitute," Patrick said. "What we really need to do is focus on how we get control of the prescription opioid epidemic."George Soros' alleged meddling in European politics has caught the attention of Congress.

Concerns about Soros' involvement most recently were raised by the Hungarian prime minister, who last week lashed out at the Soros "empire" and accused it of deploying "tons of money and international heavy artillery."

But days earlier, Republican lawmakers in Washington started asking questions about whether U.S. tax dollars also were being used to fund Soros projects in the small, conservative-led country of Macedonia.

Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., led a group of House lawmakers in writing to Ambassador Jess Baily -- an Obama appointee -- demanding answers. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also expressed concerns about USAID money going to Soros' Open Society Foundations as part of a broader concern that the U.S. Embassy has been taking sides in party politics.

“I have received credible reports that, over the past few years, the US Mission to Macedonia has actively intervened in the party politics of Macedonia, as well as the shaping of its media environment and civil society, often favoring groups of one political persuasion over another,” Lee said in his letter.

Together, the concerns reflect growing conservative pushback against Soros' operations in Europe.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week ripped the Hungary-born billionaire's "trans-border empire." Orban has been one of the central European voices speaking out against the push by E.U. leaders to absorb Syrian refugees and has been criticized for his hardline stance.

Soros' Open Society Foundations -- one of the billionaire's biggest groups operating across the globe -- fired back, saying Orban was trying to deflect attention from other issues.

“The Open Society Foundations for over 30 years have supported civil society groups in Hungary who are addressing profound problems in education, health care, media freedom and corruption," Laura Silber, the organization's chief communications officer, said in a statement to The Associated Press. "Any attacks on this work and those groups are solely an attempt to deflect attention from government inability to address these issues."

The group's stated goal is “to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens” but critics claim it's a front for Soros’ hard-left political maneuverings.

Former Macedonian PM Nikola Gruevski says Soros has a "decisive influence" on his country’s politics.

“If it were not for George Soros behind it with all the millions he pours into Macedonia, the entire network of NGOs, media, politicians, inside and out ... the economy would be stronger, we would have had more new jobs,” he said in a recent interview with Macedonia’s Republika newspaper.

Macedonia, while small, is a broadly conservative country. It has a flat rate tax of 10 percent, a small-government philosophy and a ruling conservative party (VMRO-DPMNE) that has greeted the election of President Trump warmly and pledged to work with him.

Lee’s staff recently met with Macedonia lawmakers, who also passed on a white paper from a citizen’s initiative called “Stop Operation Soros” which alleges U.S. money has been funding hard-left causes in the country -- including violent riots in the streets, as well as a Macedonian version of Saul Alinsky’s far-left handbook “Rules for Radicals.”

In an extensive 40-page dossier, the group alleges USAID money is being used to fund activists and exclusively left-wing media groups as a way to sway the country’s politics.

The Open Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

On the Soros connection, Lee’s letter asked if the Mission has “selected the Open Society Foundations as the major implementer of USAID projects in Macedonia” and if the group has been perceived to have political bias in Macedonia.

In a reply dated Feb. 9, the State Department told Lee that the Mission in the country has worked to advance U.S. interests “in a non-biased, non-partisan, objective and transparent manner.” The letter claimed U.S. government assistance has not funded partisan political activities in Macedonia, but noted that from 2002 to the present, USAID had provided three grants to Foundation Open Society – Macedonia (FOSM).

One of these grants is outlined on the USAID website. Between 2012 and 2016, USAID gave almost $5 million in taxpayer cash to FOSM for “The Civil Society Project,” which “aims to empower Macedonian citizens to hold government accountable.” USAID’s website links to www.soros.org.mk, and says the project trained hundreds of young Macedonians “in youth activism and the use of new media instruments.”

The letter from the State Department to Lee said USAID also recently funded a new Civic Engagement Project which partners with four organizations, including FOSM. It was not clear how much this project would cost, but Smith put the figure at $9.5 million.

“The money is very significant, in fact there is still money in the pipeline, from 2017 to 2021, 9.5 million,” Smith said in a recent radio interview with the Family Research Council's Tony Perkins. “It’s one thing to do election monitoring, which is a very noble cause to make sure there’s free and fair elections, but it’s quite another thing to be backing parties that Soros and his gang want to see in control of that country.”

It isn’t the only time Soros has worked with the State Department. Among the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta released by Wikileaks was one from 2011 in which Soros urged Hillary Clinton to take action in Albania over recent demonstrations in the capital of Tirana.

Soros asked Clinton to “bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and opposition leader Edi Rama to forestall further public demonstrations and to tone down public pronouncements” and appoint a senior European official as mediator.

Within a few days, an envoy was dutifully dispatched.

Former Macedonian PM Gruevski cited the WikiLeaks emails as proof “[Soros] can go visit top leading American officials whenever he wants to, arranges meetings day in day out and has significant influence.”

While Soros has often been a bogeyman for the American right, the liberal businessman has kept a steady pressure and funding of left-wing causes within America as well.

“This guy is a spider with lots of webs,” GOP strategist Brad Blakeman told Fox News' "Strategy Room." “He controls numerous third-party groups, where he uses his influence. We’ve seen it internally with Black Lives Matter, the demonstrations taken place after the inaugural -- this is what he does.”

After violent left-wing activists rioted at Berkeley in protest of a lecture by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, The Daily Caller reported that the main group behind the protests -- Refuse Facism -- was backed by The Alliance for Global Justice -- which in turn is backed by The Tides Foundation, a Soros-funded group.

Soros also has donated to Media Matters and has been a major financial contributor to the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank founded by Podesta.

The trove was found prior to the construction of two soccer fields in Carnoustie by experts from GUARD Archaeology, working on behalf of the local government. A spokesman for GUARD Archaeology told Fox News that excavations at the site have just finished.

The artifacts, which date to around 1,000 B.C. to 800 BC, have delighted archaeologists. “It is very unusual to recover such artefacts in a modern archaeological excavation, which can reveal so much about the context of its burial,”said GUARD Archaeology Project Officer Alan Hunter, who directed the excavation, in a statement.

LONG-LOST DARK AGE KINGDOM DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND

The excavation site contains a host of archaeological features, including 12 circular houses that probably date the Bronze Age, as well as two halls likely dating to the Neolithic period, one of which is the largest of its type ever found in Scotland, estimated to be 6,000 years old. Clusters of large pits were also discovered, one of which contained the haul of metalwork.

In addition to the bronze spearhead and sword, archaeologists also found a lead and tin pommel from the end of a sword’s hilt, a bronze scabbard mount and chape (the metal point of a scabbard), and a bronze pin.

Archaeologists say that the spearhead’s gold ornament is particularly noteworthy, with the precious metal likely used to enhance the weapon’s visual impact.

A FARMER’S STORY OF MOLES COULD HAVE LED TO A LOST CITY

The Carnoustie excavation also unearthed rare organic remains, such as a wooden scabbard that encased the sword blade, fur skin around the spearhead and textile around the pin and scabbard.

'Organic evidence like Bronze Age wooden scabbards rarely survive on dryland sites so this just underlines how extraordinary these finds are,' said GUARD Project Officer, Beth Spence, in the statement.

Because the remains discovered at Carnoustie are so fragile, archaeologists removed the entire pit and its surrounding subsoil and transported it to GUARD Archaeology’s lab, where it was CT scanned and X-rayed by the School of Veterinary Medicine at Glasgow University. Scan and X-ray data helped experts remove the artifacts from the block of soil. The bronze sword, pin, and scabbard fittings were unearthed near the spearhead.

MEDIEVAL SIN-WASHING WELL IS UNCOVERED

This is just the latest fascinating archaeological discovery in Scotland. Experts, for example, have spent the last few years piecing together the history of a long-lost early medieval kingdom in southern Scotland.

Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogersCould bionic eyes restore sight to the blind and give the U.S. military super sight?

Bionic implanted eyeballs, “Star Trek”-style visors, telescopic contact lenses ... these are just a few of the many exciting projects underway to both restore and provide enhanced sight.

Significant strides have been made in tech that will restore and transform lives - replacing white canes, service animals, braille machines and more for the visually impaired.

There has been a lot in the media about prosthetic breakthroughs for U.S. veterans, but what about vision? Last year the Blinded Veterans Association told the House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs that there are an estimated 131,580 legally blinded veterans in the U.S., citing data from the Depatment of Veterans Affairs.

THE 5 COOLEST MILITARY INNOVATIONS OF 2016

Technology is being increasingly harnessed to overcome blindness. So far, much of the key progress has been restricted to restoring sight for those with a specific type of visual impairment – in particular retinitis pigmentosa – an inherited condition that involves the loss of cells in the retina and causes a decline in vision.

BIONIC EYE IMPLANTS

One of the first and most promising “bionic eyes” is the Argus II made by Second Sight, which is geared toward patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

The system has two parts: a very high tech retinal implant and a camera mounted on eyeglasses or shades. The “bionic eye” is surgically implanted in, and on, the eye. It has an antenna, an electronics case, and an electrode array.

Expand / Contract Argus II (Second Sight).

The camera processes what it sees and sends it to a small computer that the person wears. The data is processed and translated into instructions that are sent wirelessly to the antenna in the implant.

MARINES GET GROUNDBREAKING, UNSTOPPABLE NEW RIFLE MAGAZINE

The retinal implant has 60 electrodes in it. These electrodes provide information to the optic nerve and the optic nerve relays the data to the brain. The optic nerve understands this data as shapes, light and movement.

This vision is not yet like normal sight and it will not restore vision to 20/20. But with Argus II, folks who were once sightless can see in black and white – they can read a book and see their homes and loved ones for the first time. More advances are in the pipeline for Argus II to restore color as well as resolution and brightness.

Argus II bionic eyes require functioning retina so many, including many visually impaired veterans, can’t take advantage of that tech – Second Sight’s Orion technology could be the solution.

PLUGGING INTO THE BRAIN

By skipping the optic nerve and directly plugging into the visual cortex, Orion could hold enormous potential for veterans who have visual impairment due to trauma.

'STAR TREK'-STYLE SURVEILLANCE DRONE FOR THE US MILITARY

In fact, this approach could potentially help those blinded by cancer or glaucoma.

This new device bypasses the retinal layer and implants electrodes directly onto the visual region of the brain.

Second Sight announced a major breakthrough for its Orion I project late last year. In a trial at UCLA, the very first of these devices to directly plug into the brain, a wireless visual cortical stimulator, was implanted in a human subject. The test was a success and restored vision to a 30-year old patient with no major side effects.

‘STAR TREK’-STYLE VISOR

Ever seen “Star Trek?” One American company has created a sort of real-life version of character Geordi La Forge’s “visor.”

'STAR WARS'-STYLE SPEEDERS COULD CARRY US TROOPS

With the eSight 3 device, the wearer can see full-color video images without a time lag. Wherever the user looks and whatever he or she looks at, the high-speed, high-def camera captures it for them.

Advanced algorithms are used for the video feed. The video is then displayed on two screens in front of the wearer’s eyes. The video image is provided in a way that overcomes their vision loss.

eSight isn’t a cure-all at this point. If the retina damage is too severe, then it may not work. It tends to be more helpful with macular degeneration, for example, than glaucoma. The company says the technology has about a 50 percent chance of working with all conditions.

GIVING SOLDIERS SUPER SIGHT

Advances in this field are also creating the potential to give US warfighters super vision.

HOW F-35A FIGHTER PILOTS ARE HARNESSING HIGH-TECH 'SEE-THROUGH' HELMETS

One exciting example is a new contact lens funded by DARPA, and made by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, that gives the wearer the ability to zoom like a telescope.

Expand / Contract (EPFL)

The scleral lens has thin aluminum mirrors built into it that work with special liquid crystal glasses. These glasses are connected to an electronic system.

Think “Mission Impossible.” If you blink your right eye, then it allows magnifying – but if you wink your left then the vision is normal. If you blink normally, it doesn’t trigger the magnifying mode.

In addition to the contact lens, other projects have made great headway. Even Second Sight bionic eyes can see in IR with a specific input device.

NEW TECH MAKES TANK ARMOR 'SEE-THROUGH'

Augmenting soldiers with vision-enhancing tech could provide advantages for ground troops and special operations in particular. Warfighters could switch between seeing in night vision, infrared, thermal, zoom, telescopic and more. Whether worn or implanted, it would provide enhanced capabilities that remove the weight of carrying optics and the time lost shifting optics by switching instead at the speed of thought.

Just one specific illustration of how helpful this could be is explosives. If the amazing advances in explosive detection could be miniaturized and adapted for military bionic eyes, then warfighters with enhanced vision could scan and spot these hidden IEDs before they could strike – putting an end to injury and death due to IEDs.

Vice President Pence on Saturday worked to assure NATO allies that the United States would be “unwavering” in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.

Pence, in his first overseas trip as vice president, told the Munich Security Conference that President Donald Trump intends to "stand with Europe." He sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by the U.S. president’s positive statements about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

"Today, on behalf of President Trump, I bring you this assurance: The United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in its commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance," Pence said.

MCCAIN IN GERMANY SAYS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN ‘DISARRAY’

During his address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, to end violence in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence met afterward with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference just before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

The vice president’s comments come just weeks after Trump called NATO obsolete, according to a Bloomberg Politics reports about an interview the then-president elect gave to a German paper.

“It’s obsolete, first because it was designed many, many years ago,” Trump said. “Secondly, countries aren’t paying what they should” and NATO “didn’t deal with terrorism.”

On Saturday, Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace agreement aimed to end fighting in Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence also reinforced the Trump administration's message that NATO members must spend more on defense.

NATO's 28-member countries committed in 2014 to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. But only the U.S. and four other members of the post-World War II military coalition are meeting the standard, Pence said.

Failure to meet the commitment, he said, "erodes the very foundation of our alliance."

"Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment and, for most, that means the time has come to do more," Pence said.

James Jeffrey, a U.S. ambassador to Iraq during the Obama administration, said Pence looked "like an adult.” The question is will Trump listen to him?"

The visit, which will include a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression and Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Pence has also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion. Pence also planned to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

The Associated Press contributed to this reportIt looks like Judge Neil Gorsuch would have an easier time making it to the U.S. Supreme Court if voters -- rather than U.S. Senators -- had to confirm him.

Continue Reading Below

That’s according to the latest Fox News Poll of registered voters nationwide.

President Donald Trump nominated Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. If Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, it will likely be a razor-thin victory. Yet voters give him a 12-point edge.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

The new poll, released Wednesday, finds that by a 49-37 percent margin, voters would confirm Gorsuch. Fourteen percent are undecided.

Not surprisingly, 82 percent of Republicans would vote to confirm him compared to just 17 percent of Democrats. For independents, a majority supports Trump’s nominee (54 percent). There’s a gender gap as well, as 57 percent of men vs. 42 percent of women are in favor of Gorsuch.

The support for Gorsuch’s confirmation (49 percent) is higher than the 39 percent received by President Obama’s nomination of Elena Kagan in May 2010. However it is a touch lower than the 53 percent who supported Obama’s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor in July 2009 and the 51 percent who were behind President George W. Bush’s selection of John Roberts in July 2005.

Senate confirmation hearings are expected in March. Democrats have threatened quite a fight, and 42 percent of voters endorse the idea of Senate Democrats doing “everything they can” to block any of Trump’s nominees they don’t like. Of course most Democrats agree with that strategy (75 percent) -- and they’re joined by one-third of independents (33 percent) and even a handful of Republicans (10 percent).

“Democrats are at the very least giving their elected leaders permission to fight Trump's nominees while many will be demanding they do anything to slow the administration,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “And with the sense that blood is in the water after General Flynn's forced resignation, that demand could increase.”

The poll also asks voters which of the three branches of government they trust the most. Hands down it is the judicial branch at 45 percent. The other two trail far behind: 26 percent trust the executive branch the most and the legislative branch comes in at 13 percent. Ten percent don’t trust any of the branches.

Sentiment hasn’t changed much since the early days of the Obama administration. At that time, 43 percent of voters trusted the court the most, 27 percent the president, and 15 percent Congress (April 2012).

The number picking the judiciary is up from 33 percent when the question was first asked in 2005.

"The judiciary generally, and the Supreme Court particularly, are seen as relatively competent and non-partisan," says Shaw. "That makes President Trump's response to the opinions on the district and appellate judges' rulings on his immigration order a gamble politically."

Around half of voters think the Supreme Court’s decisions are “about right” ideologically (47 percent). That’s up from 34 percent who felt that way in 2015 -- and up from the previous high of 46 percent in 2010.

Thirty-one percent feel the court’s decisions are “too liberal.” That’s down significantly from 45 percent in July 2015, soon after rulings on same-sex marriage and the 2010 health care law (Obamacare) were handed down.

Only about one in five voters say the court is “too conservative” (18 percent).

Pollpourri

Americans are used to cameras in big criminal trials -- what about televising the Supreme Court?

The poll finds 68 percent of voters feel it’s a good idea to allow television coverage of the nation’s highest court. Plus, majorities of independents (74 percent), Democrats (73 percent) and Republicans (61 percent) agree.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 11-13, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.Nancy Dziedzic, of Sacramento, California, enjoyed hiking in her 20s, but she had never tackled any major mountains. Now 51 and more than three years after being diagnosed with a rare blood cancer, Dziedzic is preparing to conquer Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, towering at 19,340 feet, and the highest free-standing mountain in the world.

Dziedzic and five other multiple myeloma patients start their 11-day quest on Feb. 17. The Kilimanjaro hike is part of Moving Mountains for Multiple Myeloma, a collaboration between CURE Media Group, Takeda Oncology and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF). Together, the groups send patients, as well as their family members, caregivers, and myeloma doctors and nurses on hikes with challenging terrain, including the Grand Canyon and Machu Picchu.

Multiple myeloma develops in the plasma cells found in the bone marrow. These plasma cells are critical for maintaining the immune system, but abnormal antibodies turn them into malignant melanoma cells. The cancer typically occurs in the spine, pelvic bones, ribs and areas of the shoulders and hips— the bone marrow with the most activity. According to the American Cancer Society, about 30,280 new cases of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed this year, resulting in 12,590 deaths. The lifetime risk of getting multiple myeloma is 1 in 143 (.7 percent).

Dziedzic, who works for the state of California in housing and community development, first heard of Moving Mountains through a Facebook myeloma support group post about the 2016 climb. Because she was doing well on her treatment, her doctor encouraged her to apply, and she was accepted in February.

“I’d always dreamed of going to Africa, so I was really interested,” Dziedzic told Fox News. “I followed the trek last year and was really excited and inspired by them.”

Dziedzic was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in September 2014 after feeling pain in her midsection. After several months of seeking a diagnosis, doctors identified multiple lesions and fractures on her ribs. These lesions form when groups of myeloma cells cause other cells in the bone marrow to remove the solid part of the bone. They do not occur in all myeloma patients.

After receiving her diagnosis, Dziedzic was immediately admitted to the hospital for about a week and started chemotherapy. Doctors then put her on five months of a three-drug cocktail, including Takeda’s Velcade, which led to drop in her cancer cells down to negligible amounts. In April 2015, Dziedzic underwent a stem cell transplant to replace healthy cells damaged by chemo, and, four months later, she started on a daily maintenance drug of an oral chemotherapy.

“I’m in complete response— they don’t call it remission— my levels are at very low, negligible amounts, and haven’t really changed at all since my stem cell transplant,” Dziedzic said. “Right now I’m feeling pretty normal, as much as you can.”

Dziedzic’s care is now down to blood work once a month and a visit to the oncologist every two months.

The importance of being active

Climbing through the six different ecosystems— cultivated areas, rain forest, heath, moorland, alpine desert and the summit— of the mountain poses challenges for healthy individuals and even more so for multiple myeloma patients. However, conquering the mountain is possible, and even beneficial, for people like Dziedzic, said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, an oncologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, and a fellow Kilimanjaro hiker.

“There’s nothing to limit Nancy or any of these other climbers in any of their efforts on Kilimanjaro,” O’Donnell told Fox News. “There is tremendous data that exercise is beneficial at any stage of therapy. It’s important for patients to engage in physical activity.” In her research work, O’Donnell often partners with Takeda on clinical trials. A triathlete, she joined the Moving Mountains trip after being contacted by Takeda employees who knew about her active lifestyle.

Takeda manufactures multiple myeloma drugs, including Velcade, a type of chemotherapy that’s the standard of care for first-line melanoma treatment, O’Donnell said.

“Pretty much every patient with a multiple myeloma diagnosis will see it,” she said. “The standard, backbone therapies come from a handful of drug companies.”

While imperative, staying active during treatment for multiple myeloma or any other cancer can also be challenging, noted O’Donnell, who is also the director of the Lifestyle Medicine Clinic at Mass General. The American Cancer Association recommends most cancer patients engage in 150 minutes of moderately intense exercise every week, plus two strength and conditioning sessions. Patients should consult their health care providers to ensure their fitness plan is appropriate.

After receiving a diagnosis, patients typically receive the treatment Dziedzic had: a three-drug combination and, depending on the patient’s age, a stem cell transplant, which requires a high dose of chemotherapy and hospitalization. During that time, doctors encourage patients to walk, but the recovery time after discharge can have a significant impact on patients’ cardiovascular health.

“During the recovery period, where you’re mostly at home laying low for a month after, it’s a long period of time,” O’Donnell said. On top of that, most multiple myeloma treatments include four to eight months of steroids, which often leads to a loss of lean muscle mass and increased visceral fat.

“Taking steroids definitely made a difference,” Dziedzic said. “I gained weight, and you have these highs and lows because the days you’re taking steroids, you are just going 100 percent. It’s really hard to sleep on those days, so it disrupts your whole week.”

Prior to her diagnosis, Dziedzic walked as her main form of exercise, and skipped the gym when she got sick to avoid exposing her immune system to germs. After she was accepted for the hike, her doctor encouraged her to return to the gym, where she’s been working on cardiovascular and strength training, as well as hiking outdoors on the weekend and after work.

Ready for the climb

Once they reach Tanzania, the team will hike from four to six hours a day and will spend a few days doing acclimatization hikes, going up high and then back down to adjust to the altitude.

The 16-member team of patients, family members and supporters includes a mix of ages and fitness levels. Participants’ costs are fully covered by Takeda and CURE Magazine and the team’s fundraising efforts go toward MMRF to fast-track research on multiple myeloma treatments. O’Donnell estimated the trip costs $3,000-$4,000 for each hiker, plus transportation and donated gear.

On July 9, 2016, the Kilimanjaro teammates had a practice hike on Mount Bierstadt in Colorado, climbing the 14,065 foot mountain.

Dziedzic hopes her experience will raise awareness and inspire other multiple myeloma patients the way the previous expedition team did for her.

“They can resume a normal life, and even do incredible things like climb Kilimanjaro or whatever is in their capabilities,” she said. She’ll take her first vacation since her stem cell transplant, eight days on safari, after the hike is complete.

Dziedzic is nervous but hopes her training has been enough.

“I feel very mentally prepared, and I think that’s a big hurdle that in some ways is even more important than the physical,” she said. “I feel ready mentally for it— hopefully my body follows along with that.”The election of President Trump has created a great opportunity for America and Canada to make both of our economies more productive, accelerate economic growth, and enable our nations to compete more successfully in the world market.

That is my first conclusion after talking with more than 70 Canadian CEOs in Toronto earlier this year.

The meeting was arranged by Gordon Giffin, my friend and colleague at Dentons, who was ambassador to Ottawa under President Bill Clinton and has maintained very active ties to the Canadian government and business community.

It struck me during our talk that the U.S. should continue building on our incredibly old, deep mutual relations with the Canadian people.

After all, Canada and the United States already have an amazing level of joint manufacturing. Some cars cross the U.S.-Canada border 13 times as they are being assembled. The St. Lawrence Seaway is managed cooperatively by our two countries to expedite maritime trade between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. And there are Canadian hockey, baseball and basketball teams competing with American teams.

In the energy sector, a project has been approved to bring 1,000 megawatts of Quebec hydroelectric power to New York City. And President Trump has already approved moving forward the Keystone Pipeline – one of many opportunities in joint infrastructure development. Canadians have far more experience than Americans at such public-private infrastructure projects, and there are more places along the border where such development will be mutually profitable.

One of the greatest emerging areas of potential partnership is the Arctic. The Russians are making very large investments in both civilian and military development of the Arctic. A joint United States-Canadian effort would be a much more effective response than either country could muster trying to go it alone. This could be one of the great growth areas of the next half century.

We should also not forget that on Sept. 11, 2001, it was a Canadian commanding the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) who executed President Bush's decision to land all the planes until we had a grip on the terrorist threat. And Canadians have been and are still serving with American forces in the Middle East.

It was clear during British Prime Minister Theresa May's visit to the U.S. that both the Trump administration and the British government were excited about the prospects of closer ties. With the visit by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week I think we will see a similar joint desire to work more closely together.

A United States-Canada trade agreement may be a profitable parallel to a United States-Great Britain trade deal.

At the start, the mood in Toronto on the Sunday night I was there was there was a combination of optimism, apprehension and just plain curiosity about this new American president.

By the end of the hours-long discussion, there was genuine excitement and optimism that we could work and prosper together.

Follow him on Twitter @NewtGingrich.Inmates at a maximum security prison in Delaware staged a "dry run" protest to gauge the response of prison officials two weeks before an uprising and hostage taking in which a prison guard was killed, an attorney for the state correctional officers union said Friday.

Bruce Rogers, an attorney for the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, said the protest last month at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center lasted for about two hours.

"Everybody just kind of shut down what they were supposed to be doing," said Rogers, describing how inmates gathered near a communal chow hall and refused to "lock-in" to their cells or obey other commands. The protest occurred in the same building where four Department of Correction workers were taken hostage two weeks later, Rogers said.

Rogers said the earlier protest ended only after lieutenants and captains who supervise rank-and-file COAD members responded and tried to settle the inmates down.

"We believe that was used as a test to see what the response of the department would be if they had a full-blown event," Rogers said.

Rogers said he believes correctional officers filed "multiple reports" about the incident, but that he is not aware of any sanctions or penalties imposed on inmates.

"One can reach the conclusion that a lack of response by the department kind of emboldened them to try something else," he said.

A DOC spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attorney's assertion.

Meanwhile, a lawyer representing a correctional officer taken hostage during the uprising said his client was diagnosed last week with acute post-traumatic stress disorder, and that it could be months before he can return to work.

Attorney Thomas Neuberger said a second client, another correctional officer taken hostage, was seen Friday by a psychiatrist.

Neuberger also said he is representing the family of Steven Floyd, a correctional officer who was killed, as well as three maintenance workers in the building at the time who Neuberger said were traumatized by events they witnessed.

Neuberger said the maintenance workers described being confronted by angry, masked inmates after responding to cries for help from Floyd, who had been seized by inmates and held in a closet.

"One of them had a shiv held to his throat, and all three feared for their lives," he said.

Neuberger said the maintenance workers had been working on a boiler when the uprising began. After being threatened by the inmates, one of the workers, who was wearing a respirator, threatened to spill a chemical mixture from a five-gallon container, telling inmates they would die if they breathed the fumes. Neuberger said the ruse prompted the inmates to retreat and allowed the maintenance workers to flee to the basement, where they barricaded themselves and establish radio or cell phone contact with emergency responders.

Neuberger said he plans to file wrongful death and survivor claims in federal court on behalf of Floyd's family, and that the correctional officers and maintenance workers deserve to be compensated for emotional distress, pain and suffering.

He also said he would be filing due process claims against state officials for putting prison workers at risk by ignoring chronic problems of understaffing and overcrowding at the prison, where a female counselor was taken hostage and raped by a serial rapist in 2004 before he was shot to death by a tactical officer.

"They've been screwing with the workers for 12 or 15 years and not giving a damn," said Neuberger, blaming past political leaders along with former and current DOC leaders for not taking problems in the prison system seriously.

"Instead of a rape, this time we're getting a murder," Neuberger added.

While not responding directly to Neuberger's claims, DOC spokeswoman Chelsea Hicks said in an email Friday that all of the recommendations made by a governor's task force established after the 2004 incident have been fulfilled.

Those recommendations, Hicks noted, included reviewing and updating policies and standard operating procedures, improving the radio communications system, mandating in-service officer training, increasing pat-downs and cell searches, and undertaking efforts to reduce attrition among correctional officers.Ron Hill, 78, a three-time Olympian for Great Britain, ended his running streak on Sunday, January 29.

The streak—during which Hill ran at least one mile every day—had stood for 52 years, 39 days. It was the longest known running streak in history.

In a statement released by Streak Runners International, Hill, who lives in Hyde, a town a few miles east of Manchester, wrote: “I have been having heart problems and have been waiting for some time now to have the problem diagnosed and hopefully rectified.”

On January 28, Hill wrote, he ran his last mile of the streak.

“After less than 400 metres my heart started to hurt and over the last 800 metres the problem got worse and worse,” the statement reads. “I thought I might I die but just made it to 1 mile in 16 minutes and 34 seconds. There was no other option but to stop. I owed that to my wife, family and friends plus myself.”

In 2014, when Hill’s streak hit 50 years, he told Runner’s World, “I hope to live to 100 years and still be running.” Over the first 50 years of the streak, he averaged more than seven miles per day, but he had been running less, about 25 miles per week, in his mid 70s.

The streak was only one small accomplishment in Hill’s career. He competed in the Olympics in 1964, 1968, and 1972. In fact, his disappointment in his performance in the 10,000 meters and marathon at the 1964 Games in Tokyo was what inspired him to begin the streak.

Hill won the Boston Marathon in 1970 in 2:10:30, what was then the course record. He was the second person to break 2:10 in the marathon, running a personal best of 2:09:28. He held world records for 10 miles, 15 miles, and 25K on the roads.

According to SRI, Jon Sutherland, 66, of West Hills, California, now holds the longest streak for consecutive days running, at 47 years and 8 months. He said he was saddened by the end of Hill’s streak.

“I’m a fan from afar,” Sutherland said of Hill. “He was an incredible pioneer, one of the most important figures in the evolution of running.” Sutherland says that Hill had a four-year streak going before the 52-year string of runs began.

RELATED: Ed Whitlock still setting records in his 80s

Sutherland is not sure whether he will be able to continue running to approach the mark that Hill set. “I had my worst year ever in 2016,” Sutherland said. Plagued by nagging injuries, he ran 1,066 miles in 2016, and on 20 days, he ran the one-mile minimum required to maintain his streak. (He usually runs three miles each day at between nine- and 10-minute-mile pace.)

“[The streak] doesn’t drive me that much,” he said. “I was more driven by competition when I was younger. I do it because I enjoy it. I try not to think about it.”

Jim Pearson, 72, of Marysville, Washington, is second on the current streak list (46 years, 11 months).

Stephen De Boer, 62, of Rochester, Minnesota, is currently in third place at 45 years, 7 months. In an email to Runner’s World, he said he is not motivated to try to set the longest streak, even though he is younger than those ahead of him on the list.

“It is an internal thing to run every day, no matter who is ahead of or behind me,” he wrote.

This article originally appeared on RunnersWorld.com.One city in Iowa is rolling out the red carpet for bees in order to save the human race. The Gazette reports the population of pollinating insects has been cut in half over the past 70 years, and that spells trouble for humans who enjoy having food to eat.

Part of the problem is that the natural habitats of bees and monarch butterflies have been fast disappearing, replaced by parking lots, lawns, and other signs of human development, according to Popular Science.

Now Cedar Rapids is hoping to reverse the trend by converting 1,000 acres of unused land into prime bee real estate. Cedar Rapids Mayor Ron Corbett tells the Gazette this project and others like it are "critical to the future of both pollinators and people." The 1,000 Acre Pollinator Initiative, led by Cedar Rapids Parks Superintendent Daniel Gibbins, will plant seeds for 39 species of wildflowers and seven species of prairie grass on 188 acres of land this spring.

Potential public land that has been identified includes some of the less-trafficked parts of golf courses and airports, sewage ditches, and more. The project, which has $180,000 in funding so far, hopes to reach its 1,000-acre goal within five years.

Gibbins says 99.9% of Iowa's natural habitat is gone, and this project will help all sorts of animals, not just bees. "Everything that's native here relies on native vegetation," he tells Popular Science.

Plus, the wildflowers will look pretty. (The White House may have doomed a bumblebee species.)

This article originally appeared on Newser: Iowa City Has Plan to Bring Back the BeesA 1,700-year-old untouched tomb bearing the bones of a dozen male adults, as well as pre-Columbian figurines and statues, has been unearthed in Mexico.

Archaeologists discovered the ancient tomb, which dates to the Comala Period (between 0 and A.D. 500), during work to remodel a Seventh-day Adventist church in Colima, Mexico. The archaeologists uncovered a hole that was sealed up with stones, artifacts for grinding, and human bones.

Inside, 12 skulls and other bones were piled atop one another in a haphazard manner. Some of the skulls showed signs of damage, as well as tooth fractures and wear, said Rosa María Flores Ramírez, a physical anthropologist at the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in Mexico.

When the archaeologists explored further, they discovered three burial levels. In the second burial level, the team found two figurines — a male and female — placed facedown next to two skulls. [Prince's Tomb: Images from a Mayan Excavation]

Ancient figurines

The male figurine, which measures 15 inches tall and 6 inches wide, was wearing an elaborate headdress with a horn jutting out from it. In his hand, he holds an ax.

The female figurine, which is 12.5 inches by 5.5 inches, shows a woman with a sharp nose and a triangular head. She wears a banded headdress and has her hands crossed, with the right hand holding a pot. The burial also contained two other pots.

Each of the figures was sculpted from fine paste that was polished when complete. The ancient artists used cuts to etch in the facial features.

"The presence of these pieces in the offering hint at the worldview of the groups that inhabited the Colima valley in that period. The sculptures, according to their attributes, served as propitiatory elements that ensured the protection of the deceased, as is the case with the male sculpture, which represents a shaman. The other objects fulfilled the function of bringing the requirements to the underworld," Rafael Platas Ruíz, an archaeologist at the INAH, said in a translated statement .

The finding is rare because tombs of this type are almost invariably looted before archaeologists can get to them.

The fact that the tomb was untouched "allowed us to have a first approach with the bone remains, to observe the lesions, deformations and to have more information to know what was their way of life," the researchers said in the statement.

It's possible that this isn't the only burial in the area, because the entire Colima valley was occupied continuously from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1500, and cultural relics from different periods in the city's history may be lying beneath it, the researchers said.

Originally published on Live Science .There’s a show on CBS called “Ransom” that airs Saturday nights and apparently no one tunes in.

“Ransom” has a 0.6 Nielsen rating in the key 18 to 49 demographic – that is considered by TV insiders a monumental flop, according to The Wrap.

In the past, CBS has used Saturday nights to air reruns of crime dramas, unaired episodes of killed shows or episodes of “48 Hours.” “Ransom” is an international co-production, so CBS may be taking a calculated risk running a scripted show on Saturdays.

On RottenTomatoes, critics have the series sitting at just 43 percent fresh and only 40 percent of the audience liking it.

Comments on the Rotten Tomatoes discussion board include: “Very weak pilot. It didn't catch my attention;” “What a horrible show and complete ripoff of Bull. Just dumb;" and "Absolutely unwatchable.”

JOSH ELLIOTT FIRED BY CBS AFTER ON-AIR FLUB

“Ransom” is about an experienced crisis and hostage negotiator, Eric Beaumont (Luke Roberts), and his team, who are brought in to save lives when no one else is able to. Eric understands criminals and uses his insight into human behavior to resolve the most difficult kidnap and ransom scenarios. Eric’s team is played by Brandon Jay McLaren, Nazneen Contractor and Sarah Greene.

“Ransom” boasts a 46 (out of 100) Metascore from TV reviewers measured by Metacritic, and a dismal 1.4 (out of 10) user rating.

One commenter on Metacritic says the show is, “Another incredibly stupid show from CBS. They've got that formula perfected. Stupid story lines, stupid writing, really cute actors for a stupid audience.”

One Twitter user begs CBS to “please stop making shows about hackers; or your strange weird idea of what a hacker is. It’s embarrassing.”

CBS CLAIMS TO BE 'VERY CLOSE' TO RENEWING 'BIG BANG THEORY'

In CBS’ defense, they do have the number one comedy on television with “The Big Bang Theory” and the number one drama with "NCIS."

The question is, CBS give up on "Ransom" and cancel it? All we can say is, stay tuned.Drake Parties in London Up in Da Pub!Donald Trump’s presidency is only one month old, but already the buzzards are circling. The president cheered supporters by assailing his critics at yesterday’s press conference, but there is little doubt that the Trump White House is struggling to keep its momentum. The drama over Michael Flynn’s departure and the defeat of Labor nominee Pudzer raise concerns over organization and focus, and feed headlines reporting “borderline chaos.”

Opponents on the Left are gleefully lining up more demonstrations, creating more obstruction in Congress and ripping the president in the media. Unimaginably, after suffering epic losses, Democrats are beginning to imagine a political comeback. Time for triage.

First, some perspective. At this point in his presidency, Bill Clinton’s White House was in disarray. His chief of staff, a lifelong friend named Mack McLarty, a person described by his grade school teacher as "Just a real nice boy who grew up into a real nice young man," was way over his head, unable to rein in the bigger-than-life personalities that typically occupy the West Wing. Infighting between the staffs of the president and Hillary was undermining the young administration. Chaos reined.

Bob Woodward chronicled those days in his book "The Agenda, Inside the Clinton White House." In it, he describes a Bill Clinton prone to rages and dithering, and as one reviewer put it: “a president elected to reform, but [who] is overwhelmed by an entrenched Congress and the deficit voodoo doll left to him by 14 years of Republicans. He has surrounded himself with the best, the brightest and the most inexperienced…”

Sound familiar? Woodward also reveals how Clinton staffers leaked damaging information – about each other and the president -- to the press. George Stephanopoulos, one of Clinton’s closest aides, told a reporter that the president was incapable of making decisions, while others took potshots at Hillary’s healthcare initiative, Bill’s “dishonest” budget and so on.

There’s a reason D.C. is called a swamp.

What’s different today? Trump faces an extraordinarily hostile media, which Clinton did not. Though some in the press criticized Clinton’s inexperienced apparatchiks, most supported the president’s agenda. They were not out for blood.

Not only is Trump skewered by the media at every turn, he is also facing opposition from the intelligence community, Democrats, activists supporting environmental and social causes, academia and even a good slug of his own party.

And, from time to time, he throws gasoline on the smoldering rage ignited by the election.

What can Trump do to turn things around?

First, it may be that he should take a page from the Clinton playbook and bring in a time-tested barracuda chief of staff (think Rahm Emmanuel). Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media, says Priebus is over his head; it’s possible the former RNC Chair is simply too nice a guy to knock heads. It wasn’t until hard-knuckle Leon Panetta became Clinton’s Chief of Staff in July 1994 that the White House got its act together. Given the hostility arrayed against him, Trump can’t wait that long. An ideal candidate would look like Newt Gingrich without the ego, or Chris Christie without the ambition.

Second, the president should get out of the Swamp Bubble every few weeks and go talk to the people. He is planning a rally-type event at the Orlando-Melbourne Airport this coming weekend; it’ a start. Trump is rejuvenated by his supporters. Trump needs to remind people that he loves the United States and he is working day and night to shake up the system. They’re on his side, but both he and they could use a little love. And yes- stick to the teleprompter.

Third, Mr. Trump needs to erect a speedbump in his Twitter feed. Just one set of eyes, one person who has the authority to say “go” or “no-go” on the 3 am tweets. Trump is engaging, still, in too many petty battles, when there are big ones to be fought. However, he should not shut it down; his tweets have increased in popularity since his inauguration, being “favorited” on average 120,000 times, and retweeted over 40,000 times. Those who are irate over the mainstream media’s treatment of their president are delighted he can address them directly, and they can respond.

Fourth, Trump needs to convene an intense weekend working session with Tom Price, head of HHS, and the GOP leadership in Congress. They need to lock the doors until a solid plan for replacing Obamacare emerges. Time to tell people what the bill is, and how it will be enacted over solid resistance from Democrats. Executive actions are great, and denote action, but Obamacare and tax reform require a big legislative push.

Finally, Trump should invite John McCain and Lindsay Graham to lunch, and hear them out. Both are respected GOP senior statesmen and they are aligned against the president. Their resistance will give cover to others, and the president needs a united party. Some of it is policy; some is personal. Trump has a big personality; he must win them over.

Trump needs to get the train back on the tracks. Andy Card, chief of staff for George W. Bush, stresses the importance of these early days: “The first one hundred days ends on April 30th. The president will be measured on his campaign promises, his commitment, his direction, his ability to lead on April 30th.” Trump has popular backing for most of his agenda; he will lose support if he gets so mired in minor controversies that he fails to achieve his goals. He cannot let that happen; it is too important for the future of the country.

Follow her on Twitter@LizPeek.Sponsors of a House bill passed this week to protect landowners from what they say is a federal land grab expect the Senate to pass the bill and send it to President Trump.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, seeks to prevent the federal government from claiming hundreds of thousands of acres of land -- much of it privately owned -- along the Red River in Texas and Oklahoma. It was crafted in response to complaints from property owners that the government was trying to seize land along a 116-mile stretch of the river.

The Red River has eroded and shifted – up to two miles in some places – over the last 100 years, and dry land where the river once flowed belongs to the government, according to the Bureau of Land Management.

But Thornberry and others disagree, citing a 1923 Supreme Court ruling that sets the Texas-Oklahoma state boundary as following the meandering of the river.

"This bill very simply requires that there be a survery to determine what the federal government owns and what it does not own," Thornberry told Fox News on Friday.

"It does not dispose of any land and it does not change anybody's

rights," Thornberry said.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that the northern half of the river bottom was Oklahoma's and the southern half belonged to the government.



In 2007, officials from the Bureau of Land Management began surveying the river bottom to define Indian lands. Following their interpretation of the gradient boundary survey method, the BLM extended what it believes to be part of the riverbed, setting the boundary line more than a mile onto dry land into Texas.

A group of landowners -- including Ken Aderholt, whose home lies within disputed territory -- filed suit in 2015 against the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Interior. Aderholt and others say they’ve rightfully owned and diligently paid taxes on the land for decades.

"The United States' ownership of property is limited to bottom-half of the sandy riverbed outside of Texas," the lawsuit states. "Nonetheless, BLM asserts that its boundary extends well past the riverbed into Texas and, in some instances, more than a mile outside of its lawful territory. In doing so, BLM has seized private property, infringed upon the sovereignty of the local county governments, and interfered with law enforcement’s ability to discharge its duties arising under Texas law.

Thornberry said the tug-of-war has land owners in a "panic" because "they don’t know when or where the federal government may come in and take the land that they’re entitled to and have paid taxes on, some for generations."

The House bill, which was approved 250-171, would commission a survey of the disputed area under a method backed by the Supreme Court.

Thornberry said he's confident the bill will pass in the Senate, despite opposition from Democrats who say the bill could unfairly impact Native American tribes who have mineral rights in the area.

An official from the Bureau of Land Management could not be reached Friday for comment. BLM officials previously said they have no intent to force current landowners from their properties. Instead, they said says landowners can purchase land belonging to the U.S. if it coincides with their deed.

Robert Henneke, a lawyer with the Texas Public Policy Foundation who represents the landowners, said he believes the bill has the momentum it needs to pass in the Senate.

"Throughout this dispute, the Bureau of Land Management has blatantly disregarded both the Texas landowners' private property rights and the plain meaning of the Supreme Court Opinion that defines the boundary," Henneke told Fox News on Friday.

Thornberry and others lawmakers, he said, "will stop the attempted land grab by giving Texas and Oklahoma responsibility to determine the boundary correctly."

Cristina Corbin is a reporter for FoxNews.com. Follow her on Twitter @CristinaCorbin.Tiffany Trump said she'd be happy to hang out with "The View" host Whoopi Goldberg at New York Fashion Week.

Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg I'd love to sit with you too! 😊 — Tiffany Ariana Trump (@TiffanyATrump) February 15, 2017

On Wednesday’s episode of her show the outspoken Goldberg defended President Trump’s daughter after no one would sit next to the 23-year-old at a New York Fashion week event.

“You know what, Tiffany, I’m supposed to go to a couple more shows. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I’m coming to sit with you,” she said on the show. “Because nobody’s talking politics. You’re looking at fashion! She doesn’t want to talk about her dad! She’s looking at the fashion!”

Goldberg’s defending of Tiffany Trump comes as a surprise as the co-host of “The View” has been extremely vocal against the President. And Goldberg even noted there was a difference between boycotting Ivanka’s line and the means girls of NYFW.

NY TIMES REPORTER SORRY FOR CALLING MELANIA TRUMP A 'HOOKER'

“And people say what is the difference between people boycotting Ivanka. There is a difference. That’s all about buying stuff. You’re buying stuff. This girl is looking at fashion, and she’s just looking at fashion.”

And without talking about President Trump, Goldberg explained she knows what Tiffany Trump must feel like.

“I don’t want to talk about your dad, but, girl, I will sit next to you. Because I’ve been there where people said, ‘We’re not going to sit next to you.’ I’ll find your ass and sit next to you!”NASA has taken one small step closer to possibly sending a robotic landing craft to Europa, a moon that orbits Jupiter that is a candidate for hosting alien life.

The space agency calls Europa “one of the highest priority targets in the search for present-day life beyond Earth.” That’s because scientists think it has a huge ocean beneath its surface— so big, in fact, that it could have twice the amount of water as all of the seas on Earth. Previous research has suggested that miles-high water vapor plumes even shoot into space from the Jovian moon.

Now, NASA has received a scientific study it commissioned on the potential mission. The top scientific goal, the study concluded, should be searching for life. The space agency says that the last time they looked for life on another world was during the 1970s-era Viking missions to Mars.

NASA SEES EVIDENCE OF WATER VAPOR PLUMES SHOOTING OUT OF EUROPA

A secondary goal is to see if the moon, which is about the size of Earth’s moon, is habitable.

Engineers are eying using a sky-crane system (there’s no atmosphere on Europa, so parachutes wouldn’t work) to lower a lander to the surface that would work for roughly 20 days before it ran out of batteries.

The earliest touch down date? April, of 2031.

Another moon in our solar system that scientists are interested in-- because it might also have a huge subsurface ocean-- is Enceladus, which orbits Saturn.A stunning artifact from the Revolutionary War - General George Washington’s field tent – will go on display when the Museum of the American Revolution opens its doors in April.

Dubbed “the first Oval Office,” the canvas tent will be the cornerstone of the Philadelphia-based Museum’s collection of approximately 3,000 Revolutionary War-era artifacts.

The museum’s opening on April 19 will be the first time in decades that the tent has been on public display.

SOLDIER'S FAITH: RARE BIBLE CARRIED AT THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL HAS MOVING INSCRIPTIONS

An iconic piece of U.S. history, the tent was likely made in Reading, Pennsylvania in early 1778 when Washington was camped at Valley Forge, according to the Museum. Deployed as a mobile field headquarters, the tent was used during many of the Revolutionary War’s key moments, such as the Siege of Yorktown, the war’s last major battle.

Expand / Contract General George Washington's Revolutionary War field tent on display at the Museum of the American Revolution (Courtesy of the Museum of the American Revolution).

The Museum told Fox News that it obtained the tent when it acquired the Burk collection of Revolutionary War artifacts in 2003. In 1909 the Reverend Herbert Burk, an Episcopal priest in Valley Forge, purchased the tent for $5,000 from Mary Custis Lee, a descendant of Martha Washington. Burk, who wanted to create a museum dedicated to the nation’s founding, raised the tent’s purchase price from ordinary Americans.

Preparing to display the tent was a major undertaking for the Museum, which wanted to make the structure appear as if it were pitched in a field, but without putting tension on the centuries-old fabric. To solve the problem, structural engineers Keast & Hood designed an umbrella-like aluminum and fabric structure to display the tent.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH HISTORICAL TREASURE TROVE FROM 300-YEAR-OLD PHILADELPHIA TOILETS

To test the structure, the Museum brought in a team of tradespeople from Colonial Williamsburg to build a “stunt double” replica tent. “We used the replica tent on several separate occasions to test the structure, which took varying amounts of time,” explained a spokeswoman for the Museum, in an email to Fox News. “The installation of the actual tent took four days.”

Underlining the tent’s historical importance, the structure is situated in a dedicated 100-seat theater when the Museum opens to the public.

“A commander-in-chief needs a quiet place to think, and this tent was Washington’s only private space throughout much of the Revolutionary War,” said Dr. R. Scott Stephenson, the Museum’s vice president of collections exhibitions, and programming, in a statement emailed to Fox News. "When I started to read about how Washington would use this tent, the images that popped into my head were very familiar ones: images of John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office during the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Bush after 9/11.

The decisions he made there would change the course of history."

Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogersMTV released a video that offers New Year's resolutions for white guys. It's so bad that it's bad:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: First off, try to recognize that America was never "great" for anyone who wasn't a white guy.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can we all just agree that "black lives matter" isn't the opposite of "all lives matter"? Black lives just matter. There's no need to over-complicate it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Also, "blue lives matter" isn't a thing.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Learn what mansplaining is, and then stop doing it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, and if you're a judge, don't prioritize the wellbeing of an Ivy League athlete over the woman he assaulted.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We all love Beyonce. And yes, she's black, so of course she cares about black issues. I'm talking to you, Fox News.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

Now, I'd call that a pile of crap, but why insult crap? This slick video is straight from the social justice warrior canon. Campus babble spooned like strained carrots into the mouths of the mentally infantile. Disguised as thought, but really just moronic mantras repeated by smug goons whose idea of intellectual achievement is retweeting Katy Perry while they sniff their puffy fingers.

Their goal must be to reelect Donald Trump. By smearing whites as dumb aggressors, trashing cops and mocking interracial friendships, they make leftists seem more noxious than ever.

So wait, maybe I love this video.

In the quest for P.C. obedience, MTV has found a group of people whose smarmy repulsiveness transcends all identity. I didn't see black, white, straight or gay in that video. I just saw loser. And the more they talk, the more they lose.

But perhaps that's the goal: creating a new victim group, the loser class. The goal: To demand special preferences for those who aren't just very good. As failures who see excuses instead of opportunities, the loser class are victims of your success, because they just can't keep up.

So congrats to the stars of this video. You're the poster children for deadbeats.President Trump quickly announced his picks for key Cabinet and White House positions after the November election. The following are his selections – Cabinet nominees are subject to Senate confirmation.Robert H. Michel, who served his entire 38-year congressional career in the congressional minority and rose to the post of House Republican leader, is dead at 93.

First elected in 1957, Michel gradually worked his way up through the party leadership first as chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee in 1972, then as minority whip from 1974 to 1980 and finally as minority leader until his retirement after the historic 1994 Republican wave elections.

Although Michel had a voting record similar to the Georgia congressman who would eventually succeed him as Republican leader, Newt Gingrich, he was known for a negotiating style that embraced consensus over confrontation. Michel had strong friendships with then-Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, D-Mass., and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.

Raised in Peoria, Ill., Michel initially entered public service during World War II as a combat infantryman in 1943. After he was wounded in battle, he was discharged as a disabled veteran in 1946. He was awarded two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart and four battle stars.

Former Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., who would later fill Michel’s vacant congressional seat in 1995, once remarked that Michel refrained from using political rhetoric that evoked images at war because he “knew warfare at first hand.”

“That is the reason he never used the macho phrases like 'warfare' and 'take no prisoners' when discussing politics with his staff. To Bob, the harsh, personal rhetoric of ideological warfare had no place in his office, no place in the House, and no place in American politics,” LaHood said at a 2003 Congressional Distinguished Service Award ceremony that honored Michel.

In 1949, after finishing college upon his return from the war, Michel became an aide to Rep. Harold Velde, D-Ill., which served as his introduction to Capitol Hill. After Velde announced that he would not seek reelection in 1956, Michel ran for public office for the first time and won to replace his former boss.

Michel first served on the Committee on Government Operations (now known as the Oversight and Government Reform Committee) from 1957 to 1958. A year later, he changed committees and worked on the Appropriations panel from 1959 to 1980.

The Illinois Republican first entered the leadership hierarchy when he was elected the chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee in 1972, a position which helped him cement loyalty among his colleagues with his fundraising prowess. Two years later, Michel became the minority whip and by 1980, he had risen to minority leader.

In 1988, Michel came under fire when he reminisced about blackface minstrel shows and said that changing racially offensive words in songs was comparable to the totalitarian Soviet Union government's rewriting of history. He later apologized for his remarks, claiming that they “were not in any way intended to be anything more than an honest attempt to understand and come to grips with the fact of American culture.”

By the early 1990s, many in Michel’s caucus complained that he was too conciliatory with Democrats and was pushing the GOP agenda hard enough. Gingrich, then minority whip, was considered a potential threat to Michel’s position. In 1994, even as his party was poised to regain the House for the first time in four decades, Michel announced that he would not seek reelection. He denied that Gingrich’s rise in popularity had motivated his decision to retire, but it was clear that Michel would have received a challenge for the speakership had he stayed in Congress.

In announcing his retirement, Michel complained about the diminished “camaraderie” on Capitol Hill and colleagues who preferred “trashing the institution” over effective legislating – a veiled criticism of the combative Gingrich.

Following Michel's announcement not to pursue reelection, President Clinton said in a statement: “For over a decade as Republican leader, Bob Michel has exhibited the balance of partisanship and cooperation which makes our system work. He would never give my party quarter in a partisan fight, but Bob Michel would never put his party's interest above the national interest.”

Clinton would later go on to award Michel the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honor – that same year. Michel had previously received the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Ronald Reagan in 1989.

Only once would Michel have the opportunity to hold the gavel in the House chamber. On the last day of the lame-duck session in 1994 following the midterm elections, then-Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., allowed Michel to preside over the House. The move surprised Michel. His colleagues roared and applauded as the Illinois Republican strode to the dais and took clasped the gavel, handed him by his old friend Foley.

Michel then noted never presided over the body during his entire Congressional career. Republicans had never held the majority during Michel’s tenure on Capitol Hill.

After Michel retired from the House, he joined the Hogan & Hartson political consulting firm as a senior adviser for corporate and governmental affairs.The nation’s uninsured rate tumbled further last year, hitting the lowest rate on record, according to new government data that underscored what is at stake in the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In the first nine months of 2016, just 8.8% of Americans lacked health coverage, survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

That was down from 16% in 2010, when President Obama signed the healthcare law, often called Obamacare.

California, which has expanded Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal in the state) and created its own insurance marketplace through the law, has seen some of the most dramatic insurance gains with the share of uninsured residents dropping by more than half between 2013 and 2016, to 7.1%, data show.

“From expanding Medi-Cal to launching a competitive state-based marketplace, California is empowering consumers and providing quality and value,” said Peter V. Lee, chief executive of the state’s Covered California marketplace.

President Trump and GOP congressional leaders have pledged to roll back the law and replace it with something that will provide Americans with more affordable healthcare options.

On Tuesday, House Republican leaders repeated their pledges. “We will have a stable transition, where no one has the rug pulled out from under them while we work toward a better, more stable system,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters at the Capitol.

But Republicans are struggling to develop an alternative, even as growing numbers of Americans express concern about the repeal campaign.

And to date, neither the Trump administration nor Republicans in Congress have detailed how they plan to preserve the health protections that millions have gained through the current law.

The new report released Tuesday — which is based on surveys of more than 73,000 people’s health insurance nationally — indicates that about 20.4 million people have gained coverage since 2010.

The most dramatic declines began after the law’s system of coverage expansion began in 2014.

That year, states were able to access federal aid through the law to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more very low-income residents.

To date, 31 states have taken advantage of the Medicaid expansion.

The new data indicate coverage gains have been most pronounced in those states, with the share of uninsured adults declining from 18.4% in 2013 to 9.3% in the first nine months of 2016.

By contrast, the uninsured rate for adults declined much more slowly in states that did not expand Medicaid, falling from 22.7% to 17.5%.

Many Republican governors and state legislators have opposed Medicaid expansion, arguing the program is not effective and too expensive, even though the federal government is footing more than 90% of the tab for the expansion.

Congressional Republicans and new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, a former Georgia congressman, have called for dramatic cuts in federal aid for Medicaid.

The new report shows the coverage expansion has also been fueled by new insurance marketplaces, such as HealthCare.gov, that allow Americans who do not get health insurance through an employer to shop for health plans.

Low- and moderate-income consumers qualify for government subsidies to offset the cost of their monthly premiums.

Republicans are also looking to scrap these marketplaces, saying that they are collapsing.

In fact, despite rising premiums in some parts of the country and the departure of some insurers who were losing money, enrollment in the marketplaces has held relatively stable, according to enrollment data.

And many insurance industry officials say the marketplaces could be stabilized.

TMZ reported the 37-year-old former Playboy Playmate discovered an article online stating she conducted an interview with Dr. Oz describing how Hugh Hefner took Blackcore Edge to cure his erectile dysfunction. In her suit, Madison said the endorsement is false.

HOLLY MADISON LAWSUIT ALLEGES SHE WAS SECRETLY FILMED IN HER DRESSING ROOM

The gossip site stated that according to the legal documents, the article made it seem that Madison stated, "when Hefner took a pile 15 minutes later his blood would start pumping! He got stronger, bigger, and lasted as long as an 18-year-old."

The article also made it appeared that Madison insisted all the girls in the Playboy Mansion benefitted from the pills.

Madison not only denied the details within the article, but she also claimed that she never did an interview with Dr. Oz about her 90-year-old former boyfriend and Playboy founder. She also claimed that the article was written to appear as if it were affiliated with Men’s Health, but seemed to be a knock-off website.

HOLLY MADISON WOULD HAVE HER DAUGHTER 'FORCIBLY REMOVED' IF SHE MOVED IN WITH HEF

In addition to the alleged fake quotes, Madison is also suing the company for using her name and image without consent.

Madison previously released a memoir in 2015 titled “Down the Rabbit Hole,” which explored her life in Hefner’s home, and detailed the alleged years of verbal and emotional abuse she endured.

Ticket prices are plunging as this weekend’s NBA All-Star festivities kick off in New Orleans, six months after the league relocated the annual showcase event from its original site in Charlotte in protest of North Carolina’s controversial transgender bathroom law.

As of Friday morning, the cheapest available seat for Sunday’s NBA All-Star Game at the Smoothie King Center cost $184, according to data compiled by TicketIQ, a resale market ticket aggregator. That number is a 71% decrease from last year in Toronto, when the cheapest ticket on the Friday before the game cost $644. The plunge may not be over -- the price of the cheapest seat in 2014, when New Orleans last hosted the All-Star Game, fell 39% between Friday and tip-off on Sunday.

With New Orleans set to host All-Star Weekend for the third time– and the second time in four years – fans may be growing weary of the experience, according to Jesse Lawrence, CEO and founder of TicketIQ. By comparison, Charlotte, the original location, hasn’t hosted the game since 1991.

"Basketball demand is already lower [in] New Orleans than other cities, and having hosted the All-Star Game just three years ago, the city has ‘All-Star fatigue,’” Lawrence told FOX Business.

The NBA revoked Charlotte’s hosting privileges last July in protest of North Carolina’s “House Bill 2.” The controversial measure, which became law last March, bars local governments from passing laws that restrict discrimination against LGBT individuals in public locations, and requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms that correspond to their biological sex. An attempt to repeal the law failed last December, while other repeal bills are currently being considered by state lawmakers.

Last August, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced that New Orleans had been granted hosting rights for the 2017 All-Star Weekend. Overall, tickets to the All-Star Game this year are selling for an average of $1,007 on TicketIQ, a significant drop from last year, when the average resale price for the Toronto game stood at more than $2,000.

Tickets to this year’s NBA All-Star Saturday Night, which consists of fan-favorite events like the Slam Dunk contests and the Three-Point Contest, are also significantly less expensive than last year. The cheapest available ticket costs $157, compared to $362 on the Friday before the game in 2016.

SeatGeek, another resale market ticket aggregator, noted a similar decline in this year’s prices. On that site, the cheapest seat available costs $233 – a sharp plunge from just one month ago, when the “get-in” price stood at $577.

“While many fans will travel to NBA All-Star Weekend, the local market plays a big role in the demand for tickets,” SeatGeek content analyst Chris Leyden told FOX Business. “With the weekend returning to New Orleans for the third time in the past 10 years, demand locally is not what it was the past two years in Toronto and New York, two much larger cities that had not hosted the festivities in more than a decade, if ever.”Newly-discovered radiation levels in one of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant’s reactors are stunningly high, the Japan Times and others have reported. The space is so radioactive that even a robot couldn’t last two hours, let alone a human.

It was on March 11, 2011, that the coastal power plant in Japan’s Fukushima Prefecture was hit by a tidal wave, which not only cut off the plant’s electrical power, also took out the generators that provided its backup power. The natural disaster triggered the meltdown of three reactors at the plant.

The new readings come from inside reactor two, where the radiation levels are 530 sieverts per hour, according to Tepco, the Tokyo Electric Power Company. That’s highly radioactive— most radiation is measured in thousandths of a sievert, a unit called a millisievert.

One dental X-ray is just .01 millisievert, according to the Guardian— which also pointed out that 10 sieverts can lead to death.

BY SQUEEZING AND TWISTING, NEW ROBOT COULD KEEP HEARTS PUMPING



At the end of January, Tepco said that they had taken, from inside reaction two, “intriguing images that may be fuel debris from the March 2011 accident,” but needed to study them more. (They have provided more information of their findings in this PDF.)

The company would like to deploy a robot, but the robot would be fried before even two hours at those radiation levels, since it is designed to endure 1000 sieverts, according to the Japan Times.

The radiation levels are the highest yet measured at the devastated plant, which could take as many as four decades to fully deal with.

The 27-year-old actress whose mother is Lisa Marie Presley and grandfather the late Elvis, sat down with the New York Times’ T Magazine to talk about her sexually-fueled Starz series, “The Girlfriend Experience.” During the chat, she got candid about Michael Jackson.

ELVIS' GRANDDAUGHTER RILEY KEOUGH TALKS RISQUE NEW ROLE

“I loved him,” she told the magazine and revealed how, despite being mostly raised by her father between Hawaii and Los Angeles, she often made frequent pit stops at Graceland and Neverland Ranch.

“There were toys everywhere, animals everywhere, kids everywhere,” said Keough about her time at the King of Pop’s estate in Los Olivos, Calif. “It was like being at Disneyland all day.”

That wasn’t the only way the star’s childhood was different. Keough explained how her father home-schooled her temporarily because a traditional education became, what the publication called, “too much of a nuisance.”

“Looking back on it, I’m like, ‘Wow, my upbringing was very intense,’” she said.

ELVIS' GRANDDAUGHTER RILEY KEOUGH ON WHY MARRIAGE WAS 'THE RIGHT THING'

In 1988, Lisa Marie married musician Danny Keough, with whom she had a son, Benjamin, and daughter, Riley. The couple divorced in 1994 and Lisa Marie married Jackson later that year and divorced in 1996.

She then married actor Nicholas Cage in 2002, but divorced in 2004. Lisa Marie married guitarist/producer Michael Lockwood in 2006 and divorced in 2016 after 10 years of marriage. They share twin girls, Harper and Finley.

Jackson died from a cardiac arrest at age 50 in 2009.

Emma Watson was determined to give a new twist to a beloved classic.

The 26-year-old British actress, best known by fans as Hermione in the “Harry Potter” film series, has taken on another magical role as Belle in the live-action remake of Disney’s 1991 animated fairy tale, “Beauty and the Beast.” However, she told Entertainment Weekly that movie has a new message for viewers.

EMMA WATSON AND MILES TELLER LOST 'LA LA LAND' ROLES FOR BEING TOO DEMANDING

The celebrity news magazine explained how in the film’s opening song, audiences will witness a line of boys being led to school, while a group of little girls are left behind to do the laundry. Belle, an unapologetic bookworm, invents a washing machine that frees the little girls from their chores, allowing her time to teach them how to read. This results in the townsfolk smashing her creation.

“They don’t think women should read and it goes further than that,” said Watson, who, Entertainment Weekly noted, participated in the Women’s March in Washington D.C. with her mother.

And it says airlines had one of their best years for on-time arrivals, although it wasn’t a record and December was worse than the same month a year earlier.

The Transportation Department reported Tuesday that the 12 leading U.S. airlines canceled 1.17 percent of flights last year, the lowest rate among comparable figures going back to 1995. The previous best was 1.24 percent in 2002, when travel decreased after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

So you might think it’s all upgrades and free snacks in the air. Travelers know better.

Airlines have added extra fees for many things that used to be included in the ticket price. Changing a ticket? That will cost you up to $200, depending on the airline, and even more for international flights.

Average legroom has been shrinking for years. To squeeze in more seats, the cushions are getting thinner. Air travel is less egalitarian — the biggest airlines boast about fancy new seats and other amenities for passengers in the premium cabins, but they are also introducing “basic economy” fares that in some cases don’t let coach passengers use the overhead bins.

Still, air travel is first about getting quickly from one place to another. And the airlines seem to be doing a better job of that.

The Transportation Department says 81.4 percent of domestic flights arrived on-time, which the government defines as within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. That was the fourth-best year since 1995. But December’s on-time rate of 75.6 percent was down from 77.8 percent in the previous December.

Hawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines had the best on-time rates for the full year. December’s leaders were Hawaiian, Delta and American Airlines. Spirit Airlines ranked last for 2016, but rival budget carrier Frontier Airlines was last in December.

The bad news was that there were more long delays in any year since 2013. There were 84 domestic flights last year that sat on the ground for more than three hours, and 36 international flights that waited at least four hours — long enough on all those flights that the government could fine the airlines.

MIDDLE EASTERN AIRLINE TROLLS TRUMP WITH AIRFARE PROMOTION

The airlines reported that one bag was lost, stolen or delayed for every 370 passengers, the best rate since the Transportation Department started tracking the figure in 1987.

If so, you’re not alone.

A majority of Americans — 57 percent, in fact — are suffering from post-election stress, according to a survey released this week by the American Psychological Association (APA). Nearly half of those surveyed, which included both Democrats and Republicans, reported that the political climate was either a very significant or somewhat significant source of stress. Two-thirds, or 66 percent, said they were stressed about the future of the nation, according to the APA.

"The research is very clear on the fact that uncertainty or a lack of control is a very strong source of stress,” Dr. Jim Diaz-Granados, executive director of education at the APA, told Fox News. “If you look at the campaign and into the election, we certainly are at a time of a lot of change and a lot of uncertainty, and I would say that probably the level of predictability is less, and so it would be reasonable to surmise that stress would increase.”

He noted that any kind of change, be it negative or positive — like getting married or buying a new home — can trigger a stress response.

“Those also contribute to feelings of stress, so again back to the idea of ‘there’s been a lot of change going on,’ and so I think people are reacting to that,” Diaz-Granados said.

After noticing a rising number of Americans seeking mental health help after the election, the APA decided to analyze stress levels for the first time in its annual survey, which it has conducted for the past 10 years.

Previously, Americans ranked work- and money-related concerns as their top stressor, but since the inception of the survey, the APA has never seen the the No. 1 stressor rank as high as post-election stress does this year.

“The only ones that have come close to being two-thirds were around 59 to 62 percent, so it was quite striking to see the extent to which people were identifying this as a significant source of stress,” Diaz-Granados said.

While many communities across the country saw spikes in requests for counseling after the election, crisis lines have meanwhile been flooded with similar cries for help.

If the latest findings from the APA are any indication, Americans are still struggling to find ways to cope post-election.

To help better manage your post-election stress, Diaz-Granados offered the following tips:

1. Prioritize self-care

“Exercise is a particularly very effective way of dealing with stress,” Diaz-Granados said. “It’s a way of losing yourself in the exercise, whether it’s running cycling or walking.” Physical exercise can help reduce stress and release endorphins, a natural reliever of depression and anxiety symptoms. Diaz-Granados advised consuming a nutritious diet, too, because during times of high stress, people may turn to alcohol or fatty foods to help cope.

2. Get involved

Seeking out opportunities in your community can help reduce stress, said Diaz-Granados, who has a doctorate in psychology. “Finding places to volunteer for folks who have a passion or interest — certainly, that is a very good way of taking a break from the election [talk].”

3. Seek help if you need it

“It’s important to know that when you are feeling stress, and especially over a long period of time, or chronically day in and day out, that that can have physical consequences,” like headache or stomachache, Diaz-Granados said. “We really do advise people to take care of that and be aware of their feelings of stress, and to take a break, and also seek professional help if they need to.”

4. Limit your exposure to social media

In this day and age, it may be tempting to check your Facebook or Twitter feed on the regular, but limiting your exposure to online chatter yet making an effort to stay informed can help you stay sane. “Given the environment that we’re in, one of our recommendations is that people need to be mindful of that," Diaz-Granados said.NASA has selected three potential landing sites for the upcoming Mars 2020 rover: an ancient lake, a past volcanic hotbed and an early hot-spring site.

Scientists chose the final three candidates at a workshop Feb. 8-10 in Monrovia, California, from eight sites chosen in 2015 (out of a pool of around 30, NASA officials said in a statement ).

NASA began its final design and construction phase for Mars 2020 in July of 2016. The rover is intended to hunt for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet after touching down in February 2021, exploring for at least two years, mission team members have said. [NASA's Mars Rover 2020 Mission in Pictures]

The Jezero crater stood out as a forerunner site in 2015, and is among the three remaining potential sites. It's an ancient lakebed where microbial life could have developed, NASA officials said in the statement. The river-delta structure suggests that water filled and drained from the crater at least twice, and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has identified minerals that have been chemically altered by water.

Starting in 2004, the Mars exploration rover Spirit explored Gusev crater, which stretches larger than the state of Connecticut. Spirit discovered evidence of past mineral hot springs at one particular location, according to the statement. That spot, Columbia Hills, is the only place where Spirit found signs of water in the enormous crater, and it is another of NASA's top picks for Mars 2020. (Later data analysis suggested Gusev may have hosted a shallow lake.)

An ancient volcano warmed Northeast Syrtis, and this heat could have led to hot springs and melting ice, making a welcome haven for past microbial life. The edge of the Syrtis Major volcanos is Mars 2020's third potential site. The spot exposes 4-billion-year-old bedrock, as well as many minerals altered by encounters with water during Mars' early history.

To choose from among the three top sites, which all have evidence of liquid water in their history, scientists will determine where the rover could land and travel safely. They will also look at which location has a variety of rocks and soils to analyze, the best conditions to have supported past life, and rock types that would retain evidence of past life, among other considerations .

The final determination should come after a fourth workshop, likely in 2018, researchers said at the 2015 meeting — or perhaps at a fifth, in 2019, if necessary. The craft itself should launch in July 2020 on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

They’re designed to look like simple transport, but are packed to the gunwales with enough weaponry to take down unsuspecting foes who think they’re easy prey.

Why aren’t I writing about cars this week? I am.

Well, the term was originally a nautical one. Q-ships — merchant ships with concealed weapons — are the Trojan horses of the sea. They have participated in naval warfare for hundreds of years, but they were widely used against submarines in the World Wars of the 20th century. Their name refers to the Queenstown, Ireland, port where many were based during World War I.

But the term has also come to be applied to low-profile, high-performance cars, typically bland luxury sedans with enough power to blow away flashy sports cars without drawing undue attention to themselves. Hyundai has now democratized that idea with its new Elantra Sport — though perhaps it’s overdue, as the company that founded it runs one of the world’s largest shipbuilding operations.

The Sport is the most powerful Elantra ever, but it’s subtle. One could be parked next to your desk right now and you’d never know it. It does get a black grille surround, unique headlamps, LED accent lights, small rocker panel extensions and a chin spoiler that’s low enough for me to scrape on a curb, but it looks neither fast nor furious in your rearview mirror. It’s only after it passes you, and you see its dual exhaust pipes receding into the distance, that you realize you’ve been duped.

It could happen. The Sport is no Corvette (the car or the ship), but with a very eager 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, it is quick in the tradition of hot compact hatchbacks, even though it has a trunk. It’s available with a six-speed manual transmission that’s a delight to operate for $22,450, or with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic with racy paddle shifters that can be had for an extra $1,100, making it the cheapest sedan with more than 200 horsepower – 201 hp, to be exact.

Just as important, the Sport gets an independent rear suspension that the other Elantras don’t have. This is mainly to improve its handling, but it also gives it a better overall ride. This kind of update is no small effort, and indicates how seriously Hyundai took the development of the Sport.

Changes to the Elantra’s dull-but-enormous cabin are limited to mildly racy fonts on the gauges, a couple of strips of fake carbon fiber trim, red stitching, the requisite flat-bottom steering wheel and a set of deeply-bolstered bucket seats that wouldn’t look or feel out of place in a sports car that cost twice as much.

Those seats come in handy in the curves, where the front-wheel-drive Sport grips tenaciously and remains as neutral as Taylor Swift’s politics. It’s only at the very limits, not reached on a public road without breaking a few laws, that it loses its composure. But the Sport is about as street-fast as a car needs to be to deliver an entertaining drive...in short doses. Its 30 mpg highway rating is unimpressive for a brand known for its efficiency.

Nevertheless, if you’re looking for a boy racer ride without the boy racer style, it’s worth checking the Sport out at your local Hyundai lot. You might like what you see, if you can find one.

Happy hunting.

The demonstrators held aloft colorful swatches of cloth and waved to the residents of the neighboring city of El Paso, Texas.

Organizers said a friendly, human wall meant to join the two cities was better than a wall of steel or concrete to divide them.

"We have, as it is being demonstrated here, many friends on the other side of the river, on the other side where they intend to build this wall that will never separate two friendly peoples," said former Mexican presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said.

Trump has promised to make Mexico pay for the wall, something Mexican officials say they will not do.Callista and I have great affection and respect for Bob Michel, and the news of his passing at age 93 brought back a lot of memories. He was a great colleague, mentor, and friend.

I learned an immense amount from Bob in our 16 years serving together – especially during the five years I served as whip while he was leader. Bob taught me lesson after lesson about leading people in a legislative environment.

He was always a citizen first and a politician second. And Bob, like Senator Bob Dole, represented what Tom Brokaw called "the Greatest Generation."

Both grew up with solid middle American values. Both took patriotism and hard work for granted. Both served in the Army in Europe. Both were wounded. Both overcame their wounds and went on to serve in public office.

We are fortunate to still have Senator Dole with us. I am sure he joins in reflecting on what a remarkable citizen leader Bob Michel was.

After Michel fought the Axis powers in Europe – earning two Bronze stars, a Purple Heart, and four Battle Stars – he came home to Peoria, Illinois. There, he graduated from Bradley University and married his lifetime love, Corinne Woodruff. Both loved music (Bob had a great singing voice, and Corinne was a talented pianist). They had four children and remain a close-knit family.

Bob was also a fan of the Chicago Cubs. I am glad he got to see them break their “curse” and win the World Series last year. I’m told Bob watched every game with rapt attention.

After overcoming the wounds he suffered in World War II, Bob continued his life of service to America. He came to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1949 as an assistant to Congressman Harold Velde. In 1957 Bob replaced Velde and served for 38 years – including six as Republican whip and 14 as minority leader. He was the longest serving minority leader in American history.

Bob used to tell those of us in Congress great stories about the lessons he learned serving as bartender for private sessions with Senator Everett Dirksen and long-time Republican Whip Congressman Les Arends, both of Illinois. He left deep impressions on all who worked with him.

Former Congressman Bob Walker, who was my close ally in working for a House Republican majority, caught the essence of Bob Michel in a note he wrote to Bob's family, which he has allowed me to quote:

"So sorry for your loss. But in a larger sense, it is truly a loss to all of us and to the nation. For all 50 years that I was on the Hill and working with the Hill, Bob Michel was a giant and an inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, he was the shining example of a legislator's legislator. No one was more respected by all of his colleagues for his leadership, his integrity, his courage and his sense of principle. Barb and I truly mourn with you on the loss of a great man and great American."

Bob Michel became minority leader three years after I arrived in Congress in 1978. As Michael Barone noted in the Reagan years, Bob was possibly the most effective minority leader in history.

The passage of the Reagan and Bush agendas owed a lot to Bob's skills and leadership – and his ability to successfully play the hand he was dealt. You can see that in the way he held the House GOP and the Bush administration together when the 1990 tax increase fight threatened to spin out of control. He could also work with Tip O'Neill and Dan Rostenkowski to get a lot done for Reagan. I could never have done that.

On the other hand, I was prepared to run a national campaign to elect a House GOP majority for the first time in 40 years. Bob was willing to tolerate my forcing the pace in 1993, and he very generously backed me for over a year as we pushed to elect a majority. He could easily have insisted I wait until his retirement, but that would have made the Contract with America campaign impossible.

Bob was deeply devoted to his family and his wife Corinne, and her passing in 2003 left a sadness that nearly equaled their intense partnership and happiness. Callista and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the Michel family.

Bob’s was a life worth living and an inspirational model for us all.

Follow him on Twitter @NewtGingrich.House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday defended the controversial border adjustment tax, which he called “good manufacturing policy,” during his weekly press conference with the media.

Continue Reading Below

“[The border adjustment tax is] putting American-made products at a huge advantage. There’s a built-in bias in our tax code to outsource and re-import into this country. That’s not good for American jobs, that’s not good for American manufacturing, that’s not good for American economic growth,” Ryan said.

The comments come one day after retail executives, including AutoZone (AZO) president and CEO Bill Rhodes, JCPenney (JCP) CEO Marvin Ellison and Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell, huddled with President Trump at the White House to voice their concerns over the divisive tax. The industry leaders later met with Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) of the Senate Finance Committee.

“We had a positive and productive conversation with President Trump… [Where] we stressed the importance of taking a thoughtful approach to tax reform for both individuals and corporations,” AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said in a statement on Wednesday.

After the meeting, Rep. Brady said he is “confident” the border adjustment tax, which would eliminate the ability for companies to deduct the cost of imports – but exempt exports from being taxed, will be included in the GOP’s tax reform plan. While supporters say the tax is designed to prevent the outsourcing of American jobs, opponents argue this type of tariff will result in a financial burden that retail companies will be forced to pass on to the consumer.

“This 20 percent tax on all imports is regressive, hammers consumers, and shuts down economic growth,” Senator Perdue (R-GA) wrote in a letter to his colleagues last week.

In a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) echoed concerns that it would seriously cripple the average American.

“It’s estimated that this one change alone would produce something like $100 billion a year in additional tax revenue. That’s a lot of money, and someone has to pay it. And I’ll tell you exactly who’s going to pay: working Americans who’ve been struggling for decades. A tax on imports is a tax on things working folk buy every single day,” Cotton told his colleagues.

This type of consumer pain would spillover to stunt an already slowly-moving economy, Brian Wesbury, First Trust chief economist, told FOX Business.

“U.S. companies have arranged their affairs based on the current tax code - trillions of dollars of decisions. Shifting to a [border adjustment tax] creates a chaotic cascade of winners and losers. This chaos is bad for the economy,” he said.

It is unclear whether President Trump will ultimately support the tax, he has called it “too complicated.” Meanwhile, a few U.S. multinationals who stand to gain from the tax exemption on exports, including Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE), have come out in favor of it. Even some retail industry insiders have spoken out for it, maintaining that it is an essential part of the GOP’s overhaul agenda.

“[The CEOs in opposition to the tax] are making their decisions based on the tax code as it is set up today, and what’s being proposed is a complete reform of the tax code where the incentives to export jobs and export businesses that have existed for years would be turned around so that the incentives to build capability and jobs in the U.S. would exist,” Bill Simon, former Walmart U.S. president and CEO, said during an interview with FOX Business’ Stuart Varney Wednesday.

Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform president, said the border tax supports the administration's pro-growth agenda.

"The part of the tax reform package that creates a border adjustable cash-flow business tax is part of overall pro-growth and job creating tax reform," he told FOX Business.

In December a staff memo leaked from the Democrats in the Senate Finance Committee revealed they find the proposal “confusing, untested” and “possibly illegal under WTO rules.”

On Thursday, Ryan said that division on Capitol Hill over the policy will not impede the tax reform process.

"We are doing tax reform. Tax reform is going to happen. Do you know why tax reform is going to happen? Because it has to happen," Ryan said.Every year, about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack and 610,000 people die of heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Luckily, there are measures you can take to keep your name off these lists.

In honor of National Heart Health Month, Fox News talked to two doctors to get the lowdown on keeping your ticker in tip-top shape.

For a healthier heart, take note of the following harmful behaviors:

1. You’re eating too much red meat

While we all love a juicy grilled steak or a hearty burger with fries after a long day at the office, people with diets rich in red meat may be more prone to heart attacks, research suggests. Unlike chicken, turkey and fatty fish, which can promote heart health, red meat contains saturated fat and high levels of cholesterol, Dr. Haitham Ahmed, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, told Fox News. Red meat can also trigger production of the compound TMAO, which can accelerate plaque buildup.

What to do instead: For optimal heart health, aim to eat two to three servings of oily fish like salmon and albacore tuna per week, and limit your intake of red meat to only one serving per week, Ahmed said.

2. You’re overexerting yourself

“Every year whenever we see a snowstorm, we see a spike in the number of cardiac arrests,” Ahmed said. That’s because cold weather causes blood vessels to constrict and the pressure within them to increase. “You get many patients who have not worked out for long time and making a huge effort to shovel a long driveway after foot of snow, and that’s like being unprepared for several months and going out in the cold to run a marathon,” he explained.

What to do instead: Pace yourself during physical exertion, and be aware of the symptoms of heart attack so you can know when to seek prompt medical help. Common heart attack signs include chest pain or discomfort, upper body discomfort and shortness of breath, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

3. You’re having sex under risky circumstances

Similarly, engaging in vigorous sexual activity can be risky for some individuals, including those with cardiac dysfunction, Ahmed said. Men who have high blood pressure or have had a previous heart event should also be wary of taking performance-enhancing medication, which can increase strain on the heart under certain circumstances.

What to do instead: Talk to your doctor, and be transparent about what medication and supplements you’re taking. If you recently had a heart event, discuss whether it’s safe to have sex at this time.

4. You’re drinking too much booze

Dr. Steve Gundry, former professor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda University, and current director at the Center for Restorative Medicine, told Fox News that drinking too much alcohol can adversely affect the intestinal wall and increase the risk of leaky gut syndrome. “This leaky gut allows bacterial particles into our bloodstream that can directly affect the linings of our blood vessels,” Gundry said.

What to do instead: Luckily, you can reverse this effect by reducing the amount of alcohol you consume, Gundry said. Dr. Ahmed cited guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA), which recommends a max of one to two drinks per day for men, and one drink per day for women. One drink equates to 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits, or 1 ounce of 100-proof spirits.

5. You’re regularly eating packaged foods

Processed foods that come in a wrapper tend to contain more salt, sugar and fat, and thus are not the best choices for your heart. First, Ahmed said, consuming too much sodium over time can increase your blood pressure and put strain on your blood vessels and heart. Second, saturated fat, meanwhile, can raise cholesterol levels and accelerate plaque buildup. Third, excess sugar can increase the risk of diabetes and obesity, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.

What to do instead: Reach for whole foods that are low in salt, sugar and fat. In addition to fatty fish, the Cleveland Clinic recommends oatmeal, berries, nuts, broccoli, and black or kidney beans as some of the healthiest foods for your ticker.

6. You’re using new risky substances

Despite their novelty, substances like energy drinks and e-cigarette vapor hold potential harmful health effects based on what patient cases and basic science tell us, Ahmed suggested. E-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive, and some studies suggest the devices can offer a gateway to using regular cigarettes. Meanwhile, energy drinks contain sugar and caffeine, which kick the liver into overdrive and lead energy levels to skyrocket then crash. Some energy drink companies also supplement their products with an ingredient called carnitine, which is present in red meat and can increase TMAO buildup.

What to do instead: Steer clear of smoking e-cigarettes, and trade your energy drink for more sleep, or a cup of coffee or green tea, which research suggests may promote heart health.

7. You’re stressed out

It’s not just your diet or activity that can influence your heart attack risk — your mental state can, too. “Stress has a profound impact on the heart, the blood vessels, the heart rate, blood pressure, and all kinds of things,” Ahmed said. “Without having blockages, you can see patients who have massive heart attacks.” Clinically, those events are described as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, takotsubo cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. “It’s just a testament to how strong or influential stress is on our bodies,” Ahmed said.

What to do instead: Learn to manage your stress better. Talking to a trusted friend or family member, or finding an outlet like meditation, can help keep your stress levels in check. “Steady exercise is best to keep stress levels low,” Ahmed advised. “During exercise, you secrete endorphins, which naturally relieve depression symptoms.”Fergie Goes Full MILF In Maui

Fergie can forget that tired old resolution about getting in shape -- 'cause girl's bikini body is already bangin'!

Fergie's splashing around in the Maui surf with hubby Josh Duhamel -- and after getting all wet, she made sure to dry her buns ... with some direct Hawaiian sunlight.

Honestly? Not since Jessica Alba ... brava, Fergie!!Silence is golden, the saying goes. But so, evidently, was the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, according to a recent study.

Brahe, who was born in 1546 and died in 1601, was a keen observer of the heavens. But he also was exposed to enough gold while he was alive for it to show up in tests of his hair— in fact, researchers found about 20 to 100 times the amount of gold in hair samples from Brahe’s corpse than is normal today. The hair came from his eyebrows, beard, and scalp, and the scientists also found evidence in his bones that he’d been exposed to gold.

The work was carried out by Kaare Lund Rasmussen, an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark. Brahe’s body was exhumed in 2010.

DA VINCI DISCOVERY: RARE DRAWING, VALUED AT $16 MILLION, FOUND

“We found traces of gold in Tycho Brahe's hair, and we can establish that he was exposed to gold while these hairs were still on his body,” Rasmussen said, in a statement. He thinks that Brahe got the gold into his system because of his lifestyle— like the plates from which he ate.

“It may have been the cutlery and plates of gold, or maybe the wine he drank contained gold leaf. It's also possible that he concocted and consumed elixirs containing gold, or that he worked with alchemy,” Rasmussen said.

While gold was found in the highest amounts, the researchers also found evidence of other substances, like silver, arsenic, and iron, though not enough to poison the famed Renaissance astronomer. And while some had thought that Brahe had died from mercury poisoning, this research and past research shows that wasn’t the case.

FEATHERED DINOSAUR TAIL FRAGMENT TRAPPED IN AMBER AMAZES SCIENTISTS

The researchers were even able to figure out, based on Brahe’s hair and how it grew, that his exposure to the gold and other elements actually decreased in a period of about two months before he died. That means that the astronomer might have been weak before he passed away, and unable to spend time in his laboratory.

“What Tycho Brahe died of is therefore still uncertain,” Rasmussen added. One theory has it that he died from an infected bladder.

Brahe is also known for his nose, or lack thereof. He lost part of it in a sword fight, and wore a prosthesis— that metal piece was made of brass, previous research showed, not silver, as had been thought.

The study about the golden hair was published in the journal Archaeometry.

In an effort to better understand that crater, scientists drilled down into part of it this spring in the Gulf of Mexico, pushing as deep as about 4,380 feet under the sea floor. The samples they retrieved have helped them study the dynamics of the impact— and they also report that the impact might even have provided spaces for new life to form, according to Imperial College London.

"It is hard to believe that the same forces that destroyed the dinosaurs may have also played a part, much earlier on in Earth's history, in providing the first refuges for early life on the planet,” Joanna Morgan, the study’s first author and a professor at Imperial College London, said in a statement. “We are hoping that further analyses of the core samples will provide more insights into how life can exist in these subterranean environments."

Those “refuges” existed because the rock became more porous due to the impact— and porous rock and the water that circulated through could make for a happy place for organisms to grow, Imperial College London said. One implication of this theory is that previous asteroid impacts in Earth’s early history could have had the same effect on the rock, giving life a place to develop a very long time ago.

The Yucatan impact created a phenomenon called a peak ring, which is what the researchers drilled down into— it’s “an uneven ring of rocky hills within the crater bowl,” a scientist wrote in a commentary accompanying the new study. The study, which was published this week in the journal Science, has helped scientists better understand the dramatic formation of that peak ring, which is now buried beneath the surface.

President Trump on Friday said that the U.S. is looking into a “big order” of Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornets that may have stealth capabilities.

Trump made the comments during a tour of a Boeing plant in South Carolina. The message appeared to be also directed at Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 and corporate rival, Bloomberg reported.

“We are looking seriously at a big order,” Trump said, referring to the F/A-18. He said, “If the price (of the F-35) doesn’t come down, we would. The F-18’s a great plane and now put a stealth component onto it.”

VIDEO: TRUMP: AMERICAN WORKERS WILL SOON HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, was seen at the factory holding a brochure for the F/A-18 XT, which is the advanced Super Hornet, DefenseNews.com reported.

Trump has called the costs of the F-35 program “out of control.” He has been critical of both Lockheed and Boeing and appears to be comfortable pitting the two aerospace giants against each other.

Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing, said in January that he has spoken to Trump about the Air Force One program and “discussed fighter aircraft.”

The U.S. Air Force plans to buy 1,763 of the F-35A model jets, Bloomberg reported. The report said that there is likely not much Boeing could do to compete with the fifth-generation F-35, which is equipped with a more advanced radar system.

The Dallas Morning News reported that Lockheed cut about $600 million from the F-35 program. The planes used to cost $102 million each, now they are under $100 million.

The F-35 program made up 20 percent of Lockheed's total 2015 revenue of $46.1 billion. And U.S. government orders made up 78 percent of its revenue last year.

The F-35 program directly or indirectly supports more than 146,000 U.S. jobs, according to the company's website. Lockheed assembles the F-35s in Fort Worth, Texas.

Lockheed said at the time that it has worked to lower the price of the F-35 by more than 60 percent and said it expects the aircraft to cost $85 million in 2019 and 2020.

In December,Trump tweeted Thursday that based on the “tremendous” cost overruns of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, he had asked the aerospace giant's competitor, Boeing, to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."

On Friday Scott Pruitt was confirmed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration. Pruitt, who has been harshly criticized by climate change advocates, believes the role human activity plays in causing climate change is up for debate.

Continue Reading Below

President Trump has not been shy about his contempt for how the EPA has been run, at one point during his campaign even saying he wanted to eliminate the agency altogether.

Climate change activists view Pruitt’s confirmation as a step away from the progressive agenda laid out under President Obama. However, Princeton physics professor William Happer believes that this “cult” of activists often has little evidence to back up its claims about what is actually causing global warming.

“…Any time you confront them, instead of talking about the science, they talk about 97% agree with us, we have to be right, so that’s what I meant by cult,” Happer told the FOX Business Network’s Stuart Varney.



Happer doesn’t believe humans are to blame for the changes we are seeing in the global climate.

“You know I think most of the climate change we’re seeing is natural, the climate has always changed…,” he said.

Some people like Stephen Hawking are concerned that the record-breaking increase in the Earth’s temperature could pose a serious danger to the planet unless we start decreasing the use of fossil fuels. However, Happer said people need to pay more attention to the statistics and look less at the polls to get their facts about climate change.



“It’s a problem with science illiteracy and most people don’t realize that the normal C02 levels have typically been measured in thousands of parts per million, not the puny 400 or so we have today and the Earth thrives. So the idea that the Earth has never had high C02 levels, it’s completely false, most of the time it’s never had such low levels as we have now,” he said.

Even though Happer isn’t an advocate for climate change, he doesn’t dismiss the experts who are looking into the science behind whether climate change could be due to human activity.

“There are many very good climate scientists I especially admire. Climate scientists who do measurements, of temperatures from satellites, properties of the ocean from buoys, concentrations from Co2s, these are good scientists and we should support them…”Scientists working in the waters off the coast of South America have released the first images of the stunning Amazon Reef.

The coral reef was discovered last year during an expedition off the coast of Brazil where the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza were conducting an exploration using a submarine when they came across the system, located about 721 feet below the sea and 62 miles off the coast.

CHRISTMAS CREATURE: 'CANDY CANE' CRAB DISCOVERED IN THE CARIBBEAN

Some 600 miles long, the reef stretches from French Guyana to the Brazilian state of Maranhão and is part of a system of corals, sponges and rhodoliths, with an area of 3,600 square miles, according to Greenpeace. In addition, the reef's usage of light is unique, as are its water conditions, according to experts.

In a press release on the Greenpeace website, Nils Asp, a researcher at the Federal University of Pará, said the reef “has a huge potential for new species, and it is also important for the economic well-being of fishing communities along the Amazonian Coastal Zone.”

ENDANGERED SEA TURTLES ARE ACTUALLY THRIVING AT BELIZE REEF

In its release Greenpeace voiced its concern that oil companies BP and Total could be given permission from the Brazilian government to drill in the area, which has an estimated 15-20 billion barrel reserve.

Noting that less than 5 percent of the ecosystem has been currently mapped, Asp said, “Our team wants to have a better understanding of how this ecosystem works, including important questions like its photosynthesis mechanisms with very limited light.”Two F-15s caused a ‘sonic boom’ as they raced from their base in Homestead, Fla., Friday to intercept an unresponsive general aviation aircraft that flew near Palm Beach during a stay by President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.

The jets flew at supersonic speeds and residents were startled by the loud boom, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, said in a statement. The two fighters were able to establish communication with the aircraft. This incident occured at about 7 p.m. ET. No further details were immediately available.

"The intent of military intercepts is to have the identified aircraft re-establish communications with local FAA air traffic controllers and instruct the pilot to follow air traffic controllers' instructions to land safely for follow-on action," the statement read.

TRUMP HINTS AT 'BIG ORDER' OF F/A-18 SUPER HORNETS

Earlier this month, a private plane got within 2 nautical miles of Air Force One, which is closer than permitted, while flying over Florida and the incident is being investigated by authorities, Bloomberg reported.

The planes were flying on a parallel route and there was no risk of a collision during the incident, which occurred 30 miles out on Feb. 3, sources told the news agency. President Trump arrived safely at Palm Beach International Airport.

The report said that when Air Force One is in flight, Secret Service agents work with FAA supervisors and monitor for threats.Reince Priebus, facing growing criticism and calls for his ouster, is racing to bring order to a White House that looks to be spiraling out of control.

After weeks of West Wing turmoil and critiques from President Donald Trump himself, the chief of staff is scrambling to impose a more traditional approach on a White House that is anything but, according to more than a dozen administration aides and others close to Priebus.

Story Continued Below

Priebus, who arrives at the White House by 6:30 a.m. and often doesn’t leave until midnight, has launched an early-morning staff meeting aimed at streamlining each day. He spends hours on the phone with Capitol Hill Republicans, who have been left confused and flat-footed by the administration’s stormy opening days. He’s trying to reshape an overwhelmed communications office that has had its share of fumbles. And, along with several others, he guided the search for a replacement for scandal-ridden national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose dismissal an infuriated Priebus helped to engineer.

The maneuvers paint a picture of an embattled aide frantically trying to corral a White House that has been swamped by division and dysfunction. Whether he succeeds could determine his political future — and determine the administration’s path as it moves beyond its tumultuous first month.

Priebus, a 44-year-old lawyer-turned-Republican National Committee chairman new to the federal government, has turned to a group of former chiefs of staff who have briefed him on how previous administrations functioned. They include Rahm Emanuel, the hard-charging Chicago mayor and former top Barack Obama aide, whom he met with this week. He has also leaned on Andy Card and Josh Bolten, who navigated the fires of the George W. Bush years.

It all comes at a time of mounting urgency for Priebus, who has become a favorite target for those unhappy with the rocky start — some of whom are demanding he get the hook. Breitbart, a conservative website deeply influential in Trump world, published an article Tuesday hyping the possibility of a Priebus firing. Over the past week, two longtime Trump friends, Republican strategist Roger Stone and NewsMax chief executive Christopher Ruddy, have called for his removal — though Ruddy changed his position after a pledge from Priebus that he’d improve.

“I had this quaint idea that the chief of staff would know what he was doing,” Stone said in an interview, adding that many of the president’s longtime supporters were losing faith in Priebus. “There will be more revelations about things he's done in this job that don't serve the president well. I promise you there will be more revelations.”

Although many chiefs of staff become subjects of shakeup rumors, the earliness and intensity of those confronting Priebus are unusual.

Trump himself in recent days has burned up his phone line to sound out friends in the business world about how they think his chief of staff is performing, something he has done in the past when he’s not happy with an employee. The president, ever the fan of theater, has stoked speculation about a shakeup, meeting Tuesday for lunch in the White House with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and his wife, Mary Pat. Christie has long been rumored for a top job in the administration.

For now, the president is waving off talk of a change — telling reporters this week that Priebus is doing “great.”

During Trump’s press conference on Thursday, the president defended his chief of staff and rejected reports of “chaos" inside the White House.

“I won. And ... zero chaos,” Trump said. “We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press.”

He also praised Priebus for his performance in the 2016 campaign, a topic he returned to throughout the news conference.

In private conversations over the past week, Priebus has expressed confidence in his standing and shrugged off reports that he could be in trouble. In one phone call with an associate, the chief of staff conveyed frustration over internal turf battles, described as a level of franticness that was hard to manage, and hinted at a rising degree of fatigue.

Amid the fury, Priebus has adopted a low-profile approach, quietly embracing his role as the guy whose job it is to keep an unruly White House running and granting few interviews. He did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

For Priebus — a Washington Republican who has long been close to mainstream party figures like Haley Barbour and Karl Rove — the Trump wilderness has at times been hard to navigate. He has been trying to closely manage staffing across Cabinet agencies. Yet he often feels a need to be at Trump’s side throughout the day to make sure the easy-to-distract president stays on track. During meetings, when his boss veers into a tangent, Priebus is often the one trying to get him in line.

"Trump is nothing like Reince has ever dealt with,” said one person who knows Priebus well. “Would you want the job of trying to control him and getting him to focus?"

The president can be nearly impossible to staff. His whims, moods and insatiable appetite for TV can throw off plans. Priebus, along with others, often briefs him extensively before meetings, telling him about the audience's makeup and offering guidance for what he should say. Yet Trump has veered off on tangents, like repeating his unsubstantiated claim during meetings with senators that voter fraud was committed in the election. It has often fallen upon Priebus to change the subject — sometimes with success, sometimes not.

"The staff has to assume that Donald Trump is going to do things in unconventional ways and that he's not going to change," said Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican. "They have to learn to work around that."

In order to be with Trump nearly all of the time, Priebus has largely handed off oversight of White House operations to deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, one of his top lieutenants.

Priebus has had to confront obstacles beyond Trump. The president, who is fond of creating decentralized leadership structures where power is split among multiple aides with different viewpoints, has empowered not just his chief of staff, but also a handful of top advisers — chief strategist Steve Bannon, senior adviser Jared Kushner and counselor Kellyanne Conway.

Some White House aides say they’ve seen Bannon or Conway in conversation with Trump — and then observed Priebus rushing to insert himself into the discussion.

At times, he has seemed determined to convince others of his influence. After the botched travel ban rollout, Priebus made a round of calls to senior Republicans to relay that the president had made clear that Priebus’ team, and no one else, was in charge of day-to-day operations.

"He's not been set up to be a very strong chief of staff," said one staffer. "I think there's an insecurity there."

Trump’s mercurial nature has only heightened the sense of anxiety. "You're working for a president where no one really knows where they stand," the staffer said.

Priebus has been deeply frustrated by reports he and Bannon do not get along — something both of them adamantly deny. While Priebus has come to view Bannon as the architect of Trump’s nationalist vision, Bannon regards Priebus as the operational vehicle that will carry the president’s agenda. Staffers have grown used to entering the building early in the morning and seeing the two already deep in discussion.

Bannon, who rarely speaks on the record, said in a text message: “Reince is doing a great job."

Priebus has grown particularly close with policy adviser Stephen Miller, a populist flamethrower who is Bannon’s ally. While in New York City during the transition, the two met for in-depth conversations over meals. Last week, Priebus was heavily involved in Miller’s preparation for a series of Sunday show interviews.

Bannon and Miller have insisted they did not have a hand in this week’s anti-Priebus story that appeared in Breitbart; Bannon was formerly an executive of the conservative website, and Miller has been previously linked to it.

“Reince is exemplary,” Miller wrote in an email. “He is a close friend, and his leadership has been stellar in every way.”

Priebus’ job, many staffers are convinced, is safe — at least for now. And some of those who’ve worked for him in the past point to one early move as a primary reason why that’s the case: his decision to line the White House with a number of his loyalists — chief among them Walsh and press secretary Sean Spicer.

“If Reince goes,” said one former Priebus aide, “everyone else goes that he brought in.”Swedish furniture retailer Ikea has apologized for a catalog aimed at Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that contains no images of women.

Ikea says the booklet was produced by its Israeli branch, not by the Swedish group itself.

IKEA spokeswoman Josefin Thorell says the catalog "is not something that has gone through us," adding "we have been very clear that this is not what the Ikea brand stands for."

Thorell told Swedish news agency TT late Friday that its Israeli franchise "had tried to reach a consumer group" and made "an error."

Thorell was not immediately available for comment on Saturday, and it was not clear how many catalogs had been printed.

It’s easy to diagnose yourself with a cold when you’re feeling unwell. But a cold isn’t always just a cold. It’s important to be able to tell the difference between the common cold and something more serious so you can get the medical attention you need.

If you think you have "just a cold" but are concerned it could be something more, it’s best to err on the safe side and visit your doctor. This is especially true if you have a chronic condition such as asthma, severe allergies, diabetes, kidney disease, HIV, or an autoimmune disease. The same goes for pregnant women and anyone under age six or over 65—the common cold affects these groups of people differently and can be more serious than it is for healthy individuals.

We spoke to doctors to find out what symptoms tip them off that it’s more than a cold. Here, the red flags they look for.

You’ve had symptoms for longer than four days

The common cold tends to clear up on its own in three to four days, says Melisa Lai Becker, MD, site chief of emergency medicine at Cambridge Health Alliance. It starts with a scratchy throat, congestion, and runny nose, and then a cough usually develops. While your cough and post-nasal drip may linger, most symptoms should disappear after four days.

"With a cold, you ultimately feel okay after a couple days of rest, hydration, and Kleenex," she says.

If symptoms last for longer, it’s possible you have something more worrisome, such as the flu or mononucleosis. To be safe, make an appointment with your physician.

Your symptoms seemed to go away… and then they came back

If you thought you recovered from your illness but your symptoms reappeared shortly after, it could be a sign of a rebound illness or "superinfection," says Navya Mysore, MD, a primary care physician with One Medical Group. You may have had a cold initially, but once your immune system was compromised, you developed something more serious—think strep throat, pneumonia, or a sinus infection. Book an appointment with your GP to determine whether or not you need additional treatment, such as antibiotics.

You recently returned from a big trip

Recent international travel is a red flag for doctors because it could mean you have a less-conventional infection they wouldn’t have normally considered, explains Stella Safo, MD, an internist at Mount Sinai Hospital who specializes in infectious diseases. It’s important to see a doctor if you have any symptoms after returning from a trip abroad.

You have a high fever

It is possible to have a fever along with a cold, but they’re not common—especially high ones. If you have a fever at or above 101 degrees Fahrenheit, it could be a sign of strep throat, says Dr. Lai Becker. Most patients with strep will develop a high fever in the first few days of illness, so be wary of sudden spikes in your temperature.

"Strep throat is one thing you really want to distinguish from a cold," she says. "Left untreated, it can cause rheumatic fever and lead to serious heart problems."

You’re having stomach issues

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea don’t usually accompany colds, so symptoms like these could signal something more serious, such as the flu. It’s important to get medical attention if you’re experiencing these symptoms consistently, as they can cause you to become dehydrated, says Dr. Mysore.

You have severe headaches

Doctors take note of severe headaches—especially if they’re accompanied by a fever and neck stiffness—because this could be a sign of meningitis, says Dr. Mysore. On the other hand, pressure headaches or headaches that feel worse around your eyes and nose may be a sign of sinus infection, she explains. These types of headaches can worsen when you bend forward, since you’re feeling the pressure of your congested sinus passages.

You’re experiencing chest pain or trouble breathing

Even though a cough is a normal symptom of a cold, it shouldn’t be so severe that it causes shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain, says Dr. Mysore. These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, since breathing trouble could be a sign of bronchitis or pneumonia, while chest pain, tightness, and sudden shortness of breath could signal a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot blockage in the lungs).

Your symptoms are in one location

Another red flag it’s more than a cold is a “localization” of symptoms, meaning you feel them in one specific area, explains Dr. Safo. While a cold affects the whole upper respiratory system, other illnesses are characterized by intense symptoms in one place. For example, Dr. Lai Becker points out that strep causes a sore throat so bad it’s difficult to swallow, but typically won’t cause pain throughout the body. Sinus infections can cause headaches and even make your teeth hurt, an ear infection will usually cause pain and congestion in one ear, and mono can cause swollen tonsils.

You have body aches

A regular cold is no walk in the park, but it shouldn’t cause all-over body aches and pains. On the other hand, the flu can make your muscles and body feel achy, and can also be accompanied by fatigue and chills.

"With the flu, you’ll feel like you got hit by a truck," says Dr. Mysore. Just getting out of bed will wear you out, and your muscles will be tender and sore.

There’s a pattern to your symptoms

It can be hard to distinguish allergies from a cold, since they have similar symptoms. But allergies will often follow a pattern, says Dr. Lai Becker. If you notice your symptoms are worse after spending time outside or with a pet, or they tend to come and go with a certain season, you likely have allergies. “I had one patient who thought he was sick, but the real story was that he was allergic to a cat,” Dr. Lai Becker says.

To pinpoint the exact cause, keep track of your symptom history and see if you notice any trends; it could mean you’re allergic to something or have seasonal allergies.

This article originally appeared on Health.com.Vice President Pence on Saturday worked to assure NATO allies that the United States would be “unwavering” in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.

Pence, in his first overseas trip as vice president, told the Munich Security Conference that President Donald Trump intends to "stand with Europe." He sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by the U.S. president’s positive statements about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

"Today, on behalf of President Trump, I bring you this assurance: The United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in its commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance," Pence said.

MCCAIN IN GERMANY SAYS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN ‘DISARRAY’

During his address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, to end violence in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence met afterward with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference just before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

The vice president’s comments come just weeks after Trump called NATO obsolete, according to a Bloomberg Politics reports about an interview the then-president elect gave to a German paper.

“It’s obsolete, first because it was designed many, many years ago,” Trump said. “Secondly, countries aren’t paying what they should” and NATO “didn’t deal with terrorism.”

On Saturday, Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace agreement aimed to end fighting in Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence also reinforced the Trump administration's message that NATO members must spend more on defense.

NATO's 28-member countries committed in 2014 to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. But only the U.S. and four other members of the post-World War II military coalition are meeting the standard, Pence said.

Failure to meet the commitment, he said, "erodes the very foundation of our alliance."

"Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment and, for most, that means the time has come to do more," Pence said.

James Jeffrey, a U.S. ambassador to Iraq during the Obama administration, said Pence looked "like an adult.” The question is will Trump listen to him?"

The visit, which will include a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression and Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Pence has also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion. Pence also planned to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

The Associated Press contributed to this reportU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says that the U.S. decision to block a former Palestinian prime minister from leading the U.N. political mission in Libya was "a serious mistake."

Washington blocked the proposed appointment of Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian Authority's prime minister from 2007 to 2013, a week ago. It said it was acting to support its ally, Israel.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Guterres said: "I believe that it's essential for everybody to understand that people serving the U.N. are serving in their personal capacities. They don't represent a country or a government."

Guterres said that Fayyad "was the right person in the right place at the right time." Libya has been gripped by unrest since its 2011 revolution and the killing of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi.Last Sunday morning, Mars reached opposition with the sun, meaning the Red Planet, Earth and the sun were all arrayed in a straight line. But the moment did not mark Mars' closest approach to Earth.

This Monday evening (May 30) at 5:35 p.m. ET, Mars will be the closest it has been to Earth since Oct. 5, 2005: 0.50321377 astronomical units (AU), or 46,762,695 miles . (One AU is the average distance from Earth to the sun — about 93 million miles.)

Opposition and closest Earth approach occur on different days because the orbit of Mars is elliptical. When opposition occurred May 22, Mars was still approaching Earth on its orbital track, and will not reach minimum distance to Earth until May 30. After 5:35 p.m. ET on that date, Mars will begin to recede from Earth. [Video - Skywatching Mars: 2016 Is A Great Time!]

The graphic shows how Mars would appear viewed with a superb telescope at the exact instant of closest approach. The landing site of NASA's Opportunity rover is just rotating out of sight on the Red Planet's eastern limb, and the solar system's highest volcano, Olympus Mons, is just coming into view on the western limb. Mars' Valles Marineris, far larger and deeper than Earth's Grand Canyon, is close to the center of the disk, and the dusky Acidalia Planitia is high to the north, close to the small north polar cap.

What can you see with an ordinary amateur telescope? Very little, I'm afraid. You might see a hint of the polar cap, and a few dusky shadings. Astronomers studying Mars from Earth use a slightly different terminology. Acidalia Planitia is known as the Mare Acidalium, the dark area to the southeast of the Valles Marineris as the Mare Erythraeum, and the dark area just south of Marineris is called Solis Lacus. These older names are, like the "seas" and "lakes" on the moon, imaginary bodies of water on a dry world.

When lighting conditions are exactly right, Olympus Mons can be spotted by keen-eyed observers on Earth, but the mighty Valles Marineris has never been seen from here (although the huge canyon complex has been mapped in detail by satellites in orbit around Mars).

Regular observers of Mars soon become familiar with the normal patterns of light and dark on its surface, known as "albedo markings." If you observe Mars over a few hours, you will see these markings appear to move slowly across the disk, as Mars rotates just slightly more slowly than Earth, a full rotation taking 24 hours, 37 minutes and 23 seconds. Because of Mars' slightly longer day, if you observe Mars at the same time on successive nights, the markings will seem to move.

Sometimes the albedo markings seem to change shape. Usually this is caused by gigantic dust storms sweeping across the face of Mars. Recently, British amateur astronomer Damian Peach reprocessed a number of old images made of Mars in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, using modern image-processing techniques. Peach's work revealed amazing detail not visible in the original images, and some of this detail has shown clear changes from back then to modern times. It is thought that these changes result from the shifting sands of Mars over the decades.

Nowadays, most of the serious amateur studies of Mars are made through imaging, with multiple images being combined by "stacking" to bring out the finest detail. These images rival or exceed the finest professional images of only a few years ago. However, there still are "old school" amateurs like myself sketching Mars using centuries-old techniques.

New Privacy - New Terms of Use (What's New) - FAQA new species of bird–like dinosaur was recently discovered at a construction site in Southern China. Dubbed Tongtianlong limosus, the winged creature had died after becoming mired in mud about 66–72 million years ago– hence it’s nickname, the ‘Mud Dragon.’

Before the well–preserved and near–complete skeleton was discovered, it had been damaged by dynamite while workmen were excavating a school near Ganzhou. Luckily, the workers found it before any more damage had been done.

“They very nearly dynamited it into billions of pieces, but thankfully they placed the dynamite just far enough away from the skeleton that most of it survived the blast,” study co–author Dr. Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh told FoxNews.com. “I wasn't there when it was found, but they must have realized right away that they had found something important, and it's great that the fossil was conserved by a museum rather than sold off or auctioned away, where it would have been lost to science forever.”

NOT A JOKE: SCIENTISTS STUDY HOW CHICKENS MADE HISTORIC CROSSINGS

The skeleton of the two–legged Tongtianlong limosus (translation “muddy dragon on the road to heaven”) was lying on its back with its neck arched and wings outstretched. It also had a crest of bone on its head that researchers believed may have been used to attract mates or intimidate enemies.

Expand / Contract Tongtianlong limosus skeleton (Junchang Lu).

Tongtianlong is the sixth species of the oviraptorosaur dinosaur family, a group of feathered dinos known for their sharp beaks and short, toothless heads. Oviraptors were thriving in the 15 million years before the comet that killed the dinosaurs hit Mexico, and Brusatte believes that the most important thing about the new fossil is that it gives us a glimpse of these last surviving dinosaurs.

“They were still diversifying during those last few million years of the Cretaceous, so they are a sign that dinosaurs were still doing really well right up towards the end,” the paleontologist said. “It was these dinosaurs that were undergoing the final wave of diversification before everything changed that day the asteroid hit.”

BATHROOM TRIP LEADS TO ANCIENT AUSTRALIAN DISCOVERY

Despite its wings, the Mud Dragon was flightless so it had to rely on its feet to get away from predators such as the big tyrannosaur Qianzhousaurus, which was the top predator in the area at the time. It also had different feeding habits than a lot of its fellow dinosaurs.

“The Mud Dragon didn't have teeth, but rather a beak, so it wasn't a traditional meat eater,” Brusatte explained. “It may have eaten small mammals and lizards, but probably also plants, seeds, nuts, shellfish–all kinds of things. It was a classic omnivore, which is maybe one reason that these dinosaurs were so diverse and successful, because they could eat so many things.”

There’s been a wave of dinosaur finds over the last few years in China, with many new dinosaur discoveries emerging from the country every year. Brusatte said that things don’t look to be slowing down, either.

ANCIENT BATTLE LEFT 'SEA MONSTER' WITH TOOTH STUCK IN ITS FACE

“Many of these discoveries are not found by professors or academic scientists with PhDs, but by farmers and workmen. This new discovery is a prime example of that. We would never know about it had there not been a building boom in southern China, had these workmen not been on the job that day, or had they not used just the right amount of dynamite to free the skeleton but not destroy it.”

“Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, Social Security tax, all those things,” he said. “If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level.”

Gates made the remark during an interview with Quartz. He said robot taxes could help fund projects like caring for the elderly or working with children in school. Quartz reported that European Union lawmakers considered a proposal to tax robots in the past. The law was rejected.

Recode, citing a McKinsey report, said that 50 percent of jobs performed by humans are vulnerable to robots, which could result in the loss of about $2.7 trillion in the U.S. alone.

“Exactly how you’d do it, measure it, you know, it’s interesting for people to start talking about now,” Gates said. “Some of it can come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don’t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It’s OK.”

Last month, Gates told FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo that he is excited to work with President Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to the U.S. government’s support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization he said.

“How we continue that type of outreach and how it helps our security that we are helping those countries to be healthy and be stable,” he said. “There will be some great conversations and be some ideas about new investments that can be made.”The "birth plan" of an ancient Nessie look-alike didn't involve laying a giant egg, but rather delivering a live baby sea monster, a new study finds.

Until now, researchers had thought that the fearsome marine reptile known as Dinocephalosaurus laid eggs, just as birds and crocodiles (its distant relatives) do. But the discovery of the remains of a pregnant, 245-million-year-oldDinocephalosaurus specimen in a Chinese fossil deposit indicates that the reptile gave live birth, the researchers said.

"This is the first-ever evidence of live birth in an animal group previously thought to lay eggs exclusively," said the study's lead researcher, Jun Liu, an associate professor of paleontology at the Hefei University of Technology in China. [Image Gallery: Ancient Monsters of the Sea]

Researchers discovered the specimen of the pregnant Dinocephalosaurus in southwestern China's Luoping Biota National Geopark in 2008. During its lifetime in the middle Triassic period, the 13-foot-long marine reptile would have swum throughout the shallow seas of ancient southern China.

Dinocephalosaurus had a long neck and sharp teeth. "It was a fish eater, snaking its long neck from side to side to snatch its prey," Liu told Live Science. "It looks superficially like the legendary Nessie ."

Ancient embryo

The researchers discovered a fossilized Dinocephalosaurus embryo in the mother's abdomen. The fetus was small — about 12 percent of its mother's body size — but large enough for scientists to discern that its anatomy (for instance, a long neck and elongated ribs) was similar to that of the adult Dinocephalosaurus, the researchers said.

Still, the researchers went to great lengths to determine that the bundle of bones was, in fact, an embryo. First, they noted that the embryo was enclosed within the mother's body, which excluded the possibility that a foreign animal fell on top of her and then fossilized. Second, the embryo's neck was pointing forward. Usually, sea creatures swallow prey headfirst; the mother even had a partially digested fish, whose head was facing backward in her abdomen, the researchers noted.

"The neck-forward position of the embryonic skeleton suggests that the included skeleton was not ingested prey , but was an embryo," the researchers wrote in the study.

Finally, the embryo was curled in a fetal position, just like other known vertebrate embryos during development, the researchers said.

Egg-laying animals typically deposit eggs holding embryos that are much less developed than the one found inside the mother Dinocephalosaurus, the research team noted. In addition, the researchers said that they did not see any evidence of an eggshell near the embryo, further supporting the idea that the Dinocephalosaurus gave live birth, they said.

Reptilian evolution

Dinocephalosaurus was an archosauromorph (Greek for "ruling lizard form"), a relative of the group that includes crocodiles, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, including birds. The new discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the Archosauromorpha group by 50 million years, Liu said.

In addition, the discovery solves a mystery about egg laying in most archosauromorphs. Previously, researchers were unsure whether archosauromorphs had genetic or developmental barriers preventing live birth, but now they know there isn't a barrier — most archosauromorphs just evolved to lay eggs, Liu said. [Photos: Ancient Pterosaur Eggs & Fossils Uncovered in China]

The finding is an "extraordinary" one, and demonstrates how "evolution never really attains the optimal solution," said Kenneth Lacovara, a professor of paleontology and the dean of the School of Earth and Environment at Rowan University in New Jersey, who was not involved in the study. "It obtains the best solution possible based on the current situation."

The finding shows that "egg laying in the group that spans crocodiles to birds is not a deficit of their nature," Lacovara told Live Science. "It appears to be a strength. The alternative was possible, but that was not selected for."

Moreover, the fossils show that "Dinocephalosaurus determined the sex of its babies genetically," Liu said. "This is a noteworthy finding given that its closest extant [living] relatives, turtles and crocodilians, determine the sex of their offspring by environmental temperatures."

Live birth (known as viviparity) has evolved independently at least 115 times in living lizards and snakes, and at least once in the common ancestor of mammals, the researchers said. However, Dinocephalosaurus is hardly the only ancient marine reptile that gave live birth; a 182-million-year-old ichthyosaur fossil shows that a mother died during a breech birth, Live Science reported previously .

The new study was published online Tuesday (Feb. 14) in the journal Nature Communications.

Original article on Live Science.A fascinating essay that lay hidden for decades reveals Winston Churchill’s views on alien life.

The never-published essay has been in the archive of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri since the 1980s, when it was given to the museum by the wife of Churchill’s publisher, who had died. Last year the museum invited Israeli astrophysicist Mario Livio to review the essay, which he discusses in an article published in the science journal Nature.

Livio notes the British wartime leader’s passion for science and technology in the 1939 essay, as well as Churchill’s thoughts on extraterrestrials.

GERMAN WW II U-BOAT DISCOVERED OFF THE AZORES

Apparently influenced by events unfolding at the time, Churchill voices his concern about human progress and describes the possibility of aliens. “I, for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilization here that I am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures, or that we are the highest type of mental and physical development which has ever appeared in the vast compass of space and time,” he wrote.

The original version of the 11-page essay is held in Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, U.K. Churchill, however, revisited the essay in the late 1950s and made some minor typographical changes – he also changed the essay’s title from “Are we alone in space?” to “Are we alone in the universe?” This second draft, which is now in the possession of the U.S. National Churchill Museum, was reviewed by Livio.

Timothy Riley, the director and chief curator of the National Churchill Museum, told Fox News that the essay provides an incredible insight into Churchill’s personality. “I think it reveals the incredibly curious mind of Winston Churchill and the breadth and scope of his interests,” he said. “We know that he had a keen interest in science and valued science and thought that science would lead to progress.”

DEFENSE OFFICIALS MAY HAVE FOUND REMAINS OF US WW II AIRMEN IN THE HIMALAYAS

In the journal Nature, Livio explains that, during the 1920s and 1930s, Churchill wrote popular-science essays for newspapers and magazines on topics such as evolution and cells. He also points to the politician’s friendship with the physicist Frederick Lindemann, who later became science adviser to the British government. The prime minister also created a science-friendly environment that spurred progress in areas like molecular genetics and X-ray crystallography, according to Livio.

Copyright issues, however, are currently preventing publication of the essay, something which the National Churchill Museum hopes to eventually resolve.

Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogersA fearsome carnivorous dinosaur known for eating its own kind wasn't that large — it weighed only about as much as a hefty crocodile. But the creature, Majungasaurus crenatissimus, took more than 20 years to reach its full size, making it one of the slowest growing dinosaurs of its kind on record, a new study finds.

The finding suggests that M. crenatissimus was a real pipsqueak for most of its life, at least compared with its fast-growing, enormous relatives Tyrannosaurus rex and Albertosaurus, said study lead researcher Michael D'Emic, an assistant professor of biology at Adelphi University in Long Island, New York. [Image Gallery: Tiny-Armed Dinosaurs]

Malagasy dinosaur

The researchers chose to study M. crenatissimus because it was a common dinosaur with multiple specimens available for study. "It's literally known from thousands of teeth, hundreds of isolated bones and several nearly complete skeletons," D'Emic told Live Science.

M. crenatissimus was top predator on the island of Madagascar during the late Cretaceous period, about 70 million to 66 million years ago. M. crenatissimus is considered an abelisaurid theropod — a bipedal, carnivorous dinosaur with stubby front arms; small, pointy teeth; and a short skull, D'Emic said.

When full-grown, the beast would have extended about 20 feet in length, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

But it took most of its life to reach that length, D'Emic found. The individual the researchers studied likely weighed about 1,875 lbs. when it died at about age 27. In comparison, "T. rex was at 800 kilograms in just a few years," before it eventually reached its full size of about 9 tons in adulthood, D'Emic said.

Rock-saw slice

To analyze the M. crenatissimus individual, one of the largest and most complete on record, the researchers used a rock saw to get slices from eight bones: the dorsal rib, pubis, scapula, phalanx, metatarsal and three leg bones — the fibula, tibia and femur.

To preserve the original shape of the skeleton, they used a mold to form an epoxy in the shape of the slices removed from those bones. Then they placed the replicas back into the skeleton.

"Although it's destructive sampling, you can restore the specimen to its original morphology," D'Emic said.

Once they had the eight slices, D'Emic and his colleagues mounted them on microscope slides and then ground them down until they were transparent (about the thickness of a human hair) and. "It's a slow, time-consuming process," he said.

Once he was done, D'Emic was able to easily view each individual line of arrest growth (LAG). Just like tree rings, LAGs that were close together indicated that the dinosaur didn't grow much that particular year, while rings that were far apart implied that the dinosaur had undergone a growth spurt, D'Emic said.

Many of the LAGs were close together, indicating that the dinosaur grew slowly in comparison to its theropod relatives. For example, the allosauroid Acrocanthosaurus reached about 7,700 lbs. in about the same time it took M. crenatissimus to reachjust a quarter of that weight, D'Emic said.

It's unclear why M. crenatissimus grew so slowly, but perhaps the harsh Malagasy environment, plagued by droughts and floods, curtailed its growth, D'Emic said. In addition, research shows that other abelisaurids grew slowly, so it may be a common characteristic of the group, he said. [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy]

Childhood mystery

However, some information is missing from the dinosaur's youth. Some bones, such as the tibia, contained bone marrow in their center that remodeled the bone (and the LAGs) around them, meaning that the dinosaur's early years were effectively erased.

But, by examining the spacing of the later years, they were able to guess how many rings made up the inner region covered by bone marrow. In the end, they guessed that there were 14, which helped them estimate the dinosaur's age of 27, he said. The researchers plan to study a juvenile M. crenatissimus to see whether its young LAGs are spaced as they predicted they would be, D'Emic said.

The research is part of the Madagascar Paleontology Project, in which researchers are studying bone structure and LAGs of other vertebrates that lived in Madagascar's Maevarano Formation, widely known as a stressful Cretaceous ecosystem, said study co-researcher Kristina Curry Rogers, an associate professor of geology and biology at Macalester College in Minnesota.

For instance, earlier this year, Curry Rogers, D'Emic and their colleagues published a study in the journal Science on the remains of a baby titanosaur (Rapetosaurus), a long-necked and long-tailed herbivore from Madagascar. They found that the baby likely died of starvation during a drought. But during its short life, it grew very fast, likely at the same rate as a modern baby elephant, she said.

The new study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, was presented Oct. 28 at the 2016 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Salt Lake City.

The prosecution office said in a statement Friday that it charged Kemal Causevic, who led the country's indirect taxation authority from 2004 to 2011, and two men who owned several trade companies, with malfeasance, bribery and money laundering related to customs fraud in the import of textiles from Turkey, China and Hungary.

The statement said that Causevic used the money to buy a dozen luxury apartments and other properties.

It did not specify the amount of customs revenue lost, but when the investigation against Causevic was launched in the summer of 2014 authorities claimed the loss amounted to close to 1 billion euros.The number of older adults taking at least three prescriptions for psychotropic drugs - which includes opioids, antidepressants, antipsychotics and tranquilizers - has roughly doubled over the past decade, a recent U.S. study suggests.

Nationwide, the number of annual doctor visits involving patients 65 and older who started or were already taking at least three psychotropic drugs surged from 1.5 million in 2004 to 3.68 million in 2013, the study estimated.

"This is not among patients with diagnoses like depression, anxiety, or insomnia, but rather in patients with pain and in patients with no mental health or pain diagnosis," noted lead study author Dr. Donovan Maust of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

"As with other organs, an aging brain may have more difficulty maintaining its 'normal' function," Maust said by email. "As you add additional chemicals that influence the brain, it makes sense that some of these may help the brain, but the more you add, the more they might have negative effects."

These drugs can sometimes help patients with problems like insomnia or chronic pain, but they are often unnecessary. Routinely taking several of these drugs at once can be dangerous and U.S regulators have warned that certain cocktails such as a mix of opioids and antidepressants can be deadly, the study team writes in JAMA Internal Medicine.

To examine how often seniors are taking cocktails of these medicines, researchers examined data on doctor visits for 97,910 patients aged 65 and older between 2004 and 2013.

Overall, the proportion of checkups when seniors got at least three psychotropic medicines prescribed or refilled increased from 0.6 percent of visits to 1.5 percent during the study period.

For rural patients, the proportion of checkups when seniors got at least three of these drugs surged from 0.7 percent of visits to 2.2 percent by the end of the study.

The increase was also steep for patients 85 and older, who got at least three psychotropics at 0.4 percent of visits at the start of the study period and at 1.5 percent of checkups by the end.

Roughly half of the patients taking at least three psychotropics didn't have pain or a mental health condition, and drug cocktails were much more commonly prescribed by family practitioners than by psychiatrists.

One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on whether medications were prescribed as needed for short-term use, which the authors note may have led them to overestimate routine use of drug cocktails.

Even so, the findings suggest that patients and families should exercise caution when considering whether to take more than one psychotropic medicine at a time, said Dr. Dilip Jeste, a psychiatry researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn't involved in the study.

"Older adults receiving several medications, and their family members when appropriate, should ask their prescribing physician about why each of those medications is being given," Jeste said by email.

As part of this discussion, they need to tell the physician about all the medications they take as well as over-the-counter remedies such as cough medicines, pain relievers, vitamins and supplements, Jeste added. All of these things, as well as smoking and drinking, can influence the potential for side effects.

Many older adults also have memory difficulties and problems taking medications exactly as prescribed, Jeste added.

"I have seen patients take the less important ones while forgetting the 'must take' medications," Jeste said. "Having a discussion with the physician is critical."It has been said that Valentine’s Day is one for the world’s amateurs, but for the last-minute shopper fatigued on chocolates, flowers and overrated restaurant reservations, the Bronx Zoo is offering a perfect little something (creepy) for just $10.

NEW SPECIES OF MOTH NAMED FOR TRUMP, THANKS TO 'YELLOWISH' MOP

Dubbed “Name-a-Roach,” the gift drive debuted in 2011 and serves as a fundraiser for the World Conservation Society. In a nutshell, it allows donors to name a Madagascar hissing cockroach after a loved one, or not-so-loved one, such as an ex.

For the great low price of $10, the zoo will send the lucky recipient a digital certificate to cement the purchase and cherish for a lifetime...or not.

The Madagascar hissing cockroach is the world’s largest cockroach species, often growing to nearly four-inches long, according to the Bronx Zoo.

“The namesake hissing noise is emitted as a defense mechanism,” wrote the Bronx Zoo in a press release. “Like nearly every roach species, Madagascar hissing cockroaches are not considered pests and rarely enter homes.”

Whether the giver and recipient are completely creeped out or totally amused, the WCS and Bronx Zoo promise not to judge.If you've been feeling nostalgic for the days when airlines served A full meal in economy, Delta has good news for you.

The legacy carrier announced Thursday it will start offering complimentary meals in the main cabin on several long haul flights as part of a multi-million dollar effort to improve customer experience across the board.

The airline was among the first to axe free meals back in 2001, with many domestic airlines following suit over the next decade.

Starting March 1, Delta will offer complimentary meals in the main cabin on flights between New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles/San Francisco.

The following month, the airline will expand the complimentary meal service to 10 other domestic flights from Seattle, N.Y., Boston and Washington, D.C. Other enhancements include upgraded main cabin snacks, enhanced blankets and free in-flight entertainment. Passengers on long-haul, international flights will also receive complimentary beer, wine, spirits and sleep kits.

Delta began offering complimentary meals late last year as part of the limited service test to improve customer satisfaction. Some fliers were pretty surprised by the re-introduction of inflight meals.

"Blow me down and call me Nancy, there was a free meal on my @Delta domestic flight. What is this 1997? :)," said one Twitter user last year.

(AP) jimmy-'superfly'-snukaIn more than two decades in power, the autocratic leader of Belarus has cast his nation as Moscow's closest ally, securing tens of billions of dollars in Russian subsidies.

At the same time, President Alexander Lukashenko has skillfully exploited Russia's security fears by occasionally reaching out to the West to win concessions from Moscow. Now, the Kremlin finally seems to have lost patience with its unruly ally, spelling an end to a relationship that has been described as giving away "oil for kisses."

The spiraling conflict between the neighbors has reached such a level that some analysts have talked about Russia possibly staging a "palace coup" against Lukashenko. Visibly nervous about Russia's intentions, the Belarusian leader recently assured his nation of 10 million people that "there will be no war" between the two countries.

Lukashenko has sought to present Belarus as an indispensable partner for Russia and a bulwark against NATO. At the same time, he has periodically made overtures to the West, masterfully exploiting Moscow's fear of losing a crucial ally to win more financial aid.

It now seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin has grown tired of Lukashenko's games. A scheduled meeting between the two last week was postponed indefinitely, and Russia has set up border controls on its previously unguarded frontier with Belarus.

Putin and Lukashenko never got along, and it's hard to imagine any affinity between the cold, reserved former KGB officer and the blustery and boisterous Belarusian, a former state farm director.

Lukashenko has led Belarus since 1994, extending his rule through elections the West has criticized as undemocratic, keeping most of the economy in state hands and relentlessly cracking down on the opposition and independent media.

But Belarus' dependence on Russia and Moscow's desire to keep a key military ally on its western flank have helped bridge differences — until recently.

When Belarus balked last year at the price Russia charged for its natural gas, accumulating a $550 million debt, Moscow hit Minsk in its softest spot by sharply cutting oil supplies. Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus had used cheap Russian crude for products that accounted for more than a third of its export revenues.

The spat escalated with Lukashenko recalling Belarusian representatives from a Russia-dominated economic alliance and ignoring its recent summit. He then raised the stakes by abolishing visas for short-time travelers from 80 nations, including the U.S. and the European Union. The move vexed Russia, which voiced concern that foreign visitors could cross the uncontrolled border with Belarus.

Moscow responded by unilaterally establishing border controls — a move Lukashenko warned could trigger a "serious conflict."

He further challenged the Kremlin by ordering his interior minister to open a criminal inquiry against Russia's top sanitary official for barring imports of Belarusian food products. Russia has banned some agricultural imports from Belarus, accusing it of becoming a conduit for contraband Western food banned in retaliation for the U.S. and the EU sanctions against Moscow.

The Kremlin responded that the Russian official was only doing his job, and noted that deliveries of cheap oil to Belarus had cost Russia over $22 billion in lost revenue in 2011-15. The cheap energy, along with billions of dollars in Russian loans, buttressed Belarus' Soviet-style economy that has relied on its eastern neighbor as its main export market.

Russia and Belarus have had economic disputes before, but each time Moscow caved in to Lukashenko's demands and restored the subsidies. The latest controversy, however, seems deeper, and Putin appears unlikely to back off.

"There are limits to a weak state's ability to dictate its terms to a stronger one," economic expert Vladislav Inozemtsev said on Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio.

Lukashenko sounded unusually tense at a recent news conference.

"Why take us by the throat?" he asked.

"No one will occupy us, no one will send in troops," he said in an apparent reference to fears that Russia could try to use massive joint military maneuvers scheduled in Belarus later this year to overrun the country. "The Russian troops that will enter Belarus will leave."

The statement seemed to reflect Lukashenko's suspicions about the Kremlin's intentions following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Lukashenko never recognized Crimea as part of Russia, and he also refused to follow suit when Moscow acknowledged Georgia's breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008.

The Center for Strategic and Foreign Policy Studies in Minsk warned recently that the Kremlin could try to send troops into Belarus.

"The threat of Russia stirring up an internal conflict in Belarus has reached a maximum level," said Yuri Tsarik, the head of the center's Russia program.

For several years, Lukashenko has firmly resisted the Kremlin's push for Belarus to host a Russian air base, probably fearing it might serve as a foothold for Moscow as in Crimea, where Russia had leased a navy base prior to the annexation.

"Lukashenko remembers quite well that the seizure of Crimea began from the Russian base," said Minsk-based analyst Valery Karbalevich. "After Crimea, Minsk has sensed real danger, and Lukashenko has started searching for ways to resist the Russian pressure."

In a bid to counter Russia, Lukashenko has sought to mend ties with the West, and he scaled back his crackdown on dissent.

The EU and the U.S. recently rolled back sanctions they imposed on Belarus following relatively smoother elections and the release of political prisoners. But Belarus' hope of securing a $3 billion IMF loan has remained elusive.

"Lukashenko needs Moscow, and the Kremlin knows that," said Alexander Klaskovsky, an independent political scholar in Minsk. "In exchange for subsidies, Putin expects Belarus to show support and discipline, not wag its tail to the West."

He predicted Putin would be unlikely to resort to force.

"The Kremlin's strategy is to scare Lukashenko and then make a deal with him, putting him on a shorter leash," Klaskovsky said.

About 75 minutes later, those hopes got crushed with a follow-up message that said they got the first one by mistake.

The misfired emails from the Ivy League university told the applicants that they had been admitted to the Master’s program at the Mailman School of Public Health on Wednesday.

Columbia said in a statement issued Friday that the letters were sent out “due to human error,” but had no further details on the nature of that error.

The school immediately discovered the mistake and quickly sent off apology emails within an hour, the statement said.

“We deeply apologize for this miscommunication,” Julie Kornfield, the Vice Dean of Education at the School of Public Health, said in the statement.

“We value the energy and enthusiasm that our applicants bring to the admissions process, and regret the stress and confusion caused by this mistake. We are working assiduously to strengthen our internal procedures in order to ensure that this mistake does not happen in the future.”

Click for more from NYPost.comAfter a week of administration ups and downs, President Donald Trump found his stride on Friday afternoon before a raucous crowd gathered in a hangar of Boeing’s company facility in North Charleston, South Carolina.

“We are here to celebrate American engineering. We are also here to celebrate jobs, jobs,” roared Trump to the thousands of Boeing workers assembled for the rollout of the company’s new 787-10 Dreamliner passenger aircraft.

Just a day after a press conference that rocketed from one issue to another, President Trump sounded more like Candidate Trump, repeatedly hitting on the theme that helped win him the White House: jobs.

"We want products made by our workers in our factories stamped with those four magnificent words — made in the USA," Trump said.

While he mentioned his plans to lower corporate and middle class tax cuts, the crowd responded most positively to pledges to bring jobs back home.

Earlier this week, nearly 74 percent of the Boeing employees voted to reject the International Association of Machinists’ (IAM) attempt to unionize the plant.

The plant will be rolling out the 787-10 Dreamliner, which Boeing says achieves 10 percent better fuel and emissions than competitors and 25 percent better than the airplanes it will replace.

In November, the real estate mogul won 54.9 percent of the vote in South Carolina and all 9 electoral votes.

The cadence and the content of the speech harkened to the daily speeches Trump delivered during the campaign.

“Our goal of the nation must be to rely on products made in the U.S.A,” the president said. “This is our mantra – buy American and hire American."

The president will travel to Melbourne, Florida to rally supporters on Saturday.



“From now on it’s going to be America First. Working together as a unit there is nothing we cannot accomplish. We are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community” has a better future, he promised

Following his remarks, Trump then toured the company with South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who has been in office for a little more than a month. McMaster was selected to succeed Nikki Haley, who stepped down after she was asked to serve as Ambassador to the United Nations.

Rev. Eric Manning, the pastor at the Emanuel AME Church, the site of the 2015 deadly shooting of nine church members by white supremacist Dylann Roof, also accompanied the president.

In December, Trump called out Boeing and CEO Dennis Mullenberg on Twitter for the high price of Air Force One.

“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Cancel order!”

Relations have improved since then.

Trump joked with the audience that he planned a “big order” for the F-18 Super Hornet and toyed with the idea of sticking with Boeing on the Air Force One project.

Boeing is a member of the recently-launched “American Made Coalition,” a group of businesses whose goal is to build support for a House Republican tax cut plan.

The plan would slash corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent. The plan would also exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose the 20 percent tax on imports.Sen. Ed Markey Ed MarkeyOvernight Tech: GOP chairman to propose high-skilled visa overhaul | Zuckerberg's 5,700 word letter | Tech lobbies gear up ahead of internet fight Senate Dem blasts GOP for trying to repeal broadband privacy rules Judge orders release of EPA nominee’s emails MORE (D-Mass.) called out Republicans on Thursday for trying to undo the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broadband privacy rules that passed late last year.

The broadband privacy rules, which were passed in October under former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, require service providers to obtain consumers' permission to use certain information.

“Big broadband companies want to mine and sell consumers’ most sensitive personal information without any consent," Markey, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a statement. "Overturning broadband privacy protections is nothing more than Big Broadband’s way of pumping up its profits and undermining consumer rights."

“The FCC’s midnight regulation does nothing to protect consumer privacy," Flake said in a statement. "It is unnecessary, confusing and adds yet another innovation-stifling regulation to the internet. My legislation is the first step toward restoring the [Federal Trade Commission's] light-touch, consumer-friendly approach. It will not change or lessen existing consumer privacy protections."

Republicans and the telecom industry have taken a hard line against the rules, which were passed under the authority that the FCC gained with the Open Internet Order that enshrined net neutrality as law.

Using the CRA to repeal the broadband rule would also prohibit the FCC from implementing similar rules in the future.

"Without the FCC’s broadband privacy rule, broadband providers will be able to sell dossiers of the personal and professional lives of their subscribers to the highest bidder without their consent," said Markey. "I will oppose any efforts to roll back important broadband privacy rules either by Congress or at the FCC.”Swedish furniture retailer Ikea has apologized for a catalog aimed at Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that contains no images of women.

Ikea says the booklet was produced by its Israeli branch, not by the Swedish group itself.

IKEA spokeswoman Josefin Thorell says the catalog "is not something that has gone through us," adding "we have been very clear that this is not what the Ikea brand stands for."

Thorell told Swedish news agency TT late Friday that its Israeli franchise "had tried to reach a consumer group" and made "an error."

Thorell was not immediately available for comment on Saturday, and it was not clear how many catalogs had been printed.

Not so: The couple recently found themselves unexpectedly pregnant, and their somewhat irreverent pregnancy announcement quickly went viral after they posted it on social media this week.

It features Diesen, 25, holding an ultrasound photo as Krieg, 23, makes a triumphant face in front of a brick wall reading, "It still works!" "It kind of started out as a joke, because I was like, that's so inappropriate," Diesen tells People.

"But we ended up doing it," says Krieg. Diesen got the idea for the photo while trying to find pregnancy announcements featuring dads in wheelchairs; one of the few she found featured the dad holding a sign reading, "I did that." The couple met in September 2015 at a paralysis center in California where Diesen was working as a recovery specialist.

After falling in love, Diesen returned to Krieg's hometown in Ohio with him. They currently live with his parents, and they tell Today they "definitely weren't trying to have a baby," figuring they'd get married first and then start trying in a few years.

During their pregnancy announcement photo shoot, Krieg proposed. As for the mechanics of how, exactly, "it still works," Diesen explains, "Todd does not feel it when stuff is going on, but is occasionally able to reach climax." Krieg adds that, after one of those times, "We were like, 'Uh-oh, we should get a pregnancy test.'" In their contest entry for a Brides wedding competition, the couple says doctors told them it would be "nearly impossible to conceive naturally," but now a little boy is on the way in August.

The Indian Space Research Organization said the nano satellites — those weighing less than 10 kilograms — were sent into orbit from southern India. It said the launching of the 104 satellites was a record, overtaking Russia's feat of sending 37 satellites in a single launch in 2014.

"All 104 satellites were successfully placed in orbit," the Press Trust of India news agency quoted ISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar as saying. They included an Indian Earth observation satellite and two small technology demonstration satellites.

The ISRO said in a statement that the other satellites were international customer satellites, including 96 from the United States and one each from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that the "remarkable feat by ISRO is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation."

India has been striving to become a player in the multibillion-dollar space launch market, and has successfully placed light satellites into orbit in recent years. It hopes to eventually send astronauts into space.

In September 2014, India successfully guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Only the United States, the former Soviet Union and the European Space Agency had been able to previously do that.John Glenn's widow says she misses him "terribly" and was touched by the outpouring of love and support when he died two months ago.

Annie Glenn turned 97 on Friday. On Thursday, she made her first public appearance since her husband's memorial service, a reception at Ohio State University's John Glenn College of Public Affairs.

John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died Dec. 8 at the age of 95.

Annie Glenn told The Associated Press that losing her husband of 73 years has been difficult.

"Oh, gosh. It's just awful, because we've known each other since we were 2 years old, and he and I, we were both on the same side, he was always helping me, with the kids and everything," she said. "I really miss him terribly. There's nothing I can do about it."

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

John Glenn's body lay in repose at the Ohio Statehouse before a public service attended by hundreds, including the U.S. vice president, current and former Ohio governors and other dignitaries.

"Wasn't that special? I didn't expect that at all," she said. "It was very touching."

Annie Glenn couldn't quite say how her public pace may change now that John is gone and she has recovered after a recent fall.

"We always went to things together, and so it's simply ...," she said, reflecting. "I just can't explain to you what I have to go through."

Glenn said she fell about a month ago and has been recovering from the pain of three broken ribs and compressed vertebrae. She said she was "out and about" and hurrying when she slipped.

On Thursday, she moved slowly, but on her own, using a walker.

Accompanied by her daughter, Lyn, Glenn kissed hands and chatted cheerfully as several dozen faculty, staff and students celebrated her birthday over cake and coffee. Glenn apologized for being unable to recognize people because of her failing eyesight.

Lyn Glenn said she and her brother, David, have been taking turns visiting their mother at her high-rise condo in Columbus about once a month since their father died, traveling from their respective homes in Minnesota and California.It seems as if U.S. stock investors are afraid of absolutely nothing. Not even a Russian submarine floating off the coast of Connecticut, nor a pugnacious president who lambasted and mocked the media during a chaotic press conference or a Fed Chair that talked candidly about a slow-growing U.S. economy.

“We are just totally perplexed about why the market is teflon,” said Gary Kaminsky, former vice chairman at Morgan Stanley (MS), during an interview with FOX Business.

The Dow posted its best week of the year with a gain of 1.75%. Along with the Dow, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, Russell 2000 and Dow Transports are all at record levels. Since the election U.S. stocks have gained between 10% to 12%.

Trump Bump - Since Election Day Dow Jones Industrial Average: +12%

S&P 500: +10%

Nasdaq Composite: +12%

Kaminsky, who hosts Wall Street Week for the network, blames the lack of reaction on index funds, which automatically track stocks and indices. “The average investor is not paying attention to the day-to-day which is a danger,” he cautions. $30.6 billion dollars flowed into US Equity Index Funds, the highest January figure ever, according to Morningstar.

Investors did however get pockets of positive economic reports this week. Retail sales for January rose a better-than-expected 0.4% and the December number was revised higher to 1.0%. Separately, housing permits, which track future demand, rose nearly 5% in January to 1.29 million units, the highest since November of 2015.

Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017

Either way President Trump is using the positive stock and economic news to his advantage. He celebrated the market’s record levels with a tweet Thursday morning. Later that day during an impromptu and unorthodox press briefing, he verbally touted it again as he complained about “inheriting a mess” from the Obama administration. Earlier in the week, during his meeting with retail CEOs, he also applauded the markets. “There is a lot of confidence in our economy right now, there is great confidence level. You’ve been seeing that in the stock market,” Trump said from the White House.

The president’s visit to Boeing’s (BA) Dreamliner factory in South Carolina on Friday, which focused on creating more jobs, caps off a busy week. He hosted Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of the nation’s retail CEOs, including Target (TGT) and J.C. Penney (JCP). He also pushed out National Security Advisor Mike Flynn and lost his Labor Secretary pick Andy Puzder, who he quickly replaced with Alexander Acosta.

Trump, to some extent, overshadowed Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s semi-annual testimony on Capitol Hill mid-week. Yellen confirmed that policymakers are on track to raise rates several times this year, despite an economy that is growing below 2%. Yellen was also asked why U.S. stocks are on a tear.

“Market participants likely are anticipating shifts in fiscal policy that will stimulate growth and perhaps raise earnings, tax cuts that will boost earnings. We’ve seen longer term interest rates go up and the dollar strengthen,” Yellen said.

Next week is promising to be just as busy for investors with corporate earnings on deck for Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Toll Brothers (TOL) and Foot Locker (FL) to name a few.

And President Trump will continue doing his part as well.

“There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week,” Trump said on Thursday. “Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started.”

Suzanne O’Halloran is Managing Editor of FOXBusiness.com and a graduate of Boston College. Follow her on @suzohalloranA bound copy of Sir Isaac Newton's seminal book on mathematics and science was sold for $3.7 million, making it the most expensive printed scientific book ever sold at auction, according to Christie's, the auction house that handled the sale.

The book has a Latin title — "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica," which translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy," but scholars often call it the Principia . After Newton (1642-1727) wrote the book, he gave it to the English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656-1742) for editing, and it was printed and sold in London more than 300 years ago, in 1687.

The book is a pivotal piece of science and history, and theoretical physicist Albert Einstein called it "perhaps the greatest intellectual stride that it has ever been granted to any man to make." Even so, Christie's expected the goat-skin-covered book to bring in between $1 million and $1.5 million, but the unnamed bidder bought it for nearly four times that value at $3,719,500. [Creative Genius: The World's Greatest Minds]

The Principia famously elucidates Newton's three laws of motion , explaining how objects move under the influences of external forces. Physics students today still use the laws, which include:

-An object will remain in a state of inertia unless acted upon by force.

-The relationship between acceleration and applied force is force equals mass times acceleration (F=MA).

-For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

The crimson book measures about 9 inches by 7 inches and contains 252 leaves — some with woodcut diagrams — and a folding plate, according to Christie's. Only one other original leather-bound copy of Newton's Principia has been sold at auction in the past 47 years — a copy that was presented to King James II (1633-1701) and bought at Christie's New York for about $2.5 million in December 2013.

In the Principia's preface, Newton thanked Halley for encouraging him to write the book, saying, "Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the press and taking care of the schemes, but it was his solicitations that its becoming public is owing; for when he had obtained of me my demonstrations of the figure of the celestial orbits , he continually pressed me to communicate the same to the Royal Society..." (translated by Andrew Motte). In a letter to the king in 1687, Halley wrote, "And I may be bold to say, that if ever Book was worthy the favourable acceptance of a Prince."

Halley also paid for the printing of the book; the Royal Society didn't have enough money at the time to cover the costs because it had just published another book, " De Historia Piscium " or "The History of Fishes" by John Ray and Francis Willughby. Luckily, Halley's contribution paid off: Newton's work was not seriously challenged until Einstein's theories of relativity and German theoretical physicist Max Planck's quantum theory were published in the 1900s. In fact, Newton's principles and methods are still used by scientists today.

Original article on Live Science .Donald Trump’s presidency is only one month old, but already the buzzards are circling. The president cheered supporters by assailing his critics at yesterday’s press conference, but there is little doubt that the Trump White House is struggling to keep its momentum. The drama over Michael Flynn’s departure and the defeat of Labor nominee Pudzer raise concerns over organization and focus, and feed headlines reporting “borderline chaos.”

Opponents on the Left are gleefully lining up more demonstrations, creating more obstruction in Congress and ripping the president in the media. Unimaginably, after suffering epic losses, Democrats are beginning to imagine a political comeback. Time for triage.

First, some perspective. At this point in his presidency, Bill Clinton’s White House was in disarray. His chief of staff, a lifelong friend named Mack McLarty, a person described by his grade school teacher as "Just a real nice boy who grew up into a real nice young man," was way over his head, unable to rein in the bigger-than-life personalities that typically occupy the West Wing. Infighting between the staffs of the president and Hillary was undermining the young administration. Chaos reined.

Bob Woodward chronicled those days in his book "The Agenda, Inside the Clinton White House." In it, he describes a Bill Clinton prone to rages and dithering, and as one reviewer put it: “a president elected to reform, but [who] is overwhelmed by an entrenched Congress and the deficit voodoo doll left to him by 14 years of Republicans. He has surrounded himself with the best, the brightest and the most inexperienced…”

Sound familiar? Woodward also reveals how Clinton staffers leaked damaging information – about each other and the president -- to the press. George Stephanopoulos, one of Clinton’s closest aides, told a reporter that the president was incapable of making decisions, while others took potshots at Hillary’s healthcare initiative, Bill’s “dishonest” budget and so on.

There’s a reason D.C. is called a swamp.

What’s different today? Trump faces an extraordinarily hostile media, which Clinton did not. Though some in the press criticized Clinton’s inexperienced apparatchiks, most supported the president’s agenda. They were not out for blood.

Not only is Trump skewered by the media at every turn, he is also facing opposition from the intelligence community, Democrats, activists supporting environmental and social causes, academia and even a good slug of his own party.

And, from time to time, he throws gasoline on the smoldering rage ignited by the election.

What can Trump do to turn things around?

First, it may be that he should take a page from the Clinton playbook and bring in a time-tested barracuda chief of staff (think Rahm Emmanuel). Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media, says Priebus is over his head; it’s possible the former RNC Chair is simply too nice a guy to knock heads. It wasn’t until hard-knuckle Leon Panetta became Clinton’s Chief of Staff in July 1994 that the White House got its act together. Given the hostility arrayed against him, Trump can’t wait that long. An ideal candidate would look like Newt Gingrich without the ego, or Chris Christie without the ambition.

Second, the president should get out of the Swamp Bubble every few weeks and go talk to the people. He is planning a rally-type event at the Orlando-Melbourne Airport this coming weekend; it’ a start. Trump is rejuvenated by his supporters. Trump needs to remind people that he loves the United States and he is working day and night to shake up the system. They’re on his side, but both he and they could use a little love. And yes- stick to the teleprompter.

Third, Mr. Trump needs to erect a speedbump in his Twitter feed. Just one set of eyes, one person who has the authority to say “go” or “no-go” on the 3 am tweets. Trump is engaging, still, in too many petty battles, when there are big ones to be fought. However, he should not shut it down; his tweets have increased in popularity since his inauguration, being “favorited” on average 120,000 times, and retweeted over 40,000 times. Those who are irate over the mainstream media’s treatment of their president are delighted he can address them directly, and they can respond.

Fourth, Trump needs to convene an intense weekend working session with Tom Price, head of HHS, and the GOP leadership in Congress. They need to lock the doors until a solid plan for replacing Obamacare emerges. Time to tell people what the bill is, and how it will be enacted over solid resistance from Democrats. Executive actions are great, and denote action, but Obamacare and tax reform require a big legislative push.

Finally, Trump should invite John McCain and Lindsay Graham to lunch, and hear them out. Both are respected GOP senior statesmen and they are aligned against the president. Their resistance will give cover to others, and the president needs a united party. Some of it is policy; some is personal. Trump has a big personality; he must win them over.

Trump needs to get the train back on the tracks. Andy Card, chief of staff for George W. Bush, stresses the importance of these early days: “The first one hundred days ends on April 30th. The president will be measured on his campaign promises, his commitment, his direction, his ability to lead on April 30th.” Trump has popular backing for most of his agenda; he will lose support if he gets so mired in minor controversies that he fails to achieve his goals. He cannot let that happen; it is too important for the future of the country.

That’s because this medicinal marvel, long touted in Chinese medicine and Ayurveda as a healing spice, actually has a significant amount of science to back it up. And it isn’t just motion sickness that it treats. Ginger can also knock out PMS pain, headaches, bloating, and so much more.

The best part: Both fresh and powdered ginger (what you'd find in your spice cabinet) deliver these health perks, so pick what's most convenient for you. And you don't have to consume a megadose to feel the results either—experts, including integrative medicine pioneer Andrew Weil, M.D, recommend consuming around 2 grams of ginger per day, which works out to about 1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger, or 3/4 teaspoon powdered ginger.

Here, 7 of the most compelling reasons to start embracing this potent, flavor-packed root on the regular.

It Boosts Immunity

Watch out, colds. Not only does ginger contain sesquiterpenes, chemicals that combat rhinovirus (the most common cause of colds), sipping ginger tea can also reduce congestion and other cold and flu symptoms, according to Cardiff University researchers. What’s more, ginger is also full of immune-boosting antioxidants, and acts as a natural pain and fever reducer.

It Eases Arthritis Pain

“There is some evidence that ginger may be helpful for reducing joint pain and inflammation in arthritis sufferers,” says registered dietitian Danielle Capalino, MSPH, RD, author of Healthy Gut, Flat Stomach. That’s because ginger contains gingerols, potent anti-inflammatory substances that can inhibit the formation of inflammatory cytokines. In one study, published in Arthritis & Rheumatology, ginger extract significantly reduced symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee.

It Soothes Sore Muscles

Hit the ginger before you hit the gym. Research has found that ginger, which acts as a natural pain reliever and anti-inflammatory, can ease post-workout muscle soreness. In a study published in The Journal of Pain, participants who took two grams of ginger a day (1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger, or 3/4 teaspoon powdered ginger) experienced a 25% reduction in exercise-induced muscle pain 24 hours after a workout compared to a placebo. Runners can also benefit: In another study, endurance athletes who took powdered ginger (like you'd find in your spice cabinet) had lower markers of inflammation.

It Banishes Stomach Bloat

You know ginger as a nausea fighter, but that’s not its only stomach perk: “Ginger gets your digestion going and can keep your belly from uncomfortable or embarrassing bloating,” says Capalino. Known as a carminative herb (meaning it gets rid of excess gas), compounds in ginger stimulate gastric juices and digestive organs to boost digestion. Plus, it contains the enzyme zingibain to help break down proteins.

It Sidelines Period Pain

“The most surprising benefit of ginger is that you can use it to alleviate menstrual pain,” says Capalino. In fact, ginger is shown to work as well as OTC pain meds. A study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complimentary Medicine found that ginger was as effective as ibuprofen in relieving period pain.

It Can Even Combat Migraines

Migraines are the worst, but ginger might keep you from landing in the ER. The key could be ginger’s ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, thus keeping blood vessels from swelling and creating pressure. One study found that taking ginger powder was just as effective at treating migraines as sumatriptan, a common migraine medication. What’s more, ginger helps quell the queasy stomach that often accompanies a migraine headache.

It May Preserve Your Memory

Ginger may buffer your brain against Alzheimer’s. The neurodegenerative disease is linked to sticky deposits of amyloid proteins in the brain, yet a laboratory study suggests ginger may protect brain cells from these plaques, delaying the onset and progression of the disease. The effects have yet to be studied on humans, but because eating ginger is pretty much risk-free, it's worth incorporating into a brain-healthy diet.

This article originally appeared on RodalesOrganicLife.comWhether planted for privacy, as a wind buffer or to outline a planting bed, evergreen shrubs can be useful plants to hide problem areas and define garden spaces. Selecting the right shrub for each role in the garden can cut down on maintenance and ensure that your garden will look good year-round. Here are 10 hardworking evergreen shrubs and small trees to use as garden hedgers and edgers.

1. Arborvitae

(Thuja occidentalis)

Native to the upper Midwest, eastern U.S. and eastern Canada

Arborvitae is a tough hedge plant that can withstand harsh conditions such as high winds and cold temperatures, and is useful as a dense privacy screen or windbreak. The plant thrives with regular water, so it is best planted in areas with regular rainfall.

RELATED: More Plants and Trees for Natural Privacy

Arborvitae grows quickly to between 12 and 15 feet tall and 6 to 8 feet wide. To form a dense hedge, space plants twice as close as recommended on the planting label and keep them pruned to the desired height.

Where it will grow: Varies by species; many are hardy to minus 45 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 42.8 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 2 to 8)

Water requirement: Regular

Light requirement: Full sun

2. Barberry

(Berberis spp.)

Native to various regions around the world

The foliage color of this versatile shrub ranges from chartreuse (B. thunbergii ‘Monlers’) to rich ruby red (B. thunbergii ‘Atropurpurea Nana’). The color on red varieties deepens in full sun. Plant barberry back from walkways and lawns to reduce contact with their spiny stems.

Barberry makes a great hedge or edge plant, and can be pruned into any shape well. Slow-growing dwarf varieties of barberry are best for low borders and formal parterres.

Note: Barberry can be invasive in some areas of Canada, New England and the West Coast. Check with your local nursery and select sterile cultivars (particularly of Japanese varieties).

Where it will grow: Varies by species; many are hardy to minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 31.7 degrees Celsius (zones 4 to 8)

Water requirement: Low to regular (in hot climates)

Light requirement: Full sun to light shade

3. Boxwood

(Buxus spp.)

Native to parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas

Boxwood is one of the most popular evergreen shrubs, and all varieties can be clipped into neat borders and globes or left untrimmed for a more informal hedge.

For low-growing hedges, plant dwarf varieties of boxwood, such as dwarf littleleaf boxwood (B. microphylla ‘Compacta’) or dwarf English boxwood (B. sempervirens ‘Suffruticosa’), to reduce time spent clipping.

Where it will grow: Varies by species: B. sempervirens is hardy to minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 26.1 degrees Celsius (zones 5 to 8); B. microphylla is hardy to minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 20.6 degrees Celsius (zones 6 to 9); B. sinica var. insularis is hardy to minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 31.7 degrees Celsius (zones 4 to 9)

Water requirement: Regular; low once established

Light requirement: Full sun to partial shade

4. Carolina Laurelcherry

(Prunus caroliniana)

Native from Texas east to North Carolina

A low-water alternative to cherry laurel (P. laurocerasus), drought-tolerant Carolina laurelcherry has glossy leaves and an upright growth habit. Plant it as a hedge or grow dwarf varieties (Prunus caroliniana ‘Compacta’) in containers as accent shrubs.

Nondwarf plants naturally grow 20 to 30 feet tall and 15 to 20 feet wide but can be kept smaller with pruning. Given the robust growth habit of Carolina laurelcherry, it makes a great choice for tall privacy screens or dividers between garden rooms.

Note: Can be toxic to pets if ingested.

Where it will grow: Hardy to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 9.4 degrees Celsius (zones 8 to 10)

Water requirement: Moderate in hot climates; otherwise low

Light requirement: Full sun to light shade

5. Cherry Laurel

(Prunus laurocerasus)

Native to parts of Europe and Asia

Prized for its large, glossy leaves and vigorous growth habit, cherry laurel, also called English laurel, is a favorite choice for creating dark backdrops. Shear frequently to maintain a neat and tidy hedge or semiannually for a more natural-looking screen.

Plant dwarf cherry laurel (P. laurocerasus ‘Nana’, zones 7 to 9) for a low hedge along a fence, wall or foundation.

Notes: Cherry laurel can be invasive in some parts of the western U.S., so check with your local nursery before planting. It can be toxic to pets if ingested.

Where it will grow: Hardy to minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 20.6 degrees Celsius (zones 6 to 10)

Water requirement: Looks lushest with regular water

Light requirement: Full sun to partial shade

6. Fern Pine

(Podocarpus gracilior)

Native to eastern Africa

Fern pines look lush and delicate but are some of the toughest, most pest- and disease-free shrubs out there. Their graceful willow-like leaves create a soft, feathery look.

Left unchecked, fern pine forms a full-scale tree, growing from 20 to 60 feet tall and 10 to 20 feet wide. Keep the plants at more garden-friendly sizes with semiannual pruning. Take advantage of their height by using them as a hedge plant in urban settings to screen adjacent buildings.

Note: Fern pine can be mildly toxic to pets if ingested (causing vomiting in dogs and cats).

Where it will grow: Hardy to 25 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 3.9 degrees Celsius (zones 9 to 11)

Water requirement:Moderate; low once established

Light requirement: Full sun to partial shade

7. Hebe

(Hebe spp.)

Native to New Zealand

Most hebes grow best in temperate climates, but some small-leaved varieties will tolerate colder conditions. All are relatively low-growing shrubs, from 3 to 4 feet tall and wide, and make excellent border plants and globe topiaries. Some hebes have been cultivated to grow into globes without pruning, such as H. ‘Green Globe’, H. topiaria and H. ‘Baby Marie’.

As a general rule of thumb, hebes with smaller leaves (such as H. carnosula) are more drought-tolerant and resistant to wind and salt spray than those with larger leaves and showier flowers (such as Hebe x andersonii ‘Variegata’).

Where it will grow: Hardy to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 9.4 degrees Celsius (zones 8 to 10); some varieties tolerate nighttime lows of 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 9.4 to minus 6.7 degrees Celsius

Water requirement:Regular

Light requirement: Full sun to partial shade in hot climates

8. Kōhūhū

(Pittosporum tenufolium)

Native to New Zealand

Kōhūhū is an excellent fuss-free shrub for screens, hedges and other garden accents. Most are dark-stemmed, with leaf colors ranging from light green to purple.

P. tenufolium ‘Silver Sheen’ grows 10 to 15 feet tall with an open, airy habit. This variety can be useful as a fence screen while allowing light to filter through.

Top picks for low hedges and small shrubs include P. tenuifolium ‘Golf Ball’ and bronze-leaved P. tenufolium ‘Tom Thumb’, which both stay under 3 to 5 feet tall and wide.

Where it will grow: Hardy to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 9.4 degrees Celsius (zones 8 to 11)

Water requirement: Moderate; low once established

Light requirement: Full sun to partial shade

9. Privet

(Ligustrum spp.)

Native to Europe, North Africa, Asia and Australasia

These dark-leaved shrubs make excellent hedges and privacy screens. Small-leaved privets, including California privet (L. ovalifolium) and European privet (L. vulgare), are most commonly used as clipped hedges in formal gardens.

RELATED: Enhance the Privacy Around Your Patio With These Ideas

Privets can be pruned into any shape desired, from geometric hedges to pyramid- or globe-shaped topiaries. European privet naturally grows 10 to 15 feet tall and 8 to 15 feet wide.

Note: Privet can be invasive in parts of the Midwest and western U.S., so check with your local nursery before planting. Privet stems and leaves can be toxic to pets if ingested.

Where it will grow: Hardy to minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 31.7 degrees Celsius (zones 4 to 7)

Water requirement: Moderate; low once established

Light requirement: Full sun to partial shade

10. Yew

(Taxus spp.)

Native to North America, Europe and Asia

A European favorite for formal gardens, yew is a type of coneless conifer with dark green needle-like foliage. English yew (T. baccata) and Japanese yew (T. cuspidata) — as well as a cross between the two, (Taxus x media) — are the most widely available. All are cold-hardy and slow-growing and make excellent hedges.A group of vandals struck a commuter train in Australia on Tuesday night, but they weren’t interested in breaking windows or posting graffiti.

Instead, they apparently removed all the seats from the upper floor of the Sydney-bound bi-level rail car and stacked them neatly in the back of a car.

Police say the train, which was actively operating when the vandalism took place, was traveling between Lithgow and Katoomba in New South Wales when the crime occurred.

“It must’ve taken 10, 15 minutes or something, to do the whole thing," said Steve Mateer, a passenger who discovered the scene, in an interview with 7 News Sydney. "And with stations about five minutes apart, I don’t really know how they did that.”

“It was bewildering,” added Mateer. “I looked at the guy behind me, who walked in through the door behind me, and he was equally as shocked as I was.”

Mateer says he was able to snap a photo before the train’s staff moved him along, but not before one surveyed the scene for himself and remarked, “You gotta get out of here, this isn’t good.”

NSW Trains is currently working with the authorities to search for the suspects.

“We have CCTV vision from a range of cameras around our trains and we are working closely with police to identify those responsible,” authorities said.The Russian spy ship Viktor Leonov is currently “loitering” off the coast of Norfolk, Va., home to the largest naval base in the world, two U.S. officials tell Fox News.

KREMLIN REPORTEDLY ORDERED STATE MEDIA TO TONE DOWN TRUMP COVERAGE

As of Friday morning, the Russian spy ship is slowly patrolling only 17 nautical miles -- roughly 19 miles -- from land, according to officials. United States territorial waters extend 12 nautical miles from shore.

Fox News was first to report the sighting of the Russian spy ship off the coast of Delaware on Tuesday.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

The Victor Leonov, armed with an array of intelligence gathering equipment used to intercept communications and analyze U.S. Navy sonar capability, later traveled within 30 miles off the Connecticut coast near a submarine base earlier this week.

“It’s lawful [and] similar to operations we do around the world,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters Friday.

The Russian spy ship left her homeport in the Barents Sea near Norway, part of Russia’s northern fleet, around New Year’s Day, according to American defense officials. Following a port call in Jamaica, the Russian ship then began its voyage north along the east coast of the United States.

The deployment of the Russian intelligence-gathering ship was likely planned for months before it set sail in early January, according to U.S. defense officials. They said it apparently was not tied to the Obama administration’s Dec. 29 order that Moscow shut down two of its “vacation” properties, which the U.S. government said were used to intercept American communications. One was on New York's Long Island and the other was at Maryland’s Eastern Shore.

It’s the first time the Viktor Leonov has appeared off the east coast of the United States since April 2015. The ship was spotted in Havana Harbor in January 2015 as the Obama administration eased relations with Cuba. U.S. officials have said they believe the Russian spy ship will eventually make its way back to the Caribbean.

At a White House Press conference Thursday, President Donald Trump was asked about the Russian spy ship.

“The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone is going to say that’s so great. That’s not great. I would love to get along with Russia,” Trump said.

When the president was later asked about other recent Russian provocations including the buzzing of a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Black Sea roughly 180 miles southwest of Russian held Crimea, Trump responded, "Not good."

The four Russian jets came within 200 yards of the USS Porter and had their identifying transponders turned off according to a spokesman for the U.S. military’s European Command.

In Brussels Thursday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was asked by Fox News' Jennifer Griffin if he trusted the Russians enough to potentially work with them in the future.

“Russia is going to have to prove itself first,” Mattis answered, adding it was premature to talk about cooperating militarily with Moscow.

Yet roughly 2,600 miles away from Brussels, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, was meeting his Russian military counterpart, Valeriy Gerasimov, in Azerbaijan pledging to "enhance communications" between respective militaries, according to a Pentagon statement following their meeting.

The Pentagon cut off military-to-military talks with Moscow after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Elsewhere in Europe Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Tillerson was on his first overseas trip as Secretary of State to attend the G-20 ministerial meeting in Bonn, Germany.

“The United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people. Where we do not see eye to eye the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies,” Tillerson said after his meeting with Lavrov.

The Russian foreign minister said U.S. sanctions against Russia were not discussed in his meeting with Tillerson.

The experts also found evidence of an additional 54 planets, bringing the potential discovery of new worlds to 114.

One planet in particular, Gliese 411b, has been generating plenty of attention. Described as a “hot super Earth with a rocky surface,” Gliese 411b is located in the fourth-nearest star system to the Sun, making it the third-nearest planetary system to the Sun, according to the U.K.’s University of Hertfordshire, which participated in the research. Gliese 411b (also known as GJ 411b or Lalande 21185) orbits the star Gliese 411 (or GJ 411).

CROWDSOURCING THE SKY: HUGE STAR DATABASE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC

Despite the “super Earth” label, Dr. Mikko Tuomi from University of Hertfordshire’s Centre for Astrophysics told Fox News that Gliese 411b is too hot for life to exist on its surface.

Gliese 411 and Gliese 411b are located 8 light years from earth. A light year, which measures distance in space, equals 6 trillion miles.

By way of comparison, the recently-discovered Earth-like planet Proxima b, which orbits the red dwarf Proxima Centauri, is about 4 light years from Earth. A red dwarf is a relatively cool small star.

'SUPERFLARES' LIKELY MADE PROXIMA B UNINHABITABLE LONG AGO

Tuomi, who was also involved in the discovery of Proxima b, told Fox News that the latest batch of planets marks a significant discovery. “Over the recent years it has been established as a scientific fact that there are more planets in the Universe than there are stars. This means that virtually every star has a planet, or several of them, orbiting it,” he explained, via email. “Our discovery of dozens of new nearby planets highlights this fact. But it also does more. We are now moving on from simply discovering these worlds.”

“In essence, we are now building an observational roadmap for future giant telescopes that can be used to image some or even most of these newly found worlds,” Tuomi added. “This is like mapping an archipelago so that we are familiar with it in the future when taking a closer look at what its islands actually look like.”

The 60 new planets are found orbiting stars that are mostly some 20 to 300 light years away, according to Tuomi.

NASA INVESTIGATES SENDING A LANDER TO JUPITER’S MOON EUROPA TO LOOK FOR LIFE

The discoveries are based on observations taken over 20 years by U.S. astronomers using the Keck-I telescope in Hawaii as part of the Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey. During the course of the research, scientists obtained almost 61,000 observations of 1,600 stars, which are now available to the public.

Sponsored by NASA and the National Science Foundation, the Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey harnesses the talents of planet hunters from a number of organizations, including the University of California (UC) Santa Cruz and the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.

The Carnegie Institution of Science also led a team that included MIT to release the data on the almost 61,000 observations of 1,600 stars.

Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogersA fascinating essay that lay hidden for decades reveals Winston Churchill’s views on alien life.

The never-published essay has been in the archive of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri since the 1980s, when it was given to the museum by the wife of Churchill’s publisher, who had died. Last year the museum invited Israeli astrophysicist Mario Livio to review the essay, which he discusses in an article published in the science journal Nature.

Livio notes the British wartime leader’s passion for science and technology in the 1939 essay, as well as Churchill’s thoughts on extraterrestrials.

GERMAN WW II U-BOAT DISCOVERED OFF THE AZORES

Apparently influenced by events unfolding at the time, Churchill voices his concern about human progress and describes the possibility of aliens. “I, for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilization here that I am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures, or that we are the highest type of mental and physical development which has ever appeared in the vast compass of space and time,” he wrote.

The original version of the 11-page essay is held in Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, U.K. Churchill, however, revisited the essay in the late 1950s and made some minor typographical changes – he also changed the essay’s title from “Are we alone in space?” to “Are we alone in the universe?” This second draft, which is now in the possession of the U.S. National Churchill Museum, was reviewed by Livio.

Timothy Riley, the director and chief curator of the National Churchill Museum, told Fox News that the essay provides an incredible insight into Churchill’s personality. “I think it reveals the incredibly curious mind of Winston Churchill and the breadth and scope of his interests,” he said. “We know that he had a keen interest in science and valued science and thought that science would lead to progress.”

DEFENSE OFFICIALS MAY HAVE FOUND REMAINS OF US WW II AIRMEN IN THE HIMALAYAS

In the journal Nature, Livio explains that, during the 1920s and 1930s, Churchill wrote popular-science essays for newspapers and magazines on topics such as evolution and cells. He also points to the politician’s friendship with the physicist Frederick Lindemann, who later became science adviser to the British government. The prime minister also created a science-friendly environment that spurred progress in areas like molecular genetics and X-ray crystallography, according to Livio.

Copyright issues, however, are currently preventing publication of the essay, something which the National Churchill Museum hopes to eventually resolve.

Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogersVolunteers at Boston Medical Center are helping babies who were exposed to drugs while in the womb heal faster with the power of human touch. The volunteer cuddlers are part of the hospital’s CALM program, which helps newborns who are suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome, Fox 25 reported.

“By snuggling a baby, it can be a difference between a baby getting medication versus not,” Dr. Elisha Wachman, head of the hospital’s CALM program, told Fox 25.

Babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome may suffer from tremors and difficulty eating or getting comfortable.

“We have a cuddler step in and really comfort the infant, to the point where, most of the time, I walk in and the infant is fast asleep on the cuddler, looking very comfortable and not showing any signs of withdrawal at all,” Wachman told Fox 25.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

According to Wachman, the program has helped to cut infants’ hospitalization time in half, while also helping 50 percent of babies heal without medication. The hospital has gotten 100 volunteers enrolled in the program since it started in December, with 150 more on the waiting list, Fox 25 reproted.

Program volunteer Pamela Turocotte said she became involved after watching her own grandchildren overcome neonatal abstinence syndrome.

“It fills you with so much purpose,” Pamela Turocotte, a volunteer, told Fox 25. “It’s amazing what one simple thing can do to change the outcome.”

Boston Medical Center said there are plans to expand the program in the spring.WASHINGTON—An uncomfortable question looms over the tax debate in Congress: What’s Plan B?

Border adjustment, a pillar of House Republicans’ tax proposal, is taking a beating. Big retailers are lobbying aggressively against the concept, which would tax imports and exempt exports. Senate Republicans have expressed views ranging from skepticism...In the 12-month period that ended last August, deforestation in Brazil increased in almost 30 percent.

It is an all-time record that has set off a loud alarm among scientists, environmentalists and everyone who knows that the region is not only the so-called “lung of the planet” but also home to about 2.5 million species of insects, tens of thousands of plants and about 2,000 birds and mammals.

According to the latest report by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), the Brazilian agency that monitors deforestation, between July 2015 and August 2016 roughly 3,100 square miles went up in smoke mostly to give way to farmland and further cement the country’s position as the world’s top exporter of meat products.

INCREDIBLE PHOTOS OFFER GLIMPSE OF UNCONTACTED AMAZON TRIBE

Activists and experts agree that such depredation has been in large part possible to the loosening of the nation’s environmental laws and also to budget cuts that have left vast stretches of rain forest to the mercy of greed.

Cristiane Mazetti, a spokesperson for Greenpeace, said the Forest Code of 2012 brought about a sort of “deforestation amnesty” that contributes to the increase of tree felling by creating a sense of impunity.

She said the issue is hardly getting any government attention and that apathy seems to have taken over.

"We live a political moment in Brazil that puts the environmental issue in second, maybe third,” she told Fox News. “Congress spent a year focused on the impeachment vote of former President Dilma Rousseff and now prioritizes the approval of austerity measures. It has not allowed this issue to advance," she said.

STRANGE AMAZON MARKINGS BAFFLE EXPERTS

In addition, the allocation of funds for surveillance, monitoring and prevention has been dropping dramatically. In 2015 approximately $22 million were devoted to this end; in 2016 only $7 million were used for this purpose, according to the Environmental Ministry data.

To put an end to what some are calling an epidemic, in 2015 Greenpeace introduced a bill in Congress calling for a “zero deforestation policy.” It was filed along with 1.4 million signatures supporting the initiative.

The bill is currently in the consultation phase, which means the population has until the end of 2017 to issue opinions and recommendations.

Environmentalists hope that the new law will reinstate some of the regulations that they say protected the land. Before 2012, any tree-cutting had to be justified and explained by a number of government agencies. Today, all that is required is a single permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture in a matter of weeks.

Greenpeace has dubbed Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi “the largest forest destroyer in Brazil.”

EYE IN THE SKY: TECH HELPS PROTECT ISOLATED AMAZON TRIBES

According to Paulo Barreto, a researcher at the Instituto do Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amazônia (Imazon), the steady expansion of the country's farming borders is also being stimulated by an increase in cattle prices.

However, he said Brazil could still benefit from its oversized livestock – the largest in the world – without dilapidating the Amazon rain forest if “the government was vigilant, if it didn't change the rules. But when the [deforestation] threat increases and government weakens protection — that mix leads to this escalating situation," he said.

Large infrastructure projects in the Amazon region, such as the new Belo Monte Hydroelectric Plant, in the state of Para, have worsened the problem by “leading to a disorderly urban growth of the site, pollution and even the flooding of various areas," according to the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA).

No wonder that in the INPE report released recently, Para is at the top of the list, with approximately 1,200 square miles (38 percent of the state) of deforested land in just 12 months.

Environmentalists say the magnitude of the threat demands a serious effort by the government and the world.

"There is also a lack of ambition to combat the problem,” Mazetti said. “Last year, the government set a goal to end illegal deforestation by 2030. But if we [continue to] allow this practice, admittedly illegal, for another 15 years, how can we achieve this goal?" she said.

Carolina Torres is a freelance journalist living in Rio de Janeiro.After a heated election cycle, one restaurateur in Long Island, N.Y. decided he wanted to heal the divide and bring people together-- over free pizza.

Albert’s Pizza in Ronkonkoma started a "pay it forward" program for customers on Jan. 21-- a day after President Trump's inauguration.

Participating locals have been preordering pizzas and writing messages on the box for someone they feel is in need of a special boost, according to Newsday.

DOMINO'S LAUNCHES WEDDING REGISTRY FOR PIZZA-LOVING COUPLES

“People were so divided. It felt like they wanted to tear each other apart,” Albert's co-owner, Richard Baer, said. “I was sick of the politics, so I just thought, what can I do to bring people together?”

The first pizza was given away by two of Baer’s employees who decided to pay it forward to someone grieving over a death. “To someone who just lost a loved one. Here’s your sign that they’re with you,” they wrote on the box.

A few days later, that pizza was given to a woman who recently lost her mother. When he handed over the free meal, Baer says both he and the woman started crying.

To date, 20 pizzas have been given out to military veterans, police officers, teachers, and nurses. One even went to a man battling Stage 4 cancer.

Baer did make one rule, however. The pizza must send a positive message to the recipient and cannot involve politics.

After customers write a personalized note, the boxes are hung on the restaurant's wall until servers identify a match. The recipient must also take a picture with Baer to post on Facebook.

Michael Slattery, a former special education student at Sachem High School North who now helps coach football, was visiting the pizzeria Wednesday with his father when he was surprised with a free pie set aside just for him.

“To Mike Slats, This one’s on us. Thank you for all you do for our community.” "Slats" is Slattery's nickname.

Slattery returned the favor and paid $15 for the next teacher that came in for a pizza.

“It’s a really incredibly feeling, being able to help other people and being able to share that feeling with others,” Baer said.

According to Newsday, after hearing about the movement, four Albert's Pizzerias, along with Valencia Ravioli in Lynbrook, N.Y., are planning to start pay it forward programs soon.Slightly more voters find the White House more truthful than the media, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

In addition, most feel the press is tougher on President Trump than it was on President Obama. But that may be a positive development, as a majority thinks aggressive coverage of the presidency is good for the country.

By a slim 45-42 percent margin, more voters say they trust the Trump administration to “tell the public the truth” than the reporters who cover the White House. Ten percent say neither.

READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS

The poll, released Friday, was conducted Saturday through Monday evenings. That was before Trump told reporters at a press conference Thursday, “the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.”

The Fox poll last asked a similar question in June 2006. At that time, “news reporters” were more trusted than “government officials” by a 40-25 percent margin, with 26 percent saying neither.

Some 68 percent think the press has been “tougher” on Trump than Obama. That’s more than three times the number who think reporters are giving him an “easier” time (18 percent). Another 12 percent see treatment of the two as the same.

People want tough press coverage. A majority, 55 percent, thinks it’s better for the country if the news media “cover the president aggressively.” Thirty-eight percent feel it would be better if reporters gave the president the “benefit of the doubt.”

There are the expected partisan differences. Eight in 10 Republicans (81 percent) trust the Trump administration more to tell the truth, while roughly the same portion of Democrats trust the media (79 percent). Independents are twice as likely to put their faith in Trump as the press (52-26 percent), while 16 percent say neither.

Almost all Republicans (92 percent) and most independents (74 percent) perceive coverage as tougher on Trump. Some Democrats agree: 42 percent say it’s been tougher, 34 percent easier, and 21 percent the same.

Pollpourri

Recently Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) said this on the Senate floor: “I personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully because everybody in the world pays attention to the president of the United States.” Most voters agree. Seventy-one percent think Trump “should be more careful about what he says and how he says it.”

Hatch continued, “On the other hand, I kind of find it refreshing that he doesn’t take any guff from anybody.” Twenty-eight percent of voters agree with that perspective. They like that Trump “speaks his mind.”

Over half of conservatives (55 percent) and Republicans (54 percent) want the president to be more careful when he speaks. At the same time, over half of those who voted for Trump in the election like the fact that he speaks his mind (54 percent).

Democrats aren’t nearly as forgiving: 93 percent wish Trump spoke more carefully.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 11-13, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.SUPERSONIC RESPONSE

TRUMP MULLS ‘BIG ORDER’ OF F/A-18S

President Trump appears to be comfortable pitting aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed against each other. So on Friday, during a tour of the Boeing factory in South Carolina, he told reporters that the U.S. is looking “seriously” at a “big order” of a stealthy Boeing F/A-18s. The order might cut into the amount of F-35s. Some aviation experts find it difficult to imagine how the F/A-18 could ever compete with Lockheed’s fifth generation fighter.

Long gone are the days when the hotel heiress led party marathons, stirred tabloid headlines on the regular and portrayed the ditzy blonde with a baby voice to Nicole Richie’s troublemaker on the hit reality TV series “The Simple Life.” Hilton, who turns 36 on Friday, insisted she left those days behind and instead, has been expertly crafting her career as an entrepreneur.

In other words, Hilton has finally grown up.

PARIS HILTON DOESN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS A REALITY TV STAR

“I haven’t really been going to a lot of parties. All of my friends have been telling me to go out every single night, but I have to get up every morning around 7 a.m. for work,” explained Hilton to Fox News while she's in town for New York Fashion Week where she’s been spotted walking the runway for couture designers.

“I’ve only been to one party all week when usually it would have been 50 parties,” she said laughing, all while projecting a more poised voice. “My priorities have changed and I’m more focused on my business, getting up early and just being responsible, as opposed to going to all the Fashion Week parties.”

Hilton wasn’t just in town solely to scope the upcoming styles. The LA-based star has been spending time with her younger sister Nicky, who resides in New York City, as well as her 7-month-old niece Lily Grace.

PARIS HILTON GOES TO CUBA

She also promoted her 21st fragrance, Gold Rush Man, which she described as her most sophisticated scent for men. She proudly declared to us that like the late Elizabeth Taylor, she’s had a successful collection in her 12 years of producing scents. (Taylor was previously married to Hilton's great-uncle.) She also revealed that the perfume, “one of glamour and confidence,” reflected the next stage in her life.

“I feel very lucky that I grew up in a family with amazing businessmen, with my father and my grandfather — they’ve always been such incredible mentors to me that I’ve looked up to,” she explained. “Just getting advice from my family and growing up with a business mindset, I think that’s what really made me the woman I am today and the entrepreneur that I’ve become.”

And it seems like she’s determined to make her new role the most successful one yet. It’s been reported that Hilton sells $200 million worth of perfume annually. She also owns three hotels, 35 boutiques around the world and is a product manufacturer who has launched everything from makeup to children’s wear — resulting in Hilton, who hops on a plane every other day to launch or help create something new, being worth more than $100 million.

It’s also the reason why she hopes to be recognized as a role model for girls.

“I know I have a lot of young fans, especially girls who are very impressionable and are growing up,” she said. “I want to be a role model for them, an independent woman, someone they can look up to who works very hard and created her own empire. [I want to] show them that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and your confidence. I love that I could be a great role model for these girls and show that hard works pays off and that they can do it, too.”

PARIS HILTON DENIES HAVING PLASTIC SURGERY

Hilton is pleased with her success so far, but is eager to expand on what she calls an empire.

“I feel like I accomplished so much already and I’m so proud of what I’ve done so far,” said Hilton. “I’m so excited to be following in my family’s footsteps and getting involved in real estate and opening up my own properties. Another area I’m really focusing on, the next step in my life, is working on different tech projects involving virtual reality and apps….just really innovative, and game-changing projects within the tech world. That’s one area I’m involved in now.”

She is a paradox. She is faithful & yet detached. She is committed & yet relaxed. She loves everyone & yet no one. She is sociable & also a loner. She is gentle & yet tough. She is passionate but also platonic. In short she is predictable in her own unpredictability... ✨✨👸🏼✨✨ A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Jan 25, 2017 at 10:58am PST

However, one thing Hilton has zero plans on conquering again is reality TV. When asked, Hilton stressed that while that was the beginning stage of her career, she’s happily moved on and is just too busy with her countless business projects, which is what she was really meant to do as a Hilton.

“I get calls every single day from networks and companies pitching ideas for a show,” Hilton explained. “Every single day. I really enjoyed being a pioneer in the reality television world, but now I’m on to bigger and better things. I don’t know, I’m just not into the whole reality thing anymore at all. I just see myself more as a businesswoman now and that’s what I really prefer to put my focus on now.”They say “Don’t mess with Texas” for a reason.

And if the National Football League wants to avoid getting blindsided, it might want to think twice about what that advice means.

Just a week after Houston hosted Super Bowl LI, the League suggested that if the Lone Star State legislature passes a proposed bill requiring people to use the bathroom, locker room or shower rooms and changing room assigned to their biological gender, Texas may forfeit high-profile sports events in the future. Why? Because gay rights groups consider the law tantamount to legalized discrimination against trans-gender people.

The NFL’s threat is nearly identical to one issued by the National Basketball Association and the NCAA, the governing body for collegiate sports, against North Carolina, which has already enacted a similar law.

Earlier this week, Bellwether looked at the nasty standoff between North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature and opponents of the law. The NBA moved this year’s All-Star game, slated for Charlotte, to New Orleans, as punishment for North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill. And the NCAA has threatened to shut the Tar Heel state out of future sports events unless the law, officially known as HR2, is repealed.

North Carolina isn’t backing down, and Texas probably won’t, either, when its bill comes up for a vote next month. "The NBA and the NFL have lost their minds, as well as their moral compass, " says Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. "They are shaking in their sneakers because they're so afraid of political correctness."

“The far left is out of touch on this issue,” says Texas Republican State Senator Lois Kohlkorst, the bill’s chief sponsor. “What I find frustrating is that most people who say they oppose this bill haven’t even read it.”

A former college athlete, Kohlkorst says that the proposal, formally called SB6 but shorthanded as the bathroom bill, covers more than restrooms. For example, if SB6 fails to become law, a player on the men’s basketball team who self-identifies as female can choose the girls’ locker room to suit up and shower in. She warns, “The thought of 15- and 16 –year-old boys and girls showering together at school is something we should think about.”

Women’s groups are now voicing alarm. “We’re hearing from women, especially rape victims, who are offended and traumatized by the thought of a man being in these most intimate places with them,” Kolkhorst says. “This cuts through party lines and goes to our shared system of values.”

She cites internal polling showing SB6 is favored by every ethnic group in Texas but one: white liberal Democrats.

Certainly, trans-gender people – by which I mean those who have undergone medical alteration to make them what they choose to be – should not endure discrimination. But what about those who have not taken such steps? How should they prove they are the gender they say they are? An anatomy exam? Wouldn’t that be the most humiliating test of all?

The NBA and the NCAA declined to talk last week when I called about the North Carolina law. The NFL has issued a statement saying it is inclusive and opposed to discrimination of any kind, but won’t comment further.

Yet none of these sports associations have opened their players’ locker rooms to the opposite gender. Nor have they taken steps to ensure that spectators can enter any bathroom in the stadiums where their games are played.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott thinks the NFL is sticking its faceguard where it doesn’t belong. “The NFL has its own problems,” Abbott told Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel. “The NFL coddled players who refused to stand for the National Anthem. The NFL has its own problems with regards to violence against women. The last thing the NFL needs to do is tell states how to operate.”

NFL referees are pretty good at recognizing offside, when one team wanders into an opponent’s space. Perhaps a quick glance in the mirror would help end this latest, unnecessary scrimmage, and help everyone make the right call.

After the implementation of ObamaCare, it is clear the law brought radical change and real pain to our nation’s families, economy, and health care system. The promised "affordable health care fix" made things worse.

The pending King v. Burwell case reveals another interesting legal problem with the policy and text of the Affordable Care Act. As written, the federally controlled subsidies and employer mandates are not allowed, unless a state chooses them. Now the Supreme Court debates, behind closed doors, the question of state responsibility and textual intent to determine the direction of health care in America. The resulting Supreme Court opinion could dismantle the structure of ObamaCare and give America a second chance to get health care reform right.

Ironically, the issue of state responsibility could take ObamaCare down and lift individual citizens up.

States are generally more effective regulators than the federal government. Allowing states to assume responsibility and maintain authority moves people from numbers on a spreadsheet to neighbors down the street.

The Constitution gives states the power to regulate health care within their state and voluntarily compact with other states, but the federal government has attempted to preempt state action by assuming centralized control. What is needed is clear legislation that affirms the right of states to compact with one another to return authority for health care regulation to states that choose to participate.

Interstate compacts have been used on more than 200 occasions to establish agreements between and among states. Mentioned in Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, state compacts provide authority and flexibility to administer government programs without federal interference. In the Compact structure, federal health care tax money and responsibility is returned to a state when they expand their existing Healthcare Authority structure. Congressional consent is extended when states enter into a legally binding compact. It is similar to a multitude of other grants made by the federal government to states and local entities.

Complexity empowers big government, simplicity empowers families and local leaders. Giving health care authority to states is simple and beneficial because they are able to enact accountability, efficiencies and tailor their system to fit the exact needs of their population. One size does not fit all – ObamaCare proves that. The health challenges and population needs of Vermont or California are not the same as Texas or Oklahoma.

Why should bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. manage all health care systems the same way?

Health care is large, complex, and challenging to manage at the federal level. With a federal system that impacts over 300 million people, $2.3 trillion spent annually and almost 3,000 pages of regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, federal management of our health care system is inefficient and virtually occluded from individualized input. The Medicare fraud rate has hovered around 10 percent for decades, with over $50 billion in annual lost tax money. Big systems allow massive financial loss and make individual citizens small.

States are generally more effective regulators than the federal government. Allowing states to assume responsibility and maintain authority moves people from numbers on a spreadsheet to neighbors down the street. Rural health care struggles to get the attention of federal agencies, but they would have the consistent ear of state agencies.

Some people assume only people in Washington, D.C. care about the health needs of people across the nation, but we can assure you that state leaders and state agencies deeply care for their neighbors and want to find ways to help them. In fact, before the Affordable Care Act passed, our states had already initiated systems to care for those without health care. Unfortunately, the state solutions were forced out when ObamaCare took over.

The Compact is an option that ensures the people of each state will have a choice. States can opt in to the Compact – or not. To date, the Health Care Compact has been formally requested by 9 states – Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah – and several other states are considering it.

As Congress works towards solutions to the problems created by the top-down approach of ObamaCare, we want to let states innovate to serve their citizens’ health care needs. When the Supreme Court rules on King v. Burwell in favor of state responsibility, we want to let states innovate ways to serve their citizens’ health care.

Republican James Lankford represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate.C-SPAN released a survey Friday that asked historians to rank past presidents and former-President Obama was voted the country's 12th best, right behind Woodrow Wilson and in front of James Monroe.

Historians were asked to essentially grade the presidents on items like “public persuasion” and “moral authority.” Politico reported that Obama rated high in the category of “equal justice for all,” but received low marks for his relationship with Congress.

Of course, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of a presidency so soon after the president left office.

"Although 12th is a respectable overall ranking, one would have thought that former President Obama’s favorable rating when he left office would have translated into a higher ranking in this presidential survey," Edna Greene Medford, a Howard University professor and member of C-SPAN's historical advisory board, told Politico.

Abraham Lincoln retained the top position, and George Washington came in a close second.Faced with the Syrian debacle, Trump administration officials, among others, claim that the U.S. can exploit the weakness of the growing strategic coalition between Russia and Iran, ultimately using Russia to contain Iran in Syria and throughout the Middle East.

The Obama administration had this idea too, and it remains wrong.

Circumstances could arise that might split the partners, but American outreach to Moscow won’t do it. A bigger question for the U.S. right now is whether we can prevent other nations vital to our interests from shifting toward the new Russian-Iranian orbit.

There are reasons why the Russia-vs-Iran fantasy is attractive. Historical tension between Iran and Russia is real, and neither state knows how to be a good ally. Russia sees itself as a superpower and disdains to treat other states as equals.

Iran sees itself as the natural hegemon of the Middle East and leader of the vast Shi’a Muslim denomination. Marginalization and persecution of Shi’as over the centuries makes it hard for the Islamic Republic to trust outside powers. Tehran also has had tensions with Russia over Caspian Sea resources and oil.

Thinking too much about these historical disagreements, however, obscures the deep commonality of aims shared by Moscow and Tehran--driving the U.S. from the Middle East being the chief of these common goals.

Iran’s leaders constantly assert that the Middle East should be free of the influence of outside powers. They never point that argument at Russia or China, but rather at the U.S., Britain, and their allies. Russia’s leaders and doctrines assert that the U.S. must abandon its position as a global power and yield to a multipolar world order in which Russia is its equal.

Russia and Iran also share allies and goals around their periphery. Both back Armenia over Azerbaijan in the Caucasus. Russia has kept a military base in Armenia since the end of the Cold War, while Iran fears that Azerbaijan could attempt to stir up separatism within Iran’s large Azeri population. Both seek stability in Afghanistan and prefer to work with local Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras rather than Pashtuns. Both have, however, worked with, and even supported, Taliban factions when it suited them.

Only extreme circumstances will split the Russo-Iranian coalition in Syria—if the Assad regime faces defeat, or the pro-regime coalition succeeds enough that it can move on to consider its next goals. Neither is likely.

Vladimir Putin would give up on Bashar al Assad long before Ayatollah Khamenei would, but right now Putin needs an Alawite government like Assad’s to let him keep his new military base on the Mediterranean. Ayatollah Khamenei needs the Assad regime to give the Revolutionary Guards’ Qods Force and its Hezbollah allies a secure rear-area from which to confront Israel.

Russia needs Iran in Syria at least as badly as Iran needs Russia.

The Assad regime and army are kept alive artificially by tens of thousands of Iranian, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shi’a militia, and Afghan and Pakistani militia troops, all provided, paid for and commanded by Iranians. The Russians neither can, nor would, replace these forces with their own. If the Russians agreed to drive the Iranians from Syria, the Assad regime and Russia’s position would collapse.

Russian and Iranian aims in the region diverge significantly on two points. The Islamic Republic is committed to destroying Israel and containing or collapsing Saudi power. Moscow shares neither goal. But Moscow has done nothing to protest or contain Iran’s harassment of Israel using Hezbollah and HAMAS.

The Russians have also reached out to the Saudis and Gulf states to mitigate damage their support for Iran has done to their position in the region. Moscow would prefer a Sunni power to balance Iran, where Tehran prefers unquestioned hegemony.

There is some surprising overlap even in this divergent effort, however. Egypt is drifting away from the Saudi bloc and toward Moscow and even Tehran. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi voted for Russian initiatives in Syria at the U.N. and even sent a small number of Egyptian troops to Syria on behalf of the Russo-Iranian coalition.

The Iranians have no quarrel with Sisi, and have never directed against him the kind of vitriol they reserve for the Saudis and their Gulf Arab allies. Russia and Iran may, in fact, come to see Cairo as a mutually acceptable contender for leadership of the Sunni Arabs in the region at the expense of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. This would be a formidable new challenge to American strategy and statecraft.

American policy-makers must get past facile statements about the supposed limits of Russian and Iranian cooperation and back to the serious business of furthering our own interests in a tumultuous region.

The Russo-Iranian coalition will no doubt eventually fracture, as most interest-based coalitions ultimately do. Conditions in the Middle East and the world, however, offer no prospect of such a development any time soon.

The sunken world has been dubbed Zealandia as is mostly submerged beneath the South Pacific.

Zealandia stretched 1.9 million square miles and was 94 percent underwater, according to research published in the Geological Society of America’s Journal, GSA Today.

This makes it the size of greater India.

RESEARCHERS SAY LONG-LOST CONTINENT LIES BENEATH INDIAN OCEAN ISLAND

It was part of the Gondwana super-continent but broke away about 100 million years ago, researchers claimed.

New Zealand has never been regarded as part of the Australian continent, although the geographic term Australasia often is used for the collective land and islands of the southwest Pacific region.

But after 20 years of research, scientists believe that the isolated island belonged to its own super land mass.

There is no official body that recognizes new continents, but the scientists believe Zealandia has the same features as the six we are familiar with.

Lead author Nick Mortimer said scientists have been gathering data to make the case for Zealandia for two decades.

FIRST CAME A 'CATASTROPHIC COLLAPSE,' THEN A TSUNAMI

He wrote: “As well as being the seventh largest geological continent, Zealandia is the youngest, thinnest, and most submerged.

“The scientific value of classifying Zealandia as a continent is much more than just an extra name on a list.

“That a continent can be so submerged yet unfragmented makes it a useful and thought-provoking geodynamic end member in exploring the cohesion and breakup of continental crust.”

Discoveries of this kind proves that “the large and the obvious in natural science can be overlooked”, Mortimer concluded.

This article was originally published by The Sun.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Friday told the Munich Security Conference that President Trump’s administration is in “disarray” and has “a lot of work to do.”

McCain has emerged as one of Trump’s most vocal critics from his own party. Most recently, there has been a public fued between the administration and McCain over the Yemen raid that resulted in the deaths of civilians and the loss of a Navy SEAL.

McCain, who did not call out Trump by name, pointed to the resignation of Trump’s former national security adviser to illustrate his point.

"I think that the Flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do,” McCain said, according to Reuters. “The president, I think, makes statements (and) on other occasions contradicts himself. So we’ve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says.”

McCain pointed to the “profound concern across Europe” that the U.S. is laying down its “mantle of global leadership.”

“I can only speak for myself, but I do not believe that that is the message you will hear from all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend,” he said.

Vice President Pence gave a speech Saturday morning where he assured NATO that the U.S. "will be unwavering in our commitment to this trans-Atlantic alliance."

The Washington Post ran a headline, in an analysis article, “John McCain just systematically dismantled Donald Trump’s entire worldview.” The paper reported that “it was a striking display from a senior leader of a party when it comes to a president of the same party.

McCain’s comments came days after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told fellow NATO members to increase military spending by year's end or risk seeing the U.S. curtail its defense support — a stark threat given Europe's deep unease already over U.S.-Russian relations.

Echoing Trump's demands for NATO countries to assume greater self-defense responsibility, Mattis said Washington will "moderate its commitment" to the alliance if countries fail to fall in line.

The Associated Press contributed to this reportIt’s been about three weeks since President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Fox News Poll checked in with voters nationwide to get a read on how things are going.

Here are five findings on the new administration. Voters feel:

-- Divided over Trump.

-- A bit more confident in Trump’s judgment than they did before the election.

-- Optimistic on the economy, pessimistic on health care, and mixed on security.

-- Repealing and replacing Obamacare and cutting taxes should be higher priorities than building the wall.

-- Trump’s election victory was a bigger surprise than the Patriots’ Super Bowl comeback.

Here are the numbers behind those bullet points:

When asked if the Trump administration is working on things that will help their family, 47 percent of voters say yes, while 48 percent say no.

That’s almost identical to the split over President Trump’s job performance: 48 percent approve and 47 percent disapprove. Moreover, most voters feel strongly one way or the other, as 35 percent “strongly” approve and 41 percent “strongly” disapprove.

Nearly all Republicans approve (87 percent), as do just over half of independents (52 percent). Among Democrats, 10 percent give him the thumbs up.

For comparison, after Barack Obama’s first month as president, 60 percent of voters approved of the job he was doing, including 90 percent of Democrats, 62 percent of independents, and 29 percent of Republicans (February 2009).

The poll, released Tuesday, finds 50 percent feel confident in Trump’s judgment in a crisis, up from 43 percent in October 2016. Yet nearly half, 49 percent, lack confidence in his judgment. In addition, about half of voters describe Trump as a “strong leader” (52-45 percent).

Where will things stand after Trump’s first year? In spite of his mixed approval rating, by a 55-35 percent margin, voters feel the economy will be stronger a year from now. That includes more than one in five Democrats (22 percent). There’s less optimism on health care coverage, as voters expect it will be harder (48 percent) rather than easier to get coverage next year (35 percent) -- likely due to Trump’s pledge to repeal Obamacare. Meanwhile, 46 percent think the U.S. will be safer a year from now, while 43 percent say less safe.

In Trump’s first 100 days in office, twice as many voters say it’s extremely or very important for him to work on cutting taxes (52 percent) and repealing Obamacare (49 percent), than building a border wall (26 percent). Among Republicans, 76 percent prioritize repealing Obamacare and 74 percent cutting taxes, while just 47 percent say the same of building the wall.

For many, the unique way Trump won the election made it unexpected -- with a big Electoral College advantage despite losing the popular vote by more than two percentage points. Some compared it to this year’s Super Bowl, in which the New England Patriots overcame a 28-3 third-quarter deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons.

Which was more surprising? Voters say it was Trump’s win by a 56-35 percent margin. Among Hillary Clinton voters, 76 percent say Trump. That’s more than twice the number of Trump voters who say the same (37 percent).

Trump’s win also bothered more people than the Patriots’ victory (49-27 percent). That’s largely driven by the fact that 91 percent of Clinton voters were bothered more by the election, while for Trump voters it was the Super Bowl (52 percent) or neither event (39 percent).

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 11-13, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.China has long been the world's worst when it comes to air pollution, but a new study suggests that India's trouble is now on par with China's and poised to exceed it.

The study from the Health Effects Institute and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation finds that air pollution was responsible for more than 4.2 million deaths in 2015—making it the fifth-leading cause of death worldwide—including 1.1 million each in China and India, reports the New York Times.

But whereas China has been working to prevent such deaths, causing its number to level out, the number of deaths linked to airborne particles known as PM2.5s jumped 50% in India from 1990 to 2015, per AFP.

Rapid industrialization with a focus on coal production, population growth, and an aging public more vulnerable to pollution have created "the perfect storm for India," says a researcher.

Yet a rep for the Public Health Foundation of India says the government isn't taking action. Last week, a government official there said "there is no conclusive data available" linking pollution and mortality, per Reuters.

The study does offer hope, though: It finds the 20% increase in deaths from air pollution worldwide since 1990 was slower than the rate of population increase.

Pollution also improved in Europe and the US with environmental regulations. That said, 258,000 Europeans and 88,000 Americans are still at risk of premature death due to air pollution, the study says.

(Some of the dirtiest air in the US can be found at the North Pole.)

This article originally appeared on Newser: China Has Deadliest Air Pollution? Maybe NotIf you've been feeling nostalgic for the days when airlines served A full meal in economy, Delta has good news for you.

The legacy carrier announced Thursday it will start offering complimentary meals in the main cabin on several long haul flights as part of a multi-million dollar effort to improve customer experience across the board.

The airline was among the first to axe free meals back in 2001, with many domestic airlines following suit over the next decade.

Starting March 1, Delta will offer complimentary meals in the main cabin on flights between New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles/San Francisco.

The following month, the airline will expand the complimentary meal service to 10 other domestic flights from Seattle, N.Y., Boston and Washington, D.C. Other enhancements include upgraded main cabin snacks, enhanced blankets and free in-flight entertainment. Passengers on long-haul, international flights will also receive complimentary beer, wine, spirits and sleep kits.

Delta began offering complimentary meals late last year as part of the limited service test to improve customer satisfaction. Some fliers were pretty surprised by the re-introduction of inflight meals.

"Blow me down and call me Nancy, there was a free meal on my @Delta domestic flight. What is this 1997? :)," said one Twitter user last year.

The meals offered on 12 routes will vary depending on flight time. In the morning, customers can choose between a honey maple breakfast sandwich, Luvo breakfast medley or a fruit and cheese plate. In the afternoon, there's a mesquite-smoked turkey combo, Luvo Mediterranean whole grain veggie wrap, or a fruit and cheese plate. Customers flying overnight will have a selection of a various entrees and be offered a breakfast bar before arrival.

Delta says it will regularly rotate its menus with a focus on seasonal and locally-sourced food and beverages.U.S. homebuilding fell in January as the construction of multi-family housing projects dropped, but upward revisions to the prior month's data and a jump in permits to a one-year high suggested the housing recovery remained on track.

Continue Reading Below

Housing starts declined 2.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million units, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

December's starts were revised up to a rate of 1.28 million units from the previously reported 1.23 million pace.

Homebuilding was up 10.5 percent compared to January 2016.

Permits for future construction jumped 4.6 percent in January to a rate of 1.29 million units, the highest level since November 2015. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity slipping to a rate of 1.22 million units last month and building permits rising to a 1.23 million pace.

The housing market recovery is being driven by a strong labor market, which is boosting employment opportunities for young people and supporting household formation.

Higher mortgage rates could, however, slow demand for housing.

A survey on Wednesday showed homebuilders' confidence slipped in February but remained at levels consistent with a growing housing market.

Builders anticipated a slowdown in buyer traffic and continued to grapple with shortages of developed lots and skilled labor.

Homebuilding last month surged 55.4 percent in the Northeast.

It jumped 20.0 percent in the South to the highest level since August 2007. Starts fell in the West and Midwest.

Last month, single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, climbed 1.9 percent to a pace of 823,000 units.

Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment tumbled 10.2 percent to a rate of 423,000 units.

Single-family permits slipped 2.7 percent last month after increasing for five consecutive months. Building permits for multi-family units soared 19.8 percent.

This article originally appeared in Page Six.C-SPAN released a survey Friday that asked historians to rank past presidents and former-President Obama was voted the country's 12th best, right behind Woodrow Wilson and in front of James Monroe.

Historians were asked to essentially grade the presidents on items like “public persuasion” and “moral authority.” Politico reported that Obama rated high in the category of “equal justice for all,” but received low marks for his relationship with Congress.

Of course, it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of a presidency so soon after the president left office.

"Although 12th is a respectable overall ranking, one would have thought that former President Obama’s favorable rating when he left office would have translated into a higher ranking in this presidential survey," Edna Greene Medford, a Howard University professor and member of C-SPAN's historical advisory board, told Politico.

Abraham Lincoln retained the top position, and George Washington came in a close second.In a Mexican cave system so beautiful and hot that it is called both Fairyland and hell, scientists have discovered life trapped in crystals that could be 50,000 years old.

The bizarre and ancient microbes were found dormant in caves in Naica, Mexico, and were able to exist by living on minerals such as iron and manganese, said Penelope Boston, head of NASA's Astrobiology Institute.

"It's super life," said Boston, who presented the discovery Friday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Boston.

If confirmed, the find is yet another example of how microbes can survive in extremely punishing conditions on Earth.

Though it was presented at a science conference and was the result of nine years of work, the findings haven't yet been published in a scientific journal and haven't been peer reviewed. Boston planned more genetic tests for the microbes she revived both in the lab and on site.

The life forms — 40 different strains of microbes and even some viruses — are so weird that their nearest relatives are still 10 percent different genetically. That makes their closest relative still pretty far away, about as far away as humans are from mushrooms, Boston said.

The Naica caves — an abandoned lead and zinc mine — are half a mile (800 meters) deep. Before drilling occurred by a mine company, the mines had been completely cut off from the outside world. Some were as vast as cathedrals with crystals lining the iron walls. They were also so hot that scientists had to don cheap versions of space suits — to prevent contamination with outside life — and had ice packs all over their bodies.

Boston said the team could only work about 20 minutes at a time before ducking to a "cool" room that was about 100 degrees (38 Celsius).

NASA wouldn't allow Boston to share her work for outside review before Friday's announcement so scientists couldn't say much. But University of South Florida biologist Norine Noonan, who wasn't part of the study but was on a panel where Boston presented her work, said it made sense.

"Why are we surprised?" Noonan said. "As a biologist I would say life on Earth is extremely tough and extremely versatile."

This isn't the oldest extreme life. Several years ago, a different group of scientists published studies about microbes that may be half a million years old and still alive. Those were trapped in ice and salt, which isn't quite the same as rock or crystal, Boston said.

The age of the Naica microbes was determined by outside experts who looked at where the microbes were located in the crystals and how fast those crystals grow.

It's not the only weird life Boston is examining. She is also studying microbes commonly found in caves in the United States, Ukraine and elsewhere that eat copper sulfate and seem to be close to indestructible.

"It's simply another illustration of just how completely tough Earth life is," Boston said.Sofia Vergara has filed papers to prevent her ex-fiancé Nick Loeb from bringing the former couple’s two frozen embryos to term.

As Page Six first reported, a suit was filed against Vergara on behalf of the embryos — which were named “Emma” and “Isabella” in the suit — in December.

TMZ reports that, on Tuesday, Vergara responded by filing court documents in LA arguing that any suit is invalid because Loeb already signed paperwork agreeing that he cannot bring the embryos to term without her consent.

The site says that the “Modern Family” actress is seeking a court order quashing Loeb’s suit, as well as money, presumably to compensate her for the legal costs she has racked up during the long debacle.

In figure skating, likewise, for years it didn’t much matter whether a skater rocked a Salchow and a triple-toe loop. They could fall behind if judges didn’t find their “compulsory figures” – where skaters actually carved numerals in the ice – crisp and accurate.

And when it comes to confirming members of President Trump’s Cabinet and other key officials, there certainly are no style points. All that matters is getting through.

The Senate just confirmed Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin 100-0. Days earlier, now-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos squeaked through after Vice President Pence broke a 50-50 tie, the first time in history on a Cabinet member vote. Both are now Cabinet secretaries.

And things are only tightening up, as majority Republicans try to push through President Trump’s remaining nominees after weeks of delay. The Senate confirmed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 53-47. There were 52-47 votes to confirm Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Tom Price as Health and Human Services secretary.

There’s another tight vote Thursday morning to confirm Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., as budget director. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., tangled with Mulvaney at his confirmation hearing over the congressman’s views on Pentagon spending and likely will vote nay.

The Senate’s also planning an early Friday afternoon vote to confirm Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, plans to vote no on Pruitt’s nomination.

There’s little turning radius here, with Republicans holding a narrow 52-48 majority. Pruitt faces a possible 51-49 vote, just like on Mulvaney. Again, they don’t award style points. But it’s unclear precisely who may be around to vote. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain planned to lead a congressional delegation of lawmakers to the annual Munich Security Conference tonight. McCain tells Fox News he’ll cut town early on his own – probably missing the Pruitt vote on Friday. It’s unclear if any other senators may bail. When asked if Pence’s services may be required due to absent senators, a senior Senate GOP leadership source replied flatly “we don’t lose votes.”

Senate Republicans have to get it right on each roll call. They can’t just stop and start all over again like Adele at the Grammys.

Senate Democrats successfully dragged out the confirmation process for multiple nominees for weeks. Senate Republicans have repeatedly executed a parliamentary maneuver to break a Democratic filibuster on most nominees. Senate rules allow opponents of a nominee up to 30 hours of debate once the body halts the filibuster.

On Monday night, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., filed cloture (an effort to end the filibuster) on the nominations of Mulvaney, Pruitt and four others. Those included the selections of Wilbur Ross to serve as Commerce secretary; Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., to become Interior secretary; Ben Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry for Energy secretary. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, predicted senators would confirm Mulvaney and Pruitt before the Senate broke for the first major congressional recess of the year. But Cornyn hoped Republicans could forge a deal with Democrats to also confirm Ross and maybe a few others.

Senate Democratic sources doubted an agreement was in the works. But never underestimate the power of the scent of jet fumes.

Things often seem intractable in the Senate just before a big recess. Then, magically, everything comes together. Senators vote and burst out of the building faster than Russian fighters buzzing U.S. destroyers in the Black Sea.

The Democrats’ tactic to protract the confirmation process helped them collect one trophy, though. Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder withdrew from consideration Wednesday. But in the end, Republicans killed Puzder’s nomination.

Fox News is told there were as many as 12 Republican senators who harbored reservations about Puzder. It quickly became apparent that Puzder couldn’t win confirmation with such tight margins in the Senate.

It’s not uncommon for new administrations to suffer a few Cabinet setbacks. President George W. Bush nominated Linda Chavez to be Labor secretary in 2001. She stepped aside over the issue of paying an undocumented immigrant to perform household chores.

President Clinton burned through two attorney general nominations in 1993 before settling on Janet Reno. Both of Clinton’s picks, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, also had household worker employment problems.

Without a big majority in the Senate and multiple close votes, it may have been inevitable that one of Trump’s nominees would implode. It was just the perfect storm for Puzder.

And so the Senate is poised to confirm Mulvaney and Pruitt in the next day or two. The confirmation votes may be close. But you don’t get style points in the Senate.

(Reporting by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)Two high-profile museums are weighing in on the debate surrounding President Trump’s temporary travel ban, barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.

In reaction to the executive order, Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Boston announced Wednesday they would be removing paintings and shroud objects in black fabric that were either created by immigrant artists or donated to the museum by immigrants to highlight foreign-made contributions.

The Davis Museum describes the de-installation as “Art-Less" -- a “protest” that began on Feb. 16 and will end on Tuesday, Feb. 21.

DISNEY RAISES TICKET PRICES AGAIN

In all, the museum says it will remove 120 works of art, including paintings, bronze and wood sculptures, ceremonial masks from Europe, the Americas, and Africa, plus contemporary and modern pieces-– about 20 percent of the art on display in the museum’s permanent galleries.

“We’re hoping to articulate the contributions of immigrants here at Davis in response to the anxiety this executive order has raised and continues to raise,” Davis Museum director Lisa Fischman told the Boston Globe. “We thought a lot about works that we have, and how they came to be here.”

The impact of “Art-Less” on the African galleries will be the most noticeable as nearly 80 percent of the galleries’ objects were donated by the Klejman family, who immigrated to the U.S. from Poland after World War II.

Claire Whitner, the museum’s assistant director of curatorial affairs who is overseeing the project, told the Globe the initiative will affect “every permanent collections gallery.”

The impacted works will be identified with labels stating either that the work was “made by an immigrant” or “given by an immigrant.” The museum is inviting other institutions to join the project, offering labels for public download on its website.

One painting scheduled to be removed over Presidents' Day weekend is a portrait of George Washington, painted by Swedish-born artist Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller. The painting was donated to the museum by the Munn family, also immigrants from Sweden.

In New York City, however, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is using a different tactic to highlight immigrants' artistic contributions.

MoMA has redesigned its fifth-floor permanent-collection galleries to feature contemporary art from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, three of the seven countries whose citizens have been subject to the ban.

According to Architectural Digest, works by Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid and Iranian artist Charles Hossein Zenderoudi have replaced pieces from renknowned artists like Picasso and Matisse. The works will be on display at the Manhattan museum for several months.

Accompanying the newly installed pieces is a statement from the museum that reads:

“This work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States, according to a presidential executive order issued on January 27, 2017. This is one of several such artworks from the Museum’s collection installed throughout the fifth-floor galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum, as they are to the United States."A military wife captured mourning her fallen Green Beret husband in a video that has gone viral is being hailed as a “patriot” by those who witnessed the heartbreaking event.

Thomas – a 35-year-old who had been deployed in Niger to help train local troops and residents in the fight against terrorism – died in a non-vehicle combat crash on Feb. 2, according to the Army Times.

He had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan seven times and earned two Bronze stars, four Good Conduct Medals and was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal for his work in central Africa, the Army Times reported. He was stationed at Fort Bragg.

Thomas was buried last week at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and is survived by his wife and four children, Fox 5 reported.

The video has more than 5 million views and Williams said Thomas reached out to her to thank her for capturing the moment.

Click for more from Fox 8.Kharon Davis has spent nearly 10 years in jail. He's had four sets of attorneys, with two judges on the bench. His co-defendants' cases have wrapped up. Davis has appeared in court for several hearings, and a new prosecutor is assigned.

But Davis has had no trial. There's been no jury, no verdict, no conviction. Police say he killed a man in a drug deal gone wrong, but he hasn't had his day in court. He's charged with capital murder and could face the death penalty. Trial dates have come and gone, and it's now scheduled for September. By then, 10 years and three months will have passed since the crime.

The Constitution guarantees suspects "the right to a speedy trial." Capital cases often take a year or longer to get to trial, but 10 years is rare — experts call it shocking and say it could be unconstitutional. Prisoner advocates and court-watchers say such delays take an exhaustive toll on suspects stuck behind bars and on victims' families, who are robbed of closure that can come from trials.

Davis' mother says her son is innocent but hasn't had the chance to prove it in court, and his health is suffering because of the long stretch in jail.

"It's like they snatched up my child, put him in a cage and threw away the key," Chrycynthia Ward Davis said.

Police say Davis, then 22, shot 29-year-old Pete Reaves inside his apartment on June 9, 2007. Davis and two friends had gone to the apartment complex to buy marijuana from someone else, prosecutors say in court records. But that person wasn't home, so the group went into Reaves' apartment, with an open door, and tried to rob him of money and drugs - that's when Davis shot him, the records say.

Davis and his friends, Kevin McCloud and Lorenzo Stacey, were all charged with capital murder. Stacey went to trial in 2009 and was acquitted; his lawyer suggested Davis pulled the trigger while Stacey was outside, according to local media reports at the time. Two years later, McCloud pleaded guilty to a lesser murder charge, avoiding the death penalty and receiving a 99-year prison sentence.

That leaves Davis. He's held without bond — typical in capital cases.

As Davis waits, so does the family of Pete Reaves.

"I want justice for my parents, for my family," his brother Alvin Reaves said. "Every time it gets set back, it's taken a big toll on them."

Lawyers — and Davis has had many — can be the crux of the timetable.

His mother first hired Benjamin Meredith, who represented her in a lawsuit after she was hit by an 18-wheeler.

Years passed, but Judge Kevin Moulton took Meredith off the case completely because his son, a police officer, had investigated the shooting.

Derek Yarbrough was appointed Davis' attorney. As Yarbrough put it, it was basically starting over. Trial was scheduled for 2014, then 2015, then 2016.

Frustrated, Davis stopped talking to Yarbrough and asked that he be dismissed.

Davis' next attorney withdrew after only a few weeks, citing a conflict of interest.

The fourth and current lead lawyer, Tommy Goggans, was appointed in June.

He'll face a new prosecutor. Longtime District Attorney Doug Valeska left office in January. The state assigned prosecutors Kenneth E. Gibbs and Stephanie C. Billingslea this month; they wouldn't comment. Judge Moulton didn't return a telephone message about the case. The case's first judge, Sidney E. Jackson, retired in 2010 and said via phone that he didn't recall too many of its details.

Davis' current lawyer wouldn't talk, either.

Today, Kharon Davis spends 23 hours a day in his cell at the county jail. He's been kept in disciplinary segregation since 2014 for fighting and for having contraband — including a sweatshirt, a book, pornography and hair cream. He's allowed visitation only from clergy and his lawyers. He hasn't seen his mother in more than a year.

This segregation is different than solitary confinement; Davis is in a cell with other inmates. Jail commander Capt. Keith Reed told the AP in a phone interview that Davis wouldn't be allowed to speak with a reporter. The AP sent a letter to Davis in jail. He hasn't responded.

Davis has enough write-ups to remain in disciplinary segregation until April 2020, Reed said.

In October, Davis handwrote a request to be returned to the jail's general population, describing segregation as "No phone calls, no visitation, no television, no sunlight nor fresh air." He sent it to his mother, but it hasn't been filed in court.

"Since being confined and forgotten for so long, the defendant has reached a state of stress and depression from missing family visits and voice communication, and had been compelled to taking medications," Davis wrote.

Four miles from the jail, at Chrycynthia Ward Davis' small brick house where she lives with her mother are photos of Kharon Davis as a child, grinning next to a Bible verse: "'I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord."

"He will say he is fine to keep me from worrying, but he is mentally torn down," Chrycynthia Ward Davis said.

But Reaves' family says Davis knows her son is alive — something they'll never have for Pete, the fun-loving, peacemaker middle child in a family of seven.

His brother Malcomb Reaves said he understands it's wrong for Davis to wait a decade to see trial, but it's also "wrong for my brother to be dead."

"His momma gets to go to a jail cell to see her son," he said. "My momma's got to go to a graveyard."

Associated Press reporter Kate Brumback contributed from Atlanta.More than 100 pounds of Marijuana have been seized at the U.S. - Mexico Border on Wednesday, according to officials with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

In a statement released Friday, the incident happened at the Port of Sasabe, about 74 miles southwest of Tucson.

Officers found the drugs hidden inside a shipment of mesquite firewood, after a narcotics-detection canine was alerted to a truck, the statement said.

The Marijuana was discovered, after officers loaded the firewood off the truck, and split them in half. The drug, according to the statement, is worth an estimated $53,000.

The person driving the truck, identified as a 41-year-old man, was reportedly turned over to officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The AP made the call about 8:45pm last night. Clinton heard the news right as she held a rally in Long Beach, California. Clinton saying, “I got to tell you, according to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do don’t we?” Hillary Clinton is the first woman to be on top of a major party’s ticket, and makes history as the presumptive nominee.

Nancy Pelosi endorsed Hillary Clinton this morning suggesting a Warren VP slot. Pelosi saying, “I’m a voter in California, and I have voted for Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States of America. I’m proud to endorse her.”

We’re also hearing Hillary Clinton will call Bernie Sanders tonight after the voting is done in California.

During our show voting will be underway in the last big “Super Tuesday,” of the campaign. Voters head to the polls in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

It looks like it could be record turnout in California where fully ¾’s of the voters who are eligible are actually registered. New Jersey also expecting big turnout. Usually CA and NJ aren’t competitive at this point in the election cycle.

Bernie Sanders sounding anything but conciliatory. His campaign almost immediately issuing a statement saying the mainstream media was in a rush to judgement. He has said he will carry on to a contested convention. Sanders is pinning all his hopes on a big win in California that would allow him to argue that superdelegates awarded to Hillary should change their minds before the convention. So far, very few superdelegates have been willing to entertain the socialist senator.

The President, meantime, is reportedly eager to join the race, and campaign for the Democratic nominee. He is expected to endorse this week, and will likely quickly join the campaign trail.

Today the President is meeting with India’s Prime Minister.

On the GOP side, Donald Trump is refusing to back down in the face of incredible pressure from the left and the right over his attacks on the judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. A leaked conference call with the Trump campaign showed that Donald Trump insisted his surrogates defend his attacks on the judge. Some Republicans are calling on Mister Trump to apologize. That appears unlikely.

On The O’Reilly Factor last night, Trump said "I don't care if the judge is Mexican or not. I'm going to do great with the Mexican people because I'll provide jobs."

Democrats in many states, and across the country have launched an apparently coordinated attack against Donald Trump over his comments about the judge.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan is set to unveil several major policy suggestions from the GOP as he continues to make efforts to unite the GOP. Ryan gave a tepid endorsement of Trump last week. This week he’ll propose an overhaul of the nation’s poverty programs.

Publicist Elaine Schock says the 83-year-old country star will perform Thursday night at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo.

Nelson missed a three-night stint in California last week, as well as shows set for New Mexico and Arizona, because of what Schock says was a terrible cold that required rest. Prior to that, he canceled two Las Vegas shows in late January but returned for the last three in early February.

The singer-songwriter is set to release a new album this spring called “God’s Problem Child.” He won a Grammy over the weekend for best traditional pop vocal album with “Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin.”

This article originally appeared in Page Six.Slightly more voters find the White House more truthful than the media, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

In addition, most feel the press is tougher on President Trump than it was on President Obama. But that may be a positive development, as a majority thinks aggressive coverage of the presidency is good for the country.

By a slim 45-42 percent margin, more voters say they trust the Trump administration to “tell the public the truth” than the reporters who cover the White House. Ten percent say neither.

READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS

The poll, released Friday, was conducted Saturday through Monday evenings. That was before Trump told reporters at a press conference Thursday, “the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.”

The Fox poll last asked a similar question in June 2006. At that time, “news reporters” were more trusted than “government officials” by a 40-25 percent margin, with 26 percent saying neither.

Some 68 percent think the press has been “tougher” on Trump than Obama. That’s more than three times the number who think reporters are giving him an “easier” time (18 percent). Another 12 percent see treatment of the two as the same.

People want tough press coverage. A majority, 55 percent, thinks it’s better for the country if the news media “cover the president aggressively.” Thirty-eight percent feel it would be better if reporters gave the president the “benefit of the doubt.”

There are the expected partisan differences. Eight in 10 Republicans (81 percent) trust the Trump administration more to tell the truth, while roughly the same portion of Democrats trust the media (79 percent). Independents are twice as likely to put their faith in Trump as the press (52-26 percent), while 16 percent say neither.

Almost all Republicans (92 percent) and most independents (74 percent) perceive coverage as tougher on Trump. Some Democrats agree: 42 percent say it’s been tougher, 34 percent easier, and 21 percent the same.

Pollpourri

Recently Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) said this on the Senate floor: “I personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully because everybody in the world pays attention to the president of the United States.” Most voters agree. Seventy-one percent think Trump “should be more careful about what he says and how he says it.”

Hatch continued, “On the other hand, I kind of find it refreshing that he doesn’t take any guff from anybody.” Twenty-eight percent of voters agree with that perspective. They like that Trump “speaks his mind.”

Over half of conservatives (55 percent) and Republicans (54 percent) want the president to be more careful when he speaks. At the same time, over half of those who voted for Trump in the election like the fact that he speaks his mind (54 percent).

Democrats aren’t nearly as forgiving: 93 percent wish Trump spoke more carefully.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 11-13, 2017. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.Best and worst celebrity beach bodies (okay mostly best)

While addressing a group of Boeing workers, the President reiterated his commitment to American workers and to creating more jobs.

“Our goal is to rely less on imports and more on products made in the U.S.A.” he said.

The President’s visit came two days after workers at the South Carolina plant voted to reject union representation. During the election, Trump handily won the strongly anti-union state, with only 1.6% of Palmetto State workers claiming union membership, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



The North Charleston plant, which opened in November 2011, is the final assembly site and delivery facility for the 787 Dreamliner. The campus sprawls 743 acres and employs 7,565 workers. As of January 2017, Boeing employed more than 120,000 Americans across nine states.

Boeing has invested more than $2 billion cumulatively in its South Carolina plant, which is the exclusive building site for the 787-10 aircraft. It also spends $355 million each year and uses hundreds of the state’s local suppliers and vendors, according to the company.

The new jetliner is 224 feet long and can hold 330 passengers; that is an extra 18 feet in length and 40 more seats more than the 787-9. Its maximum cruising speed is Mach 0.85, consistent with the two previous models. The maximum range of the 787-10 is 6,400 nautical miles. The aerospace defense company’s newest jetliner is 15 percent more fuel efficient than its competitors, according to the company.

The South Carolina factory is also the aircraft provider’s first 100% renewable energy site, with up to 20% of its energy supplied by solar panels, according to Boeing’s website.

The first delivery of the aircraft is scheduled to take place in 2018 to Singapore Airlines. Currently there are 149 orders for the newest 787 model from customers including British Airways, Air France and United Airlines (UAL).

Following Friday’s big reveal, Boeing says the jetliner will be prepared for flight testing.

Since taking office, Trump has publicly criticized Boeing, calling the company out in December for the high cost of its newest iteration of the Air Force One jet.

Since sending the tweet, the president has met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg multiple times to discuss the requirements for Air Force One.It’s widely acknowledged that the Earth was a cold, dark place after a giant meteor, measuring roughly six miles across, struck Mexico about 66 million years ago, which many believe triggered what is known as the end-Cretaceous mass extinction.

Now, new research using state-of-the-art computer simulations paints a more detailed picture of this period and how long-lasting cooling and a mixing of the oceans may have spelled the end for the dinosaurs.

The results of the new study discounted the competing theory that it was large-scale volcanic eruptions, as opposed to the meteor’s impact, that led to the extinction.

HUMAN SKULL IN MUSEUM EXHIBIT STUNS RESEARCHERS

“Our results show that the impact must have played a significant role in the mass extinction,” lead study author Julia Brugger from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Control told Fox News.

The model assumed that tiny droplets of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere caused the long-term cooling after the comet hit. It’s long been posited that it was dust particles thrown into the air from the meteor strike that lethally blocked the sun, but dust wouldn’t last long enough in the atmosphere to cool the Earth for several years. Sulfate aerosols have a longer cooling effect due to their more sustained time in the atmosphere.

“The target rock, which was struck by the asteroid, contained sulfur,” Brugger explained. “After the impact, sulfur bearing gases evaporated and formed sulfate aerosols high up in the atmosphere.”

For Brugger, the most surprising result of the study was the magnitude of the cooling. When the acid droplets blocked the sun, it caused the Earth’s surface air temperature to drop by at least 79 degrees Fahrenheit. Even the annual mean temperatures of the tropics went from 80 to 41 degrees. The global average temperature was below freezing for about three years, which was obviously bad news for life on Earth. Dinosaurs used to a tropical climate froze while their food supplies withered and died. It would take 30 years for the climate to recover from the cooling.

“This is based on basic physical laws, but I still find it fascinating that an accident like this asteroid impact can completely change climate for a couple of years,” Brugger said. “It really illustrates how fragile our climate system is.”

Another surprise was the meteor impact’s disruption of ocean circulation. The ice caps expanded and surface waters cooled down, becoming denser and heavier. While these cooler water masses sank into the depths, warmer water from deeper ocean layers rose to the surface. The warmer waters carried nutrients that likely led to massive blooms of algae that may have been toxic.

THIS BAG-LIKE THING IS YOUR ANCESTOR

“The model simulations of our study allow us to observe a disturbance of the ocean circulation and this leads to a nutrient transport to the surface ocean,” Brugger said. “This could have caused an algal bloom and it is conceivable that these algal blooms produced toxic substances, further affecting life at the coasts.”

This toxic algae– as well as sulfuric acid from the meteor strike mixing into the oceans– might’ve been what led to the deaths of marine life, which would include creatures like the ammonites (marine mollusk animals). Creatures living on the coast would have been greatly affected as well.

While the comet strike likely meant the end for the dinosaurs, it did make way for the evolution of the human species. And though extinction was cold and dark for the prehistoric creatures, it’ll likely be quite toasty for us.

“It's a certain irony that today the most immediate threat is not from natural cooling but from human-made global warming,” Brugger said.Airlines may be charging more to check luggage today, but one flier allegedly resorted to extreme measures to avoid paying an excess fee.

On Sunday, a male traveler was apprehended by the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, India after metal detectors revealed he was concealing gold bars weighing 1.2 kilograms (about 2 pounds) inside his rectum, according to the Times of India.

The 36-year-old smuggler, originally from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was arriving from Singapore when officials noticed something unusual in his body. He was taken in for questioning by customs staff who flagged his checked luggage after they spotted what appeared to be LED lamps inside his bag.

Officials opened the lamps and discovered eight gold bars, weighing roughly 800 grams, hidden inside the back covers of the lighting equipment.

Upon further questioning, the suspect was asked whether he had more gold, and, after submitting to a metal detector screening, officials found an additional 1.2 kilograms of gold bars inside the man’s rectal cavity.

In all, the man was hiding 2 kilograms of gold-- nearly 4-and-a-half pounds-- worth about $88,000.
