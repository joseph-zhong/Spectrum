The NFL season reaches its conclusion in Houston on Sunday when the New England Patriots take on the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. The Patriots are appearing in their seventh title game since 2002, having won four championships in those years, while Atlanta has never won a Super Bowl and have appeared in the title game just once beforeWhen weary hikers stop for a thermos of tea and a sandwich on the sheltered beach at Damper Bay on the fringes of Lake Wanaka, many feel they’ve arrived in paradise.

The hilly outcrop covered in golden tussock and native trees boasts uninterrupted views, across sometime placid waters, of New Zealand’s snow-capped Southern Alps.

It is an ancient landscape imbued with a natural sense of drama, where the stars blaze bright every night and the nearest town has no traffic lights. At 18,000kms from London and 23 hours by plane from New York, you are reliably at the end of the world – but also an eight-minute drive from a supermarket that stocks duck confit and chilled Veuve Cliquot.



“It’s in the back of everybody’s mind at the moment. If there are, shall we say, changes, where can we go?” says Michael Nock, a Hong Kong-based hedge-fund manager who has a luxury, multimillion-dollar bolthole in nearby Queenstown.



“I researched this problem dispassionately and settled on New Zealand … it is a small community that has the ability to be self-reliant, with a rule of law based on the English system. And it is stunningly beautiful – it ticked all the boxes. ”



Walking along the eastern shores of Lake Wanaka, you pass the buzzing yacht club and Eely Point picnic grounds, where toddlers paddle in the freezing shallows, chilled year-round by glacial runoff.



Next, a long stretch of luxurious homes known to locals as “millionaires’ row” sprawls for kilometres along the lake’s edge, snaking around Beacon Point.



Wonderful Wanaka Wonderful Wanaka

These multimillion-dollar homes are reliably kept in immaculate condition – with tightly clipped green lawns and filtered duck ponds. But month after month, sometimes year after year, many of the windows stay shuttered against the mountain views, and the doors tightly bolted.



According to the 2013 census, more than half of Wanaka’s 2,781 homes are unoccupied.



“We’ve got quite a lot of billionaires in the district,” says Queenstown Lakes mayor Jim Boult, whose region is home to just 1% of New Zealand’s 4.5 million population.



“There are a number of billionaires and many multi-, multi-millionaires. In the main they are enormously valuable to our district, they come to our town and spend enormous amounts of money on their property and employ lots of people. In general, they are significant contributors to good works in the community.”



Driving to the world-heritage listed Mount Aspiring national park from Wanaka has become a road-trip through the property portfolios of the global elite.



“There are a number of people who want to create a bolthole in the southern hemisphere, that’s away from some of the problems facing the western world,” says Terry Spice, the managing director of Luxury Real-Estate New Zealand, who has sold at least one property to a concerned American post-Trump.

“I would say there has been a significant increase in inquiry, but it is not just from the US. The situation in the US is making people elsewhere consider their options, and how their part of the world might be affected.”



At the beginning of the Wanaka-Mount Aspiring Road is Trade-Me founder Sam Morgan’s NZ$25m (£14.4m) Hillend Station, on the flanks of Mount Alpha.



To the left is property owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire PayPal co-founder and Trump adviser who controversially gained New Zealand citizenship, allowing him to buy sensitive land without overseas investment office approval.



Four kilometres along, in Glendhu Bay, is Motatapu Station (NZ$21.5m). For many years it was the high-country retreat of pop star Shania Twain, and is still owned by her ex-husband, South-African record producer Robert “Mutt” Lange.



“I started designing a homestead for us shortly after we bought it and began putting my heart, soul and dreams into the plans,” wrote Twain in her memoir From This Moment On.



“I dreamed of riding horses across the vast plains, along winding riverbanks and through golden tussocks in the sharp, beaming sunshine of the land of the Kiwi.”



For sale signs dot either side of the narrow, two-lane road, advertising luxury, multimillion-dollar properties on land that for decades prior has been the stomping ground of shepherds, sheep and locals picnicking on the lake’s sandy shore.

With a NZ$30m private hospital in the pipeline, international airport and a plethora of pampering options (there are more than 40 hair and beauty salons in the region, and dozens of vineyards), the Queenstown Lakes district has long drawn the admiration of the world’s privileged.



But in an unpredictable post-Brexit, neo-Trump world, their interest has cranked up a notch, and some locals are growing concerned at being engulfed by exceptional wealth, turning their once egalitarian farming towns into part-time playgrounds for the moneyed few.

While prime land is gobbled up by the mega-rich, community groups such as the Residents Association are on “the verge of collapse”, according to Wanaka locals, because of a lack of volunteers and funding.



“We’ve only got $7,000 in the bank and we’re battling businessmen who can spend millions to get whatever they want,” says Julian Haworth, secretary of the Upper Clutha Environmental Society for the last 22 years.



“It is almost impossible, all we have are our brains and our local contacts and our knowledge of the resource plan. That is our only advantage.”



Haworth locked horns 10 years ago with the then-owners of Thiel’s Damper Bay land, and was successful in reducing the approved number of building sites from six to one.



New Zealand’s national hiking trail – the Te Araroa trail – runs alongside the lake boundary of Thiel’s property, and the environment group was concerned the hiking trail and “exceptional natural landscape” of the region would be spoilt by gaudy, oversized mansions.



“Anybody who is linked to Trump is bad news … we want people who play by the rules, and believe in the philosophy of a fair-go for every New Zealander,” says Haworth, regarding Thiel’s citizenship



“Increasingly Wanaka is becoming a self-interested community that is motivated by money, and that is the polar opposite of the peaceful town I moved to nearly 30 years ago.”



Currently there are three high-country stations for sale in the Queenstown Lakes, with the overseas investment office (OIO) granting approval for the sale of Hunter Valley station to an overseas owner – reportedly an American businessman – on 9 February.

A second station, farmed by the same family since 1912, may also need OIO approval, although the agent could not confirm at this stage.



For overseas buyers wanting to purchase land or property in New Zealand, applying for an investor visa is relatively straightforward provided money is no object.

The investor visa stipulates that applicants can gain permanent residency in New Zealand by investing NZ$1.5m over a four-year-period and spending a minimum of 146 days in New Zealand for three of the four years of the investment period.

Another visa for the exceptionally wealthy is even easier, requiring applicants to spend a minimum of 44 days in New Zealand for the last two years of the three-year NZ$10m investment period.

Last year’s release of the Panama Papers also identified New Zealand as a significant tax-haven, with Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca identifying New Zealand as a good place to set up foreign trusts and avoid tax.

“It is bizarre, what has happened here,” says Randall Aspinall, a sheep farmer who lives in the the Matukituki Valley, 30km up the road from Thiel.



“Most of the foreign-owned stations are still farmed, sort of, but it is fairly easy to tell if it is a priority, or a sort of hobby,” he says.

“Overseas buyers purchasing our prime farming land has made it harder for Kiwis to go farming and stay farming, and it has pushed the price of farming land up hugely. I have strong reservations regarding the sale of the high-country farms, especially when it’s to people who are never home.”



After the 2008 global financial crisis, Hong Kong-based Nock hired a helicopter to scour New Zealand looking for a bolthole. He found one – in Queenstown.



At Nock’s place overlooking Lake Hayes, where he now spends three or four months a year, the quality of life is high and the pace gentle, something he values after decades as a self-described “global citizen”.



Since Brexit and Trump, Nock routinely fields queries from wealthy friends and colleagues interested in purchasing a “back-up” like his.



And he heartily recommends the Queenstown lakes, where he says you can easily “blend in”, and the Pinot Noir is among the best in the world.



But unlike the transient millionaires who are increasingly calling the region home, Nock has strong ties with the local community, which includes offering an art studio for locals to use, and a residency for international and Kiwi artists.



“My feeling is you want to be giving into the community, not just flying in and flying out,” says Nock. “Because then you really become a part of it, then you really put some roots down.”In the first of a our three-part series Speak your Mind, we meet Sheeva, 24, who was raped at university. It took her four years of panic attacks, anxiety and depression to accept that she was not to blame for what had happened and that she could not have stopped it. She now supports victims of crime, including domestic and sexual violence, through the aftermath of a traumatic eventCircles within circles. It’s been 15 years since The Ring, Gore Verbinski’s American translation of the cult Japanese horror Ringu, which means an entire generation of westerners might not have been scared or bored to death by the sight of lank-haired spooks emerging from the gogglebox. This update for the era of iPhones and .MOV files has very quickly to acknowledge that the VHS players that perpetuated this curse circa the millennium are now practically occult items, less likely to be found occupying cherished home-cinema space than collecting dust, along with Ouija boards in junkshops.

Ghost in the system: has technology ruined horror films? Read more

Another key shift: where Verbinski’s redo could star a thirtysomething Naomi Watts, the refresh retools the material for those college kids who have come to overrun multiplexes in the past decade and a half. Yet – given how much of this legend has been unspooled – it’s miraculous that the presiding script committee have alighted upon an at least semi-involving mystery. This centres on the inquiries of young Julia (appealing Ellen Page-alike Matilda Lutz) into her errant boyfriend’s participation in an extracurricular research project overseen by Professor Gabriel (Johnny Galecki, nicely ambiguous) – a tangent that slyly suggests this phenomenon might merit further study.

Director F Javier Gutiérrez has evidently parsed every thesis going on The Ring Series and Female Sexuality; but he also has fun with the franchise’s organising visual conceit (stalled Mac cursors, AA circles) and handles the setpieces with quiet aplomb. The admirably loopy finale, involving blind Vincent d’Onofrio’s swarming army of cicadas, is worthy of one of the better Exorcist sequels. But we are a world away from the quiet culture shock of Ringu, which lurked in far-flung corners of video shops and the rep circuit; this offshoot is essentially a well-produced, easily accessed B-movie. Still, it wouldn’t kill you to watch it, and it does more than expected to reinvent its particular wheel.Republican Senator John McCain, who has in the past been critical of new president Donald Trump, speaks at a security conference in Munich, Germany and says that Nato’s founders would be alarmed by society’s growing unwillingness to “separate truth from lies”. Referencing Trump directly, McCain also admitted that the new administration is in “disarray” but pledged to speak up when he disagrees with actions Trump is takingThomas Countryman was on his way to Rome for an international meeting on nuclear weapons on Wednesday when he found out he had been summarily removed from his position. The senior diplomat turned around and got on the first flight back to Washington.

It was a sudden and unceremonious end to 35 years as a foreign service officer, the last four months of it as the acting undersecretary for arms control and international security. But Countryman was not alone. The Trump White House carried out an abrupt purge of the state department’s senior leadership last week, removing key officials from posts that are essential to the day-to-day running of the department and US missions abroad.

Donald Trump's first week: carnage, both real and imagined | Tom McCarthy Read more

The purge has left a gaping hole at the heart of US diplomacy: the incoming secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has yet to be confirmed and the Trump team has not named candidates to fill several levels of leadership under him. Its only nominations so far have been ambassadors to China and Israel. All further nominees to senior posts will take months of security vetting and confirmation.

It is not clear whether Tillerson, a former chief executive of the ExxonMobil oil company, had been informed of the purge. When he does arrive on “Mahogany Row”, he will find a line of empty offices along the wood-panelled seventh floor of the state department, where its leadership works.

“As a career diplomat, I experienced many transitions and never saw anything like this dangerous purge of public servants now underway at State,” former ambassador Laura Kennedy tweeted.

The motives behind the sudden wave of sackings are unclear. Some of the outgoing diplomats saw it as one more sign of chaos from a new administration that is desperately short of experience. Others saw it as a wrecking operation, aimed at debilitating the state department at a time of upheaval: while the White House planned its ban on entry for people from a list of Muslim countries, and while Trump frames a new foreign policy before Tillerson arrives in his post.

In the past, the state department has been asked to set up early foreign contacts for an incoming administration. This time however it has been bypassed, and Trump’s immediate circle of Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Reince Priebus are making their own calls. The state department was not asked for help arranging Theresa May’s visit, according to a former official.

Countryman’s position was especially sensitive. He was acting as “undersecretary T”, the official required to sign off on US arms sales or security assistance abroad, and the person charged with negotiating, implementing and verifying international arms control agreements and international security.

“The world doesn’t stop turning just because there is a new US administration,” said Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a global security advocacy group. “There is an entire global arms regime to maintain. Without US leadership, decisions won’t get made or will get taken in ways that harm our national security. The machinery is still there [in the state department], but there is no one in the cockpit.”

Among the other top officials to be removed from their positions were Patrick Kennedy, undersecretary for management; Michele Bond, who was in charge of US consuls around the world; Joyce Barr, assistant secretary of state for administration; and Gentry Smith, the head of the office on foreign missions.

David Robinson, the assistant secretary of state for conflict stabilisation operations, also received a letter telling him to pack up his desk and leave, according to Jon Finer, who was John Kerry’s chief of staff.

All were long-serving career officials who had been promoted to high rank equivalent to political appointees. The acting state department spokesman, Mark Toner, pointed out that as political appointees they were routinely expected to submit their resignations.

Although that is true, it is also customary for such officials to stay in positions until their replacements are ready to step in, for the sake of continuity. In this case, there are no replacements on the horizon.

The second fact that distinguishes the Trump purge from previous transitions was the abrupt nature with which it was carried out, giving officials who had dedicated lives to the foreign service just a few days to clear their desks.

“This is no way to treat people who have served under Democrats and Republicans, who have been unstintingly loyal to their country and their government,” said Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of state for political affairs in the last Bush administration. “They deserve respect for their service to the country, especially in the manner in which they are asked to leave.”

According to state department officials who have just left, those in leadership roles had submitted their formal resignations to the Trump transition team well before the inauguration. But the team appeared to have ignored those letters until Wednesday, when instructions appear to have come from the White House to act on them.

The transition team Trump has sent to the state department has shown little interest in policy issues. Departments covering large regions of the world say they have had no contact with his representatives.

When Daniel Baer, the former US ambassador to the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna, was preparing to leave this month, he offered to visit Washington to brief the transition team. Such briefings are part of an outgoing ambassador’s duties – they are laid out in the state department’s foreign affairs manual – and there were sensitive issues to discuss, including the upcoming renewal of the team monitoring the Ukraine conflict. Baer was told his parting advice would not be required.

“I worry about a know-nothing approach to foreign policy,” he said. “The whole thing can’t be done by shooting from the hip. There is a responsibility you have to the citizens you are governing to make an effort to have the information on which decisions are made.

“If I were in the transition, I would not want to scatter 60 ambassadors to the winds. I would want to hear what is going on in their regions, I would want to know where the bodies are buried.”Donald Trump’s new nominee for labor secretary oversaw the justice department’s civil rights division at a time when the division was widely attacked for making politically motivated enforcement decisions, and he was personally singled out in an inspector general’s report for failing to closely supervise a subordinate who was accused of illegally politicizing the hiring process.

Trump’s new nominee, Alexander Acosta, is the dean of the Florida International University College of Law and the former US attorney for the southern district of Florida. He is Trump’s selection to replace Andrew Puzder, whose nomination foundered after accusations of alleged wrongdoing in his businesses and personal life.

But Acosta’s record is not without its own potential sticking points. From August 2003 to June 2005, Acosta served as the assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department’s civil rights division. During that time, the division was roundly accused of a lax approach to racial bias and voting rights and of taking the politics of a lawyer into consideration when hiring new attorneys and assigning or transferring cases.

Alexander Acosta: Trump pick for labor secretary is Muslim-defending Hispanic Read more

Those accusations became the subject of hearings on Capitol Hill and a 2008 joint investigation by the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility, which singled out Acosta personally for a failure of oversight. Acosta, the investigation concluded, had failed to act on “red flags” about the conduct of his subordinate in charge of hiring.

The employee, Bradley Schlozman, was ultimately hauled before a congressional committee on charges that he had used political affiliations in vetting potential civil rights attorneys.

Federal law prohibits the use of political or ideological affiliation to evaluate candidates for the justice department’s career attorney positions.

The OIG report that chastised Acosta concluded that Schlozman distinguished between “right-thinking Americans” and “libs” or “commies” when hiring new attorneys, and that Acosta was aware that Schlozman had forwarded a racially insensitive email around the office.

Despite his own misgivings about Schlozman, the report said, Acosta did nothing to prevent Schlozman from becoming his replacement when he left the civil rights division.

In an email, Schlozman said: “I strongly disagree with the preposterous allegations leveled by the highly partisan inspector general back in 2008, most of which have been refuted.” He provided the link to a Weekly Standard article which disputed many of the report’s claims.

“I’d also note that the Obama DoJ’s civil rights division engaged in politicized hiring at a level exponentially worse than anything I was even accused of,” he said. “Battling the unprofessional attorneys who populated much of the Division during my tenure was a herculean task, but I am extremely proud of my tenure there.”

Acosta reads as an odd selection for Trump’s cabinet. He has been outspoken in his defense of Muslim Americans and their religious civil liberties, criticizing policies that prohibit headscarfs. And unlike many Trump picks, his résumé is one of a career civil servant. Acosta has clerked for the conservative US supreme court justice Samuel Alito, served on the National Labor Relations Board, and worked as a federal prosecutor.

Still, his 2003 appointment to lead the civil rights division elicited mixed feelings from civil rights groups. “There is no broad-based support for Acosta among civil rights groups, as of yet,” Nancy Zirkin, of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said at the time. “Several organizations are expressing concern.”

The Bush administration enacted policies that seemed to make politicized hiring inevitable. In 2002, the then attorney general, John Ashcroft, disbanded the hiring committees made up of veteran career attorneys and placed the authority to hire with political appointees. A year later, Acosta issued a memo within the civil rights division that further reduced the ability of career civil servants to vet potential hires.

The changes took their toll. From 2003 to 2006, only 42% of new hires in the Civil Rights Division had civil rights experience, compared with 77% of new hires in the two years prior, according to an investigation by the Boston Globe.

The Globe report, for which reporters obtained hundreds of pages of hiring data from an open records request, also found that the new hires’ credentials skewed political. Eleven out of 45 lawyers hired in that period were members of the Federalist Society, a conservative thinktank, and seven were members of the Republican National Lawyers Association.

During the same time period, the Globe reported, the civil rights division brought far fewer voting rights cases or cases involving employment bias against black people than before, and more cases alleging discrimination against white people or Christians. Morale among career civil rights attorneys became so low, some complained to the Globe, that a 2005 buyout offered led to 63 resignations – twice the average number since the late 1990s.

“The clear emphasis has been to hire individuals with conservative credentials,” Jon Greenbaum, a career civil rights attorney, told the Globe. Greenbaum left in 2003. “If anything, a civil rights background is considered a liability.”

David Becker, a career voting rights attorney who accepted the buyout in 2005, told the Globe that the division replaced lawyers like him with “inexperienced ideologues, virtually none of which have any civil rights or voting rights experiences”.

It was during these turbulent years that Acosta oversaw the civil rights division and delegated hiring to two subordinates who were later accused of improperly considering applicants’ political or ideological affiliations.



Acosta gave final authority on hiring to Sheldon Bradshaw, his primary deputy assistant attorney general, who in turn turned over most hiring decisions to another deputy, Schlozman.

According to several members of the division who spoke to investigators, Schlozman ran the hiring process with little oversight or scrutiny.

Schlozman and his superior frequently referred to applicants they favored as being “good American”, “fine American”, “right-thinking American”, or being “on the team”, which investigators concluded were codewords for conservative. To describe applicants or career civil rights attorneys he didn’t like, investigators said, Schlozman used the terms “libs” and “commies”.

A Washington Post investigation reported that Schlozman had transferred three minority women out of their positions over their supervisors’ objections to “make room for some good Americans”. While he denied those reports, Schlozman conceded, in testimony to a congressional committee, that he often bragged of hiring conservative lawyers.

The inspector general’s investigation did not establish whether Acosta knew about the signs that Schlozman was engaged in political hiring. And Acosta claimed that no one approached him with complaints of inappropriate hiring practices.

But at least one official claimed that she complained to Acosta that Schlozman had hired as her deputy “an applicant whom she considered unqualified even for a line attorney position”. The official, special litigation chief Shanetta Cutlar, told investigators that Acosta brushed her off. Acosta claimed he did not recall the conversation. He did, however, recall having a discussion in December 2004 with a different section chief about Schlozman’s management style.

Acosta was also aware that in August 2004, Schlozman had mass-forwarded an email containing a racist joke, writing: “Y’all will appreciate [this].” In the email, a colleague said he liked his coffee “Mary Frances Berry style – black and bitter”. Berry was the former chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Acosta claimed he demanded a written apology from Schlozman for forwarding the email, although investigators never found such an apology when they searched Schlozman’s correspondence.

Overall, Acosta acknowledged to investigators that he was aware of potential problems with Schlozman’s conduct and formed his own concerns. But Acosta, investigators concluded, did not alert anyone in the justice department of his concerns. In fact, after Acosta left the civil rights division in 2005, Schlozman served as his acting replacement for five months before becoming an interim US attorney.

It was not until 2007 that Acosta took any action to prevent Schlozman from obtaining a position of power. At that time, Acosta claims, he helped stymie Schlozman’s hiring as director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys.

A White House spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Cutlar, who held her position until 2010, could not be reached.‘I saw irony in that people were learning English to alleviate poverty, but they needed $1,000 to get out of poverty,’ he saysThe Artist and their City, episode 2

The booming industry needs English speakers to service US customers, and the US president seems set to oblige with a deportation force that could banish record numbers of Americanized Mexicans south of the border.

“That’s a huge pool of talent for us,” said Joe Andere, executive vice-president of Americas Survey Company (ASC), which with its sister company Voxcentrix has 450 call center stations in Tijuana. “We’re looking for people at the moment. All the companies are.”

Employing native English speakers who understand American culture gives Mexican call centers an edge over rivals in India and the Philippines in a competitive, billion-dollar global industry.

Call centers here already employ thousands of people deported under the Obama administration. They do market research, sales and technical support for companies such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Toyota. Their English can be so fluent and idiomatic that customers assume they are in the US.

Trump's Mexico bashing may backfire if peso plunge forces poor migrants north Read more

Luis Vargas Salazar, 53, a former marine deported in 2014 after 51 years in the US, is due to start a call center job this week. “I aced the tests,” he said. “I scored so high on all the English exams they signed me up straight away.”

Call centers post flyers on the noticeboards of migrant shelters where deportees usually spend their first nights after expulsion. The flyers promise dollar commissions, bonuses and benefits, such as free coffee and cookies. Wages, however, are low – about $100 a week.

From just a handful a decade ago, there are now more than 50 call centers employing more than 10,000 people just in Tijuana, a sprawling city abutting a border wall beyond which lies San Diego.

“We’re fighting for the same pool of people so we have to refine our retention strategies. Wages are going up,” Andere said. “The industry is growing every single day.” About 80% of his agents are bilingual – and of those, most were deported.

If Trump keeps a promise to swiftly deport 3 million undocumented people, possibly followed by millions more, it will benefit call centers, the executive said. “Absolutely.”

The upbeat view contrasted with the anxiety gripping immigrant communities around the US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids swept up 680 people last week, sparking grassroots resistance and vows to block future deportations.

Mass expulsions could undermine a separate Trump election promise to curb the outsourcing of call center jobs. Seven Democratic senators have lobbied the president to ban federal contractors from offshoring such posts.

Mexico, however, is far cheaper than the US. If the country gets more native English speakers, US corporations will be even more tempted to outsource such work.

Call centers can be a lifeline for deportees who arrive broke, disorientated and disconnected from families in the US. Some of those who left Mexico as infants barely remember the country or speak Spanish.

“Everything was new. It was a new world,” said Oscar Ortega, 47, who left four children behind in Duarte, California. He struggled to adapt to life in Tijuana. “I was used to how the [US] runs things. I didn’t know anything about Mexico.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Oscar Ortega, a Tijuana call center worker who was deported from the US: ‘Everything was new. It was a new world.’ Photograph: Rory Carroll for the Guardian

Ortega has been a survey supervisor with ASC since 2009. “It’s been my family.” Spending eight hours a day in a cubicle with a headset, talking to strangers across the US, nurtured a connection with his old life. “It makes me feel closer to things over there. I still feel American.”

Jaime Castaneda, 37, was in diapers when his family crossed illegally from Mexico, so being dumped back in 2008 – he was convicted of drug possession – came as a shock. “I was in denial for a while.” He said he enjoys doing customer satisfaction surveys but plans to appeal the deportation next year, when he will have completed a decade out of the US.

It makes me feel closer to things over there. I still feel American Oscar Ortega

Trying to bypass border security was a dumb move likely to end in capture and jail, Castaneda said. “They have drones, infrared. If you’re smart, you get with the program here, do the nine-to-five.”

Some call center agents, however, do attempt to sneak back into the US, said Ramses St Martin, 32, a supervisor. “Some guys will go missing for a couple of days, trying to cross, then they get caught and deported and show up here again.”

Many deportees committed minor offenses, such as driving under the influence, but some match Trump’s depiction of “bad hombres” – they are men convicted of serious crimes.

Call centers in El Salvador employ so many former gang members they are nicknamed “homieland”, according to the New Yorker.

Salazar, the former marine, spent 14 years in jail for sexual assault. He said he was a born-again Christian who had repented and hoped to return, pardoned and forgiven. Meanwhile, he planned to use his gift of the gab to engage strangers on the phone. “I’m looking forward to it. I like to talk and I like to help people.”

Andere, the executive, said companies vetted employees and banned pen, paper and cellphones from work stations to prevent theft of credit card details and other sensitive information.

Deportees were overwhelmingly honest, dedicated workers, he said. “We were the first to employ people with tattoos. We saw past it. It doesn’t matter how you look.

Officials in El Paso, Texas, said that the detention of the woman moments after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents watched a judge grant her a protective order was an alarming development that had sent shockwaves through the community.

The woman has been a victim of violence by her partner on at least three occasions, has filed three police reports and endured punching, kicking, choking and having a knife thrown at her, Jo Anne Bernal, the El Paso county attorney, said on a conference call with reporters.

As the protective order was granted on 9 February, Bernal said, an Ice agent sat through the proceedings in the courtroom. Two federal agents were placed at exits, she said. After the end of the hearing, agents escorted the woman from the courtroom area on the 10th floor and out of the building. She is presently in the county jail.

“None of us can recall an incident where immigration authorities made their presence known inside a courtroom in this courthouse, and especially not in a courtroom that is reserved for victims of domestic violence,” Bernal said. “We need to be very firm in our voice: the courthouse is not a place for enforcement of immigration law, the courthouse is a place where victims of domestic violence come for protection.”

Jaime Esparza, the local district attorney, said: “They came into the courthouse and I think it sends a horrible message to victims of domestic violence on whether or not they’re actually going to have the ability to seek justice in our courthouse.”

Michelle Ortiz, deputy director of Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Florida-based group, said such arrests threatened to undo decades of bridge-building work between immigrant communities, their supporters, and law enforcement.

“Enforcement action like this one, I mean, it takes us back 30 years and it’s terrifying because we do so much outreach and community events with law enforcement trying to get the word out that this is safe, and in your home country it might not be safe, and in your home country there is corruption and there is law enforcement that does not care about domestic violence and is not going to protect women – but you’re in the United States now, where everyone is protected regardless of immigration status,” she said.

“And I’m really afraid that we won’t be able to say that any more. It’s disheartening and frankly it’s terrifying.”

“It will make our communities less safe because it will make immigrants afraid to come forward to report crime,” said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of Raices, a Texas-based immigrant legal aid group.

“We’ve been working with undocumented victims of domestic violence for 30 years. They’re always afraid to come forward because their entire life has reaffirmed that they should fear authority, that they should fear men, and they don’t have rights. That’s the process by which they have become so chronically abused and these stories feed into what is already a long-term pervasive narrative among survivors of violence, that no one cares about them.”

El Paso, a city of about 675,000 in far west Texas, borders the bigger Mexican city of Juárez and has a large undocumented population. County officials suspect Ice acted on a tip-off from her alleged abuser, since he was the only other person given written notice of the hearing.

But in a statement, Ice said that the woman was arrested on a felony charge of illegally re-entering the US “after receiving a tip from another law enforcement agency indicating that a previously deported felon had illegally re-entered the United States”.

According to Ice’s criminal complaint, reported by the El Paso Times,

the woman is a Mexican citizen who has been deported repeatedly and has a criminal history. It says that Ice agents were “conducting surveillance” at the courthouse “in attempts of seeing” her, then took the woman into custody when she walked out. Bernal said that video footage indicated that her detention began inside the building.

Nearly 700 people were detained last week in a series of Ice operations in cities from Los Angeles to New York, homeland security secretary John Kelly said in a statement on Monday.

Many did not have criminal convictions and appeared to have been picked up by officials initially seeking someone else, adding to alarm among advocates who are worried that the government is now pursuing a less targeted strategy than under Barack Obama. While his administration deported large numbers of unauthorised immigrants, Obama pledged that “felons, not families” would be the priority.

Last week, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two who was convicted of using a fake social security number in 2008, went to a regularly scheduled meeting with immigration officials in Phoenix, Arizona, and was detained, then deported. Agents had previously allowed her to remain in the country under supervision.

“We are hoping that this is an isolated incident,” Bernal, the El Paso county attorney, said. “We are fearful that it is not.”An understandably forgotten mini-trend in the 80s was the strange idea to set horror films in gyms. Granted, the decade was generally monopolized by a sudden obsession with working out, but audiences weren’t that pumped with the prospect of seeing sweaty youths get crushed to death by weight-training equipment in films like Death Spa and Killer Workout.

While three decades on, gym culture is still a dominant force, it’s been joined by a rather smug obsession with wellness, a somewhat vague term encompassing a mixture of healthy living, spiritual oneness and spa treatments. There’s something undeniably creepy and cultish about the industry its spawned, the promise of peace and well-being without a solid idea of how you’ll be getting there. It turns out, if this rather loopy new thriller is to be believed, it requires some nasty eels, Jason Isaacs and a lot of water.

In his first major lead role, Chronicle’s Dane DeHaan plays Lockhart, a workaholic exec tasked with heading to a remote wellness center in Switzerland to bring back the company’s CEO. The grand and initially calming estate grows increasingly frustrating with the staff eerily unhelpful and the facility’s director Volmer, played by Isaacs, is annoyingly insistent that Lockhart needs some rest. After a shock car accident leaves him injured, he’s left with no other option than to stay and find out what the cure for wellness really is.



One of the many dispiriting problems with the horror genre today is a frustrating lack of ambition. If it’s not a remake, a reboot or a sequel then it’s a derivative exercise in formula-rehashing with notes so predictable, that even the twists feel inevitable. So there’s something to praise here, right off the bat, as writer/director Gore Verbinski (who proved his mettle in the genre with the surprisingly effective Ringu remake) and co-writer Justin Haythe have crafted something quite extravagant, equal parts mystery and horror, that feels like it’s a product of another era when audiences could be trusted to remain enthralled without the need for constant jump scares.

It’s a folly reminiscent of Crimson Peak, Guillermo del Toro’s attempt to make a studio-funded gothic throwback horror, but like that film, this deserves more points for what it’s trying to do rather than actually achieving. The anti-climactic opening plays things a little too safe while the slow build before nastiness is ultimately far too slow. The film runs for 146 minutes, a running time usually reserved for worthy Oscar contenders about war, and not once does it justify such an excessive length, only serving to show up the script’s inadequacies, thinly written characters and noticeably large plot holes.

While there’s a refreshingly minimal use of aggressive sound effects to put audiences on edge, they’ve been replaced by an over-egged atmosphere filled with creepiness layered on so thick that it’s hard to believe that anyone would spend more than five minutes at the center without making a sharp exit. As the nefarious plot ultimately unfolds, it’s far battier than one could have imagined and in an attempt to make up for the slow burn the finale changes gear entirely, opting for full-on crazy rather than creepy. It’s not helped by Isaacs who plays his character with such obviously sinister overtones from the start, he might as well be called Dr Evil.

DeHaan emerges with more respect, his performance echoing a slightly less complex take on Leonardo DiCaprio’s similarly stranded character in Shutter Island. His palpable fear adds a clammy unease to some of the more effective skin-crawling moments, involving the aforementioned eels but also a rather horrific visit to the dentist. There’s support too from Nymphomaniac’s Mia Goth, who is compelling to watch but stuck with a one-note role, and also Celia Imrie, who has fun as a crossword-obsessed patient.

There are flashes of greatness here and credit is due for its desire to be distinguishable from the pack but tonally, it’s too messy, maniacally veering from elegant restraint to unhinged hokum and the absurd running time doesn’t befit what’s ultimately a rather hollow campfire tale. There’s hope for the ailing horror genre yet, but this is far from the cure.Felsőtárkány, Hungary

It stars Casey Affleck as Lee, a guy who lives on his own in Boston, working as a janitor and seething with poisonous rage at the world and himself. Lee returns to his hometown after the death of his brother Joe to find to his astonishment that he is now legal guardian of Joe’s teenage son.

Manchester by the Sea: how Matt Damon and brutal honesty helped make 2017's most affecting film Read more

This is about life as it is lived in the real world, with unassuageable pain, loose ends untied, life lessons unlearned. Life with no narrative closure. Lee bears the burden of a terrible tragedy, which explains his exile from the place where he grew up; the current situation appears to offer the familiar trope of an unsympathetic guy poignantly redeemed by the responsibility of parenthood and odd-couple friendship with the quasi-child. Yet things don’t work out anywhere near as cleanly as that.

This film has already been hailed as a masterpiece and I think it is, though of a more conventional kind than Lonergan’s previous movie, Margaret. Manchester By the Sea sees him assume the self-aware weightiness of an Arthur Miller or a Eugene O’Neill, but blends this with some wonderfully played comic scenes, and even uses some trad jazz over a scene transition that is rather like Woody Allen. And as in Seinfeld, there is no hugging or learning. After a fire-related disaster, Lee still manages almost to burn the house down by falling asleep with a pan on the stove. It is a brilliant moment of abject horror.

The Massachusetts hometown of the title looms oppressively over Lee. It is a port dominated by the fishing industry. There is no seaside, no beach. It is a place of work. Yet the nearest that Lee comes to smiling is when he goes out on his brother’s boat. When Lee gets word that he must come back, it is an almost primeval confrontation. To use his own phrase, it is as if he must “beat” this place and what happened here. Lee once lived in Manchester By the Sea with his wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and their kids; his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) lived there with his own wife Elise (Gretchen Mol). They had a boy, Patrick, played by Ben O’Brien as a little kid; Lucas Hedges makes a tremendous troubled 16-year-old Patrick in the present day. Both Lee and Joe came to be separated from their wives.

Anger pulses from Lee’s thin, shrewd face, with clenched teeth that resemble angry little white squares like tiny tiles. And anger radiates also from the grumpy tenants whose apartments he has to fix. He sees them at their grumpiest, absorbs the feeling and sweats it from his pores. Affleck compresses and dams and forces the anger, anger that can’t quite find release in tears, except – nearly – at the very end, when Lee tells his sort-of son Patrick he is getting a place with a spare bedroom. There is a kind of dark, self-harming eroticism in the way Lee goes to bars, ignores attractive women coming on to him, and instead finds men to fight.

Lonergan intersperses the action with the flashbacks that jab agonisingly into Lee’s mind. Joe suffered from a heart condition and an unspeakably painful hospital scene replays the moment in which he gets the diagnosis, which may also be the moment when Elise walks out on him for good.

Hedges gives a glorious performance as Patrick, the teenager who finds that tricky Uncle Lee is now his dad. He is a mixture of vulnerable, clueless and precociously worldly. When Lee shows up in the town to tell Patrick that his dad is dead, it is as if he is making a reckoning with a younger, freer version of himself.

Manchester By the Sea is a sombre and wintry film, and in fact the sheer arctic chill is what delays the funeral and creates the important, though hardly palliative interval in which the drama can take place and feelings can be worked through, as far as that’s possible. It is a movie composed in an inexpressibly sad minor key.The star of the video game adaptation – alongside co-star Marion Cotillard and director Justin Kurzel – discusses the plausibility of past lives and inheriting the experiences of our ancestors.

• Assassin’s Creed opens in the UK on 1 January 2017Bosnia-Herzegovina will ask the United Nations’ top court to review its 2007 ruling that cleared Serbia of genocide during the country’s civil war, Bosnia’s Muslim leader said on Friday.



The move announced by Bakir Izetbegovic, the Muslim member of Bosnia’s tripartite presidency, could spark a new political crisis in the Balkans country, which remains deeply divided along ethnic lines since the 1992-1995 war.

Izetbegovic said the request for revision would be forwarded to the Hague-based International Court of Justice next week – just a few days before a 10-year deadline expires.



“Everyone needs the truth, even those who oppose it, a truth that will be written by international judges, experienced and impartial,” Izetbegovic told reporters after meeting with some 50 Bosnian Muslim politicians, legal experts and representatives of war victims’ associations.

In the original case launched in 1993 by Bosnia’s then Muslim-dominated government, Sarajevo accused Belgrade of masterminding a genocide through widespread “ethnic cleansing” during the war which killed more than 100,000.

On 26 February 2007, the ICJ found only one act of genocide – the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim males by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica – and said there was not enough evidence to suggest Belgrade was directly responsible.

But it did find Serbia, which politically and militarily backed the Bosnian Serbs, had breached international law over the Srebrenica slaughter.

Serb forces captured the eastern town in July 1995, in the final months of the war, then summarily killed its men and boys in Europe’s worst single atrocity since the second world war.

“We are interested in the truth and the process of reconciliation based on the truth,” Izetbegovic said, adding that the goal of the appeal was to prove that genocide was so widespread that it could not be limited only to Srebrenica.

Bosnian Serb officials say such a request cannot be made without consensus within the tripartite presidency. But Izetbegovic insists it can and said it would be done by a lawyer the presidency appointed in 2002.

Bosnia’s legal team has “new arguments”, notably those presented during the trial of the Bosnian Serb wartime army chief, Ratko Mladic, who is awaiting judgement at a UN tribunal, Izetbegovic said.

In Belgrade, the Serbian prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, labelled the decision “difficult and bad” for ties between the two neighbouring countries.

“Despite everything, I’m convinced that we will manage to preserve our national interests,” Vucic was quoted saying by the Blic newspaper’s online edition. “However, we will continue to talk with Bosnian officials, wishing to assure a lasting peace in the Balkans.”

The Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, called on ethnic Serb politicians to “challenge the legitimacy” of the demand for revision with the ICJ.

On Tuesday the Bosnian presidency’s Serb chairman, Mladen Ivanic, said that an appeal would violate the country’s constitution and further widen divisions among the rival ethnic groups. He said it would “threaten peace and stability in Bosnia”. Bosnian Serb MPs plan to boycott parliament to show their opposition.

Since the war ended, Bosnia has consisted of two semi-independent entities: the Serbs’ Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation. The two are linked by weak joint institutions.

They dressed in several layers of clothing or donned old hats. They carried blankets and cardboard boxes. It was approaching midnight in New York one night in March 2005, and recruits who had been paid $100 each to pretend to be homeless were fanning out across the city.



There were 58 sites dotted throughout the metropolis. Pseudo-homeless people arrived at subway stations in Manhattan, back alleys in Staten Island and Queens, the front steps of a church in the Bronx.

Then they waited to see if anyone noticed them.



The actors were taking part in a peculiar experiment led by Kim Hopper, a researcher then at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research. The purpose: to analyze the effectiveness of the city’s count of homeless people.

Hopper and his colleagues found that actors at almost one in three of the sites reported being missed by counters. And these were people who wanted to be counted. They did not include the swaths of genuinely homeless ensconced in corners of the city. “Invisibility serves the purpose of security and uninterrupted sleep,” the researchers noted.

Just over a decade later, questions remain about the reliability of America’s biennial street count of homeless people, an extraordinary undertaking in which thousands of volunteers head out into the darkness in cities, forests and deserts around the country.

It still takes place mostly at night, relying on volunteers who are often equipped with nothing more sophisticated than clipboards, pencils and flashlights.

But supporters of the count, which is run by local communities in return for federal dollars and may be the largest tally of homeless people in the world, argue that it is a crucial mechanism to keep track of people who often exist outside of government bureaucracy.

Even if the figures are open to question, they provide a window into the landscape of America’s homelessness problem – and a sense of how it is changing over time.

“The bottom line is that it’s imperfect, but I don’t know that we could do a better job,” said Dennis Culhane, a University of Pennsylvania researcher and a principal investigator on the homelessness reports that are presented to Congress annually.

The most recent report found that on one night there were 549,928 homeless people in America.

That figure has gradually declined across the nation over the past decade, although homelessness appears particularly entrenched in western states. Of the 10 states with the highest rates of homelessness, seven are in the western half of the country.

Today the Guardian launches Outside in America, a year-long series focusing on the people and places scrambling to cope with a homelessness crisis across the west.

One in five homeless Americans live in California, where the problem is especially acute. In the Golden State and three other western states – Hawaii, Nevada and Oregon – more than 50% of homeless people are categorized as unsheltered, meaning they are living in the streets, vehicles or parks, in places not fit for humans to stay. In New York, by comparison, the number is less than 5%.

City services are overwhelmed. After torrential rains in San Francisco last week, the shelter wait list for single adults reached a record 1,126 people, according to Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco.

“We have this emergence of a very visible and very large homeless population in the shadow of tremendous affluence,” she said. “As folks are forced to remain on the streets for longer and longer, they’re really disintegrating. They’re developing more severe mental illnesses and more severe medical disorders, and losing limbs and in wheelchairs.”

The homelessness problem appears especially severe in cities in the grip of soaring real estate markets. Places such as Seattle and Portland have declared states of emergency to deal with the crisis as they would a natural disaster, while the Los Angeles area, where 43,854 people were counted last year, has the largest number of homeless people in the region.

The 4,000-square-mile count that covers most of LA County is the nation’s largest. It includes one of the most concentrated communities of unsheltered homeless people in the country: Skid Row.

During this year’s count, Skid Row volunteers were forced to walk in the middle of the road as the sidewalks were blocked by jumbles of tents and lean-tos. People lay prone in sleeping bags, with cardboard boxes over their heads for a modicum of privacy.

“Four! Five! Six!” announced one of the counters, the numbers mounting almost without cease.

A barefoot woman in a bathrobe was bent over and scraping at the ground under a lamppost with her walking stick. A grizzled man almost ran into the volunteers and trilled “uh oh”.

“You’ll see a whole lot of that,” said Lydell Londo, a formerly homeless man who struggled with a drug addiction and lived on Skid Row for about a year and a half and had joined the counters. “A whole lot of craziness.”

The shimmering skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles loomed overhead, but on Skid Row many of the grimy buildings were dark. All the life was on the streets.

Counting homeless people here is disconcertingly easy; volunteers estimated they had tallied about 275 homeless people in only eight square blocks.

The idea of carrying out a national count emerged at the same time as the modern incarnation of American homelessness: the early 1980s. The country was in a recession, mental healthcare was in the midst of a decades-long process of being deinstitutionalized, and cuts by Ronald Reagan weakened the safety net – the budget for low-income housing assistance was cut in half during his first year in office.

The government created a new homelessness program within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “We put it in an emergency agency and we gave it an emergency-sounding name,” said Mark Johnston, who administered homelessness programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development for 25 years. A few years later, “we realized that this is not an economic blip of a recession in the Reagan era. This thing has roots. It’s going to stay around.”

At the time, some activists opposed the idea of counting homeless people, arguing that doing so would inevitably produce an inaccurately low number, enabling policymakers to cut back on services. In 1990, homelessness advocates dumped sand outside the US Department of Commerce and placed signs reading, “Counting the homeless is like counting grains of sand.”

Despite criticisms, the outdoor counts prevailed and gradually became an enduring event taking place in the last 10 days of January across the country every other year.

In addition to tallying people living on the streets, organizers also include those who are in emergency shelters or temporary housing.

But counting homeless people outside of places such as Skid Row can be complicated. During this year’s count in Hawaii – the state with the highest per-capita rate of homelessness in America – volunteers fanned out across the islands to count homeless residents.



Its homeless population has soared 30% since 2007 in tandem with real estate prices – what some call the “paradise premium”.

At Waikiki Beach, Honolulu’s arc of white sand, social worker Colleen Nakamura watched as a man with matted gray hair passed by on the promenade, clutching a bulging grocery bag. Did it contain a recent purchase – or his worldly belongings? She made a judgment call. “No,” she mouthed to another volunteer.



That call – rightly or wrongly – will mean one less person on Hawaii’s count for 2017.

Another person who will be left off the tally is Chris Kauffman, 39, who sat in a gray minivan filled with bags of his possessions and surfboards on the outskirts of the neighborhood when he saw the volunteers walk past. He has been living in his vehicle for two years because he was unable to afford rent. He wouldn’t mind answering the survey, he said, but nobody had asked him. “I’m pretty smart,” he said softly. “I know where to sleep so the police don’t bother me.”

“I’ve never been of the opinion that the count is even close to the complete number of those who experience homelessness on a particular night,” said James Wright, a homelessness expert at the University of Central Florida who was a leader of the count in Orlando for about seven years. “It always gives me a chuckle when HUD” – the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which publishes the data – “reports it to six significant digits. It’s real misplaced precision.”

But Culhane, the University of Pennsylvania academic who aggregates the vast set of data, said federal officials are aware their figures provide only a snapshot. While the count identifies around half a million homeless Americans on a given night, Culhane uses data extrapolations to estimate that some 2 million Americans experience homelessness at some point over the course of a year.

For one in three, it lasts a week or less; for others it will be much longer.

Some advocates take a more expansive view and define the many people who are “doubled up”, unable to afford their own place to live and making do by sharing space with friends or family, as homeless.

Others say such people are merely “at risk” of homelessness. Either way, according to the US Census Bureau, this was 7 million people in poor households in 2014.

Estimating the number of homeless Americans is by definition a fraught exercise. Doing so in winter, when many homeless people are huddled for warmth under freeway underpasses or inside cars, poses a particular problem.

It is especially challenging in Alaska, which has one of the largest per-capita homeless populations in the country, concentrated in Anchorage. More than 400 people in Alaska were unsheltered, in sub-Arctic weather, according to last year’s count. .

About 5am one recent morning, volunteers including six air force airmen set out on foot along an unlit bike trail through a large forested area in the south-west of the city.

With flashlights they scanned for foot trails in the fresh snow that might lead to homeless camps. Given the temperature was just below 30F (-1C), they were also prepared to discover something worse.

Deceased homeless people have been discovered during expeditions such as these. Weeks later, spring snowmelt in Alaska has also been known to reveal the frozen bodies.

“When we have these big cold snaps like we did this winter, it’s not unheard of,” said Monica Stoesser, a social services worker who led the group. “It’s the reality of what sleeping in tents is like in Anchorage.”

The airmen waded through thigh-deep snow to an old camp, which was unoccupied. Next the volunteers came upon a well-traveled trail that wound into the spruce forest. At the end were two tents, both covered with tarps.

“Hello?” Stoesser called out. “Is there anybody home?’ There was no answer.

The announcement, made on the Treasury Department’s website late on Monday, is bound to increase tensions between the US and its harshest critic in Latin America. El Aissami is the most senior Venezuelan official to ever be targeted by the States.

The US government is also sanctioning Samark López, a wealthy Venezuelan businessman believed to be El Aissami’s main frontman. As part of the action, 13 companies owned or controlled by López, including five in Florida, will be blocked and both men will be barred from entering the United States. There was no immediate reaction from El Aissami but he has long denied any criminal ties.

The move comes a week after a bipartisan group of 34 American politicians sent a letter to Donald Trump urging him to step up pressure on Venezuela’s socialist government by immediately sanctioning top officials responsible for corruption and human rights abuses, as well as El Aissami for his purported ties to Hezbollah.

In the wake of President Nicolás Maduro’s crackdown on dissent following anti-government protests in 2014, Congress passed legislation authorising the US president to freeze the assets and ban visas for anyone accused of carrying out acts of violence or violating the human rights of those opposing Venezuela’s government.

Monday’s sanctions were imposed under rules passed during the Clinton administration allowing the US to go after the assets of anyone designated a drug kingpin.

El Aissami has been the target of American law enforcement investigation for years, stemming from his days as interior minister when dozens of fraudulent Venezuelan passports ended up in the hands of people from the Middle East, including alleged members of Hezbollah.

Venezuela’s top convicted drug trafficker, Walid Makled – before being sent back from Colombia in 2011 – said he paid bribes through El Aissami’s brother to officials so they could turn a blind eye to cocaine shipments that proliferated in Venezuela over the past two decades of socialist rule.

El Aissami was named vice-president last month as Maduro struggled to hold together a loose coalition of civilian leftist and military supporters whose loyalty to the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez has frayed amid triple-digit inflation and severe food shortages. Recent polls say more than 80% of Venezuelans want Maduro gone.

El Aissami is feared by many in the opposition for his association with Venezuela’s intelligence services from his long run as interior minister under Chávez. Since El Aissami became vice-president, Maduro has handed him control of an “anti-coup commando unit” to go after officials and opponents suspected of treason.

A former Obama administration official said the decision to sanction El Aissami was months in the making and involved several US federal agencies. It was held up last year at the insistence of the State Department, for fear it could interfere in a Vatican-backed attempt at dialogue between the government and opposition, as well as efforts to win the release of US citizen Joshua Holt, jailed for months on what are seen as trumped-up weapons charges.

“This was an overdue step to ratchet up pressure on the Venezuelan regime and signal that top officials will suffer consequences if they continue to engage in massive corruption, abuse human rights and [the dismantling of] democracy,” said Mark Feierstein, who served as Barack Obama’s top national security adviser on Latin America.

The talks between the opposition and Venezuela have since collapsed. The opposition blames Maduro’s administration, saying it did not follow through on a pledge to release dozens of activists that government opponents consider political prisoners. The opposition also says Maduro did not set a date for regional elections that his opponents are favoured to sweep after the government suspended a recall referendum against the president in October.

“The sanctions in and of themselves will not bring about a democratic transition,” Feierstein said. “That will require the Venezuelan opposition to remobilise its followers and US diplomatic efforts to marshal governments in the region to isolate Maduro.”

Tensions between the US and Venezuela have been on the rise for years. The countries haven’t exchanged ambassadors since 2010. Trump mentioned the country only briefly during his election campaign and amid uncertainty on whether he would break from the Obama administration’s policy of relative restraint, Maduro had adopted a softer tack. After blasting Trump as a “bandit” and “mental patient” during the campaign, Maduro has remained quiet since.

Last month, Maduro said: “He won’t be worse than Obama, that’s the only thing I dare to say.”YouTube star PewDiePie has released an impassioned, 10-minute diatribe in which he blames the mainstream media for cherry-picking parts of his videos to make him look like an antisemite.

On Tuesday, the Walt Disney Company and Google severed ties with the 27-year-old YouTuber, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, after the Wall Street Journal highlighted the fact that he’d posted several videos featuring antisemitic or neo-Nazi “jokes”, including one where he paid two men to hold a “Death to All Jews” sign. Another video features a man dressed as Jesus saying: “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong.”

Kjellberg, who rose to internet fame making videos about video games, is angry that the Wall Street Journal referred to his antisemitic “jokes” as “posts”.

“They take that and use it out of context to portray me as a Nazi,” he said.

“I am sorry for the words I used as I know that offended people, and I admit that the joke itself went too far. I like to push boundaries, but I would consider myself a rookie comedian,” he said.

Kjellberg blames the Journal, rather than his comments, for the breakdown of his two biggest brand relationships, saying they took the out-of-context antisemitic “jokes” to Disney and YouTube “obviously cornering them and forcing them to sever their ties with me”.

Kjellberg claims that the Wall Street Journal purposefully skewed his words because it and other mainstream media outlets feel threatened by him.

“Old-school media does not like internet personalities because they are scared of us. We have so much influence and such a large voice, and I don’t think they understand that,” he said.

The story, he said, “was an attack towards me by the media to try and discredit me, decrease my influence”.

The videos in question have made PewDiePie popular with neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, which has run a series of articles about the YouTuber, describing him as “our guy”.

“He could be doing all this only to cause a stir things up and get free publicity,” wrote the Daily Stormer.

“Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, since the effect is the same; it normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies.”

Responding to the support from neo-Nazis, Kjellberg said: “I do not support the hateful groups in any way.”

Kjellberg, who has more than 53 million subscribers on YouTube, explained that his relationship with mainstream media has soured over the years as he has become more successful.

“They blatantly represent people for their personal gain, they even viciously attack people just to further themselves,” he said.

He doesn’t like the fact that reports focus on how much he earns (estimated to be more than $12m in 2016).

“The money is all I’ve ever been acknowledged for. I literally raise millions of dollars for charities. That’s rarely ever spoken about,” he said.

He said that he has started to fight back against the mainstream media but “the more I punch back, the more I get back”.

He concluded his video on Thursday with a message to the Wall Street Journal: “I’m still here, I’m still making videos. Nice try, Wall Street Journal.

• Loving is released in the UK on 3 FebruaryJapan’s long wait for a homegrown sumo grand champion has ended after Kisenosato became the first Japanese wrestler to reach the ancient sport’s pinnacle in almost two decades.



The 30-year-old became the sport’s 72nd yokozuna, or grand champion, after Japan’s sumo association approved his promotion on Wednesday in a move purists hope will mark the start of a challenge to years of dominance by overseas wrestlers.

The last Japan-born wrestler to reach the top rank was Wakanohana in 1998.

The 178kg Kisenosato – who has been criticised for letting several tournament titles slip through his hands – became a serious contender for promotion after winning the new year’s contest in Tokyo with a record of 14 victories and one defeat.

At a ceremony at his stable on Wednesday morning, Kisenosato said he accepted his promotion “with great humility”. He added: “I will show devotion and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna.”

In recent years sumo has been dominated by wrestlers from Mongolia, Hawaii and Samoa.

Earlier this week, with his promotion all but a formality, Kisenosato told reporters that the rank of yokozuna came with a special responsibility. “I feel grateful to all the people that have helped me,” said Kisenosato, who paid tribute to his late stable master, Naruto. “If I had not met my former trainer I would not have got to where I have now,” he said. “I have nothing but gratitude.”

Kisenosato’s ascent to sumo’s summit did not come easily: his historic victory on Sunday came at the end of his 73rd tournament as a professional, which is more than it has taken any other wrestler since 1926 to reach the top rank.

His addition to the yokozuna ranks is also expected to help improve sumo’s image, after a decade in which it has been rocked by a series of scandals, including bullying, drug taking and allegations of match fixing.

Kisenosato joins three other wrestlers at the rank of yokozuna, all of whom were born in Mongolia: Kakuryu, Harumafuji and Hakuho. The latter is considered by many to be the greatest sumo wrestler of all time with 37 tournament titles.

Foreign-born wrestlers’ domination of sumo began with the 287kg Konishiki in the 1990s and continued into the next decade with the arrival of Asashoryu from Mongolia whose unpredictable behaviour outside the ring occasionally took the sheen off his brilliant performances inside it.When Edward Snowden met journalists in his cramped room in Hong Kong's Mira hotel in June, his mission was ambitious. Amid the clutter of laundry, meal trays and his four laptops, he wanted to start a debate about mass surveillance. He succeeded beyond anything the journalists or Snowden himself ever imagined. His disclosures about the NSA resonated with Americans from day one. But they also exploded round the world. For some, like Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, it is a vitally important issue, one of the biggest of our time: nothing less than the defence of democracy in the digital age.

But the intelligence agencies dismiss such claims, arguing that their programs are constitutional, and subject to rigorous congressional and judicial oversight. Secrecy, they say, is essential to meet their overriding aim of protecting the public from terrorist attacks.

The debate has raged across time zones: from the US and Latin America to Europe and to Asia. Barack Obama cancelled a trip to Moscow in protest at Russian president Vladimir Putin's protection of Snowden. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff cancelled a state visit to Washington in protest at the US spying on her. Bolivian president Evo Morales's plane was forced down in Vienna amid suspicion that Snowden was being smuggled out of Russia. In Germany, a "livid" Angela Merkel accused the US of spying on her, igniting a furore that has seen the White House concede that new constraints on the NSA's activities may be necessary. Meanwhile, in Britain, prime minister David Cameron accused the Guardian of damaging national security by publishing the revelations, warning that if it did not "demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act".

Caught in a net US internet companies, their co-operation with the NSA exposed by Snowden's documents, fear a worldwide consumer backlash, and claim they were forced into co-operation by the law.

Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.

Cell phones, laptops, Facebook, Skype, chat-rooms: all allow the NSA to build what it calls ‘a pattern of life’, a detailed profile of a target and anyone associated with them. And the number of people caught up in this dragnet can be huge.

Three degrees of separation You don't need to be talking to a terror suspect to have your communications data analysed by the NSA. The agency is allowed to travel "three hops" from its targets — who could be people who talk to people who talk to people who talk to you. Facebook, where the typical user has 190 friends, shows how three degrees of separation gets you to a network bigger than the population of Colorado. How many people are three "hops" from you?

Faced with growing public and political concern over the quantities of data it is collecting, the NSA has sought to reassure people, arguing that it collected only a tiny proportion of the world’s internet traffic, roughly equivalent to a “dime on a basketball court”. But in reality, that is still a huge amount of data. The Library of Congress, one of the biggest libraries in the world, gathers 5 terabytes a month. The NSA sucks up much, much more.

Since you began reading this, the NSA has selected terabytes terabytes of data for review. That's about

The NSA say it needs all this data to help prevent another terrorist attack like 9/11. In order to find the needle in the haystack, they argue, they need access to the whole haystack.

Snowden recognises the value of the NSA in counter-terrorism, but thinks the spy agency has dangerously over-reached itself. He is a fugitive from US law, in exile in Russia. But the debate he wanted to start when he decided to become a whistleblower is now happening.An Indonesian woman arrested for suspected involvement in the killing of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s half-brother in Malaysia was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank, Indonesia’s national police chief has said, citing information received from Malaysian authorities.

Meanwhile, Malaysian police said on Saturday they had arrested a North Korean man in connection with the murder.

The man was identified as Ri Jong Chol, born in 1970. He was arrested on Friday night in Selangor state, the police said in a statement. He is the fourth suspect to be arrested.



Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, told reporters in Indonesia’s Aceh province that the Indonesian woman, 25-year-old Siti Aisyah, was paid to be involved in pranks .

He said she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

“Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong-nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer,” Karnavian said.

“She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents.”

Siti’s family have said they were shocked to hear of her involvement in the case, describing her as a struggling mother who had travelled to Malaysia for work.

Her 26-year-old Malaysian boyfriend was also arrested by police late on Thursday. Police are hunting for other alleged accomplices.

Authorities are investigating whether Siti and another female suspect killed the 46-year-old North Korean exile in a shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur’s international airport on Monday.

Karnavian’s intervention, based on information that has not been independently verified, came as a diplomatic row developed between Malaysia and North Korea over the fate of Kim ’s body, and as details emerged about the movements of the second female suspect detained over his apparent murder.

Malaysia performed a second autopsy on Kim’s body because the first procedure was inconclusive.

Late on Friday, North Korea’s ambassador in Malaysia said his country would reject the results of a postmortem and demanded the body be released immediately.

“The Malaysian side forced the postmortem without our permission and witnessing, we will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance,” Kang Chol said .

Kang said Malaysian police were being pressured by hostile forces, notably South Korea, and the postmortem was a violation of human rights.

Police in Kuala Lumpur said on Friday they would only abide by a North Korean request to hand over the body of Kim when it is claimed by a next of kin or DNA samples are provided.

The second female suspect, who was captured on CCTV at the airport in a top emblazoned with “LOL” and arrested on Wednesday in possession of a Vietnamese passport, stayed at a hotel near the airport in the days before the attack, booking the cheapest room and carrying a wad of cash, according to a receptionist who spoke to Reuters.

She moved accommodation twice. Employees at the second hotel said she borrowed a pair of scissors from the front desk the evening before the attack, and that a member of housekeeping staff found hair on the floor and in the bin the next day.

She then checked into another hotel on Monday afternoon. It is not known what her subsequent movements were before her arrest.

Selangor state’s police chief, Abdul Samah Mat, said Kim’s body would not be released until the identity of the victim had been confirmed.



“ We have only received the application from the North Korean embassy yesterday,” he told Reuters.

“We need to collect DNA samples from the next-of-kin in order to get conclusive evidence on the victim’s identity.”

Diplomats from the North Korean embassy have shown a deep interest in the case, spending several hours at the mortuary on Wednesday and requesting custody of Kim ’s body on the basis that he had a North Korean passport.

North Korean officials reportedly objected to a postmortem, but Malaysian authorities went ahead with the procedure anyway because they had not received a formal complaint.

Police have told the Guardian that samples have been sent to a laboratory for a toxicology report, which could take several days.

North Korean media has made no reference to Kim’s death . People close to him say he was long targeted by his half-brother, Kim Jong-un.

A schoolfriend told the Guardian that Kim – who reportedly divided his time between Macau, China and Singapore – feared for his life and was recently planning a trip to Europe.

Malaysia’s deputy prime minister, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, said on Thursday that Kim had been travelling under a pseudonym, Kim Chol.

“We have looked into the possibility that he travelled with a fake passport. I think he carried two different identities. Probably this is an undercover document.”



Hamidi said the body would be released to North Korea once “police and medical procedures” were completed.

“The cause of death will be confirmed by the police, who will issue a statement,” he added.

Malaysia is one of the few countries in the world with normalised relations and visa-free travel into North Korea. In October 2016, several former US diplomats held talks with senior Pyongyang officials in Kuala Lumpur.

There is a small North Korean community living in the Malaysian capital although shops and restaurants owned by the expatriates have been closed this week.

Kim was once seen as heir apparent to his father, Kim Jong-il, but was ostracised in 2001 after a failed attempt to enter Japan on a forged passport, apparently to visit Disneyland.

However, Yoji Gomi, a Japanese journalist and former friend, said he had already become disillusioned with the North Korean dictatorship in the early 1990s when “he saw the reality of the country’s situation”.

Kim had spent many years in Switzerland, Russia and later settled in Macau. South Korea’s intelligence agency told lawmakers in Seoul that Kim had received China’s protection.

The double 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic champion, who was born in Somalia — one of the seven countries named in the president’s executive order — branded the decision “ignorant and prejudiced”.

He added that he would have to tell his children that he might not be able to come home to the US from his training camp in Ethiopia, where he was scheduled to stay for another two weeks before competing for the UK in Britain.

IAAF worried Trump’s US immigration order will impact World Championships Read more

Farah spoke out after Trump’s executive order halted the entire US refugee programme and imposed a 90-day travel ban for nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban has caused a furore among leading British Muslims, who could be affected by the border clampdown. Sporting figures, politicians and artists have all united to condemn the ban.

Farah was speaking from Ethiopia, where he is training at high altitude in preparation for a race in Birmingham next month. He planned to go back to Ethiopia afterwards for four weeks before returning to the family home he shares with his wife and four children in Portland, Oregon, in March. The news of the executive order, however, led him to fear that he would not be able to travel back to Portland because of the ban, which applies to those who hold dual nationality with one of the listed countries.



In the riposte to Trump, Farah said: “I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years – working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It’s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home – to explain why the president has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.

“I was welcomed into Britain from Somalia at eight years old and given the chance to succeed and realise my dreams. I have been proud to represent my country, win medals for the British people and receive the greatest honour of a knighthood. My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation.”

He also contrasted his treatment from the Queen, who recently gave him a knighthood, with that of Trump, saying: “On 1 January this year, Her Majesty the Queen made me a knight of the realm. On 27 January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien.”

Farah is a British citizen with a British passport who does not have dual nationality or hold a Somalian passport. However, he was born in Somalia.



The UK government last night released a statement after talks with the White House that sought to play down the impact of the ban. Detailing assurances secured by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the government said the measure applied only to British citizens with dual nationality travelling to the US directly from one of the seven targeted countries. “The US has reaffirmed its strong commitment to the expeditious processing of all travellers from the UK.”



On hearing the statement from No 10, Farah said he was relieved that he could return to his family, but still staunchly opposed to the policy, according to a spokeswoman for the athlete. She said: “We understand from the statement released this evening by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office that the executive order will not apply to Mo, and we are grateful to the FCO for urgently clarifying the situation.



“Mo is relieved that he will be able to return to his family once his current training camp concludes. However, as he said in his earlier statement, he still fundamentally disagrees with this incredibly divisive and discriminatory policy.”

Alan Watkinson, the PE teacher who discovered Farah as a schoolboy, said he was not surprised by him speaking out against Trump’s decision. “Mo has strong values,” he told the Guardian. “If he thinks something isn’t fair he won’t sit on the fence. He is always been passionate about injustice and he has always had that side to him.”



Watkinson, who was also the best man at Farah’s wedding, urged Theresa May to intervene directly to make sure that Farah would be able to return to the US. “Mo has lived in the US for many years, had children there, and pays his taxes there. And while Mo is the most high-profile case, the whole policy is complete crackers and hopefully his case will highlight how ridiculous this blanket ban against Muslims is.”

May tells ministers to raise travel ban with their US counterparts Read more

The British–Iranian comedian Patrick Monahan had plans to take his tour to the United States this year, but now says his Iranian heritage could make that impossible.

Monahan, 40, came to Britain in the early 1980s to escape the Iran-Iraq war. His family lived on the border of the two Middle Eastern countries in the south-western city of Ahvaz in Iran. But when the conflict started, his parents were forced to flee with their three children, crossing into Saudi Arabia, Europe and then into the UK before settling in Teesside.

He said: “This is taking us right back into the dark ages. I find it ridiculous that because of my heritage I am now considering public enemy number one in the states. America is made up of immigrants and to shut the doors to others is just ludicrous. I have never been to the states before but I was going this year and taking my show out there. It doesn’t look like that can happen now.”

Monahan’s father is an Irish national, who had travelled to the Middle East to work on oil rigs. He added: “I am used to being asked questions at airports because they get very confused with my Irish passport and my Iranian birth. I always get asked if I’ve been to Syria. But I get they have a job to do — I have never been refused entry before though.

“Comedy is a way of breaking barriers and banning us from entering a country is not going to help with culturally diversity or help people to understand what we are all about. Stopping people from meeting each other creates fear.”

The Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Baghdad, said he felt “demeaned and discriminated against” by Trump’s border edict. Lawyers have told the politician that he could be barred from the US under the ban.

Speaking on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, he said: “I don’t think I have felt discriminated since little school when the kids were very cruel, as a young boy coming from Iraq of Kurdish origin. For the first time in my life last night I felt discriminated against. It’s demeaning, it’s sad.”

The Lord of the Rings actor Andy Serkis also condemned the ban. Serkis, whose father is from Iraq, described the order, which could affect the free movement of some of his relatives, as “brutal” and “catastrophic”.

He said: “Within a week of assuming a highly pivotal role in balancing the future of our planet, one that demands an incredibly virtuous leader and subtle negotiator, in a world that needs real understanding, a great mind, compassion and empathy, we find ourselves instead with a childish bully at the helm who has placed catastrophic, heinous and brutal executive orders into place, one presumes to show off how powerful he is, most recently the decision to block refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries including Iraq.

“It is the sign of a civilised country to open wide its arms to those who have suffered the unimaginable terror, psychological trauma and desperate heartbreak of war, those who seek help and comfort.

“Many of my own Iraqi relatives have indeed sought refuge abroad in countries such as New Zealand, Canada, Europe and the USA, gradually rebuilding their lives in a safe and nurturing environment. In line with his nationalistic desire to rid his country of Muslims, foreigners, others, with this blatantly illegal anti-human rights action, it is clear that that he cares not for any human being beyond his own walls.”

Serkis also criticised Theresa May, who initially refused to criticise Trump when pressed by reporters on the ban, saying it was up to America to devise its own policy. “I’m deeply ashamed that our prime minister is happy to even sit down with a man who fights fire with fire, wants to make torture a ‘normal’ activity, and who is deluded about climate change,” he said. “Very great shame on you.”Before the Super Bowl winning drive Tom Brady stood on the Houston stadium’s field and said to his team-mates: “Let’s go.” And later, after the New England Patriots had won on the game’s final play and confetti tumbled over them their right tackle gushed: “He thrives on those moments.”

That was 13 years ago, on the night the Patriots won their second Super Bowl, which came in the same stadium, in a similar high-scoring game, won at the end by the Patriots on a drive led by Brady, who would be named MVP. Back then Brady was the 26-year-old quarterback who had won two titles in three years but wasn’t judged as the greatest at his position that the game had seen. That legacy would take more winning, more touchdowns and ultimately three more championships.

Now that he has won five Super Bowls, the most remarkable thing is how time has failed to take its toll on Brady. No quarterback at 39 makes storming through the final minutes of the Super Bowl look as easy as he did at 26. No quarterback has been as remarkably-consistent and dominant for two decades while players swirl in and out of the league around him.

A few days ago, Damon Huard – Brady’s backup on those first two championship teams – talked about returning to New England last fall for a celebration of that initial 2002 Super Bowl win and realizing that all but one of those Patriots had long retired. It was a jarring sensation for Huard, watching Brady that afternoon while assessing his own full post-football life.

“It’s just so hard in this job and profession to win,” Huard told the Guardian. “How they are still doing it is amazing. I was looking out there and I said to myself: ‘That’s No12 out there and it’s still [coach] Bill [Belichick] in the hoodie and they still have the drive and work ethic to make this happen.”

Play Video Reaction after the New England Patriots stun the Atlanta Falcons to win Super Bowl LI

How is it possible for Brady and Belichick to keep winning? How do they go down 28-3 to the Atlanta Falcons, sending their benefactor Donald Trump to bed certain of their defeat, only to thunder back for a 34-28 overtime victory? How does Brady throw for a Super Bowl record 466 yards at an age when most quarterbacks have long left the game behind? Last year, Peyton Manning won this game at 39 and yet the win came in his final professional game, with his body crumbling and his mind more of a factor than his arm.

Brady looks as nimble now as he did all those years before. The popular belief is that his greatness comes because his offensive line keeps him from getting hit. Teams know they can’t rush more than four defenders at him or he will pick their defensive backs apart. Rarely are four pass rushers enough to beat Brady. But on Sunday the Falcons rushed four and it worked. They hit Brady. They hit him hard – he said so himself after the game. They made him force passes he didn’t want to throw. They rattled his timing. They made him uncomfortable.

Matt Ryan, Super Bowl LI and the art of the perfect choke Read more

When he started his final drive in regulation, 91 yards from the touchdown the Patriots needed, he had been sacked five times in the game and hit 16 times. Nobody hits Brady 16 times. And still he stood back up, found the spots where the Falcons defense had softened and fired passes to his players. Though New England stood 91 yards away from that touchdown there seemed no doubt they would score. Then, after they did, putting them down two points from tying, there was again little question he would complete the two-point conversion – this time a pass that rocketed into the arms of receiver Danny Amendola.

Following the final 75-yard drive in overtime, another group of players – men who were teenagers the last time he did this at a Super Bowl in Houston - would make the same kind of admiring statements as their predecessors 13 years before.

“When it comes down to game time, he’s the best,” Amendola said. “He’s our leader, he’s so competitive. We rally behind him.”

It was a quote that easily could have come from 2004.

Tom Brady dodges Deflategate after comeback from suspension to MVP | Paolo Bandini Read more

There will be so many memories that are different this time from the others when Brady has won. This was the Super Bowl of redemption for the Patriots and their fans. They remain outraged by commissioner Roger Goodell’s draconian four-game suspension of Brady over the Deflategate scandal. After nearly two years of legal fights, Brady was forced to serve that suspension at the start of this season. But unlike the fans and team owner Robert Kraft, Brady has not worn the scars of that suspension.

Just as he did at the end of the other Super Bowls, Brady looked straight ahead.

But the 39-year-old Brady was not the carefree 26-year-old Brady. He fell to his knees after Sunday’s championship in a rare public expression of sensitivity. He talked around rumors that his mother has been seriously ill. He even struggled to remember what had happened in the game’s frantic last minutes, admitting: “There was a lot of shit that happened.”

Thirteen years after he took the Patriots to a championship on the same field, he became the only quarterback to win five Super Bowls. He also became the first to win four Super Bowl MVP awards. He gets older and nothing changes. He keeps winning. New England keeps winning.

It’s as if this all can go on forever.It is not normal for a technology chief executive to announce a new product roadmap in the form of a 5,700 word blogpost that begins with a unified theory of history and ends by quoting Abraham Lincoln. But that’s exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has done in his letter to the “Facebook community”, published on Thursday.

The unusual aspects of the letter don’t stop at its length. Zuckerberg rapidly alternates between lofty statements of social principle and minor product updates. One minute, he is discussing the necessity for a strong civil society existing between the government and the people, implicitly rebutting Margaret Thatcher; the next, he is discussing the need for the administrators of Facebook groups to be able to support “sub-communities”, so that, for example, a Facebook group for a university can contain within it a sub-group for a particular accommodation block.

If an attentive reader overcomes the whiplash induced by the shifts in tone, they’ll find a founder clearly concerned by the growing discontent many are feeling about Facebook’s affect on the world. Zuckerberg proposes solutions to such varied problems as Facebook’s history of heavy-handed censorship, the social network’s role in enabling and promoting fake news, and the need to prevent terrorist groups from using Facebook’s tools to recruit and co-ordinate.

Those solutions are varied, but a number of them share one thing in common: an expectation that artificial intelligence technology will get significantly better in the short term, enabling technological fixes to problems conventionally thought unsolvable.

For instance, Zuckerberg proposes an AI capable of distinguishing between different levels of violence in a picture, thus allowing individuals to choose how granular their personal censorship settings should be. And he wants to train an AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda, to automatically remove the latter but not the former.

While he admits that those capabilities are, in some cases, “several years away”, at least Facebook is investigating solutions. In other domains, Zuckerberg seems content to show that he understands the problem, without feeling the need to suggest much of a solution at all. For instance, he concedes that “there is more we must do to support the news industry to make sure this vital social function is sustainable”, but his solutions (which include growing local news, making mobile-first news formats, and developing new business models) feel back-of-the-envelope at best.

But a forensic breakdown of Zuckerberg’s letter risks missing the overarching point. If Zuckerberg wanted to simply announce some new features, he would have taken to the stage at F8, Facebook’s annual developer conference, and done his best Steve Jobs impression.

Instead, the letter is an application for Zuckerberg to take the position on the world stage he feels is his. Some have seen hints of a 2020, or 2024, presidential bid in his recent actions: between this letter, his folksy visit to Texas in January, and his hiring of an image consultant, they say, he’s surely got his eye on public office. Or maybe he just thinks running Facebook is the 21st-century version being president. Either way, it means what he’s saying is less important than how he’s saying it.For most football fans, the big event this weekend is the Champions League final. But in Sukhumi, capital of the breakaway region of Abkhazia, attention will be on teams from 12 unrecognised countries – ranging from de facto independent states to autonomous regions with faint hopes of future autonomy – taking part in the World Cup for unrecognised states.

In the opening match on Sunday afternoon, Kurdistan will take on Székely Land, a Hungarian-speaking part of Romania. Other participants in the tournament include Somaliland and the Chagos Islands. None of the participants are UN members states.

The final lineup of the tournament has changed after a number of teams withdrew. The County of Nice declined to participate owing to “organisational restructuring”, the Isle of Man pulled out because the UK government advises against travel to Abkhazia, and the Aymara people from South America could not travel after promised funding from the Chilean government did not come through, according to tournament organisers.



The tournament is run by Conifa, which represents national sides unable to join Fifa, the world football body. The first tournament took place in 2014 in Östersund, Sweden, where the County of Nice beat the Isle of Man in the final and the Arameans beat South Ossetia in the third-place playoff.



Conifa’s general secretary, Sascha Düerkop, said the tournament gave unrecognised states a chance to play international football, and complained that Fifa’s regulations were often unfair or inconsistent.



“It is still absolutely not clear or transparent who can be a member of Fifa,” said Düerkop. Gibraltar and Kosovo were recently made members of Uefa and are thus eligible to play in international tournaments, despite not being UN member states.

“We absolutely applaud the decision that both were finally allowed into Fifa, as surely they are the only FAs that have de facto governmental power of the territories mentioned. But the same is true for the Abkhazian FA, the Nagorno-Karabakh FA, the Northern Cyprus FA, the Crimea FA and the South Ossetia FA.”

Meanwhile the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey have more political independence from the UK than Gibraltar, according to Duerkop, but are not allowed to play international football.

Abkhazia, a subtropical chunk of coastline on the Black Sea that was once a popular Soviet holiday resort, is considered by most of the world to be part of Georgia, but has functioned as a de facto independent statelet since a war after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

In 2009 Russia recognised the territory as independent, and it now functions as a Russian protectorate. Other than Russia, only Venezuela, Nicaragua and the Pacific island of Nauru recognise Abkhazia’s independence.

A spokesperson for the Georgian government said no permission had been sought from Georgia to host the tournament, but added that by definition the Conifa tournament was for unrecognised states and thus “does not entail the legitimisation of the regime in control”.

He added that entering Abkhazia from Russia was a violation of Georgian territorial integrity, and as such any players who did so would be banned from Georgia in future, and a criminal case would be initiated against them.

Matches will be played at Sukhumi’s Dinamo stadium, which has a capacity of 4,300, and in the town of Gagra, a resort town where Joseph Stalin had a dacha. Organisers expect some of the matches to sell out, thanks to demand from locals, holidaying Russians and a small handful of fans who plan to make the trip to support their teams.Usain Bolt has been stripped of one of his nine Olympic gold medals following confirmation that his 4x100m relay team-mate Nesta Carter took a banned substance at the Beijing Olympics. It means the legendary Jamaican sprinter can no longer claim to have done the “triple-treble” – gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay in the Games in 2008, 2012 and 2016.

The International Olympic Committee announced the decision on Wednesday after a hearing in November to discuss Carter’s results following retests of 454 frozen blood and urine samples from the 2008 Games.

“It’s heartbreaking because over the years you’ve worked hard to accumulate gold medals and work hard to be a champion – but it’s just one of those things,” he said. “Things happen in life, so when it’s confirmed or whatever, if I need to give back my gold medal I’d have to give it back, it’s not a problem for me.”

Carter, the sixth fastest 100m runner of all time, helped Jamaica set a then-world-record time of 37.10sec in Beijing, as Bolt won the first of the 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble. But under the rules of the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, all four members of Jamaica’s 4x100m squad in 2008, which was made up of Bolt, Carter, Asafa Powell and Michael Frater, will now lose their medals.

Carter told the IOC he took two supplements in Beijing that were advised by his coach, and he had no idea how the banned substance did not show up in his original test. He is currently in discussions with his legal team about whether to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. He has 21 days to do so.

The 31-year-old has been a vital member of Jamaica’s 4x100m relay team for nearly a decade, running the first leg as they won gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Games and the 2011, 2013 and 2015 world championships, but missed the 2016 Rio Olympics. The decision means that Trinidad and Tobago’s team of Richard Thompson, Emmanuel Callender, Keston Bledman and Marc Burns are promoted to the gold, with Japan taking silver and Brazil bronze.

The Russian Tatiana Lebedeva, who competed in the women’s triple jump event and the women’s long jump event in which she ranked second has also been disqualified from the 2008 Games. Re-analysis of Lebedeva’s samples from Beijing 2008 resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance dehydrochlormethyltestosterone.

The 40-year-old has already announced plans to appeal. According to the Tass news agency, she has also been suspended from her position on the IAAF’s women’s committee.The Inna De Yard project invites legends of the Jamaican reggae scene to record outdoors, high up in the hills surrounding Kingston.

Even in the best-case scenarios, global warming is likely to see snowfall replaced by rain across the Alps, according to a report in the European Geosciences Union (EGU) journal the Cryosphere.

It says mathematical climate models predict that “bare alpine slopes could be a much more common sight in future”.

“Since many alpine villages are heavily dependent on winter tourism, the economy and society of regions with such tourism centres will suffer,” Sebastian Schlögl, one of the report’s authors wrote.

Last year the Swiss Alps had their driest December since records began 150 years ago. 2016 was the third year in a row with little snow at Christmas, when many families go skiing.



If global warming is limited to 2C, the target set in the Paris climate change agreement, the loss of snow cover in the Alps would be 30% by 2100, the report said. Were the temperature to rise above this target, the snow cover would dwindle by 70%, it added.

The research was carried out by scientists at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) and the Cryos Laboratory at the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Switzerland.

It also suggests that the season when natural snow is deep enough for winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding is likely to become shorter.

In a report entitled How much can we save? Impact of different emission scenarios on future snow cover in the Alps, the lead author Christoph Marty, SLF’s research scientist, writes: “The alpine snow cover will recede anyway, but our future emissions control by how much.

“The majority of the climate models used project slightly increasing winter precipitation towards the end of the century. However, since temperatures are clearly increasing simultaneously, we may experience increasing rainfall and not snowfall.”

Marty added: “We hope our results convincingly show that even increasing winter precipitation cannot compensate for the effect of the strongly increasing temperatures.”

The team’s projections show that the layer of snow covering the Alps would lose depth “for all elevations, time periods and emission scenarios”.

The report says: “The most affected elevation zone for climate change is located below 1,200m, where the simulations show almost no continuous snow cover towards the end of the century.”

About a quarter of the ski resorts in the Alps are below this altitude.A small provision buried within the Workers’ Compensation Act, a bill before the Illinois state senate, could wind up as a big headache for Chicago’s retired football stars. The provision would end disability benefits for professional athletes at 35, compared to 67 for the rest of the working population. Sources within the NFL Players Association traced the bill to a suggestion made by Chicago Bears owner George McCaskey – perhaps unsurprising, considering nobody else in the state of Illinois stands to benefit more from such a law.

Judge upholds NFL's 'imperfect but fair' $1bn concussion settlement Read more

“This bill being sponsored by [Illinois state senator] Christine Radogno is simply designed to target professional athletes and take away their right to health care that every worker in the state of Illinois is entitled to,” DeMaurice Smith of the NFL players’ union said this past Friday. “The Bears’ owners are behind it as well. To be blunt, it’s just another way to bankroll the coffers of the rich owners who own these teams at the expense of the players who actually do all the work. They’re pushing the bill. Our understanding is they are the people who have lined up a lobbyist to promote the bill.”

Most likely, this bill won’t be going anywhere. According to the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin, the bill is likely to die in committee, and it has not made any progress since it was added to the senate’s reading list on 25 January. But this story is worth noting. As sports leagues like the NFL take major hits in the courts, don’t be surprised if more owners like McCaskey target legislative bodies – many now heavily Republican – to solve their legal problems.

Even if this bill dies in committee, this is a distressing sign for those who care about labor rights in the sports world. This bill is a clear response to the major hits the NFL has been taking in court in recent years – specifically, the $1bn settlement in a class action lawsuit over concussions and the spectre of more legal action as research on brain injury and CTE continues to progress. Rather than change the league or the sport to ensure safety for its players, team owners like McCaskey are instead trying to head off these legal troubles by calling on their friends in high political places to give them special treatment.

The bill is not even about saving taxpayer money. Workers’ compensation is paid by employers – or more commonly, their insurers – not the state. Instead, as Radogno put it, it’s an effort to “respond to the concerns from the business community that workers’ compensation costs are too high.” In other words, this bill would throw workers – professional athletes and everyday laborers – under the bus in order to keep cash in the pockets of bosses.

The average NFL player has a career only three years long, and may exit the league and enter the workforce with debilitating injuries – not only the concussions, but also lasting injuries to joints and ligaments that prevent them from performing physical labor. Workers’ compensation laws vary from state to state, but rewards are typically limited to medical coverage, disability pay limited to under $100,000 per year, and/or payment for vocational rehabilitation. The wage loss benefits in particular are paltry fees for a corporation like the NFL, which pulls in $9bn in revenue yearly.

The real killer for the NFL and their insurers is the medical costs. Already, a large portion of NFL players are on disability, with hundreds filing claims in California alone. Many others who have suffered injuries have found themselves stymied by the NFL and the supposedly “neutral” physicians who affirm or deny players’ claims for benefits. Should a major scientific breakthrough like a test for CTE in living brains become available, those medical costs – and teams’ insurance premiums – could skyrocket. Fully aware of this possibility, McCaskey and the Bears pushed for this legislation to cover their backs.

The last decade or so has seen the professional sports world’s business model attacked in the courts. The Ed O’Bannon case threatened the NCAA’s amateurism by showcasing how the association profits off the images of college athletes. Concussion cases at every level of football have both damaged the public perception of the game’s safety and the pocketbooks of its executives. Major League Baseball has found itself under fire from multiple angles for its treatment of minor leaguers and amateur players.

McCaskey’s amendment is far from the only legislative approach leagues have attempted in response to these new judicial challenges. MLB has pushed to classify its players as “seasonal workers”, which would allow teams to legally pay their players sub-minimum wages (as they already do now). NCAA executives and college presidents have floated the idea of congressional action to codify the amateur model into law. One of the association’s biggest expenses over the past decade? Congressional lobbyists.

There couldn’t be a better political climate for sports leagues to make these plays. While sports welfare has been a bipartisan issue for much of American history, the Obama administration at least made attempts to curb tax and other government breaks for sports teams. Included in President Obama’s 2015 was a provision that would end the use of tax-free bonds for professional sports facilities, a practice that has allowed sports owners to avoid paying $4bn in federal taxes over the past 30 years.

Between the Trump administration and the Republican control of the federal legislature and a majority of statehouses, it’s hard to figure where the opposition to bills like SB12 will come from. Trump himself has been an avid supporter of sports institutions, even spending parts of three decades trying to buy his way into the ranks of NFL ownership. And the Republican party has never been the party of young men of color, who make up an overwhelming segment of the athletic population that will be affected by legislation like SB12. When the leagues and their lobbyists bring their cash to Washington and state capitols around the country, there’s no reason to believe the party of Trump won’t be happy to do their bidding.

Taxpayers, whether or not they care about the long-term health of athletes, should be incensed by the proposal in SB12. One in four NFL retirees requires a joint replacement surgery. They suffer from arthritis at five times the usual rate, and beyond CTE, they are four times likelier to suffer from ALS, Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. These men are going to require medical care as they age. If their injuries are bad enough to prevent them from working, the vast majority who didn’t have long, lucrative careers won’t have the money to cover the costs. If these players are barred from making workers’ compensation claims and getting those costs covered by the teams they sacrificed their bodies for, that burden will instead fall on the rest of us.

But sports owners and their lobbyists are making a bet. They believe the American people have enough resentment towards top-level athletes and their high salaries that they will see anything that can be construed as a privilege – workers’ compensation in retirement, or payment for college athletes, or living wages for minor leaguers – as excess that must be curbed. Even if liberals don’t fall for this bait, they may see athletes’ rights as something that can be sacrificed to hold ground elsewhere. Although that logic is understandable in a world where social protections are being eroded all around us, there is no excuse for leaving these men to fight these injuries alone, without help from the employers who profited off their labor for years.

SB12 may be headed for an inglorious death in committee. But the bet American sports leagues are making is a sound one. Athletes have been making great gains through judicial action over the past decade or so, but thanks to an election that gave us Donald Trump and a Republican party with more power than it has had in years, sports leagues have a real chance to regain powers they have lost and strengthen powers that have been threatened. It may be a minimal fight compared to many that are being fought in Trump’s America, but just know that when athletes lose, they aren’t the only ones. The burden of caring for athletes in their twilight years falls on someone, and if teams skirt their responsibilities as George McCaskey and the Bears want, it will be squarely on our shoulders.Director Ken Loach accepts the Bafta award for Best British Film for his portrayal of life in the British welfare system in I, Daniel Blake. He uses his speech to criticise the government for its “callous brutality” and its attitude towards “the most vulnerable and the poorest people” in our society, and particularly notes that the “disgraceful” cruelty now “extends to keeping out refugee children”At the start of January, I woke early and packed a few last-minute things for a trip to Arapahoe Basin in the Colorado Rocky Mountains: my ski gear, food and my Leatherman knife, which I carry in most outdoor situations. In the scramble, I threw the knife into my food bag, rather than my ski pack.

As an instructor at the ski school, I had been due to teach that morning, but the cold and windy weather meant no learners showed up, so I had the day off. I was on my way to get breakfast when someone called my name: it was Billy and Hans, two of my old ski buddies, who introduced me to their friend, Richard. We decided to ski together.

We arrived at the Lenawee Mountain lift, which reaches 12,500ft. It’s a fast, fixed-grip chairlift, meaning the chairs are permanently fixed to the cable. Each chair has room for only three people, so Richard told Billy, Hans and me to ride together while he took the chairlift in front with two strangers. When the chair gets to the top, you just jump off and ski away, so those two people probably never realised what happened next.

When we got off the chairlift, we couldn’t see Richard anywhere. Then we heard a scream. We turned and saw one of Richard’s skis near the downhill side of the bullwheel – the top of the lift that the chairs go around before heading back down. Then we heard more screams and the chairlift stopped.

Richard was hanging from the chairlift by his rucksack, around 30ft from the ski tower. He wasn’t moving and the rucksack was around his neck; his feet were dangling 10ft above the snow. Hans screamed, “He’s choking!” then I realised Richard was being strangled by his bag. The three of us and the chairlift operator tried to make a human pyramid to reach him, but we kept toppling over in the deep snow. People were yelling for ski patrol, so I knew they were on their way, but I also knew we had to act fast.

When I’m not teaching skiing, I’m a professional slackliner: it’s like tightrope walking, only, instead of static cables, I walk on two-inch-wide dynamic straps of rope; I also have plenty of climbing experience. I sprinted uphill to the base of the tower, which is 25ft tall, and climbed the maintenance ladder. To make climbing easier, I ripped off my gloves and the splint on my right hand, where I’d torn some ligaments in a slacklining accident. As I began to clamber up the ladder, I heard someone yell at me to stop. I hesitated, then carried on without looking back. At the top of the tower, I straddled the chairlift cable and shimmied along it, using my hands to pull me towards Richard.

When I got to him, I jumped down into the chair and saw he was unconscious. That’s when I realised I didn’t have my knife. I tried to break the strap of his rucksack with my foot, but it was too strong. Then ski patrol arrived and threw me a knife, and I cut the strap. Richard fell like a rag doll into the snow below. He wasn’t breathing.

Experience: I accidentally bought a giant pig Read more

Ski patrol immediately started doing CPR, and after a minute or so, he started breathing again; then they skied him down the mountain on a stretcher. People said I’d probably saved Richard’s life, but it wasn’t over yet – he left in a critical condition.

That evening, I got a call from Hans. He and Billy were at the hospital, and Richard was sitting up in bed, wearing a neck brace but smiling: he had some broken ribs and a dislodged trachea, but was otherwise OK. He thanked me, and I told him no problem: I’d always wanted to climb a ski tower.

Not even Richard knows for sure what happened on that chairlift. We know his strap got caught; my theory is he must have tried to ski off before the lift swung him back around the bullwheel, hitting his head. He wasn’t able to free himself before the rucksack started choking him. He was hanging like that for between four to six minutes.

Being in such a near-death situation made me realise I needed to take more control of my own destiny. Two weeks later, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. There are always going to be things out of your control, but it’s how you react to them that’s the real game-changer.

Warning: contains scenes of an adult natureA group of fifth-graders in New Jersey were celebrating on Thursday after they won their battle to play mixed-sex basketball, thanks to a high-level intervention from the Catholic church.

The Archbishop of Newark has ordered that St John’s basketball team in the town of Clark be allowed back in their Catholic youth league – two weeks after the team were thrown out for contravening the rules on co-ed play.

St John’s made national headlines earlier this month after league officials gave them an ultimatum: go back to single-sex basketball, or have your results struck from the record. The Newark archdiocese claimed that league guidelines decree that girls and boys must play separately. Two girls played on the St John’s team.

Do Oklahoma City Thunder have a rivalry with the Warriors? Absolutely | Hunter Felt Read more

The league’s decision sparked heavy criticism from players and parents – and a gesture from the boys on the team: they stood in solidarity, and refused to play on unless the girls were allowed back.

A standoff ensued, and the future of the team looked uncertain. In a showdown before a game last week, the league director told referees not to officiate if the girls played. But the team vowed not to give in – and now Cardinal Joseph Tobin, who was installed last month, has officially asked the league to let the mixed team play.

A letter published on Thursday by the archdiocese of Newark, under whose auspices the league is run, read: “Cardinal Tobin believes that the St John’s JV black team should not have been penalized for mistakes that adults responsible for following the league rules may have made.

“The cardinal has directed that the St John’s JV black team may retain its current roster as a co-ed team for the remainder of the current season, and have its win-loss record restored.”

Rob Martel, the St John’s coach and the father of one of the girls on the team, fought back tears when he heard the news. “Our season is going to continue as a team, and we’re going to the playoffs,” he told NJ.com.

Keisha Martel, the team’s assistant coach, said it was simply about basic fairness.

“This is all we ever wanted,” she said. “The cardinal and our pastor from the beginning supported us, and we understand that it was on the advice of counsel and the Catholic youth organization league director that the cardinal rescinded his decision. For him to overturn the CYO league director’s decision speaks volumes, and we are so grateful.

“This was never about being defiant or wanting to break, bend or change rules. It was about fairness for these 10-year-olds, about finishing the season the way they started – together.”

The archdiocese also said the Cardinal has asked officials to convene a group to “study the current league rules regarding participation and team makeup in all age groups.”CLARK -- Let the girls play ball.

That was the message sent Wednesday from the the Archdiocese of Newark's newly installed archbishop, Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, a dramatic reversal of a decision made two weeks ago to remove two 10-year-old girls from St. John's 5th grade CYO basketball team.

After the girls were removed, their nine boy teammates stood in solidarity, refusing to play without them at a game on Friday. The story of their resolve gained widespread publicity after being reported by NJ Advance Media.

The team was told after that game that their season was forfeited because of the "stunt" and the final regular season game was canceled, parents said.

But today, Cardinal Tobin announced that the girls are to be immediately put back on the team, their 7-3 record is to be reinstated, the two regular games that were not played are to be rescheduled and played immediately, and the team is to continue on together into the playoffs.

In a statement, Jim Goodness, spokesman for the archdiocese, wrote, "While he recognizes that the recent decisions by CYO officials were aimed at an appropriate and consistent application of the organization's rules, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, the Archbishop of Newark, believes that the Saint John's JV Black team should not have been penalized for mistakes that adults responsible for following the league rules may have made." See the full statement, below.

After school, the team gathered in the gym where they waited for "an important announcement" from their coach, Rob Martel, who is also the father of one of the girls on the team.

"Our season is going to continue as a team, and we're going to the playoffs," Martel told the group, fighting back tears. Watch how the team reacted in our video, above.

Last year, the team made it all the way to the championship game.

Tobin, who is considered to be a moderate churchman in the mold of Pope Francis, was officially installed on Jan. 6 as the sixth Archbishop of Newark.

The team's coaches said they were in disbelief when they received the word via an email this morning.

"This is all we ever wanted," said Keisha Martel, the team's assistant coach and the mother of one of the girls on the team. "The cardinal and our pastor from the beginning supported us, and we understand that it was on the advice of counsel and the CYO league director that the cardinal rescinded his decision. For him to overturn the CYO league director's decision speaks volumes, and we are so grateful. This was never about being defiant or wanting to break, bend or change rules. It was about fairness for these 10 year olds, about finishing the season the way they started - together."

The decision to remove the girls came weeks ago, after a complaint was filed when St. John's played St. Theresa's, a few miles away in Kenilworth. There, another crusade is being waged - the family of a 7th grade girl, Sydney Phillips, sued after the school wouldn't allow her to play for its boys basketball team. Phillips and her sister were expelled from the school after the suit, but on Feb. 3, an appeals court judge ruled they must be allowed to return to school.

It seemed the St. John's battle could still be won at a point: Seeing the boys' resolve, parents took up the fight and even had St. John's pastor, Rev. Robert G. McBride, hand-deliver a letter to Tobin.

The parents say Tobin initially took their side, saying the girls could at least finish out their season, but days later, he rescinded his decision, citing legal issues, they say.

"We already knew he was on our side based on his reaction to the letter last week," said team parent Alexandra Costa. "He is a breath of fresh air for the archdiocese. We are happy to have him and this just reinforced that."

Goodness had previously said rules specifically state the teams should be boys or girls only at the 5th grade level, and said St. John's athletic director admitted he made an error in allowing the team to exist this way after 4th grade, before which teams are allowed to be coed.

In league rules obtained by NJ Advance Media, there is no mention of whether the teams in the St. John's team's division can or cannot be coed, though other divisions are mentioned as strictly boys or girls teams. The girls played with the boys team for the past four years because there were not enough interested girls their age to form a separate team.

As to the Phillips case, Goodness's statement Wednesday also added that Tobin has directed the archdiocese's legal counsel "to cease seeking to enforce the school's parent/student handbook provision about removal of students because of litigation" and allow the Phillips girls to remain in school.

Goodness also said the Cardinal has asked CYO officials to convene a group to "study the current league rules regarding participation and team makeup in all age groups."

"We want the children to play for the very reasons CYO sports leagues were established: to provide a source of both recreation and reaffirmation of our Christian faith," Tobin said.

On Monday, the team appeared on Good Morning America. The story has been shared in media outlets across the country and appeared in the Washington Post on Feb. 14.

The correspondents take on today’s most newsworthy topics.Lady Gaga brought the house down with her high energy performance at the Super Bowl, which started with her jumping off the roof of the stadium after singing This Land is Our Land as red, white and blue drones flew in formation in the sky above her. The rest of the set was similarly impressive as she stormed through hits including Bad Romance, Poker Face and Born This Way. While light on overt criticism of Trump and his policies, her performance was praised as sending a message of inclusion, hope and acceptanceLee Snover is a born-again Christian, a mother of one, and a boss. She runs a drywall and framing business based in Northampton, Pennsylvania. She manages 15 full-time employees – 50 when you count subcontractors. She calls them her “guys”. They work in four states. She supported John McCain for president in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. She wasn’t in love with either candidate, but it didn’t matter. Her father was a Republican activist and she took after him. She has always been a loyal party soldier.

Then Donald Trump came along, and Snover’s investment in politics changed. “Whatever it takes, that’s what was running through my mind,” she told the Guardian last week. “If I have to lose it all, I need for him to win.”

Before Trump had won any primaries, before he had any campaign offices in Pennsylvania, before the political pros took him seriously, Snover, 48, was a true believer. At a state Republican party meeting in January 2016, she presented herself as Trump’s proxy.

“Lo and behold, I had this Trump table down there,” Snover said. “It was me and one other guy. We were mocked so heavily. I was mocked. ‘Oh my God, look at Lee now, isn’t she hysterical, she’s so nutty. Look at her! Oh my God, she’s off the rails again, look at her. She’s such a renegade.’

“I couldn’t get the party people onboard until after the primary. And then they had no choice. They came kicking and screaming. But that was the party people. Not the people. The people were onboard. You saw the results.”

The results made Snover look like a clairvoyant and her Republican peers look blind. Trump won Snover’s home county of Northampton by four points; he won Pennsylvania; and he won the presidency. The county result was as dramatic as the national result. Northampton had voted twice for Barack Obama and had a long record of Democratic strength built in part on its legendary steel industry, which shuttered in the 1990s. In 2016, the county voted for a Democratic state attorney general and a Democratic state treasurer. But at the top of the ticket it was Trump, by 5,461 votes.

Since the election, the Guardian has been spending time in Northampton County, speaking with Trump supporters – and Trump detractors – about his presidency. How do his supporters understand Trump’s promise to make America great again? And is he seen as delivering on that promise?

To his critics, the first month of Trump’s presidency has been a historic disaster. The worst fears about his discriminatory views, his personal corruption and his authoritarian impulses have, in their eyes, come true. A growing scandal over communications with Russia of unknown scope has claimed the career of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and further fallout seems likely. A federal court blocked Trump’s attempt to ban Muslims from seven countries and suspend refugee admissions. Agencies are headless, leaks are rampant, and aides are congratulated for lying on TV. The new president is historically unpopular, the punchline of many jokes, and the large groups of protesters challenging him across the country are mobilized, motivated and growing.

Trump supporters see things very differently.

They think the president is off to a fine start, with understandable hiccups given the extent to which he and his people are honest-to-God government outsiders. They echo White House strategist Steve Bannon’s labeling of the media as “the opposition party” and blame the press for trying to tear Trump down. They see the protesters as petulant malcontents and repeat Trump’s accusation that some of them are surely getting paid to demonstrate.

As news was breaking in San Francisco that Trump’s travel ban had been blocked by an appeals court, in his south Bethlehem barber shop, Joe D’Ambrosio rated Trump’s performance in office so far as “fantastic”.

“He’s just making good choice after good choice,” D’Ambrosio said, repeating a Trump claim about saving jobs that has been challenged as misleading. “Look how many jobs he’s brought back already, or that he’s in line to bring back. Look at the people in his cabinet. Look at the secretary of state, and all these people that know what the hell they’re doing.

He’s giving them the medicine they don’t want to take. And in two years they’re going to feel so much better Lee Snover

“You see this guy – he told Iran: ‘We’re putting you on notice.’ I love that. So does everybody else,” he said, lauding the aggressive posture of Gen Flynn.

A few days later, the news of Flynn’s downfall was rolling nonstop on cable television, when Peg Ferraro, the only woman on the Northampton County council and also a Trump supporter, shared her view.

“I think he’s a really smart man, and it’s going to be very interesting to see if he can bring his business sense to bear,” Ferraro said. “And I like what I’m seeing, I really do, I like what I’m seeing and hearing. So I think the jury is out.”

At her drywall business, Snover rated Trump’s first three weeks in office as pretty near perfect. “I haven’t seen anyone back away from Trump,” she said. “I haven’t seen anyone doubt. I haven’t seen any retreat.

“Trump is medicine for the American people,” she said. “They don’t want it. I look at the protesters and that’s how I visualize it. It’s like when your parents said you have to take the medicine and you said: ‘Oh my God, don’t give it to me.’ He’s giving them the medicine they don’t want to take. And in two years they’re going to feel so much better. It’s medicine right now. That’s why it tastes so terrible.”

An uneasy truce

The culture of Northampton County politics has traditionally been to disagree as one might, but not to be disagreeable about it. That sense of live-and-let-live has mostly survived the 2016 campaign, judging by dozens of interviews over a month, with fans and foes of the president getting together for dinner, and with protesters taking care to say they are pro-community and pro-country, not anti-Trump.



But neighbors can’t live both side-by-side and on different planets without lapses in understanding, and some Northampton residents tell stories of startling conflict, going back to the months before the election. Families split by political arguments. Obnoxious interactions on Facebook. Physical aggression or threats of harm. Racism shockingly revealed in the heart of a friend or colleague. While the social fabric of life in the Lehigh Valley may not have been torn by the 2016 presidential campaign, it has been frayed. In some neighborhoods, Trump yard signs planted in the fall remain in place, covered by February snow.

Future installments of this series will explore those fault lines. But the county is not a destination stop for connoisseurs of political animus. For one thing, there’s significant policy overlap in Northampton between Republicans and Democrats, who are heard to agree on the need to check immigration, protect American jobs, and promote manufacturing and who may attend the same churches and hold similar conservative social views. The overlap was plain in the thousands of county voters in 2016 who crossed party lines or switched parties to vote for Trump.

Since the Kennedy presidency, D’Ambrosio, a lifelong Democrat, has been cutting hair in south Bethlehem, the city that gave the steel company its name. He still cuts hair but he’s no longer a Democrat. He switched his party membership last year so he could vote for Trump in the the state’s closed primary. “I was behind him from the very beginning,” D’Ambrosio said.

Last spring, the barber turned his shop into something of a satellite Trump campaign office, stocking voter registration forms so that other Democrats who came in could switch parties, too. He hung a Trump cap above his rotary phone for people to try on, check out the fit. He tacked a big Trump billboard up outside.

“The response was great,” D’Ambrosio said. “I can’t tell you how many forms I gave out. I’ll betcha I must have, without exaggeration, converted a hundred people, or more.”

Trump promised to make America great again. The cap on D’Ambrosio’s wall confirms it. But how will the president do it, and how will anyone be able to measure success? Does it lie in unemployment data, or the cost of living, or taxes, or manufacturing growth, national security, or crime data or quality of life or anecdotal evidence?

All of that must be weighed. But while Trump’s promise has economic contours, it goes beyond dollars and cents. As Trump’s supporters tell it, the promise has to do with a regained spirit of possibility and a renewed sense of identity, too. Trump’s promise is both personalized – it means something different for everyone – and universal. People who voted for him describe a shock of recognition when he stepped on to the national stage. They’d been waiting for a candidate like him. They just never dreamed they’d get him.

“I put a big sign up there – ‘Trump’, you know, ‘make America great’,” D’Ambrosio said. “And everybody said to me: ‘What the hell’s wrong with you? You’re in business.’ I said: ‘I’m 76 years old, what do you want from me?’

“I mean I have the right, I worked, did everything, and I can do what I want to do. Just, you know, I like the Eagles, you like the Giants. You know. After the game we shake hands and everything else – what the hell, you’re going to get pissed off? ‘Well, don’t you think you’re gonna lose customers?’ I don’t give a damn if I lose a customer. I don’t want him if he’s gonna get mad at me over my political choice.



“He’s either coming here because he likes me or he likes his haircut. And if he doesn’t like what I do, then I can’t relate to that guy. Stay the hell outta here.”



Did he lose any customers?

“I don’t know. I don’t think so.”

‘Hate has no home here’

“Friday I woke up and decided I was going to hold a unity rally against hate.”

Vanessa Williams, who grew up in Northampton County, describes herself “as Pennsylvania as they come”. One of her grandfathers worked in steel. The other worked in coal. “The house that my mom grew up in, three generations lived in that house,” Williams said.



Williams supported Hillary Clinton for president, saying she found Trump’s rhetoric during the campaign “very offensive”.

“I would say the things that struck me the most were these sort of secretly racist comments, and these dog-whistle sort of comments, and the comments on women specifically – I found those most disconcerting,” she said.

The day after the election, Williams created a Facebook group for former Clinton supporters. Then she decided to hold a bipartisan rally against hate crimes.

You can vote for Trump and I can like you still. Let’s get beyond that first thing Kaitlyn Sommer

“Just the idea that, basically, hate has no home here,” she said. “That was the point. It was not anti-Trump, it had nothing to do with Trump.” The rally drew 150 people, Williams said, and launched an activist network that now includes 3,300 people locally.

As much as Northampton was the scene of a startling Trump victory, it has also been the scene of a wave grassroots activism and community building following the election.

Jennifer Newland is a Democrat and a community activist in the northern, more rural part of the county, known as the slate belt.

“My whole lawn was nothing but Clinton yard signs” during the election, she said. “But many people were afraid to put out Clinton yard signs, because they were afraid of the repercussions. I’d walk outside and people would honk – ‘Go Trump!’ Yeah, you know. Love ya! I mean, it’s just – I would never think about going past someone’s house and being like, ‘Yeah, Hillary!’ Maybe I’m the weird one.”

Newland, a cancer survivor, has been a Girl Scout leader, a parent-teacher association founder, a fire victims aid organizer, a borough council member, a local party leader and a national Clinton delegate. She wants Trump to succeed, she said.

“I never want anyone to fail,” Newland said. “Including Trump. Because if he fails, the world fails. If he fails, we fail. I don’t want him to fail. I have no hate towards him. He fought a good fight and he won. Was he my pick, and do I stand behind his policies? No.



“But somehow we have to reunite and we have to come back together and we have to work all of this out.”

Kaitlyn Sommer, 33, is a Northampton resident and navy veteran who did two deployments to the Persian gulf and conducted anti-pirate operations off the coast of Somalia as a combat systems specialist. Toward the end of her navy career, she went to night school to earn a law degree, and she now works for a judge in Allentown, in neighboring Lehigh County.

Sommer, who volunteered for the Bob Dole campaign as a kid and “reluctantly” voted for George W Bush in 2004, said she found Trump’s gambit early in the 2016 primary race to sit out a debate, to ostentatiously raise money for veterans, to be insincere.

“It kind of felt like, ‘Oh! We’re being used,’” she said. “Throw out this buzzword, people will vote for you because you say you’re helping veterans, and yet you’re also going to take away healthcare from those veterans who need it the most, who are on the street and are relying on Obamacare.”

Sommer is the founder of a local chapter of Team RWB, the veterans’ advocacy group, and she and her husband have volunteered to house college students over the summer who are green card holders and who may not be able to travel home owing to the threat of Trump’s travel ban.

Sommer said she had been discouraged by the animosity the political season had bred. “You can vote for Trump and I can like you still,” she said. “Let’s get beyond that first thing.”

The election result still feels “not good” to Sommer, she said, but she hoped that a greater degree of political engagement would produce greater social good.

“I don’t feel as badly about it as I did at first, just because I’ve realized that I believe more in this country than what one person’s impact is going to be on it,” she said.

In his acceptance speech, Brady thanked his team and fans, and also mentioned a bizarre development in which his game jersey was stolen from the Patriots lockeroom after the finalThe sprinter Nesta Carter has appealed against the decision to strip him and a Jamaican team featuring Usain Bolt of an Olympic 4x100m relay gold medal due to doping, the court of arbitration for sport has announced.

Carter tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine at the 2008 Beijing Olympics after his anti-doping sample was reanalysed, meaning the entire Jamaican relay team lost their title. That included Bolt, meaning he could no longer claim to have done the triple-treble at the Olympics and is instead now an eight-time gold medallist.

A statement from Cas on Friday said that Carter was seeking “to set aside the challenged decision in order for the Jamaican team to be reinstated as gold medallists”.

Usain Bolt stripped of 2008 Olympic relay gold after Nesta Carter fails drug test Read more

It added: “A Cas arbitration procedure is in progress. First, the parties will exchange written submissions and a panel of three arbitrators will be constituted. The panel will then issue directions with respect to the holding of a hearing. Following the hearing, the panel will deliberate and at a later date, it will issue a decision in the form of an arbitral award.”

Cas did not give an indication of how long the process was likely to take.

The International Olympic Committee announced the decision on Carter in January after a hearing in November to discuss Carter’s results following retests of 454 frozen blood and urine samples from the 2008 Games.

Carter, the sixth fastest 100m runner of all time, helped Jamaica set a then-world-record time of 37.10sec in Beijing, as Bolt won the first of the 100m, 200m and 4x100m treble. But under the rules of the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, all four members of Jamaica’s 4x100m squad in 2008, which was made up of Bolt, Carter, Asafa Powell and Michael Frater, will now lose their medals.

The 31-year-old has been a vital member of Jamaica’s 4x100m relay team for nearly a decade, running the first leg as they won gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Games and the 2011, 2013 and 2015 world championships, but missed the 2016 Rio Olympics.Michael Sheen, the actor who has portrayed Brian Clough, Tony Blair and David Frost, talks to the Guardian’s Owen Jones.

By Chris Emma–

(CBS) DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association, is prepared to tell potential free agents not to sign with the Bears should a new Illinois bill that he says targets athletes is passed.

Under Illinois state law, injured workers can claim disability benefits known as a “wage differential award,” a calculation based on two-thirds of the difference between the average salary they could earn pre-injury and the average salary they could earn in “some suitable employment or business” after the injury.

Most permanently injured workers in Illinois can claim compensation benefits until they’re 67 years old. However, legislation sponsored by Illinois Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno (R-Lemont) would end workers’ compensation benefits for professional athletes when they turn 35, unless they can prove their expected playing career would last longer than that.

Smith told the Spiegel & Parkins Show on Friday that the bill is being pushed by the McCaskey family, the owners of the Bears.

“This bill being sponsored by Ms. Radogno is simply designed to target professional athletes and take away their right to health care that every worker in the state of Illinois is entitled to,” Smith told the Spiegel & Parkins Show.

“The Bears’ owners are behind it as well. To be blunt, it’s just another way to bankroll the coffers of the rich owners who own these teams at the expense of the players who actually do all the work … They’re pushing the bill. Our understanding is they are the people who have lined up a lobbyist to promote the bill.”

The Bears released a statement to 670 The Score:

“We join the four other major professional Chicago teams in monitoring and supporting changes to the system that protect athletes’ rights under the workers’ compensation system while acknowledging athletes are not competing professionally until age 67. Nothing in the wage differential language under consideration impacts the right for any athlete to receive just compensation for partial or permanent injury, medical benefits or to file a claim itself.”

Smith described the bill as “just a chicken-scratch thing thrown into the budget at the last minute.” He also referred to previous cases similar to this one around the league.

“Its only effect is to hurt people who get hurt for a living,” Smith added.

“It’s just cheapness. It’s just being cheap.”

Should this bill pass, Smith and the NFLPA plan to sway players from signing with the Bears.

“I will tell you from the bottom of my heart that this union will tell every potential free agent player, if this bill passes, to not come to the Bears,” Smith said. “Because, think about it, if you’re a free agent player and you have an opportunity to go play somewhere else where you can get lifetime medical for the injury you’re going to have, isn’t a smarter financial decision to go to a team where a bill like this hasn’t passed?”

Fevered media speculation about Donald Trump’s psychological motivations and psychiatric diagnosis has recently encouraged mental health professionals to disregard the usual ethical constraints against diagnosing public figures at a distance. They have sponsored several petitions and a Feb. 14 letter to The New York Times suggesting that Mr. Trump is incapable, on psychiatric grounds, of serving as president.

Most amateur diagnosticians have mislabeled President Trump with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. I wrote the criteria that define this disorder, and Mr. Trump doesn’t meet them. He may be a world-class narcissist, but this doesn’t make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder.

Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr. Trump (who is neither).

Bad behavior is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely. Psychiatric name-calling is a misguided way of countering Mr. Trump’s attack on democracy. He can, and should, be appropriately denounced for his ignorance, incompetence, impulsivity and pursuit of dictatorial powers.

His psychological motivations are too obvious to be interesting, and analyzing them will not halt his headlong power grab. The antidote to a dystopic Trumpean dark age is political, not psychological.

The Mail Online article published on 11 January tells the story of a man who fired a shotgun in a supermarket in Spain’s northwestern region of Galicia. The report began: “A gunman has opened fire in a Spanish supermarket shouting ‘Allahu Akbar.’”

It added: “One employee confirmed that he had shouted the Arabic phrase for ‘God is great’ before he began shooting.”



The Mail Online story received a considerable reaction on social media, and was shared 19,000 times.

This breaking news tweet received hundreds of retweets:

The Mail story has been shared on various pages including those of the far-right group Britain First and supporters of the anti-Muslim Dutch politician Geert Wilders, while the Express article was cross-posted on the blog of Pamela Geller, an anti-Muslim commentator from the US, who added: “It. is. Islam.”

Britain First Facebook/ Screengrab, Geert Wilders Supporters Facebook/ Screengrab, Geller Report/ Screengrab ID: 10319437

However, since publication of the articles, Spanish news sites, including those for English-speaking expats, have dismissed the accounts in the story being widely shared online, with the Spain Report writing a piece headlined: “Mercadona And Police Refute British Reports Of Jihadi Suicide Attack In Spanish Supermarket.”

The article gives details of the incident that differ to what was first reported in the British press. Spanish police and Mercadona, the supermarket chain, both confirmed to the Spain Report that a man fired shots at a store in the city of Ourense but said it was not part of a terrorist attack and refuted claims reported by The Sun and the Daily Mail.

According to the version of events in Spanish media, the shots caused damage to the drinks aisle, but no one was hurt. An off-duty policeman in the shop at the time attempted to calm the man down before back-up arrived.

In a statement to BuzzFeed News, a spokesperson for Mercadona confirmed: “The shots fired at a store in Ourense (Galicia) were not part of a terrorist attack. He did not shout “Allahu Akbar” and he wasn’t wearing a suicide vest.

“He is a Spanish national with some kind of decreased mental faculties, as the police has said. He was born in the Basque country and he was shouting in his local language (this has been the reason of the confusion).”

“He had no terrorist link at all,” a police spokesperson told the Spain Report. “It was not a robbery either. At one point in the video footage, he can be seen eating a banana and smoking a cigarette,” the article went on to say.

This version of events tallies with other contemporary Spanish-language reports, which were more guarded about what he said.

heraldo.es ID: 10320069

Speaking to BuzzFeed News about the way the story had been reported in Spain compared with the British press, Matthew Bennett, the editor of the Spain Report, said: “There had been nothing in the Spanish press, it wasn’t the typical response of a major story when these major stories happen. There had been no huge social media reaction in Spain. Apart from a few local stories there wasn’t very much coverage in Spain.



“If it had been true we would have known about it.”

He added: “I picked up the phone and spoke to some sources. Nothing spectacular I’m afraid. No huge investigation.”

Police told local newspaper La Region that a witness had been mistaken and added that they had discounted any suggestions of jihadist links. The Olive Press, another Spanish news website, wrote: “Despite reports from Spanish and UK press, he is not believed to have shouted ‘Alahu Akbar’, the Arabic phrase for God is Great.”

The Local, a European English-language news website, reported in its story headlined “Man detained in supermarket shootout was ‘not jihadist’” that the 35-year-old, who was detained by police after the incident at lunchtime on Wednesday, was said to have a mental illness.

Miqdaad Versi, who monitors media reports on Muslims and Islam and who has forced a number of retractions and corrections by national newspapers, has since complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about the inaccurate reporting by the three newspapers.

The Sun has since changed its headline on this particular story:

The Sun corrects false claim of terror attack by gunman shouting Allahu Akbar (actually robbery by Stefan): no reco… https://t.co/HbRBPougIw — Miqdaad Versi (@miqdaad) ID: 10319689

Versi said: “There have now been a number of stories on this false claim and it has even been shared by the far right. It is appalling that such articles can be written with so little care for the truth – and even now, whilst The Sun has at least corrected their story, it has done so without even acknowledging or apologising for their error. This is just not good enough and we need much stronger policies in place to prevent such stories being written in the first place.”



On Twitter he pointed out how headlines on the Express and Mail Online stories were yet to be corrected and said they were more “false”.

The idea that all women want to be mothers is outdated and sexist, argues Julie Bindel.

Who is responsible for China’s chronic and deadly air pollution? That depends on who you ask. Officials blame the weather or outdoor barbecues, activists blame steel companies and coal-fired power plants. But Yu Wensheng blames only one actor: the government.



The 50-year-old lawyer recently launched an unprecedented suit against the authorities in three regions in China, claiming they have failed in their responsibilities. For a government with the motto “Serve the People”, Yu feels the officials are serving other interests by allowing nearly half a billion people to choke on toxic smog.

“Our bodies are being harmed because of the ineffectiveness of our government; because of their inaction and carelessness, we suffer,” Yu told the Guardian. “The pollution has affected my family, my son is coughing, I’m also coughing, and I feel the smog caused this. I am suing as a victim.”

Northern China is frequently blanketed with thick clouds of deadly smog that is linked to almost a third of all deaths in the country – and caused by steel plants, a heavy reliance on coal for heat and power generation, plus millions of cars. While the authorities have “declared war on pollution”, many feel progress has been slow and the region is still hit with a yearly bout of “airpocalypse”.

We have laws, regulations and systems to combat pollution, but they’re not being enforced Cheng Hai

Yu and four other lawyers have filed cases against the governments of the capital Beijing, the neighbouring port city of Tianjin, and Hebei province, home to some of the country’s most polluted cities.

“If the authorities don’t accept the case or use some other method to dismiss it, it can only show the government has a bad attitude in the face of pressure from the citizens,” Yu says. “That would clearly show they don’t serve the citizens at all.”

Several in the group have been pressured by local branches of the justice ministry to withdraw the cases and another lawyer has already dropped out after he was visited by police in his hometown. But Yu is undeterred, having previously spent stints in detention, where he says he was tortured.



President Xi Jinping has made building “rule of law” a hallmark of his tenure, but critics say the ruling Communist party remains above the law and ordinary citizens still struggle for justice. The country’s top judge rejected the idea of judicial independence in a speech last month, dismissing it as a “western” notion.

In the wake of the lawyers announcing their lawsuit, China’s powerful censorship authorities issued a blanket ban on any discussion of the case – a rare edict for an environmental issue. In recent years the government has allowed some space for citizens to vent their anger over the country’s chronically toxic air.

Even government media frequently publishes articles lamenting pollution. In the midst of a week-long bout of bad air in the beginning of January, the state-run China Daily published an editorial lambasting the government for not doing enough to tackle the problem.

“No matter how much importance the government says it has attached to pollution control, no matter how many efforts may have actually been made in this regard, the heaviest smog that has extended for the longest time and covered the largest number of cities in years flies in the face of the country’s fight against environmental pollution,” the paper wrote.

Environmental suits have been successful in the past, particularly civil cases suing for monetary compensation. A Chinese court ordered US oil giant ConocoPhillips to pay damages to 21 fisherman who claimed their livelihoods suffered after a spill at an oil rig operated by the company.



China allowed nongovernmental organisations to sue companies in 2015, with the goal of civil society taking a greater role in holding polluters accountable. NGOs with government affiliation and backing have been much more likely to have a case accepted by courts than independent groups.

But one of Yu’s colleagues sees little point in targeting companies.

“We have to sue the government,” says Cheng Hai, another lawyer involved in the case. “A business can only control the emissions from its factories, but the government can reduce emissions across all the polluting industries. We have laws, regulations and systems to combat pollution, but they’re not being enforced.”

Their initial attempt at filing the case was rebuffed by a Beijing court, with court officials saying a case against each government needed to be filed separately in each location.

“There’s no point in just suing one government, such as Beijing,” Cheng says. “This is a regional problem and all three governments need to be held accountable for there to be any effect. If we don’t sue, the air will just get worse.”

The lawyers have since refiled their cases and are waiting for a response. But even if the court agrees to hear the cases, the chance of a landmark victory is almost nonexistent.

“This lawsuit on this topic at this moment in history is going to be an uphill battle,” says Rachel Stern, author of Environmental Litigation in China: A Study in Political Ambivalence. “I would be surprised if this lawsuit is successful, and if I were betting, I don’t even think it will get accepted by the court.”

For the first 15 years of his law career, Yu shunned political cases, instead practising corporate and civil law. But in 2014 he staged a one-man protest, standing outside a Beijing detention centre for hours after he was barred from visiting a client held there.



Two days later, police took him away. He would not emerge for more than three months, while interrogators accused him of supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which were at the time clogging the city’s financial centre with hundreds of thousands of people.

“I really had nothing to do with the Hong Kong protests, but those 99 days changed my entire life,” Yu says.

Once he was released, Yu put aside many commercial cases to focus on defending human rights, and was detained again in 2015 as part of a nationwide crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists.

“When I became a lawyer, I thought could contribute to society,” he says. “But after practising law, I found that it was not like that at all – because China is not a rule of law society, but a rule by law society.”

Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to investigating one of the worst preventable causes of death around the world: air pollution. Explore our coverage in The Air We Breathe and follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussionWhen The Good Wife premiered in 2009 it was a spunky legal procedural, with a central character boasting a juicy backstory, but a procedural nonetheless. Each week delivered a new case that was easily solved within an hour and familiar plot points were ticked off with slick yet predictable ease.

But somewhere along the way, it transformed itself into essential, often daring television. It maintained its case-a-week format but kept each one fresh and thrillingly topical while choreographing the out-of-courtroom drama with increasing skill and subtlety. The end of the seventh and final season was something of a loss then, yet sensing a world worth revisiting, CBS gave the green light to a spin-off, to premiere on the channel itself yet continue on their new on-demand platform. Such a release is a hefty risk, especially for CBS viewers, yet for digitally competent Good Wife fans it is a rich reward, offering the promise of another sleekly designed peek into a fascinating universe.

Goodbye to The Good Wife, a miracle of the small screen Read more

With the titular wife out of the picture, there are three female leads in her place, two of whom we’re already acquainted with. The show opens with Diane (Christine Baranski) watching Donald Trump’s inauguration, appalled (as with its parent show, The Good Fight remains joyfully leftwing on a channel dominated by middle America fare). It’s something of a last straw for her and she decides to retire, using her savings to buy a home in France. But tragedy strikes. Her choice to make investments with an old college friend’s company results in bankruptcy after a Bernie Madoff-style financial scam.

She’s broke but also unemployed, her firm refusing to rescind her resignation. And she’s not the only one affected by the scandal. Her god-daughter Maia (Game of Thrones’ Rose Leslie) is also in the line of fire, given that her parents are front and centre of the controversy, and her career as a lawyer is already facing a massive pothole. Finally, both are up against Lucca (Cush Jumbo), Diane’s ex-colleague who now works for a predominantly black firm, in a case involving police brutality. By the end of the first episode, the cards are reshuffled yet again and our main three characters are set on a combative new course for the rest of the season.

As largely uninventive television execs continue to show us, the small screen spin-off is a tough recipe to perfect. For every Frasier, there’s a Joey – and arriving at a time when every other show on TV is a reboot or remake, it would be easy to cast aside the mere idea of this as creatively bankrupt. But the stellar team behind The Good Fight have used all the lessons learned through seven seasons of The Good Wife to start off with confidence and flair, immediately grabbing our attention and crafting a dramatic structure that hints at even greater things to come.

While the Madoff-aping setup might not smell quite as fresh as the real world issues The Good Wife used to cover, it’s nonetheless an interesting way of bringing Diane crashing back to earth. There’s also a challenge on her white privilege at play. Previously, her firm had been accused of racial bias within their hiring strategy and now she finds herself battling her last case for them, stranded on the wrong side of a racially motivated police attack. But by the end of the episode, her position has drastically changed and future episodes will force her to examine her arguably staid views.

It’s a pleasure to see Baranski given the lead and also a striking rarity, handing over a major new show to a 64-year-old woman. It’s also great to see Jumbo back, her commanding well-worn shtick working well alongside Leslie’s fresh-faced newcomer.

It’s set to be a somewhat brief season (just 10 exploratory episodes) but the opener provides a welcome reminder of what The Good Wife did so well while spicing it up with a range of new dynamics. It’s an immensely satisfying show that combines soapy machinations with grounded legalese and an authentic awareness of contemporary America.

According to Maria Fernanda Cabello, an immigration activist and Daca recipient, Thursday’s action was a demonstration that “immigrants are ready to show their power on the streets”, in anticipation of holding even larger events in the coming months.

“Through non-cooperation of our labor and by not purchasing we’re just making a really bold statement that this country is sustained by us,” Cabello said.

Immigrants rights organizations are not the only ones organizing around these types of economic and service disruption protests. Earlier this month, Yemeni grocery stores closed throughout New York City in protest of Trump’s travel ban executive order. On Friday more than 80 locations nationwide are hosting events aimed at building towards “a series of mass strikes”, with participants staying home from work and school, and not spending any money at businesses.

“We need to be able to show our power and one of the ways we do that historically, both in this nation and many other countries, is through our job and our workplace, and sometimes taking back our work,” said Todd Wolfson, one of the lead organizers of Friday’s #Strike4democracy.

Organizers see the day as a “preview” of an even larger mass strike planned for March. That action, billed as “a day without women” by organizers, is a follow-up of the massive Women’s March protest movement that brought millions into the streets the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated.

The idea of a general strike as a means of expressing political or social dissatisfaction is fairly novel in the US. Labor experts cite the 1919 Seattle general strike as the last such demonstration, but even there workers were at least as motivated by ordinary union concerns about wages and workplace conditions as they were about sending a broader political message endorsing socialism.

The tactic has been used in other countries regularly since the industrial revolution with varying degrees of success. India and France have both seen large-scale general strikes in the past eight years, but even these were primarily orchestrated by public sector workers whose connection to the government is more direct than private sector workers.

The prospect of a primarily political general strike in the US is, to all intents and purposes, unprecedented. New York University social and cultural analysis professor Andrew Ross said that during Occupy Wall Street there were some intimations towards a general strike, but a lack of buy-in from establishment labor unions stifled the effort before it got off the ground.

“One strong interpretation of that is that Occupy was a very horizontal-type movement … Most trade union organizations are highly hierarchical and they didn’t necessarily want their members catching the Occupy bug,” Ross said.

Without full-throated support from major trade and industrial unions, general strikes face an uphill challenge in gathering enough leverage to affect the economy and send a loud message. Workers who strike under these circumstances also face a higher likelihood of losing their job for missing work. Still, Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University said the right strikes at the right time, even without dramatically high numbers of participants, can be effective in the right industries.

“Rolling strikes, also called rotating strikes, have proven effective among flight attendants and pilots – groups of workers who are difficult to replace if they strike. They have also proven effective in the $15/hour minimum wage movement among fast-food workers, a case in which a few workers out can close an entire store. So the effectiveness of rolling strikes would depend on ‘strategic location’. A few workers on strike here or there can shut down an entire operation,” Chaison said.

Although the Friday event has been dubbed a “general strike”, Wolfson said he doesn’t yet expect it to reach single-day critical mass.

“It’s a fine imagination for us to hold, but I think we need to be really honest about where this country is and what we’re ready for. It is a seedling towards that, though.”

Cabello, who is helping to organize what she hopes will be a larger day without immigrants on 1 May or “May Day”, an internally recognized day of labor activism and celebration, said the purpose of the day without immigrant strikes is to “move the conversation from ‘are immigrants wanted’ to ‘are immigrants needed’”.

There are more than eight million undocumented immigrants in the US workforce, and they make up a disproportionate number of workers in several industries, including construction and food services.

“‘A Day without Immigrants’ would take a great deal of organizing and coordination to gain worker participation but would provide real proof to the public of the critical role that immigrants play in our economy as workers,” said Chaison.

Cabello admits it will be difficult, but said she sees no shortage of enthusiasm among immigrant communities for getting involved in this type of direct action. “A lot of immigrants get it and feel like ‘I might lose some money but what I can get in exchange could be worth so much more than a week of my wage’.”You can’t buy happiness but you can buy tap shoes, and that’s kind of the same thing according to a growing number of people who have taken up tap dancing following the release of the hit musical La La Land.

The all-singing, all-dancing feature, starring Ryan Gosling as cool jazz enthusiast Sebastian and Emma Stone as down-on-her-luck actor Mia, won six Golden Globes, five Baftas, and matched the record for the most amount of Oscar nominations (14). But notably, it has also inspired a new generation of filmgoers to take up the art once popularised by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.



“Our beginners’ classes have got really popular this year, tap has suddenly sky rocketed into the forefront,” said Rory Cubbin, 27, a dance tutor at City Academy in London. “People used to want to be Fred and Ginger, now they come to class and say they want to be Ryan and Emma.”

Cubbin has been tap dancing for nine years, having switched over to musical theatre from ballet at the age of 18. This year, demand for his classes has been so high that City have had to put on several more beginners’ courses as well as a separate one which just teaches the sequences from La La Land.

On a Friday morning in the studio, he ran me through a few classic tap numbers: toe taps, heel beats, four beat riffs, shuffle hop steps and more. Any anxiety, I quickly found, was replaced by the magical tenacity induced by a pair of clacking shoes on my feet.

“Our clientele is completely mixed,” Cubbin explained. “In the same class, I have an A-level student and a couple of ladies who have just retired. Some are even thinking about a change of career and want to take up tap professionally.

“I see lots more men coming to class too; usually I have one or two in a course, this year I have 16 male beginners. I try and make it fun for everyone. Tap doesn’t work if you’ve got too much tension, if you’re thinking too much. The studio is the one safe place you’re allowed to make mistakes.” One customer, he added, recently told him she always leaves his classes in a good mood.

Fiona Byrne, 30, a freelance illustrator, started a beginners’ class in tap because she wanted to do more exercise, but after a tour of her local gym was completely demotivating she decided to try her hand at something new. “I feel really good after tap classes – confident, happy,” she said. “They’ve had much more of a positive effect than I was anticipating. I was originally apprehensive about going, as an adult to go on your own to dance classes you have to be outgoing or brave, but it was completely relaxed and fun.”

Byrne signed up for the tap lessons and then went to see La La Land. “It’s nice to know there are a lot of people interested in tap now, and to have a contemporary reference. Before I saw the film, I was looking at videos online of people tap dancing and it was mostly kids doing recitals or videos from decades ago. It’s nice to have a modern inspiration. People in the class chat about the movie as well. In our first lesson someone said they wanted to learn the routine from the film.”

“I think La La Land makes people who haven’t danced before feel there is a possibility for them,” Lesley Osman from Danceworks said. “It touches people’s hearts, and dance is all about what you feel.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dance studios in New York and LA have also seen a spike in people signing up for tap lessons. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for The Guardian

Osman said Danceworks had had a spike in all of its classes, particularly tap and musical theatre, and colleagues in New York and LA had also reported “jam-packed” classes. “We’re going to introduce a tap class for younger kids as well, which we haven’t done for years. We have a ballet academy and quite a few parents asked if we could add tap into the curriculum because it’s coming back into fashion. People watch the movie and think that looks so fun.”

Such seasonal changes are not unusual, James Blackwell from City Academy said. “After Strictly Come Dancing there was a spike in young people taking ballroom. The perception of tap has changed because of the super slickness of La La Land. When you’ve got people like Ryan and Emma doing it, it becomes glamorous.”

Caleb Newman from Pineapple dance studios said they too had seen an increased interest in tap. “It’s a real treat to see so many young people becoming interested in the art form – once they start they quickly become aware of the legacy and influence of bygone stars such as Astaire, Rogers, Gregory Hines, and how much they influence today’s pop videos,” Newman said, adding that La La Land also resonated with Pineapple’s younger tutors, who are around the same age as Stone.

“The film shows the struggle young performers face as they pursue their artistic ambitions. This is a universal story; the fact that it is told in musical form engages the tutors on a deeper level – it may reflect their journey while at the same time offering them performances that inspire them.

“It’s also a great talking point with students. The more awards the film gathers the more it becomes a part of the everyday, impossible to ignore.”

Osman said: “It’s interesting watching people realising they don’t have two left feet, they don’t have to embarrassed, they can dance. Sometimes people just need a bit of inspiration. Dancing is good for everybody, for your health, your wellbeing. It feeds your soul, and La La Land catches that so well.”

While my hour with Cubbin didn’t transform me into an instant pro – I can’t walk in a straight line on a good day – I did return to the office with a special kind of souvenir, that of a Hollywood spring in my step.After the teaser for the upcoming Disney live-action remake broke viewing records in August, the latest and final trailer of the 1991 animated film classic starring Emma Watson serves up new footage and scenes – as well as Ariana Grande and John Legend’s duet on the film’s theme songOlder, more polluting cars will have to pay a £10 charge to drive in central London from 23 October, the city’s mayor has said.

Confirming he would press ahead with the fee, known as the T-charge, Sadiq Khan said: “It’s staggering that we live in a city where the air is so toxic that many of our children are growing up with lung problems. If we don’t make drastic changes now we won’t be protecting the health of our families in the future.

“That is why today, on the 14th anniversary of the start of the congestion charge, I’ve confirmed we are pressing ahead with the toughest emission standard of any major city, coming to our streets from 23 October.”

The announcement came after fresh warnings this week about the poor quality of London’s air.

The mayor spoke as he launched an online vehicle checker on the Transport for London website so drivers can check whether their vehicle will be affected by the T-charge, whose introduction coincides with the start of the autumn half-term.

The levy is expected to affect up to 10,000 of the oldest, most polluting vehicles every week day, as it will apply to motorists who own vehicles that do not meet Euro 4 standards – typically those diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006.

It will operate on top of, and during the same times, as the congestion charge, meaning it will cost £21.50 a day to drive a pre-Euro 4 vehicle in centre London between 7am and 6pm Monday to Friday.

London joins a growing number of cities around the world taking action against rising air pollution. In Paris, older more polluting vehicles are now banned between 8am-8pm on weekdays.

Khan launched a consultation on the T-charge proposals last July at Great Ormond Street hospital for children, whose chief executive, Dr Peter Steer, said at the time: “The mayor’s drive to clean up the capital’s air is fantastic news for our patients and staff. Children living in highly polluted areas are four times more likely to have reduced lung function in adulthood, yet improving air quality has been shown to halt and reverse this effect.”

Air pollution is believed to cause almost 40,000 premature deaths every year in the UK and was in April labelled a “public health emergency” by a cross-party committee of MPs. The government is facing a new legal challenge over the adequacy of its plans to tackle the issue, having already lost a previous case in 2015.

Last year Khan published research that showed numerous schools in the capital were in areas that exceeded safe legal pollution levels. His plan to cut air pollution includes extending the ultra-low emission zone beyond central London to the North and South Circular roads from 2019. Drivers would not pay both the ULEZ and the new £10 charge and the latter will not apply to taxis.

Other suggestions for tackling the problem include a national diesel scrappage scheme, which the government would have to implement. Paying owners to scrap their their cars is supported by some MPs but other groups argue the money would be better spent supporting public transport and cycling and walking.

WARNING: strong language

Donald Trump’s controversial executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries is being tightened up to get around legal and constitutional objections with minimal input from the National Security Council, the Guardian has learned.

Donald Trump considers using national guard to round up immigrants, memo suggests Read more

The White House policy director, Stephen Miller, is at the helm as the process for refugee and immigration policy is going through the domestic policy council, which does not include most of the government’s foreign policy or security-related agencies.



Trump made clear at his chaotic 77-minute press conference on Thursday “we’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country” at the same time as fighting the executive order which was blocked by the courts.

The goal of the new order is to bolster a signature initiative against ongoing legal and constitutional scrutiny, rather than revise it in a substantive fashion, relax its restrictions or consider any deleterious consequences it has on national security, according to Guardian sources.

The process means domestic political concerns are given greater priority and consideration of their national security impact is marginalized despite the impact on US relations with much of the world.

Observers consider the NSC’s diminished role symptomatic of Trump’s approach to governance and expressed alarm that Trump has not corrected course.

More than 1,000 US diplomats have signed a dissent to the travel ban Trump issued last month, which is currently blocked by the courts, objecting on the grounds that it will have a deleterious impact on the US’s security and international reputation. Their signatures came before the current process of revision through the DPC, on which the state department does not have a seat.

Though sources cautioned that deliberations on the new order are fluid and ongoing, the initial discussions of the imminent order contradict the justice department’s promise to the ninth circuit court of appeals of a “substantially revised executive order”.

Activists have been bracing for revisions that add more countries to the ban, either from the Muslim world or from outside it, in order to soften its edges. But the early White House deliberations on a revamped executive order have focused on the seven nations already included in the ban, not additional ones or fewer. Those countries are Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Sudan.

Officials working on the next order have signaled their intent to make a stronger case for why the ban needs to apply to the seven countries. That intent stems from an attempt to overcome mounting legal scrutiny and make the order seem both less arbitrary in its particulars and something other than a “Muslim ban” in its effect.

Officials are also belatedly examining refugee screening procedures worldwide, both as they existed under Barack Obama and currently.



In addition to the legal hurdles Trump’s ban faces, it has led to substantial international acrimony. Both Iraq and Iran have publicly mulled retaliatory measures against Washington.



Some see the reduced role of the National Security Council over the issue as a contributing factor behind the haste in the order’s drafting and the international opposition it has received.

“If an action is taken domestically that has an international consequence, it should be flowed through the NSC. By not doing so, you end up exactly where you did the last time, with the alienation of allies in Europe and the Islamic world,” said David Rothkopf, author of a history of the NSC, who considered the NSC’s diminishing relevance a sign that “a small clique of loyalists” dominate Trump’s policymaking process.



“The state department takes a strong stance on the immigration issue and the White House, when it sort of goes to immigration 2.0, cuts them out altogether.”

Ronald Newman, the former director for human rights and refugee protection on the National Security Council under Obama, said that refugee policy took “months” to craft each year, with the NSC convening the intelligence agencies and a variety of foreign and domestic-focused departments, from the Department of Health and Human Services to the state department.

Considering the new administration’s approach, he said: “It does sound more political. The worrisome thing is, it’s hard for me to believe that any process that factors in the relevant concerns, the foreign policy or the domestic ones, could have occurred in the five days it took to issue that executive order,” said Newman, who left the NSC in October.

Beyond the executive order process itself, the National Security Council is in turmoil.

Trump on Monday fired Michael Flynn, his national security adviser and the council’s chair, following revelations that Flynn discussed sanctions easement with Russia’s US ambassador and misled Vice-President Mike Pence about the conversation. An intended replacement, retired vice-admiral Robert Harward, turned down the job, citing family issues in a statement; CNN reported Harward had privately called the position a “shit sandwich”.

The White House strategy chief, Steve Bannon, denounced as a white nationalist who used to run the hard-right Breitbart news service, runs another internal group within the White House. It is called the Strategic Initiatives Group (SIG), and is considered a rival power center, one that has left current and former officials wondering where the true policymaking authority for vital security challenges lies. At one point SIG was listed on an internal White House organization chart as connected by a parallel line to the NSC.

Before Harward took himself out of the running for national security adviser, Colin Kahl, the former security adviser to Joe Biden, said the effectiveness of the next national security adviser depended in part on “how successful he is in shutting down parallel national security structures in the West Wing, most notably Bannon’s Strategic Initiatives Group”.

Rothkopf added: “The NSC is being marginalized in favor of Bannon, [Trump son-in-law Jared] Kushner, the SIG, et cetera, and in favor of a handful of domestic policy advisers.”

White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.A Canadian university professor claims to have found the only existing moving picture of French writer Marcel Proust.

The black-and-white footage of a wedding cortege filmed in 1904 shows a brief glimpse of a man in his 30s with a neat moustache, wearing a bowler hat and pearl-grey formal suit, descending a flight of stairs on his own. Most of the other guests are in couples.

Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan, a professor at the Laval University in Quebec, believes the film, which he found in the Centre National du Cinéma in Paris, could contain the only known footage of the author.

Sirois-Trahan says the film is of the marriage of Élaine Greffulhe, daughter of the Countess of Greffulhe, who was one of Proust’s close friends and the principal inspiration for his character Oriane de Guermantes in À La Recherche du Temps Perdu (In Search of Lost Time).

Luc Fraisse, director of the Review of Proustian Studies, has no doubt the film shows Proust.

“Because we know every detail of Proust’s life, we know from several sources that during those years he wore a bowler hat and pearl grey suit... It’s moving to say to ourselves that we are the first to see Proust since his contemporaries... even if it would be better if he was descending the steps a little less quickly! It’ll be fine when we have slowed the film down,” Fraisse told Le Point magazine.

Sorbonne professor Jean-Yves Tadié, another Proust specialist, said he was delighted. “I’ve always thought we’d end up seeing him in a news film. The shape of the face, the approximate way of dressing, all corresponds to him, and the identification seems quite convincing,” Tadié told Le Point.

He added: “I find this discovery very moving, and all the more so because Proust always had an ambiguous relationship with moving images.

“It’s astonishing that nobody has thought to look for Proust in the archives of films of the Greffulhes before... It shows that new discoveries are still possible, even about an author who, it would seem, has already been so minutely studied.”

Proust died in 1922 aged 51. His most famous work, In Search of Lost Time, was published in seven parts between 1913 and 1927.

Sirois-Trahan, however, remains cautious about his find. “Everything leads us to believe this could be Proust,” he said, but added: “There can be no absolute proof that it is indeed Proust. But in any case, it’s a valuable document about the world of In Search of Lost Time.”404

The device, a hybrid that can be used both handheld and with a TV when in a dock, will go on sale on 3 March priced $299.99 in the US and £279.99 in the UK. Other European prices will vary, Nintendo said.

The pricing is higher than had been rumoured and makes the Switch more expensive than rivals Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One S.

The new gaming platform wants to do everything at once, executives said, from the old-school fantasy of its flagship launch title, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, to party games played face-to-face rather than in front of a screen.

The Switch “inherited all of Nintendo’s entertainment DNA” across the company’s broad line of products, said Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s head of software development.

The presentation, which was streamed live, ended with a surprise revelation: the long-delayed Breath of the Wild, originally planned as an exclusive to the Wii U platform, will go on sale with the new console.

The first Mario game for the platform will not debut until later in the year: Super Mario Odyssey, “a large Mario sandbox world,” in the words of producer Yoshiaki Koizumi, will exile Mario to an unknown world – our own. Footage from the game shown at the presentation featured Mario leaping through realistic forests and over yellow taxi cabs. Koizumi also produced the Mario Galaxy franchise for the company.

And Nintendo may be mending fences with third-party developers: Electronic Arts executive Patrick Soderland said the game company’s wildly popular Fifa football franchise would return to the Switch after years of refusing to make versions of its games for the Wii U. The hugely popular building game Minecraft will also be coming to the Switch, its makers confirmed



Nintendo is also rolling back its digital rights-management protections slightly: the company will not region-lock its games, Kimishima told the audience, meaning that Switch games will be playable whether or not they were purchased in the same country as the console itself.

The company merged its living-room console and handheld device divisions to create the Switch: the machine has a built-in screen so it can function as a tablet-sized handheld gaming device, but it also plugs into a dock attached to a television. Its single complex controller splits into two simpler controllers for in-person multiplayer.



Nintendo has doubled down on its non-standard hardware design largely in the service of keeping users off the couch. Kouichi Kawamoto, general hardware director for Nintendo, introduced a game called 1, 2 Switch similar to the simple, sometimes acrobatic Wii Sports games that came with the company’s original Wii system. Players quick-draw their controllers like gunslingers in a western or battle with swords, among other activities. 1, 2 Switch “isn’t a game you play facing the screen, it is a game that is primarily played through face-to-face interaction,” Kawamoto said. The executive suggested bringing the game to parties and called it “an icebreaker for all kinds of fun communication.”

A new online multiplayer service debuts with the Switch, but like competitors Sony and Xbox, Nintendo’s service will be subscriber-only by the end of the year, with a grace period of a few months for early adopters.

Among other new game announcements:



Nintendo will make a sequel to its Wii U paint-gun game Splatoon for the Switch

Along the lines of popular 1980s title Punch-Out, Nintendo will release Arms, a boxing game starring creatures with long springs for arms, playable online against other Switchers

Eccentric developer Suda51 did not quite say a new No More Heroes game was on its way, but he did say “Travis Touchdown is coming to the Nintendo Switch.”

Toshiro Nagoshi of one-time Nintendo nemesis Sega said his company “will consider new games for the Nintendo Switch and present them soon.”

Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty ImagesAt a stadium rally in Lyon, Emmanuel Macron, the maverick centrist outsider who has become a leading contender in the French presidential race, lowered his normally fervent tone and looked earnestly out at the crowd. “I’m a child of provincial France,” he declared. “Nothing pre-destined me to be here today.”

If the French presidential race is often seen as a battle to elect a republican monarch, the enigmatic Macron’s life-story is crucial to his bid. The 39-year-old has never stood in any kind of election before and only three years ago was a complete unknown. He has staked his campaign on a personal crusade to reinvent what he calls the “vacuous” and failing French political system, while refusing to be defined by any fixed ideology.

Macron’s carefully crafted personal story is worthy of the florid, unpublished novels he wrote as a teenager. Born into a bourgeois family of doctors in the northern city of Amiens in the Somme, at 16 he began a relationship with his drama teacher who was 24 years older. Banished to Paris to stop their romance, he vowed he would one day return to marry her, and he did. “I make no concessions to conformism,” he likes to say — not just of his relationship, but of his political project.

After two years as economy minister under the unpopular Socialist president, François Hollande, Macron had the political instinct to seize on a mood of distrust and despair with the French political class in a fractured country marred by decades of mass unemployment and a new terrorist threat. In less than a year he built a movement, En Marche! (Forward), which he defines as “neither left nor right”. Economically liberal and pro-business, he is firmly on the left on social issues. But he hates the term centrist, preferring to call himself someone “of the left” open to ideas from the right.

After once likening his rebellious streak to France’s 15th-century saint and saviour Joan of Arc, Macron’s premise is to side-step the old party machines and build a direct relationship with the French people. He believes that ever since King Louis XVI’s head was chopped off in the revolution, France has been trying to compensate for the lack of a true leader figure who could personify France. The postwar president General de Gaulle fitted the bill, he has argued, but since then, the increasingly “ordinary” characters who served as president have left a kind of “empty seat at the heart of political life”.

Macron’s quest to fill that void has seen critics accuse him of staggering presumptuousness. His political opponents call him a “guru”, and he himself has described politics as “mystic”. But his supporters are looking for a new type of pragmatic politics that can hold back the progress of the far-right Front National’s Marine Le Pen.

‘A genius for human relationships’

At the start-up-style headquarters of En Marche!, young volunteers sit on sofas working on laptops greeted occasionally by Macron coming down from his top-floor office to chat. Laurence Haïm, a former French TV correspondent in Washington who recently joined the team after covering Barack Obama’s early rise and Donald Trump, described Macron as “unbelievably down to earth”.

His childhod in Amiens, the northern Picardy city dominated by its Gothic cathedral, was a far cry from the working class red-brick terraces and factories. The eldest of three children from a family of hospital doctors – his father was a neurologist, his mother a paediatrician – Macron lived in a townhouse in a smart neighbourhood near a tennis club.

But his refuge was the flat of his grandmother Manette, where he went after school and at weekends. Manette’s mother, a cleaner, had been illiterate, and education had become a family obsession. Manette, who had worked as a headteacher, spent hours having her grandson read aloud. “After school, we’d drink hot chocolate and listen to Chopin,” he recalled. “His self-confidence comes from his grandmother,” said François-Xavier Bourmaud, Macron’s biographer. “She was a reformist socialist who coloured his political engagement very young.”

Macron went to a private Jesuit school in Amiens where he was top of the class, a prize-winning pianist and actor, who preferred the company of teachers. When talk began circulating of a relationship with Brigitte Trogneux, the French and Latin teacher who ran his theatre group, she was 40 and married with three children, the eldest of whom was not far off Macron’s age of 16.

He was sent away by his parents to a prestigious lycée in Paris, but the relationship continued and the pair married when he was 30. They are constantly together on the presidential campaign trail. Such is the fascination for their marriage that their frequent, carefully staged appearances on the cover of celebrity magazines always prompts a rise in sales.

When a social media rumour grew — helped along by quips from certain political opponents — that Macron had a secret gay relationship, paparazzi searched but found no evidence it was true. The rumour had been dismissed by journalists as false, but Macron this month publicly raised it anyway, dismissing it on stage at a campaign team meeting. “It can’t be me; it must be my hologram,” he said.

At the prestigious Henri IV lycée in Paris, Macron was known for having the gift of the gab, said Jean-Baptiste de Froment, a classmate who was later an advisor to Nicolas Sarkozy and is now a Paris councillor for the right-wing party Les Républicains. Macron could stand at the blackboard and win over his audience in mathematics even if he didn’t actually have the solution to an equation, de Froment said. “What was already clear was that he was fascinated by networking and he was a genius at human relationships,” he added.

In French politics, where aloof arrogance has come to be seen as the norm, Macron’s devotion to the art of seduction stands out, even to his opponents. “His handshakes go on for ages,” said Bourmaud, his biographer. “He puts a hand on your arm and looks into your eyes. He listens to you, asks you questions and gives you the impression that the future of the world depends on what you’re saying. He makes everyone he meets feel important. On the ground, it’s quite rare to find a political personality that gives everyone the impression they’re intelligent. He has a lot of empathy.”

Of the left – but ‘not a Socialist’

Macron describes himself as a product of French meritocracy, but the elite graduate colleges that he rose up through remain a privileged microcosm. By his mid-20s he had joined the highest ranks of the senior civil service, after studying politics and philosophy — working on Hegel and Machiavelli. He attended the École National d’Administration, seen as a factory of the French elite.

He was on a civil service work placement at the French embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, when he watched on TV what he called “the defining political moment of my generation”: the far-right Front National’s Jean-Marie Le Pen reaching the final round of the presidential election in 2002. He feared, as he says now, that if mainstream political parties didn’t radically change, the far-right would progressively inch closer to power.

In 2006, Macron briefly joined the French Socialist party on the special cheap membership rates put in place before Ségolène Royal was chosen as presidential candidate. But he never renewed, and today says: “I am not a Socialist.” When the rightwing Sarkozy became president, Macron was appointed to help coordinate a commission to produce a pro-business road map for boosting growth and economic competition.

There he met the top tier of French industrialists, bankers, business leaders and trade union figures, building up one of the most extensive personal address books in Paris. “He had an unusual talent for behind-the-scenes diplomacy,” one commission member said, recalling how he privately bartered between the different political sensibilities on the board.

Macron left the civil service for the Rothschild investment bank, where his role was the art of persuasion and brokering deals. “You’re sort of a prostitute,” he later told the Wall Street Journal. “Seduction is the job.” His biggest deal was arranging Nestlé SA’s $11.8bn purchase of Pfizer Inc’s baby-food business, which made him €2.8m. He has since complained of being unable to shake off the “scarlet letter” of having been a banker in a nation where money can be a taboo.

‘What determines him is freedom’

“Money is not the final aim for him,” argued his close friend, the economist Marc Ferracci, who was his best man. “He doesn’t collect watches, he’s not into consumerism. The principal purpose of money for him is that it gives you freedom. The best way to understand Emmanuel Macron is to know that what determines him is freedom, liberty. When he left Amiens it was because he wanted to be free to live his relationship with Brigitte. When he was at Rothschild it was to have financial freedom. And later when he left his position as economy minister, it was to have a type of political freedom. That’s what guides his choices.”

Ever since their friendship in university days, when they gifted each other the novels of Émile Zola on their birthdays, he and Macron had talked about inequality in France, Ferracci said. “Poverty and inequality is something he wants to bring an answer to but not necessarily the traditional answer of the French left that is redistribution and benefits payments. I think he’s convinced that you fight poverty by giving opportunities rather than in giving money. Equal opportunities matter.”

While a banker, Macron was a behind the scenes economic adviser on the Socialist Hollande’s bid for the presidency – pushing a pro-business line. As president, Hollande made him deputy chief of staff, where he was a sherpa at international talks and during the eurozone crisis. But he became frustrated at what he saw as Hollande’s limited appetite for pro-market reform. He quit in 2014, hoping to launch a start-up and teach at the London School of Economics. But he was out cycling near his grandiose holiday villa in Le Touquet on the northern French coast when he got a surprise call from Hollande asking him to take over as economy minister.

Appointing Macron was a massive gamble. Hollande had just sacked a group of leftwing rebels for opposing his economically liberal shift. Bringing in an ex-banker who had never been elected was seen as the ultimate snub to the left. When Macron, who likes to debate with demonstrators in the street, convinced he can win over anyone in an argument, was caught on camera telling a protester, “the best way to afford a suit is to work”, it hardened leftwing dissent. And yet Macron swiftly became the most popular politician in France.

Hollande refusenik

It was Macron’s exasperation in government that led him to jump ship and launch a presidential bid. His showcase “Macron law” was a diverse package of liberalising and deregulatory measures – from Sunday opening hours to introducing competition on long distance bus routes – which seemed mild by most European standards but was always going to be difficult to get past rebel Socialist MPs.

After more than 200 hours of parliament debate and behind-the-scenes horse-trading with the opposition, Macron was convinced he could swing it. But the government instead decided to controversially ram through the law without a parliament vote by using a rare and controversial form of decree. Macron balked at what he felt was self-serving political party machines blocking any real discussion about change.

“He was wounded,” Ferracci said. “It was very clearly the start of his thinking about a political movement and trying to build a new political offering.”

Another point of dissent was Hollande’s response to the November 2015 Paris attacks that killed 130 people. The president’s knee-jerk reaction was to promise to change the constitution to strip French citizenship from dual-nationality citizens convicted of terrorism. That plan caused havoc on the left and right and Hollande was later forced to abandon it. Macron broke ranks, insisting the government would be better off trying to understand and deal with why French gunmen had killed French citizens. The prime minister Valls attacked Macron, saying “to explain was to excuse”.

Observers describe Macron as a man in a hurry. His rise since quitting the economy ministry last year has come on a run of staggering luck and circumstance. Hollande’s decision not to run again for office and the defeat of the moderate Alain Juppé in the right’s primary race opened up the centre ground. Next the rightwing favourite François Fillon was hit by scandal, allowing Macron to overtake him in the polls. When the leftwinger Benoît Hamon won the Socialist ticket, Macron could take a chunk of the centre left.

You make your own luck – Macron’s aides

But his deliberate flexibility on policy has been met with growing calls to spell out exactly what his “progressive vision” means. Macron doesn’t like what he sees as an age-old formula of setting out dozens of manifesto pledges that are later ignored in office, but he is under increasing pressure to spell out concrete proposals. Over the past year, he has shifted his views on the notion of the 35-hour week and the French wealth tax leading one old Paris contact to observe bitterly that he needs to “set out his convictions”.

Macron once observed that “what’s missing in politics today is a bit of the transcendence that literature and philosophy bring”. He has likened a leader’s role to being the nation’s “therapist” – listening to and explaining away the country’s woes. Last year he sent volunteer door-knockers out around France to listen and gather up testimony about what was wrong with France.

For now, he reads a least a few pages from essays, poems or graphic novels every day. He saves literary novels for weekends. “I need all those emotions,” he has said. “I don’t know how to live without them.”The White House’s national security adviser has resigned after leaks revealed that he had secretly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington and then tried to cover up the conversations.

But it’s hard to keep that ‘New Year, new you’ attitude, no matter how good our intentions are. Could the evolution of our brains explain why resolutions are so hard to keep?This was a slog for Manchester City, but after a fiercely contested game on the south coast against opponents who refused to wilt it should probably be considered evidence that Pep Guardiola’s side will pose the most credible threat to Chelsea’s advantage at the top of the Premier League. City have sprung into second place, taking advantage of the leaders’ slight stutter on Sunday at Burnley and Guardiola could arguably draw more positives from this hard-fought victory than the 4-0 thrashing they had inflicted on West Ham United in their previous away fixture.

That had proved a stroll at the London Sadium but, confronted by opponents yet to win a game in 2017, City had to scrap to impose themselves. In the autumn, once City’s scintillating start to life under Guardiola had petered out, they might have shrunk in the face of the resistance offered by an energetic and eager Bournemouth team.

Bournemouth 0-2 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more

Yet they have steeled themselves in recent weeks. A fourth successive win in all competitions in what will be their last league fixture until the first week of March maintained the momentum. This team have been revitalised, with Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling irrepressible, David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne orchestrating their play expertly from deeper roles, and Sergio Agüero eager to reassert himself as their predator-in-chief.

The Argentinian, who had come on as a substitute for the injured Gabriel Jesus, left the field insistent that he had scored for the first time since early January. Agüero had held off another substitute, Tyrone Mings, as he darted across his marker midway through the second half sensing Sterling would have the beating of Adam Smith down City’s left flank, and stretched out for the winger’s low centre on the edge of the six-yard box. There was a flick on the loose ball, but it cannoned beyond Artur Boruc off Mings as the centre-half desperately sought to get ahead of the striker. He will grumble in frustration to be denied his own reward, but his attacking instinct had still drawn the error. City will await news of the extent of Jesus’ foot injury, sustained in the early exchanges, but know they have a match-winner who is glad to be back.

Agüero should revel at the prospect of slotting back into this front-line in the weeks ahead. Sané, in particular, was magnificent down the left, was unlucky late on when he belted a shot on to the crossbar. His gliding menace contrasted with Sterling’s scuttling energy on the opposite flank.

“People say we only brought in one guy [Gabriel Jesus] in the January transfer window but, since Arsenal [in mid-December], something has clicked with Sané,” said Guardiola. “He’s shown us a lot of things. He is so fast, and his intensity has helped us a lot, and he is only 20.” His potential is frightening.

It had been the German who had dumped Smith on the turf while the game was still goalless, his centre reaching Sterling whose shot was deflected by Steve Cook on to a post. Within minutes, however, that pair had combined once again with Sané’s centre flicking off Cook and evading Charlie Daniels at the far post. Sterling lurked unmarked to convert an eighth goal of the season with ease.

That combination down the flanks, supplied by Silva’s clever slide-rule passes, will propel this team’s late challenge to Chelsea’s dominance at the top. “I thought City were very good and gave a very controlled performance as the away team,” said Eddie Howe. “Our lads gave everything they could, worked incredibly hard, and I can’t ask for anything more. I just felt they were better than us.”

Pep Guardiola admits Sergio Agüero could soon leave Manchester City Read more

Howe had no complaints at the referee’s decision to deny Josh King an equaliser after the striker pulled back John Stones in the build-up, and had taken heart from Jordon Ibe’s improved display on a first league start since early November during which the former Liverpool winger almost eased the hosts ahead. Willy Caballero’s outstretched right leg had denied them that privilege.

This was not the performance of a team nosediving into a relegation scrap, their frenetic energy and urgency deserving of better, and they can go into the remaining fixtures with more optimism. Yet the ill-fortune thrust Bournemouth’s way did reflect that of a team enduring a slump in form.

No sooner had Howe found relief in the restoration of his first-choice back-line than Simon Francis suffered a hamstring injury. Jack Wilshere then crumpled to the turf clutching his left ankle after blocking a shot from Silva. The grimace on the Arsenal loanee’s face as the midfielder departed just before the interval looked worryingly familiar.

They will be as anxious about the extent of any damage as City will be over Jesus’ fitness, though at least Bournemouth have time now to lick their wounds before targeting a recovery. City, in contrast, have FA Cup and Champions League ties looming against Huddersfield Town and Monaco. They have moved to within eight points of Chelsea in the championship race, Guardiola still insistent the title is the leaders’ to lose, but their presence leading the chasing pack will keep Antonio Conte on his toes.Sumo wrestler Kisenosato is awarded the title of Yokozuna on Wednesday, the first Japanese wrestler to reach the ancient sport’s pinnacle in almost two decades.

Google’s satellite timelapses show the inconvenient truth about our planetThis autumn, you told me something more significant than anything you have ever said to me. You told me that you feel you are a woman in the body of a man.

I want you to know that telling me was one of the bravest things you could ever have done and I applaud you for that. Now, and always, you have my full support. In your journey to becoming a woman, I am with you every step of the way. Every new shopping trip, every makeup tutorial, every session with your GP and psychiatrist, I will be there in person or in spirit. Whatever you wish to tell me or not tell me, I am grateful to be a part of this most complex and emotionally fraught of processes.

I know that everything you are doing is heavily weighed and considered. I know you have agonised over this since you were very young, since that first experiment of trying on girls’ clothes and feeling more comfortable than you ever felt before. I know you were scared when a relative found you putting on a pair of her tights and you were relieved that she simply put it down to childhood curiosity. I know that all you crave is acceptance and understanding. And I give that to you wholeheartedly.

I know it was difficult. You wanted to keep this a secret until you died, but you just couldn’t any more

But there is a small, bitter seed inside me, and, try as I might, I cannot contain it. I want to know why you couldn’t tell your wife before she even became your girlfriend. I want to know why you proposed to her, feeling as you do, when your view of marriage is that it is all or nothing. I want to know why, even after marriage, you thought you could carry on with this illusion, going so far as to try for a baby.

Please understand that I know it was difficult. You wanted to keep this a secret until you died, but you just couldn’t any more. I cannot imagine how you must have been agonising, mentally and emotionally. But there were plenty of opportunities to be honest with yourself, your wife, and us.

When you told me, I was relieved for you. I was relieved that you felt you could be yourself. But that relief was tangled up with grief. And that grief was not for you. It was for your incredible wife and your beautiful baby. They have to start again. I know you will do your best to provide for them. But in this world of confusion, disappointment and heartbreak, they did not deserve this any more than you deserved your lifetime of pain hiding who you are.

I love you so much. But I also love my sister-in-law, and I love my nephew. And I can never stop being sad for them. I will be fighting for them, quietly and with subtlety, as much as I am supporting you and our family, navigating our way through this new dynamic.

Last year was meant to be our year. The year where, finally, our family would suffer no divorce, no terminal illness, no death. But we found ourselves in mourning again. Not for who you are, but for the life that has now passed, in a way.

When I see you again, I will give you the biggest hug. I will experiment with your makeup, and listen to what you have to say.

I will also do this for your wife, who holds a huge place in my heart.

Love, your sister

Neverwhere tells the story of Richard Mayhew, an ordinary young man drawn into the fantastical landscape of London Below, an otherworldly city populated by real landmarks and legends personified, including the Old Bailey, the Black Friars and the Angel, Islington – among which the lost, homeless and dispossessed of London move. The idea came from a chat with Gaiman’s friend, the comedian and actor Lenny Henry, who suggested the concept of tribes of homeless people living beyond the notice of “ordinary” people in London.

The Neverwhere story is perhaps Gaiman’s most various work. Beginning life as a BBC TV series in 1996, Gaiman released a novelisation of his own script later that same year. In 2005, it was turned into a comic book by writer Mike Carey and artist Glenn Fabry and in 2013, a BBC radio adaptation with Dirk Maggs at the tiller was broadcast. The story has also been adapted for the stage several times.

Gaiman has hinted previously that he would write a sequel and the FAQs on his website already indicate a title: The Seven Sisters.



But at an event at London’s Southbank Centre this week, Gaiman closed the show by announcing – to rapturous applause – that he’s “a solid three chapters” into the novel and confirmed: “So that will be the next book.”

Gaiman said that he had been prompted to write the sequel both by the changes in the world over the past 20 years and his work with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). Under the latter’s auspices, he has visited refugee camps in the Middle East and spoken to people displaced by the conflict in Syria.

He told the Southbank audience: “When Lenny Henry and I came up with the original idea for Neverwhere almost 25 years ago, what attracted us was the idea that we could talk about the homeless, talk about the dispossessed, talk about the people who fall through the cracks, and do it in a way that was exciting and fun and interesting and also relevant and might change people’s heads.

“Neverwhere for me was this glorious vehicle where I could talk about huge serious things and have a ridiculous amount of fun on the way. The giant wheel has turned over the last few years and looking around the work I have been doing for UNHCR for refugees, the kind of shape … London is in now, the kind of ways [it] is different to how it was 20 years ago, meant that I decided that it actually was time to do something.

“Now I had things I was angry about. I cared about things I wanted to put in and I’m now a solid three chapters in to a book called The Seven Sisters.”

The title of the sequel takes its name from an ancient area of the real north London replete with myths and legends. The name comes from seven elm trees planted in a circle there, with suggestions of pagan places of worship dating back to Roman times. The area was also known, four centuries ago, as Page Greene – which might be a good name for a new protagonist.Conservative MP Anna Soubry tells Owen Jones that she will never forgive Boris Johnson for his Brexit campaign.

A co-founder of private equity giant 3G Capital, Jorge Paulo Lemann is ranked the world’s 19th richest man and Brazil’s wealthiest, with a fortune estimated at $29.5bn.

He was born in 1939 and as a young man was the Brazilian national tennis champion and played at Wimbledon. He went on to work for Credit Suisse in Geneva and later founded the Brazilian investment bank Banco Garantia. Two co-founders later became fellow founding partners at 3G Capital.

Paul Polman

Unilever’s Dutch chief executive grew up in Enschede, where he had high hopes of becoming a doctor. However, places at medical school were allocated by lottery at the time and Polman missed out, according to an interview.

The 60-year-old’s career has taken him through some of the most high-profile consumer goods companies, starting with Procter & Gamble in 1979. He joined Nestlé in 2006 and was poached three years later by Unilever to become its chief executive.

Polman is an unusual boss, who spends substantial amounts of time travelling and lecturing on issues such as global poverty, climate change and refugees. He recently described his job at Unilever: “I always say I represent one of the biggest NGOs.”

At the behest of UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, he agreed to be one of 27 members of the UN high-level panel of eminent persons on the post-2015 development agenda.

The Dutchman has previously declared himself “ashamed” of the amount of money he earns – £8m last year – and attracted criticism for bemoaning his high pay after Unilever said it would be raising prices to offset the post-EU referendum fall in the pound.

Trump security adviser Flynn resigns after leaks suggest he tried to cover up Russia talks Read more

Reached by the Associated Press on Thursday evening, Harward, who is a senior executive at Lockheed Martin, cited family and financial reasons for opting not to take the job to replace Flynn, who was asked to resign on Monday after a brief and turbulent tenure.

He said that the Trump administration was “very accommodating to my needs, both professionally and personally”.

“It’s purely a personal issue,” Harward said. “I’m in a unique position finally after being in the military for 40 years to enjoy some personal time.”

Two sources familiar with the decision told Reuters that Harward turned down the job in part because he wanted to bring in his own team. That put him at odds with Trump, who had told Flynn’s deputy, KT McFarland, that she could stay.



During a freewheeling press conference on Thursday in which Trump claimed his administration was running like a “a fine-tuned machine”, the president implied that he was able to let Flynn go in part because he already had a replacement in mind.

“I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position – and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision,” he said.

Harward, a retired three-star admiral with deep experience in Afghanistan and the Middle East, emerged from the same special-operations circles as Flynn.



Flynn was forced to step down over contacts with the Russian ambassador to Washington and his subsequent attempts to cover up the true nature of those contacts, which included misleading Vice-President Mike Pence.

Harward was under consideration for a senior White House position even before the national security adviser job came open, the Guardian has learned.

Initially, Trump had discussed making Harward, who is close to the defense secretary, James Mattis, one of his five special assistants to the president, a job that offers substantial access to the Oval Office.

But when Flynn was forced to resign on Monday, the job discussions with Harward recentered on the national security adviser role.

Former officials who worked with Harward considered his amiable temperament, bureaucratic competence and lack of discernible ideology a notable contrast to Flynn.



They said an early test for Harward would have been restoring the primacy of the National Security Council (NSC), the traditional interagency forum for foreign and security policymaking. Under Flynn, the NSC had been challenged by competing bodies, particularly one helmed by Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and a white nationalist.

Harward is said to share Mattis’ view of Iran as a primary security threat, though with less ideological fervor: he spent much of his youth in pre-revolutionary Iran, where his father, also a navy officer, was stationed.



Colin Kahl, the former national security adviser to Joe Biden and before that a senior Pentagon official, called Harward a “hard-charging patriot” who would have stabilized a volatile White House.

One of the rumored replacements for Flynn is the former CIA director and retired four star general David Petraeus, a man far more amenable to the intelligence agencies than Flynn.

But Petraeus resigned as director of the CIA in 2012 and is still on probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor violation of mishandling classified information, which he provided to his biographer – a woman he was having an affair with.

The other name floated is Keith Kellogg, the acting national security adviser.Donald Trump’s war on the media means he will struggle to challenge China over “ideological” questions such as human rights, a Communist party-controlled newspaper claimed, as the US president intensified his offensive against the press, labelling journalists “the enemy of the American people”.



In an editorial published on Saturday morning, China’s state-run Global Times newspaper celebrated how Trump’s early moves in office suggested he would be “less concerned about issues like human rights” – long a bone of contention between western governments and Beijing’s authoritarian rulers.

McCain savages Trump administration and inability to 'separate truth from lies' Read more

“His war with mainstream media makes it difficult for Trump to ally with the media on [the] ideological front against China,” the state-run tabloid said, adding: “Many have predicted that Trump’s presidency would exacerbate the recession of liberalism.”

The Global Times’ comments came as Trump followed up on Thursday’s extraordinary 77-minute media conference with a renewed assault on the media, whose refusal to publish fawning reviews of his first weeks in office has led the president to accuse them of publishing “dishonest” and “fake” news.

“The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people!” Trump tweeted on Friday afternoon.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!

Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist who helped unearth the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s, was among those appalled by Trump’s latest attempt to undermine the media.

“Oh boy,” he told the New York Times. “Donald Trump is demonstrating an authoritarian attitude and inclination that shows no understanding of the role of the free press.”

Bill Bishop, the Washington DC-based publisher of the Sinocism newsletter on Chinese politics, said Trump’s bid to cow the media into becoming an “obedient, unquestioning” force came straight out of the Communist party playbook. “It feels like China … It’s deeply depressing and deeply disturbing and yet every day it gets worse.”

As part of a sweeping crackdown designed to tighten the Communist party’s grip on power, China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, last year demanded “absolute loyalty” from the press, telling Chinese news outlets their “surname should be party”.

Shooting the messenger: how Trump's media vitriol could ultimately backfire Read more

“Trump’s vision would be, ‘the media’s surname is Trump’,” said Bishop. “I’m surprised he hasn’t started referring to journalists as ‘news workers’ like the Communist party does. It could be next: ‘fake news workers’”.

Trump’s shock election and his repeated vows to take a hard line with Beijing over issues such as trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea had fuelled fears that a dramatic deterioration in relations between the world’s top two economies was on the cards.

However, those concerns have receded in the wake of what the White House called an “extremely cordial” telephone call between Trump and Xi on Thursday last week in which the US president appeared to back away from threats to challenge Beijing over Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory.

Bishop said he believed the domestic turmoil Trump was now facing would distract him from making Beijing a particular target. “There is so much chaos around Trump that China is unlikely to be any kind of real focus in the near term. China benefited after 9/11, China benefited from the Iraq debacle and China looks to be benefiting from the Trump disaster.”

As Beijing basked in an unexpected strategic opportunity to boost its global standing, Bishop said the US was lumbered with “a stark raving mad president holding Monty Pythonesque press conferences”.Abraham Cruzvillegas, the first Mexican artist to exhibit at Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, shows us how his art embraces the modern chaos of Mexico City.

Lee este artículo en español aquíWhen his mother left, Alan Balfour, aged six, vowed he would never let his father down. But when he fell in love with a German girl, he knew his Jewish father would never approve

Several years ago, my son married an Asian woman who converted to Judaism. At the simchah, my daughter-in-law wore a burgundy-and-gold sari. Thumbprints of sandlewood were pasted on their foreheads. A young Indian, barefooted and clothed in an ivory tunic over loose trousers played traditional Tamil music on a clarinet. At each table he bowed, and when the Tamil tunes gave way to a slow, haunting Hatikva the room was mesmerised. Jews and Tamils were celebrating together.

It had been very different when, as a young Jewish man, I had wanted to marry a German girl.

In 1942, my mother suddenly left home. I was told she had done a bad thing, but my father never spoke ill of her – or well. All I knew was that she had walked out on my father, me and my young sister. After the war, they divorced and she left for the US with an American pilot whom she later married.

I made a promise to myself: I would never let my father down. I was six. It was 10 years before I saw my mother again. I was 16 when the telephone rang and a husky voice said: “Hello, honey, it’s your mother.”

She wanted to see me. I went with my sister to my grandparents’ house. There, I met a dynamic, dramatic woman with black eyes and hair and film-star looks. She told me her side of the story. She had had a one-night fling, but never had any feelings for the man. She had simply wanted my father to pay her closer attention. She said that when she lost custody of my sister and me, she had tried to kill herself. I was enthralled by her and after she returned to the US I couldn’t get her out of my mind.

For the next few years, I fell in and out of love with every girl I met, but did not trust any of them. Then, in 1958, I met a beautiful German girl who introduced me to music and literature. She said that neither she nor her friends knew anything about the Holocaust. She was horrified by what I told her, saying that maybe her parents had wanted to protect her from the terrible shame, just as my father had done for me over the stigma of my mother’s affair.

When she left for Germany, we wrote often, but all her letters had to be sent to a friend’s house. My father would not have appreciated mail from the Fatherland in his letterbox.

For several months I tried to forget her. But I couldn’t and in 1960 I drove over to see her. In Heidelberg, I told her I was done with the secret life. She wanted to be Jewish and I wanted to marry her. I persuaded her to come back with me to London.

My grandparents, fleeing pogroms in Odessa, had arrived in England in 1905 where, two years later, my grandfather started a small millinery factory in London’s East End. After the second world war, my grandmother discovered from a cousin that six members of her family had been murdered in 1942 when thousands of Jews were either shot or burned alive by the Romanian army. For my father, every Jew who died was family and the Germans were responsible. I told him my German girlfriend had known nothing of the Holocaust, but he gave me a strict Jewish lesson and said she had to go.

I gave in, despising myself for my weakness.

Later, I told her what had happened. The following day, she fainted in the street and spent five days in hospital. One night, while visiting her, I told her it was far from over. I returned home to see the kitchen light on, the door ajar.

My father was sitting at the table, wearing a yarmulke and with a prayerbook in his hands. He pushed a letter towards me in an NHS envelope. He no longer looked angry, only deeply sad. He had just found out about her hundreds of letters and knew the whole story.

“You told me it was over,” he said. There was no chastisement and he was perfectly calm, but behind his sad eyes I saw the demand – silent, but insistent.

I wanted him to be angry. I hated him for wearing a yarmulke and holding a blackmailer’s prayer book. I hated my stepmother, who had found the letters in my bedroom. I searched his face for a sign of judgment, but saw only a man shackled to tradition who could act in no other way. But I could.

I made up my mind that I would walk out of the house and out of his life for ever. My triumph was short-lived. I remembered that childhood promise: never to be the one who let him down.

“It’s over,” I whispered. “She’s flying home tomorrow.”

Three months later, I flew to Baden-Baden to rekindle the dream. But when we walked through the botanical gardens, all my wonderful words were hollow and she knew it. After I came back to London, we both started dating other people.

In 1961, I went to Israel and forged a relationship with a girl I knew from London who was working on a kibbutz. But I was still hankering after the one who had introduced me to Beethoven. On our return home, I took a secret trip to Strasbourg for a few last passionate hours together. We were both about to get married – I to the girl from the kibbutz and she to an architect. I thought we had struck the best deal for everyone. I didn’t know then that I would be divorced within two years.

In 1970, I directed The Crucible by Arthur Miller for an amateur dramatic group, Nucleus. I cast a young student as Goody Proctor, and she later became my wife. She has been playing Goody Proctor for me and our children ever since.

One day, while living with us, my father inexplicably forgot how to make hats. Then he lost his way to the bathroom. He was barred him from the day centre he attended, for aggressive behaviour. Once, I caught him at the front door, car keys in hand, about to visit his sister. When I reminded him that he was no longer allowed to drive, he was fuming. When I reminded him that his sister had died the year before, he aged. I said: “You have Alzheimer’s, Dad. I’m doing the best I can, and I don’t want to let you down, but I don’t know how long I can carry on like this.”

How I wished I could take back those desperate words. But then, suddenly, my father-of-old miraculously reappeared. He was glad I’d told him that, said I shouldn’t worry about him: “Nobody’s going to let anybody down here, Alan. You do what’s best for the family.”

The following month, I took him to a home. He died four months later.

Watching my son dancing with his new wife on their wedding day, I wondered what questions they had asked themselves. I reflected how many lovers from different faiths and cultures still face a tragic choice. Today, for me, whatever the sacrifice there need be no blame on anyone.

I never blamed my father for his actions. He was an honourable man. But, for him, there had always been only one choice. The alternative was unthinkable. I came to believe that when two claims are made on the heart, sometimes there is no wrong choice and that honour is in the struggle.

Police are investigating after a female Labour MP received “very explicit death threats” online.

Louise Haigh, MP for Sheffield Heeley, told parliament she was targeted after calling for a debate on the banning of Britain First, the far-right group which may have inspired the murder of her colleague Jo Cox.

She told the Guardian such threats were becoming commonplace among female MPs, noting that Cox’s successor in parliament, Tracy Brabin, had received “horrific levels” of abuse.

Speaking in a Commons debate on Wednesday night, Haigh said: “I just called for the house to be given evidence and to look at the details of the group’s paramilitary activity and anti-democratic behaviour. As a result of that and of how the media covered my call, I have received very explicit death threats. I have been called a traitor and a Muslim lover.

“On Friday, an individual went through every one of my YouTube videos and said he would not rest until I was murdered. If that is not evidence that Britain First should be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, I am not sure what is.”



Haigh, who at 29 is the youngest Labour MP in the House of Commons, said she was disappointed with the initial reaction from police when she reported the abuse.

She said she first told a special police unit situated in parliament designed to deal with such investigations. “Their reaction was: ‘South Yorkshire police need to deal with this.’ We reported it to SYP and the initial reaction was pretty dismissive: ‘It is really difficult to find people on the internet.’”

The MP said SYP only seemed to start actively investigating after she told the media about the threats, though they were quick to install panic alarms in her Sheffield home and office, and to provide her with uniformed and undercover protection while going about constituency business over the weekend. The force has now put in a request to Google for IP information, she said.

“I didn’t think they were going to act until the media attention. I don’t know what it would take to make them act. The same group [Britain First] inspired the murder of Jo, one force over [the border in West Yorkshire],” she said.



Vile online abuse against female MPs ‘needs to be challenged now’ Read more

Haigh said she shrugged off the threats at first. She said: “My initial reaction was to treat it as fairly usual: I get really abusive messages all the time. But reflecting on how obsessive the individual seemed, and the specific obvious threats of murdering me, it did really affect me. I didn’t really feel safe until I came down to London on Monday.

“SYP was really good at offering resources to protect me, had cars following me at roving surgery and undercover police at events. But I would really rather they put resources into investigating.”

Following the parliamentary debate, Ben Wallace, the minister of state for security at the Home Office, said he would intervene, Haigh said.

Being abused was now part and parcel of life as a female politician in the UK, she said. “For women it’s definitely depressingly familiar,” she said. “Speaking to male colleagues they just don’t seem to receive the same level or magnitude of abuse I get on a fairly regular basis. But it’s nothing compared with some colleagues, like Jess Phillips [MP for Birmingham Yardley]. I know Tracy Brabin has had horrific levels. We do become accustomed to it and we shouldn’t. I worry that it will put some women off coming into politics.”

Brabin told the Guardian she had received abuse on social media in response to her efforts to champion diversity in her constituency of Batley and Spen and had asked the members of her local Labour party to respond by retweeting the positive things on her Twitter page. She has also had abuse by post, which one of her researchers has spoken to the police in the House of Commons about.

Brabin said she would support her fellow female MPs however they chose to respond to such abuse, but she was trying not to let any of it get to her and had not made formal complaints to the police. “Everybody deals with it in their own way, but I particularly cannot afford to let it affect what I do because I wouldn’t get out of bed,” she said.



A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire police confirmed that the force received a report of malicious communication in the early hours of 9 December. She said: “The force takes reports of this nature extremely seriously and inquiries are ongoing in relation to this matter.”Lil’ Kim, Snoop Dogg and Just Blaze among artists set to feature on record whose release will mark the 20th anniversary of the rapper’s death

The anticipated duet album between Faith Evans and the late Notorious BIG is to be released this spring. The King and I has been described as collection of songs that tell the story of one of the most legendary love stories in hip-hop history.

Featuring newly recorded vocals from the Grammy award-winning Evans, and both familiar and unheard rhymes from the rapper – whose real name is Christopher Wallace – the album also includes cameos from some of the biggest names in rap, such as Lil’ Kim, Busta Rhymes, Jadakiss, Lil’ Cease, Sheek Louch, Styles P and Snoop Dogg. Producers DJ Premier, Just Blaze, Salaam Remi, Stevie J and Chucky Thompson are also on board.

Notorious BIG: 'I got feelings too, you know' Read more

Evans and Wallace married nine days after meeting at a photo shoot in 1994. March 2017 will mark 20 years since the rapper was killed in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His murder remains unsolved.

Other familiar names on the tracklist is Voletta Wallace, Biggie’s mother, as well as guest stars 112, Kevin McCall, Chyna Tahjere, and Jamal “Gravy” Woolard, who played the rapper in the 2009 biopic Notorious.

“I remember telling [Voletta] years ago that one day it would be really dope if I could do something similar to Natalie and Nat King Cole’s Unforgettable,” says Evans. “Knowing the love that BIG had for Tyanna and Ceejay, I feel it’s my duty to uphold and extend his legacy, especially his musical contributions. This project is my creative reflection of the love we had and the bond we will always have. I’m elated to share this musical journey with our fans!”

Due for release on 19 May, the album’s first two singles are NYC, “Evans’ love letter to New York” featuring Jadakiss, and When We Party, “a west coast party anthem” featuring Snoop Dogg.

This will not be the rapper’s first posthumous release: Life After Death, recorded before he was killed, was released 16 days after his death, and topped the US album charts. It remains one of the few hip-hop albums to achieve Diamond certification from the RIAA. As well as greatest hits albums, the album Born Again was released in 1999, and Duets: The Final Chapter in 2005, which featured team-ups with Missy Elliott, Eminem, Jay Z and Korn.Amazon is teaming up with “Drive” director Nicolas Winding Refn on new crime thriller, Variety has learned exclusively.

The drama, titled “Too Old To Die Young,” has been greenlit with a straight-to-series order with 10 episodes, according to sources. The show will shoot this fall in Los Angeles.

“Too Old To Die Young” explores the criminal underbelly of Los Angeles. The series is described as being in a similar vein to Refn’s Pusher trilogy, which looked at Danish criminals caught up in the drug trade. It explores various characters’ existential journeys from being killers to becoming samurai’s in the city of angels.

Refn will serve as co-writer with Ed Brubaker, who will be an executive producer. Refn will also direct the series and produce it.

Amazon has past ties to Refn, as the company previously released “The Neon Demon,” his recent horror film and fashion satire with Elle Fanning. His other credits include “Only God Forgives” and “Valhalla Rising.” “Too Old To Die Young” marks the first American TV series for the Danish filmmaker.

Brubaker is a comic writer and cartoonist, who most recently took a turn into television, working as a supervising producer and writer on HBO’s “Westworld.” He started in the crime genre of comics and then moved to superhero comics, writing for “Batman,” “Daredevil,” “Captain America,” Catwoman” and more.

The project is eyeing several big-name stars — Variety sources have mentioned three notable male actors who have been offered roles, though no deals have been made. Should the series lock down one of the names on Refn’s wish list, the show would follow Amazon’s hot streak of expanding its lineup of original programming with A-listers, including “Transparent” with Jeffrey Tambor, “Goliath” with Billy Bob Thornton, plus upcoming projects with Julianne Moore, Robert DeNiro and David O. Russell and a drama series from “Mad Men” creator Matthew Weiner.

Refn is repped by WME. Amazon did not respond to a request to comment and WME declined to comment.

Elsa Keslassy contributed to this report.John McCain said on Friday that Donald Trump’s administration was in “disarray” and that Nato’s founders would be alarmed by the growing unwillingness to “separate truth from lies”.

The Republican Senator broke with the reassuring message that US officials visiting Germany have sought to convey on their debut trip to Europe, telling a Munich security conference the resignation of the new president’s security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his contacts with Russia reflected deep problems in Washington.

“I think that the Flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do,” said McCain, a known Trump critic, even as he praised Trump’s defence secretary. “The president, I think, makes statements [and] on other occasions contradicts himself. So we’ve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says,” he said.

Without mentioning the president’s name, McCain lamented a shift in the US and Europe away from the “universal values” that forged the Nato alliance seven decades ago. McCain also said the alliance’s founders would be “alarmed by the growing inability, and even unwillingness, to separate truth from lies.”

White House on leaked memo: national guard swoop on migrants is not policy Read more

The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said “more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticising it as our moral equivalent”. The senator also regretted the “hardening resentment we see toward immigrants, and refugees, and minority groups, especially Muslims”.

European governments have been unsettled by the signals sent by Trump on a range of foreign policy issues ranging from Nato and Russia to Iran, Israel and European integration.

The debut trip to Europe of Trump’s defence secretary, Jim Mattis, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to a meeting of G20 counterparts in Bonn, went some way to assuaging concerns as they both took a more traditional US position.

But Trump is wrestling with a growing controversy at home about potential ties between his aides and Russia, which he dismissed on Thursday as a “ruse” and “scam” perpetrated by a hostile news media.

Mattis made clear to allies, both at Nato in Brussels and in Munich, that the US would not retreat from leadership as the European continent grapples with an assertive Russia, wars in eastern and southern Mediterranean countries and attacks by Islamist militants.

US vice-president Mike Pence will address the Munich conference on Saturday with a similar message of reassurance. Pence will say Europe is an “indispensable partner”, a senior White House foreign policy adviser told reporters.

Mattis told a crowd that included heads of state and more than 70 defence ministers that Trump backed Nato. “President Trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to Nato. He too espouses Nato’s need to adapt to today’s strategic situation for it to remain credible, capable and relevant,” Mattis said.

Mattis said the US and its European allies had a shared understanding of the challenges ahead. Trump has alarmed allies by expressing admiration for Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Mattis, however, has spoken out strongly against Russia while in Europe. After talks with Nato allies in Brussels on Thursday, he said he did not believe it would be possible to collaborate militarily with Moscow, at least for now.

The Europeans may need more convincing that Washington stands with it on a range of security issues. “There is still a lot of uncertainty,” Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s foreign minister, told reporters. “The big topic in Munich is looking to the USA to see which developments to expect next.”

European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is also seeking to destabilise governments and influence elections across Europe with cyber attacks, fake news and propaganda and by funding far-right political parties.

British defence minister Michael Fallon said: “We should be under no illusions about the step-change in Russian behaviour over the last couple of years, even after Crimea”, referring to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula.

“We have seen a step-change in Russian military aggression, but also in propaganda, in misinformation and a succession of persistent attacks on western democracies, interference in a whole series of elections including ... the United States.”

Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, held talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Munich, seeing progress on encouraging Moscow to be more open about its military exercises that the alliance says are unpredictable.

Russia says it is the western alliance, not Moscow, that is destabilising Europe by sending troops to its western borders. “We have different views,” Stoltenberg said of the crisis in Ukraine, where the west accuses the Kremlin of arming separatist rebels in a conflict that has killed 10,000 people since April 2014. Russia says the conflict is a civil war.

First Name Last Name E-mail City Request UnblockDonald Trump is driving liberals crazy, says Jonathan Freedland, but how worried should they really be? He claims that norms of democracy – such as a free press and the rule of law – have already been undermined by the new president. And, he says, the idea of democracy is falling out of favour with young people across the globeThe reported murder of the half-brother of Kim Jong-un by two female secret agents fits well into the unreal, comic book depiction of North Korea as bizarre hermit kingdom ruled by a murderous, whimsical, paranoid and overweight tyrant addicted to chocolate and cocaine. But Kim’s dictatorship is no joke.

Ever fearful of plots to overthrow him, Kim is said to have had 140 senior officials executed since he succeeded his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011. In a Kafka-esque twist, the most recent victim of regime purges is the man in charge of them: General Kim Won-hong, chief of the secret police and minister of state security, who was sacked last month.

Flame-throwers and machine-guns are said to be Kim’s favoured methods of execution. But the method allegedly used to assassinate his troublesome playboy half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday recalls a similar incident in South Korea in 2011, when a North Korean agent attacked an anti-regime activist with a poisoned needle concealed in a pen.

Gruesome stories of the fate of relatives and senior advisers who have fallen out of favour, none officially corroborated, are complemented by persistent rumours of Kim’s unstable mental state. Aged about 34, he is reportedly chronically overweight and suffering from diabetes.

But there is another, more confident and competent aspect to Kim’s one-man reign, and it is this more serious side that has western analysts worried. In recent months, Kim has declared North Korea possesses an inter-continental ballistic missile capable of hitting Los Angeles and pledged more nuclear detonations after last year’s two atomic tests.

And he virtually gatecrashed Donald Trump’s cosy Palm Beach golfing weekend with Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, by firing a new type of ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan. It was a provocation exactly timed to put both men off their swing.

Thae Yong-ho, a senior North Korean defector, said last month Kim was on a “slippery slope”. Speaking in Seoul, he said the regime’s days were numbered. “The traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling.”

But Kim’s bumptiousness, including blithe defiance of repeated, unanimous UN security council condemnations and sanctions, does not mean that he is a man on the brink of losing the plot. In fact he may simply be following the example of other world leaders.

Kim will have noted how Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has repeatedly defied global opinion without suffering especially dire consequences. Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the war crimes allegedly committed by its forces in Aleppo are recent cases in point.

An instructive example of how to get away with murder is the 2006 poisoning in London of Alexander Litvinenko, a Putin opponent. His death was officially blamed on named Russian agents, but none has been arrested or prosecuted.

China, Kim’s only ally, may be another role model. The death on foreign soil of Kim Jong-nam, a potentially subversive critic, recalls the 2015 abduction to the mainland of five Hong Kong publishers by Chinese state agents. The publishers did not die. But nor was anybody punished. Perhaps Kim thinks he can act with similar impunity.

Trump’s failure to take punitive measures following the weekend missile test may have emboldened Kim. Like the rest of the world, he was waiting to see whether the new US president matches his words, highly critical of Pyongyang during last year’s election campaign, with actions.

Perhaps Kim figured that, in the Trump era, it would be no big deal to bump off a troublesome relative. Trump has rationalised murders that occurred during Putin’s time in office, describing the Russian leader as a “killer” whom he nevertheless respects. This is the sort of mano a mano respect the dysfunctional, isolated Kim craves.Justin Trudeau said at a joint press conference in Washington with Donald Trump on Monday that it was not his place to come down to the US and “lecture another country”.

At a surprisingly placid joint press conference at the White House, the Canadian prime minister went out of his way to avoid any incidents with a US president, who has already stoked controversy in his dealings with several foreign leaders. Trudeau seemed to be struggling to keep a straight face at times as his American counterpart spoke.

Canada arrests nearly 70 asylum seekers at US border following Trump travel ban Read more

While Trudeau, who has long been vocal about the need for Canada to welcome refugees, did his best to avoid conflict, he was aided by the American press, who used their two questions for Trump to lob softballs at him. The president, who is facing growing controversy over his national security adviser Mike Flynn’s conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as well as his own apparent discussion of classified information on the patio at his Florida club over the weekend, called on two right wing media outlets for questions, Sinclair Broadcast Group and the Daily Caller. Flynn was in attendance at the press conference on Monday.

Although following Trump’s announcement of his travel ban – now blocked by the courts – last month, Trudeau wrote on Twitter: “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada”, he avoided such statements on Monday.

Instead, the prime minister noted of US-Canadian relations that “there have been times where we have differed in our approaches and that’s always been done firmly and respectfully”. Trudeau added: “The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose they govern themselves. My role, my responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians’ approach and be a positive example in the world.”

Earlier he did say Canada believed it could maintain an “openness” to immigrants and refugees “without compromising security”.

Trump returned to several of his favorite topics during the press conference, pledging to get “criminals, drug lords and gang members” out of the country, boasting about his “very, very large electoral college victory”, which came in spite of a loss in the popular vote, and darkly warning “we have problems in just about every corner of the globe”.

The president also made clear that his concerns about Nafta, the free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, were far more focused on the United States’ southern neighbor than its northern one. “We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada; we’ll be tweaking and doing things that benefit both of our countries,” said Trump, adding that the relationship with Canada was a “much less severe situation than that on our southern border”. Trump continued to enthuse that “our relationship with Canada is outstanding – we’ll work together to make it even better.”

Trudeau did his best to try to find common ground with his counterpart. He told reporters “both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class” as the Canadian prime minister then emphasized how important “the continued effective integration of our two economies” was.

Prior to their joint press conference, Trudeau and Trump held a meeting with female business leaders from both countries, including Ivanka Trump, where they announced the creation of United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. The two went on to hold a private lunch in the White House. After the press conference, the Canadian prime minister went to Capitol Hill to meet with speaker Paul Ryan.Democrats have promised to stage a last-ditch effort to thwart the appointment of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, amid fears within the agency that he will trigger an “unprecedented disaster” for America’s environment and public health.



Donald Trump has nominated Pruitt to lead an agency he has sued multiple times in his role as attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt has vowed to dismantle serried environmental rules and is currently involved in a legal effort by 27 states to overturn Barack Obama’s clean power plan, the president’s centerpiece policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Donald Trump picks climate change sceptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA Read more

“The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses,” Pruitt said in a statement.

Trump said Pruitt is a “highly respected attorney general” who will reverse the EPA’s “out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs”. Earlier this year, the president-elect said there would be just “little tidbits left” of the EPA if he made it to the White House.

Environmental groups have reacted with dismay at the nomination of Pruitt, warning that he will not only tear up much of Obama’s climate legacy but also imperil the reliably clean air and water that Americans have largely enjoyed over the past 40 years. Democrats have vowed to fight Pruitt’s nomination, with Chuck Schumer, the minority Senate leader, promising a torrid confirmation hearing for the Republican lawyer.

Some Democrats are hopeful that a number of Republicans could join them to block Pruitt’s confirmation. “This is full-fledged environmental emergency, this is someone (Pruitt) who is a professional climate change denier,” said Brian Schatz, a senator from Hawaii. “This is a litmus test for every member of the Senate who believes in science. We are going to do everything to oppose his nomination, and we are confident we can do so.”

Other elected Democrats have also vowed to take on Pruitt, with Eric Schneiderman, attorney general of New York, promising to “use the full power of my office” to compel the EPA to uphold federal environment laws.

Republicans, the majority party in the Senate, have largely welcomed Trump’s pick. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma senator and a vocal denier of climate science, said Pruitt is “thoughtful, experienced and a natural pick” for the EPA administrator role. Inhofe is chairman of the Senate environment committee, which will question Pruitt prior to his confirmation.

EPA staff have expressed nervousness over Pruitt’s nomination, given his zealous pursuit of the agency. Pruitt has fought against EPA regulations that prevent air pollution haze in national parks, methane leaks from drilling and mercury and arsenic seeping from power plants.

Scott Pruitt's EPA: a dream for oil and gas groups but a nightmare for scientists Read more

The attorney general has proved to be such a staunch advocate for fossil fuels that he allowed Oklahoma firm Devon Energy to use his letterhead to send a three-page complaint to the EPA in 2014. He has questioned the accepted scientific stance on climate change, claiming in May that the “debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.”

One EPA scientist, who asked not to be named, said that Pruitt risks being an “unprecedented disaster” for the natural world and public health. Other EPA advisers warned that the agency risks being trampled under Trump’s agenda of boosting corporations and eviscerating climate action.

“Pruitt doesn’t believe in the mission of the EPA, which is to protect human health and the environment,” said Lisa Garcia, vice-president of Earthjustice and a senior adviser to the last two EPA administrators.

“This isn’t a business agency, it’s an environmental agency. It’s scary to have someone who doesn’t believe in the mission of the EPA walking in to run it. I expect they will choke the funding of the EPA and stop enforcing laws. The work of the agency will basically come to a halt.

“People at the EPA are in shock, they are worried about carrying out its mission. People are worried about how they will do their jobs, even people who voted for Trump. They didn’t expect this. Clean air and water, safe places for our children to play – these things should be bipartisan. They should be above politics.”

Trump has previously called climate change a “hoax” and threatened to end all spending on climate change and clean energy, but environmentalists saw a glimmer of hope when the real estate magnate met with Al Gore, the former vice-president, and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Both regularly call for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The nomination of Pruitt, however, presages a lengthy battle between the Trump administration and green groups.

“Donald Trump has made it clear that he intends to wage war on clean air and clean water,” said Benjamin Schreiber, climate and energy program director at Friends of the Earth US. “Trump has also put our climate in peril and shown he is out of step with the American people. With this EPA pick, Donald Trump is putting all Americans at risk.”Donald Trump has dropped a two-decades old US commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of a permanent Middle East peace agreement.

Speaking at a joint press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the US president did not rule out a two-state solution but implied his administration had no ­preference when it came to the final ­geography of the region as part of a ­permanent Middle East peace agreement.

Asked what he thought about a two-state solution on Wednesday, Trump said: “I’m looking at two-state and one-state and I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like,” he said.

Trump casts aside decades of Middle East diplomacy in one sentence Read more

Trump’s comments dismantled one of the key pillars of the US-led peace efforts since before the signing of the Oslo accords, which envisioned the creation of a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish one.



“The United States will encourage peace and really a great peace deal,” the US president said. “We will be working on it very, very diligently. But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement.



“To be honest, if Bibi [Netanyahu] and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy – I’m happy with the one they like the best.”

In an otherwise effusive welcome for his Israeli ally, Trump used the occasion to deliver a mild rebuke to Netanyahu on the pace of settlement construction, suggesting that it would be one of the compromises necessary to strike a deal.



“I’d like to see you pull back on settlements for a little bit,” he said.

The Israeli government has said it plans to build approximately 6,000 Jewish settlement housing units in the West Bank, signalling a surge in planned construction since Trump was sworn in as president in January.

Netanyahu shrugged off Trump’s comment, gave no such undertaking, and insisted that settlements were “not the core of the conflict”.

Trump castigated the Palestinians for teaching their children to “hate” Israel. But he continued to put off his pledge to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a constant demand of the US and Israeli right, while insisting it was being considered very carefully.

And while there was tough talk from both men on Iran, Trump did not repeat earlier threats to “dismantle” the international nuclear deal agreed with Tehran in 2015.



At their first meeting since Trump’s election, both leaders expressed the hope that Arab states could be brought in to helping forge an enduring Israeli-Palestinian agreement that has eluded the region for 70 years, suggesting that those states were more amenable and friendly to Israel because of a shared fight against “radical Islamic terror” and Iranian influence.

Most long-term observers of the region have argued that the chance of Arab states in the Middle East giving up the goal of an sovereign Palestinian state was close to nil.



Neither Trump and Netanyahu, speaking before they had substantive talks, sketched out what the alternative to a two-state solution would look like – a shared non-denominational state of Jews and Arabs, or an enlarged Jewish state with a non-voting Palestinian population living in annexed territory.

President Mahmoud Abbas called on Israel to agree to Trump’s call to refrain from settlement-building, and stressed his administration’s commitment to the two-state solution which would “establish [a] Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.”

Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat warned that undermining the long-standing strategy was no joke.

“We want to tell those who want to bury and destroy the two-state solution that the real alternative to a Palestinian state living alongside an Israeli one on the 1967 lines is a democratic, secular state where Jews, Christians and Muslims can live together,” he said.

Emerging from a meeting with the speaker of the UK parliament, John Bercow, in Jericho, he added: “Those who believe they can leave the two-state solution and replace it with one state and two systems, I don’t believe they can get away with it. It is impossible. I believe undermining the two-state solution is not a joke and that would be a disaster and tragedy for Israelis and Palestinians.”



But Trump’s comments were seized on by the leader of Israel’s pro-settler Jewish Home party who hailed it as a “new era”. In a tweet, Naftali Bennett said the “Palestinian flag was removed from the staff and replaced with an Israeli flag”.

In a speech in Cairo, UN secretary general António Guterres warned against abandoning the two-state solution. “There is no alternative solution for the situation between the Palestinians and Israelis, other than the solution of establishing two states, and we should do all that can be done to maintain this,” he said.

George W Bush gave the first formal US backing for the idea of a two-state solution in 2002, although the concept had been the unspoken goal of the latter part of the Clinton administration before that.

The 2003 peace “road map” envisaged an independent Palestinian state as part of a final status agreement and successive Israeli prime ministers from Ariel Sharon to Ehud Olmert tacitly or explicitly accepted it. Netanyahu embraced the concept at a speech at Bar-Ilan University in June 2009.

A former US ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, said that the change in US rhetoric might help Netanyahu navigate short-term coalition politics but added, in a tweet, “It will be hard to tap dance there for long” as neither the Palestinians nor the Arab states in the region could accept a “walkback” from the two-state solution.

Trump used the White House stage to put on a show of familial warmth and affability with Netanyahu. Both men patted and rubbed each other’s backs as the Israeli prime minister arrived. Melania Trump had flown from her home in New York to act as hostess for Sara Netanyahu, and the Israeli leader voiced appreciation from the podium of Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.



The event was a respite for two men under intense pressure at home. Trump leads a dysfunctional administration, having been forced to fire his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, the day before the Israeli prime minister’s arrival.

He faces ever more intense questioning about contacts with Moscow the day after news reports said US intelligence had intercepted conversations between his campaign aides and Russian intelligence officials during the election campaign, which the Kremlin tried to hard to skew in Trump’s favour. The president called on conservative media during the joint press conference who spared him questions on the issue.

Netanyahu is meanwhile facing a corruption investigation and an unruly coalition back home. But on Wednesday he could bask in the praise of a US president who twice promised “a lot of love”. It was a world away from the testy and largely taciturn, relationship he had with Barack Obama.















Immigrant communities across the United States are in a state of fear and uncertainty after a week of immigration raids and leaks from the Trump administration that have raised the specter of a mass deportations.

The White House denied the most alarming leak – a draft memo suggesting it considered mobilising 100,000 national guard troops to round up and deport unauthorised immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border – was current administration policy.

However the 11-page memo has compounded fears among immigrant communities that Trump’s campaign promise of a hardline clampdown on immigration, dismissed by some at the time as little more than heated rhetoric, is about to be realized.

“It’s almost like it’s psychological warfare that’s being waged against people of color to create a constant feeling of fear and uncertainty,” said Juanita Molina, the executive director of Border Action Network, a human rights organization in Tucson, Arizona.

Molina spoke to the Guardian just hours after the Associated Press revealed details of the proposed plan to deploy the national guard against undocumented immigrants in the western US.

“I’ve had border patrol ask me for my documents just going for a jog by my house. I’d go to get a gallon of milk at the store and have officers stop me and say ‘Well, what are you doing?’”, she said. Adding the national guard would be even more “invasive” and add to the already “ominous” atmosphere of border towns, she added.



“We don’t have just basic freedom of movement.”

White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, dismissed the memo, which was written by the US homeland security secretary, John Kelly, a retired four-star marine general. “That is 100% not true,” he said. “It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.”

The national guard memo set off shockwaves for immigrant advocates already grappling with the fallout from Trump’s 25 January executive order, which expanded the potential targets for deportation to anyone who has “committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense”.



The implications of the policy became apparent over the past week, as immigrants who could previously consider themselves relatively protected from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) were revealed to be in Ice’s crosshairs.

On 8 February, Guadalupe García de Rayos was arrested and deported to Mexico after her annual check in with Ice officials. The 36-year-old mother had been allowed to remain in the country for years on the condition that she complete the yearly appointments.

Next came a series of Ice raids in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, and New York City, resulting in the arrest of more than 680 people. Though the administration described the actions as “routine”, activists said that the raids were more aggressive and sweeping than was seen under the Obama administration.

This week, two immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program were detained – the first cases of Ice targeting any of the roughly 750,000 people protected by the Obama administration program. (Daca recipients, also known as “Dreamers”, are undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children.)

Taken together, the events carried a clear warning: no one is safe.

“I think of Daca as my own personal form of sanctuary. It allowed me to thrive,” said Sheridan Aguirre, 22, of Austin, Texas. Aguirre was brought to the US from Mexico as a baby, and received Daca shortly after he turned 18.

Now, after hearing the news of the two Daca recipients being detained, he said he feels unsafe for the first time in years.

“I don’t think that I can trust the Trump administration,” he said. “I’m feeling persecuted, alienated – like this administration is trying to terrorize me and my loved ones.”

It’s not easy for them to return with nothing, to start again. For me and for all of them – this country is our country Elsa Medrano

Reyna Montoya, another Daca recipient from Phoenix, Arizona, was similarly on edge.

The leader of a grassroots immigrant rights group, Montaya said her organization had been preparing for an immigration crackdown “since the day after the election”. That work included holding house meetings, organizing “know your rights” workshops, and providing emotional support for people dealing with “a lot of anxiety and distress”.

But even with all her preparations, Montoya was still shocked by the idea that state governors could be empowered to deploy the National Guard as immigration enforcement agents.

“My heart got really heavy,” she said. “I was just thinking, ‘Is this the nation we’ve become?’”

Reverend Ken Heintzelman, of the Shadow Rock United Church of Christ in Phoenix, leads one of a growing number of congregations confronting the present climate by offering up their churches as sanctuaries – places of refuge for undocumented immigrants to live.

Shadow Rock has provided four individuals with over 800 days of sanctuary since June 2014, Heintzelman said. When the church started offering sanctuary, the idea was to provide a safe space for people until an administrative remedy could be reached that would allow a family to stay together.

But with the switch in stance of the Trump administration, Heintzelman said he was concerned that there were few if any administrative remedies left to be had.

On Thursday, he attended a meeting with immigration attorneys, advocates, and other people of faith to discuss strategy and tactics around “Sanctuary 2.0”. Heintzelman was not sure what that would look like, but he said that he has received a growing number of inquiries from people seeking information on sanctuary.

For many immigrants, however, hostility from the Trump administration does not dampen their determination to stay.

“I’m very firm in my belief that I’m going to fight with all that I have to stay here,” said Aguirre.

Montoya said that she was determined to help people channel their “fear and anxiety into action”. “I know that whatever happens, I’m going to persevere and push forward,” she said.

After a long day of cleaning hallways and public areas at the Encore hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Elsa Medrano spoke of her perspective on the current political climate.

“I feel so worried about the situation, because we came to this country to find better opportunities for everyone,” said the 52-year-old mother of three from Guadalajara, Mexico. “I worked so hard, and I’m still working. We don’t just come to live from the benefits from the government. We work so hard.”

Medrano has a work permit that she renews every year, but she is concerned for her friends and neighbors, many of whom do not have any papers.

“It’s not easy for them to return to their countries with nothing, to start again,” she said. “For me and for all of them – this country is our country.”We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The five-year-old German shepherd with the black and red coat from Wisconsin captured the title of America’s top dog by winning best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden.

Rumor the German shepherd named Westminster's Best in Show – live! Read more

Rumor had come within touching distance of the top prize at Westminster a year ago, entering as the nation’s top-ranked dog but falling short at the final hurdle after winning the herding group to make the last seven. She retired into a presumed life of maternity afterward, but after failing to conceive re-entered competition last month for one final run at America’s most prestigious title.

“It’s unbelievable,” said Kent Boyles, the dog’s breeder, co-owner and handler. “I’m not sure I have the words to describe it.”

Rumor, whose official champion’s name is Lockenhaus’ Rumor Has It V Kenlyn, moved effortlessly and elegantly around the ring to beat out a stacked field of six other group winners, among them a Norwegian elkhound named Duffy, a Pekingese named Chuckie, a miniature poodle named Aftin, a boxer named Devlin, a Norwich terrier named Tanner and an Irish setter named Adrian who was awarded a runner-up prize as reserve best in show.

“She’s got an awesome attitude and a lot of beautiful details about her,” Boyles said. “She really enjoys showing.”

The 51-year-old Boyles becomes the second breeder-owner-handler of a best in show winner in as many years after Valerie Nunes-Atkinson, who did it for the first time since 1983 in helming CJ the German shorthaired pointer last year.

Rumor, named for the Adele song “Rumour Has It” that was released 10 days before she was born in 2011, becomes only second German shepherd in Westminster’s 141-year history to win the sport’s most coveted title and only the second winner from the herding group. Manhattan, another German shepherd, took the top prize in 1987.

“The German shepherd standard talks about quality and nobility,” said Thomas H Bradley 3d, the veteran judge who assessed Tuesday’s final seven. “When you recognize it, it hits you at home, and that’s what it really is.

“She is just magnificent.”

Boyles, who has shown dogs for 35 years, looked relieved shortly after midnight as he fielded questions from a throng of media and onlookers, confirming that Rumor, after winning her 104th best in show title, was quitting on top after surviving a winnowing-down process that began on Monday morning with 2,798 entries in 202 breeds and varieties drawn from 49 states.

“This is her official retirement,” he said. “She can’t accomplish any more than what she’s accomplished. This is the ultimate win for her.”

The immediate aftermath for Rumor includes the traditional Wednesday media blitz, a whirlwind itinerary that includes TV appearances on the morning shows, a photo op atop the Empire State Building and the traditional lunch at Sardi’s. Thursday will bring a long drive back to Edgerton, Wisconsin. And then what?

“Babies, I hope,” Boyles said with a wry grin.British shoppers reined in their spending last month as a surge in fuel prices and higher food bills ate into household finances in a further sign the pound’s sharp devaluation is starting to bite.

Official figures showed sales volumes fell 0.3% in January, confounding economists’ expectations of a rise. Adding to evidence of ailing consumer sentiment, December’s weak performance was revised even lower in the latest sales update to show a 2.1% decline over the Christmas period.

January marked the third consecutive drop for retail sales. The decline will cast doubt on the consumer’s ability to continue powering the UK economy, which has so far proved more resilient than most economists had expected after June’s Brexit vote.

Over the November to January period, sales were down 0.3% on the previous three months, the weakest underlying performance for three years, according to the Office for National Statistics.

ONS senior statistician Kate Davies drew links between the retail slowdown and news earlier this week that inflation hit 1.8% in January, its highest level for more than two years.

“We have seen falls in month-on-month seasonally adjusted retail sales, both in conventional stores and online, and the evidence suggests that increased prices in fuel and food are significant factors in this slowdown,” she said.



Economists warn consumer spending will come under further pressure this year as wage growth struggles to keep ahead of inflation, squeezing people’s incomes in real terms. Jobs market data this week showed wage growth slowed at the end of last year despite unemployment remaining at its lowest rate for more than a decade.

“These figures provide the clearest evidence yet that rising prices will squeeze consumer spending throughout this year and into 2018,” said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC.

“A sharp turnaround in the inflation environment has put a brake on the growth of retail spending – and we are likely to see more of the same as we move through 2017 and next year.”

The pound fell on the figures as they bolstered expectations the Bank of England would keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% throughout this year, as policymakers seek to shore up confidence and spending in the post-referendum economy.

Sterling was down 0.7% to $1.2406 in mid-morning trading. It was at €1.1648 against the euro, a drop of 0.4% from Thursday. The pound is down 17% against the dollar and 11% against the euro since the referendum, making the cost of imports to the UK such as fuel and food more expensive. Fuel prices have also been pushed up by a rise in crude oil prices on the back of production cuts.

James Smith, economist at the bank ING, said inflation would push higher this year, putting more pressure on household finances.

“It looks like the UK consumer’s remarkable post-Brexit resilience is finally coming to an end,” said Smith.

“Food and fuel prices are soaring, and as the effect of a weaker pound continues to feed through, we expect inflation to break above 3% in the second half of this year.



“At the same time, wage growth is starting to moderate and the employment outlook is, at best, looking subdued. When you put all this together, real incomes look set to start falling and it could be increasingly tough 2017 for the UK consumer.”

There has been a silver lining to the pound’s fall, with the latest tourism figures from the ONS on Friday suggesting sterling’s devaluation has helped lure overseas tourists to the UK. A weak pound means their holiday spending money stretches further and hotels and department stores have already reported a boost from tourists.

The ONS said overseas residents made 9.2m visits to the UK in the final three months of 2016, up 6% on a year earlier. Visits from North America increased by 15% and visits from residents of EU countries increased by 8%.They were engaged and on the trip of a lifetime when tragedy struck.

This is what I remember about waiting at the temple in Ko Pha Ngan that August: cold, bitter black coffee. I can still taste it 15 years later. It must have been around 2am. Women were passing out the cups, and a small group of men gathered around a red Toyota truck in which the body of my fiance lay, wrapped in a white sheet.

Two Israeli girls sat next to me on a low wall. They had been with me through the most terrible moments of my life, but I didn’t even know their names. We were waiting for a key. At the clinic, it had been explained to me that Sean had to be put in a box at the temple, the only place on the island where his body could be kept cold. But they couldn’t find the key.

The nights had been uncomfortably hot since Sean and I had arrived in Thailand six days earlier. But, as I waited, the cold began to creep up from my bare feet on the tile floor, seeping through my thin sundress. Sean had bought it for me on Khao San Road in Bangkok, and I was naked underneath. We had spent the last two months travelling through China, where I’d declared some days too hot for underwear. Sean liked to joke that there was only a thin piece of material protecting my most intimate parts from all of China.

Hours earlier, we had been holding hands, walking back to our cabana. Darkness was starting to fall, though it was still warm and sticky. I headed for the ocean to take a dip, and Sean joined me. I hugged him and he held me in the warm, waist-deep water as I wrapped my legs tighter around him. We kissed and I felt something large and soft brush against my thigh. I flinched and gave a short yelp. Sean asked what it was; he was nervous about sharks. I was studying to be a marine biologist and knew how unlikely a shark attack was, especially in Thailand. I kept assuring him that he was more likely to be struck by lightning.

“I just felt something,” I began, but hadn’t finished the sentence when Sean dropped me. I was thinking that he was going to hear about this later, dropping me into whatever had frightened him. But he was already making his way as fast as he could to the beach. His movements were urgent and awkward, his elbows held high, his fingers splayed. I followed him to the water’s edge. He sat down on the wet sand.

“It’s all over my legs.”

I bent down in the fading light and made out a faint red welt rising on his ankle. “It’s probably a stingray,” I said. Whatever bumped me in the water had felt substantial and solid. After the ray brushed my thigh, Sean must have inadvertently stepped on it.

I had seen people stung by stingrays before and knew how excruciating it could be. So I wasn’t surprised when Sean said, “My head feels heavy. I’m having trouble breathing. Go get help.” He was quiet, calm, coherent.

“Come with me,” I said, looking down at him, his dark hair wet, his long white legs now covered with sand. I’d never heard of venomous marine life in Thailand. I thought he was being squeamish.

“Come with me,” I said.

I waited for a splutter as Sean came to and gasped for air. I still thought someone could save him

We met, and immediately began flirting, at a cheap hostel in Barcelona. I was 24 and he was 22. He had a broad Australian accent and blue eyes that wrinkled at the edges when he smiled. His entire body bent double when he laughed. We travelled together for months, zigzagging across Europe, before I returned to a job teaching diving in the Caribbean, and then a PhD at Santa Cruz in California. Meanwhile, Sean had a working visa for Ireland. I rang him from rusting payphones on the islands of Sint Eustatius and Saba, and we wrote letters and postcards. We talked about getting married, until the time and distance apart overtook us, and after seven months we broke up.

Less than two years later, we were back together, as soon as we managed to make our long distance a little shorter. Sean had gone home to Melbourne, and in June 2001 I moved from Santa Cruz to Kangaroo Island to study the threatened Australian sea lion.

The next year, we decided to travel again, first around China, where we got engaged, then on to Thailand. I was now 28 and he was 25. On the long train rides, we discussed our plans. We talked about finding jobs and buying a house, getting married and what we would name our children: Jack, after his grandfather; we found it harder to agree on a name for a girl. I had lived in seven countries, and still hadn’t figured out where my home was in the world. But it was easy for me to see our life together: Sean felt like home.

Sean started to sink down on to his elbows in the wet sand. “The key is in your shoe.” It was the last thing he said as I turned to go. I was topless. I didn’t realise he was dying. I went to our cabana, peeled off my shorts and threw on the thin sundress. By the time I ran back outside, he had collapsed face first into the sand.

I sprinted to him. “Sean! Sean!” There was no response. It was difficult to turn him over. As his head and shoulders touched the sand, there was a brief rush of air. At the time, I thought it was an inhalation. I rushed to the bar, several hundred feet down the beach, crowded with August tourists. “My boyfriend’s been stung! He’s having trouble breathing.” I was having trouble breathing myself. When we got back to Sean, he had no pulse. A young female backpacker began compressing his chest. I waited for a reaction, a Hollywood-esque splutter as Sean came to and gasped for air. I would tell him how much he’d scared me. I still thought someone could save him.

“Can someone get an ambulance?” It didn’t occur to me that Ko Pha Ngan wouldn’t have one. Finally, a truck was reversed down the beach and Sean was moved into the back. With his head in my lap, I continued mouth-to-mouth all the way to the clinic. Sean was carried through a tiny waiting room to a bed against the far wall.

“Has he taken any drugs?” the Chinese doctor asked. “Has he been drinking? We will work on him for 20 minutes.”

I watched as, twice, a thick dripping needle was plunged into Sean’s chest. There was hardly any medical equipment: no defibrillator, no bottle of vinegar (a common treatment for jellyfish stings), certainly no antivenom. There was nothing there that could save Sean.

Twenty minutes passed in an instant, and my heart seized as the doctor walked over to me. “I’m sorry,” he said. “There was nothing I could do. He was already dead when he got here.”

“How are you going to pay?” the receptionist asked me.

Two young Israeli girls who had pushed their way through the crowd outside looked at me. The three of us turned to the receptionist. “She needs to be allowed some time alone with him,” they told her, pushing me towards the bed and pulling the curtains shut behind me.

I touched the side of Sean’s face and told him I was sorry and that I loved him. I hadn’t known he was dying. I kissed him, told him I loved him again, and tried to close his eyes before walking numbly back through the white curtains. But the doctor ushered me back towards a desk. “Please sign the death certificate,” he said, pointing to a line near the bottom of a document. The words were all in Thai; I didn’t understand.

One of the Israeli girls walked into the room. “This needs to be translated,” she told him. The other girl followed closely behind.

“It will be very difficult to find a translator at this time of night,” the doctor replied. “She needs to sign it tonight.”

“She’s not signing until it’s translated,” one of the girls insisted.

He sighed and translated the death certificate himself: “This is the time you brought him into the clinic. This is the time we stopped CPR. This is the official time of death. This is the official cause of death.”

“What’s the official cause of death?” The two girls looked over his shoulder.

“Drunk drowning.”

“But I told you he wasn’t drunk. I told you he didn’t drown. He was stung.” My voice sounded high-pitched and strange.

The girls agreed. They had seen him on the beach, too, among the crowd who had followed us from the bar. They pointed to Sean’s legs, where thin reddish-purple lines wrapped themselves around his calves, over and over. The welts seemed to be swelling and darkening before our eyes.

It hadn’t been a stingray. Sean had been holding me in the water, my legs wrapped safely around his waist, as jellyfish tentacles wrapped themselves around his legs below me.

The doctor sighed again. “He must have had an allergic reaction to jellyfish, then. He was just unlucky.” I had no way of knowing at that point that it was a deadly box jellyfish that had killed Sean. That he wasn’t the first to die of a sting there, and wouldn’t be the last. Or that, the next day, the Thai police would deny he was stung, suggest again he was drunk or on drugs, and insist on having four male witnesses to his death. The doctor crossed out a short jumble of characters and scribbled next to it. The only words I understood on the entire page were my name, misspelled: Ms Shannan Fouler. I wanted that woman to have to sign this piece of paper. I wanted it to be her fiance lying on the bed.

The girls told me I should ring Sean’s family. The only number I had was for his parents’ home in Melbourne, written inside his passport. His mother answered. The conversation was horrible, anguished and brief.

“I told him to be careful.”

“I know. I am so sorry.”

“I’m all alone. I have to go.” And she hung up on me. I never spoke to her on the phone again.

Exactly one week later, I flew into Melbourne with Sean’s coffin. The doors from customs parted with a gasp and my chest tightened when I saw the faces of his parents. I stepped towards them on unsteady legs, hugging first his father and then his mother. We had met many times, but it was the first time I’d hugged either of them. His mother and I couldn’t stop shaking.

I had been to their house before. His father, Keith, and I shared an interest in seafood and enjoyed introducing each other to obscure wines.

Now there was a trapped stillness in the house while we waited for the funeral. I helped Keith choose the music for the service: the Beatles, Ben Harper, David Gray, Crowded House. Sean’s friends brought over bottles of whiskey and Kahlúa, and we drank Jack and Cokes and white Russians in the middle of the day. I sat with his older brothers in the backyard by the swimming pool. Their eyes were the same shade as the flat blue water, the same shade as Sean’s.

But I didn’t really belong with his family and friends. I wasn’t from Melbourne, I wasn’t Australian. I hadn’t grown up with him, or known him as long as they had. We hadn’t had the chance to get married.

And I wasn’t pregnant any more. Months before, Sean and I had taken an early morning bus from Xī’ān to Huá Shān. It was a few minutes before 8am, but already muggy and hot. I was shifting in my seat, trying to find a position that put less pressure on my bladder, when I realised: I’d forgotten to take my birth control pill. But it was only the one, and I took it as soon as we got to Huá Shān.

By the time Sean died, I was three weeks late and he was three weeks nervous. He adored his two nieces and was looking forward to being a father, but not just yet. We were too young.

I had assumed I’d have a relationship with his family. But his parents stopped returning my phone calls, my emails

The nausea, insomnia, dizziness and stomach aches started after his death, and I thought they were the consequence of shock and grief. I kept forgetting I was pregnant. And then I wasn’t any more. Four days after losing Sean, I miscarried in a Bangkok hotel room. I was terrified; I had desperately wanted that baby. Losing it meant losing my last piece of Sean.

The night of the funeral was awful. I knew the next day would be even harder. Since Sean had died, there had been jobs for me to do: dealing with his insurance company and the Australian consulate, getting his body to Melbourne, deciding what to say for my eulogy. The day after was when I had to start figuring out what to do with the rest of my life.

I had assumed I’d have a relationship with his family. But after I left Melbourne – after I’d hugged and kissed Audrey and Keith goodbye – his parents stopped returning my phone calls, my emails and letters. On my last visit to the family home, over a year and a half after the funeral, Audrey didn’t come out of her room.

Maybe I was too terrible a reminder. Maybe they thought I could have saved him; maybe they blamed me in some other way. Maybe they couldn’t help but wish it had been me instead. Maybe, even though I thought of them as family, all they could see when they looked at me was their dead young son. In the end, I lost Sean and the only other people on Earth who felt the same way about him.

***

I have now loved Sean longer dead than I knew him alive. I still can’t help but sometimes wonder, what would our children have looked like? Would we have been happy?

Some things might have been different if I hadn’t had the miscarriage. Maybe there would have been Christmases with the Reillys in Melbourne. “That Jack Reilly, he’s got a bit of dash,” Sean used to say, picturing our future son. It took a long time for me to let go of that life, of the family I thought I would join. It wasn’t until I finally had my own child, eight years later, that I could truly understand.

I know how incredibly lucky I’ve been. I was lucky to have loved Sean, and to have been loved by him. I was lucky the two Israeli girls – Anat and Talia – chose to walk through the door of the clinic on Ko Pha Ngan instead of walking away. I was lucky to meet my husband five years later, in 2007, and although our marriage didn’t last, we now have three healthy and happy children.

I look at my kids and imagine what it must have been like to get that phone call. Some girl on the other end telling me that my 25-year-old son is dead. Some girl, when I carried him for nine months, nursed him for 18. When I changed him and rocked him and sang to him and was there to catch him when he fell.

After Sean’s death, my life split in two: before and after. But my life split again when I became a mum. Someone mentions an event, and I immediately know if it was before or after I had my first son. More than anything else, having my own children has changed the way I feel about Sean’s death and his family. So while it’s Talia, now a lifelong friend, who thinks of me on every anniversary (“Believe it or not, but I never forget,” she recently emailed), it’s Audrey, Sean’s mother, I find my thoughts turning to each Mother’s Day, his birthday, Christmas and each anniversary of his death. And all of it has changed the way I feel about love.

The detained man, identified as Ri Jong Chol, 46, is the fourth person to be picked up by investigators and the only suspect from North Korea. They other three suspects hold Vietnamese, Indonesia and Malaysian documents.

North Korea has tried to stymie the Malaysian investigation, attempting to block an autopsy on Kim Jong-nam’s body and demanding Malaysia release the corpse, a move authorities refuse until Kim’s family has provided an identifying DNA sample.

Late on Friday, North Korea’s ambassador to Malaysia broke the country’s silence on the apparent assassination in a heated statement to reporters in which he accused Kuala Lumpur of forcing an autopsy.

“We will strongly respond to this act by the Malaysia side and also the hostile forces towards the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] and we will sue [sic] this matter to the international court.

“I asked them, I strongly demanded, to release the body to our side without any further delay but they rejected,” he said. The ambassador said Malaysian police had told him the cause of death was a heart attack, which is why he said no postmortem was needed.

“This strongly suggests that they are deceiving us, that they are concealing something ... and that they are colluding with outside forces who are interested in damaging the image of our republic.”

Although the ambassador spoke about an hour after the North Korean national was arrested, it is not clear if he knew of the arrest.

Malaysia is one of the few countries in the world with normalised relations and visa-free travel into North Korea. In October 2016, several former US diplomats held talks with senior Pyongyang officials in Kuala Lumpur.

The diplomatic spat threatens Malaysia’s role as a space for Pyongyang to semi-officially engage with world powers, increasingly important as North Korea moves towards its goal of developing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the US mainland.

Kim Jong-nam was attacked in Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday by two women. He complained to medics of being sprayed with chemicals before dying en route to the hospital.

South Korean and US officials have suggested Kim Jong-nam’s death is a political assassination by North Korean agents. Malaysia has performed a second autopsy on Kim’s body because the first procedure was inconclusive.

Details of the attack, which took place at the budget airline terminal, suggest the two women may have been duped into the alleged killing of Kim, who was 45 or 46 and had lived in exile for years.



Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said that the Indonesian suspect, 25-year-old Siti Aisyah, was tricked into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.

He said she and another woman, believed to be the suspect with Vietnamese documents, performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.



“Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong-nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer,” Karnavian said.

“She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents.”

Siti’s family have said they were shocked to hear of her involvement in the case, describing her as a struggling mother who had travelled to Malaysia for work. Her 26-year-old Malaysian boyfriend has also been arrested.

The second female suspect, captured on security camera footage at the airport in a top emblazoned with “LOL”, stayed at a hotel near the airport in the days before the attack, booking the cheapest room and carrying a wad of cash, according to a receptionist who spoke to Reuters.

Unverified reports in Malaysian media said Doan Thi Huong, who held a Vietnamese passport, also told police she thought she was working for a reality TV comedy.

Kim Jong-nam reportedly fell out of favour with his father, the late Kim Jong-il, in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a forged Dominican Republic passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

A Japanese journalist and former friend, Yoji Gomi, said Kim had already become disillusioned with the North Korean dictatorship in the early 1990s when “he saw the reality of the country’s situation”.

“Never accept those who promote exclusion, hatred or closing in on ourselves!” Emmanuel Macron urged the audience in Lille, a city surrounded by France’s leftwing northern heartlands that are increasingly turning to Marine Le Pen’s far-right Front National. “When the Front National promises to restore security points at the border, they are lying,” he said.

Then the maverick centrist, who is running an independent, outsider campaign, did something no others are doing. He hailed the European Union to a standing ovation. “Europe is us! Brussels is us! We need Europe!” he shouted. Cheering supporters, many in their 20s, stood up waving EU flags.

Emmanuel Macron launches outsider bid for French presidency Read more

Macron is becoming a growing phenomenon in the highly unpredictable French presidential election campaign. In recent weeks, the maverick former economy minister has begun to rise so steadily in polls that he is now seen as capable of causing a major surprise in the spring vote – perhaps able to reach the final round by knocking out one of the current top contenders: the rightwing, social conservative, free-market reformist François Fillon and the far-right, anti-immigration, anti-EU Marine Le Pen.

When Macron launched his outsider bid to blow apart the inadequacies of the “vacuous” political class two months ago, he was bucking every trend in French politics. The 39-year-old former investment banker, who had been a chief adviser and then economy minister to François Hollande, was not a member of any political party. He had never run for any kind of election. He defined himself as “neither left nor right”, and only two years before, the public had never even heard of him. He was more than a decade younger than any serious presidential contender, and his disgruntled opponents inside French traditional parties said he was a “champagne bubble” waiting to burst.

But now, with huge numbers turning up to his rallies, rising ratings and one poll this week showing he was France’s most popular politician, the political novice who has promised to revolutionise the way France is governed is being eyed nervously by the other main candidates.

There are no foregone conclusions in the French presidential race, and the final line up of candidates for the two rounds in April and May is not yet known. But Macron wants to show he can buck a recent trend in western politics – he styles himself as a liberal “progressive” who believes he can triumph against the odds in a political landscape where support for the extremes is growing.

More than 4,500 people in Lille turned out to see Macron, a very high number in the historically Socialist city. Far from the well-heeled dotcom entrepreneurs who attended Macron’s first rally in Paris last summer, they were of all ages, from students and sixth-formers, to doctors, hauliers, teachers, pensioners and local business people. Macron is economically liberal and a pro-business reformist, but he is firmly on the left on social issues, including on the freedom to practise religion in a neutral state, on equality and immigration.

“I’m afraid of the rise of Marine Le Pen and if Macron proves a possible rampart against her then I’m interested,” said Franck Tronet, a former wedding photographer on disability benefit who lives near Calais and considered himself centre-left. “Macron represents something new in French politics. He’s young, he’s not aggressive, he’s always smiling and that’s a good thing.”



The growing curiosity about Macron and his fledgling movement, En Marche (Forward), is also linked to disappointment in other parties. The Socialists are in disarray and expected to fare badly no matter who they choose as their candidate in an open primary race this month. Fillon’s rightwing campaign is struggling to take off.

Fanny Brunet, 24, an engineering student from Aix-en-Provence, once voted Socialist. “Emmanuel Macron is young; he sees the world the way we see it,” she said. “I want realism; I’m fed up with politicians making promises that can’t be kept.”

Ghislaine Desbordes, 50, a trainer in office management and an independent local councillor from Wambrechies, near Lille, approved of Macron’s regular appearances on the front cover of celebrity magazines with his wife, who is 24 years older and was once his drama teacher. “Having an older wife means he’s tolerant in life. He’s not closed-minded,” she said.



Macron’s critics say France has a long tradition of an outsider “third man” peaking before a presidential election but then fading away. There are many variables – such as whether or not the veteran centrist François Bayrou decides to run, and whether disgruntled Socialists defect to Macron, seeing him as the only way to stop the far right.

Macron’s trip to the north did not all go according to plan. His comments in the former mining heartlands that the difficulties, social and health problems in the area included high rates of “smoking and alcoholism” were attacked by one local Front National mayor as the Parisian elite stereotyping the northern working classes.

Yves-Marie Cann, political director at the Elabe polling group in Paris, said: “Some saw Macron as a bubble that would burst, so far that isn’t the case. The indicators show that he is now a weighty candidate.

“If the momentum around him continues, he could reshuffle the cards and disprove predictions that the final run-off will be between Fillon and Le Pen. He could re-orientate the second round into a battle that is Fillon versus Macron or Le Pen versus Macron. This is not yet the case – Fillon and Le Pen remain the frontrunners – but the campaign is about to begin in earnest and things could change.”

Pierre Mathiot, a politics professor at Lille’s Sciences Po university, said: “There are two questions. First: will French voters accept a candidate who says he is above the left-right divide? Second: is he credible when he says he embodies change, a break with the past and a new way of politically doing things?

“Those factors, added to the poor health of the Socialist party and the poor start for Fillon, could carry him far in terms of results,” said Mathiot.

One 28-year-old IT technician from Lille had come to the rally out of curiosity. He has always voted right but thought Fillon was “too socially conservative and wants too much austerity”. Afterwards he said: “Macron has really given me a boost. If enough people come to see him live, he’ll rise higher and higher. I found him quite exhilarating.”

Nathan Chen took first place Friday in the men’s short program at the Four Continents, a test event for the 2018 Winter Olympics, while Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada won the gold medal in ice dance.

The American champion, 17, opened with a quad lutz-triple toe loop combination at the Gangneung Ice Arena and added a quad flip and a triple axel for 103.12 points.

“That score is really incredible for me,” Chen said. “It’s close to what I got at nationals, so it’s great to see it reaffirmed at an international event.”

Shoma Uno of Japan was second with 100.28 points after landing all his jumps cleanly, while Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu had 97.04 in third.

“I’m very happy with the way things went,” Chen added. “There were a few bobbles here and there, like in the ending position of the program. I think that one was a little funny actually, but it’s something that I’ll work on for worlds.”

Hanyu opened with a quad loop, but could only manage a double salchow instead of a planned quad salchow as part of a combination jump that included a triple toe loop.

Jin Boyang of China was fourth with 91.33 points, while Patrick Chan of Canada fell on his opening quad toe loop and stumbled on the landing of a triple toe loop to finish in fifth with 88.46 points.

Last month, Chen became the first ever skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program at US nationals in Kansas City, shattering the American records for total score and margin of victory.

The near-flawless performance made him the youngest US men’s champion in more than five decades.

Virtue and Moir, first after the short dance on Friday in Pyeongchang, scored 117.20 points in the free dance for an accumulated 196.95 points overall to capture their third Four Continents title.



“Today was an interesting performance for us as we left a couple of points on the board, but it was really special for us to be in that venue,” Moir said of the 2018 Olympics site. “We really felt the energy and we’re really happy with certain parts of our performance. We’re going to be pretty excited, looking forward to the next five weeks for the world championship.”

The women’s and pairs free skate is on Saturday.The US national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned late Monday amid a flow of intelligence leaks that he had secretly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington and then tried to cover up the conversations.



The resignation, with the Trump era less than four weeks old, is the latest and most dramatic convulsion in the most chaotic start to an administration in modern US history.

Donald Trump had 'full confidence' in Mike Flynn – hours later he was gone Read more

It was far from clear whether Flynn’s departure would steady an inexperienced and feuding White House, or resolve the lingering suspicions about the Trump team’s pre-election contacts with the Kremlin.

The White House issued a statement just after 11pm in Washington announcing the resignation, shortly after reports broke that the Trump administration had been warned weeks ago that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.

The statement also named retired army general Joseph Kellogg, who goes by his middle name Keith, as acting national security adviser, pending the appointment of a permanent successor. It was reported that a third general, former CIA director David Petraeus, was due to meet Trump on Tuesday.



But Petraeus has legal issues of his own. He is currently nearing the end of two years of probation for sharing classified information with his biographer and lover, Paula Broadwell.

In his resignation letter, Flynn claimed he had mistakenly misled the vice-president, Mike Pence, and other Trump officials about the nature of phone calls in December to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kisilyak. When intelligence leaks about the communications began appearing last month, Pence and other White House officials insisted that the contact had only involved an exchange of Christmas greetings and arrangements for a future phone conversation between Trump and Vladimir Putin.

However, subsequent leaks suggested that they had been more substantial, and concerned sanctions the Obama administration was about to impose on Moscow for interference in the presidential elections. Intelligence officials claimed that Flynn had given the impression the sanctions might be lifted once the Trump administration came to office on 20 January.

“In the course of my duties as the incoming national security advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors,” Flynn said in his resignation letter. “These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the president, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude.

“Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology.”

Russian politicians offered a fierce defence of Flynn. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee at the upper chamber of the parliament, said in a Facebook post that firing a national security adviser for his contacts with Russia is “not just paranoia but something even worse”.

Kosachev’s counterpart at the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, Alexei Pushkov, tweeted shortly after the announcement that “it was not Flynn who was targeted but relations with Russia”.

On Monday afternoon, the White House appeared to struggle with how to handle the accusations. A White House statement that the president was “evaluating the situation” conflicted with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway telling reporters that Trump had “full confidence” in Flynn.



Flynn’s – and the Trump administration’s – problems run far deeper than the December phone calls with Kisilyak. The former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) chief is also reportedly being investigated by the army for accepting money in late 2015 for a speaking engagement in Moscow, which could have breached military rules. Furthermore, the repeated and detailed leaks by a disgruntled and alarmed US intelligence community suggested that Flynn’s contacts with Kisilyak dated back to before the election, raising more questions about whether the Trump campaign had any knowledge of the Russian effort to skew the elections.

Mike Flynn might be done – but Trump's nightmare has just begun | Richard Wolffe Read more

A handful of intelligence agencies are looking into those suspicions, as are four separate congressional committees. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on one of those panels, the House intelligence committee, demanded to know when contacts with Russian officials started and how far up the Trump chain of command did responsibility for those contact rest.

Schiff said: “The Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn’s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge.”

At the time of his departure, Flynn appeared to have been losing a power struggle inside the White House in which the established institution and processes of the national security council (NSC) were being sidestepped by a small group of Trump advisors, led by Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and former head of Breitbart News, which has been a platform for the far right.



Alongside him are Stephen Miller, another rightwing ideologue, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser. They have set up the Strategic Initiatives Group, a parallel institution to the national security council inside the White House, which produces policies, in the form of quick-fire executive orders and memoranda, without consultation with the staff experts on the NSC.

Ignored at best, berated at worst, the NSC career staff began leaking copiously about Trump’s erratic phone calls with other world leaders and other missteps, infuriating the president, who ordered leak investigations, further deepening the discontent and dysfunction inside the White House. Any successor to Flynn would face the same struggle for influence and the president’s ear as he did.The Academy Award nominees class of 2016 pose for a photograph on Monday during the Oscars luncheon in Beverly Hills, California.

The only son of Cuban immigrants, and the first Hispanic pick for a president who has gone out of his way to offend the Hispanic community, he is currently the dean of Florida International University College of Law. He serves on the Commission for Hispanic Rights and Responsibilities and was named one of the 50 most influential Hispanics by Hispanic Business Magazine.

Andrew Puzder, Trump's labor secretary pick, withdraws from consideration Read more

More controversially still – for Trump – he has staunchly defended the rights of Muslim Americans, once asking the justice department to intervene on behalf of an Oklahoma teen who had been told to remove her headscarf at school.

In 2011, speaking before a Senate judiciary committee on “Protecting the rights of American Muslims”, Acosta called the US a “nation built on principles of freedom, and high on the list of freedoms is freedom of religious expression. Indeed, as is well known to this Committee, this freedom pre-dates our Constitution.” He went on to criticize France for being too intolerant (the exact opposite view to his new boss) when it introduced a ban on “headscarves, kippahs, crosses and any other religious clothing or jewelry. Our government, by contrast, protected religious expression”, he said.

As US attorney for the southern district of Florida, Acosta went after disgraced Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Swiss bank UBS for aiding tax evaders and a doctor accused of illegally prescribing painkillers. Acosta even worked on the National Labor Relations Board in 2002 and 2003 – suggesting he may actually know what the labor secretary is supposed to do: “promote and develop the welfare of working people, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment”.



But liberals wondering if Trump has changed tack dramatically after the disastrous fall of his former pick fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder, shouldn’t get too excited. The Harvard graduate clerked for supreme court justice Samuel Alito, arguably the most consistently conservative justice on the current court.



In 2004, while serving as assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, Acosta notified a federal judge that the justice department had no problem with Republican plans to post thousands of partisan challengers at polling stations ahead of the election. “It is totally unusual, it is unprecedented for the justice department to offer its opinions on the merits of a case like that,” Al Gerhardstein, a lawyer representing two civil rights activists who wanted the poll watchers banned, said at the time. “This is the civil rights division saying it is OK for voters to be ambushed when they reach for a ballot. That’s how the letter reads to me.”



Scrutiny of the 47-year-old has only just begun. And as Puzder found, skeletons in appointees’ closets soon start rattling once the nomination process begins. The fast-food lobbyists who did so much to undo Puzder promised they would be watching closely.

Aiesha Meadows McLaurin, a Burger King worker from Chicago and a member of the Fight for $15 minimum wage lobby, said: “Workers in the Fight for $15 just proved that when we stand together, even fast-food CEOs and presidents can’t ignore us. Working Americans need a labor secretary who will have our backs, not one who will hold us back. We look forward to learning more about Mr Acosta’s record as the confirmation process unfolds. If confirmed, we will hold Mr Acosta accountable as labor secretary and do whatever it takes to make sure that our voices are heard loud and clear in Washington. No matter who becomes labor secretary, we won’t back down for one second in our fight. We’ll keep taking to the streets, standing up and speaking out until we win $15 and union rights for all.”Tony Blair has accused a “debilitated” Labour party of allowing a disastrous Brexit to happen, as he called for a cross-party political movement to oppose leaving the EU.

The former Labour prime minister turned on his own party, saying there was inadequate opposition to Theresa May’s pursuit of Brexit at any cost.

“The debilitation of the Labour party is the facilitator of Brexit. I hate to say that, but it is true,” he said. “What this means is that we have to build a movement which stretches across party lines, and devise new ways of communication.”

He dismissed accusations it was undemocratic to carry on debating Brexit, arguing that the country could change its mind when people realised the “misery and pain” it would cause.

Speaking at Bloomberg in London on Friday, he said: “Where is the pressure on the government? The pressure is all one way.”

In his first major intervention since the referendum, Blair declared it his mission to persuade the UK to stay in the EU, calling for remain supporters to “rise up in defence of what we believe”.

“The people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit. As these terms become clear, it is their right to change their mind,” he said. “Our mission is to persuade them to do so.”

He argued people’s opinions were not immutable and debate about the wisdom of Brexit should not be stifled. “They will say the will of the people can’t alter. It can. They will say leaving is inevitable. It isn’t. They will say we don’t represent the people. We do, many millions of them and with determination many millions more,” he said.

Blair said he was setting up an institute to make the case against “Brexit at any cost”, but denied he was thinking of setting up a new political party on the centre ground.

He said he was not being personally critical of May but it was necessary to raise the alarm about the “jumble of contradictions” in her arguments for Brexit.

“They’re not driving this bus. They’re being driven … We will trigger article 50 not because we now know our destination, but because the politics of not doing so would alienate those driving the bus. The surreal nature of the exercise is enhanced by the curious absence of a big argument as to why this continues to be a good idea.”

Challenged about whether he was the right messenger, Blair said: “This a free country. I’ve got a right to speak and you’ve got a right to listen or not.”

He also raised eyebrows by saying the case for Scottish independence had become “more credible” as a result of Brexit, as the Scottish people voted to remain in contrast to England and Wales.

Blair is already facing a backlash from Conservative ministers and some on the remain side for arguing that people were misinformed when they voted for Brexit. May has repeatedly criticised those seeking to deny the “will of the people” as reflected by the EU referendum result, and Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has pledged not to block the triggering of Brexit.



Speaking at a G20 foreign ministers’ summit, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said the EU debate was over and Blair’s speech was “insulting the intelligence of the electorate” with calls for them to think again.

“[People] were told the economy would go off a cliff, the very opposite has happened,” he said. “Our country has a phenomenal future and people are waking up to that.”



“Whatever his merits as a former prime minister, this is the guy who would have taken our country into the euro, this is the guy who dragooned our country into the Iraq war on a completely false prospectus with consequences foreign ministers here [at the G20 summit] are still trying to deal with,” he said.

“So I respectfully say to Tony Blair, who urges the British people to rise up, I urge them to rise up and turn off the TV next time Blair comes on with his condescending campaign.”

Michael Gove, the former Tory cabinet minister and Brexit campaigner, accused Blair of “trying to undermine British democracy”, while Nigel Farage, former leader of Ukip, said: “He clearly hasn’t grasped that if the referendum was held again tomorrow the margin would be at least three times larger than it was last June.”

“There is yesterday’s man. He’s like the heavyweight world champion who has been retired for a few years who needs money so comes out of retirement and gets knocked out in the first round,” Farage added.

However, the former prime minister’s contribution was praised by the Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, who said: “Tony Blair is right. The challenge now is to persuade people to change their mind – and the Liberal Democrats are the only party offering them a chance to have their voice heard again. Blair’s speech shows how badly Corbyn’s Labour has failed as an opposition. Labour have waved the white flag and given Theresa May a blank cheque for a divisive, hard Brexit.”

Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, also backed Blair, saying:

Nick Clegg (@nick_clegg) I agreed with every single word of that.

But some other pro-EU politicians were not impressed. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, called it “staggeringly unhelpful” and said it would be better if Blair “butted out” of the debate.

Blair’s intervention was particularly inflammatory as many of his critics have accused him of presiding over a wave of immigration from eastern European countries without being straight with the electorate about its likely magnitude. He directly addressed the issue of immigration in his speech, arguing that leaving the EU would only reduce the number of new arrivals to the UK by a fraction.

“There is, in some parts of the country, a genuine concern about numbers from Europe – real pressures on services and wages. But for many people, the core of the immigration question – and one which I fully accept is a substantial issue – is immigration from non-European countries especially when from different cultures in which assimilation and potential security threats can be an issue.

“Nonetheless, we have moved in a few months from a debate about what sort of Brexit, involving a balanced consideration of all the different possibilities, to the primacy of one consideration – namely controlling immigration from the EU – without any real discussion as to why and when Brexit doesn’t affect the immigration people most care about.”

Blair’s position contrasts sharply with that of Corbyn, who took the decision to order his MPs to vote in favour of May’s Brexit bill last week. Four shadow cabinet ministers resigned so they could be among the 47 Labour MPs to vote against Brexit.

Corbyn has made clear Labour will not block Brexit, although the party is likely to renew its attempt to secure amendments to the bill when it passes through the Lords, starting on Monday.

Open Britain has emerged as a cross-party political force since the referendum, with the purpose of campaigning against a “hard, destructive Brexit”. Its key supporters in parliament include Clegg, the Tory MPs Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, and the Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie.Pope Francis has offered his unequivocal support to grassroots organisers and activists who are fighting for social justice, migrants, and environmentalism, saying he “reaffirms” their choice to fight against tyranny amid a “gutting of democracies”.

“As Christians and all people of good will, it is for us to live and act at this moment. It is a grave responsibility, since certain present realities, unless effectively dealt with, are capable of setting off processes of dehumanisation which would then be hard to reverse,” the pontiff wrote in a letter that was read to organisers this week.

The remarks can be viewed as a clear endorsement by the Argentinian pope of resistance against populist and xenophobic political movements. While he did not name Donald Trump, and stressed his remarks were not targeted at any individual politician, the letter, read at the opening of the US Regional World Meeting of Popular Movements in Modesto, California, seem to speak directly to protests against the Republican president.

“The direction taken beyond this historic turning point – the ways in which this worsening crisis gets resolved – will depend on people’s involvement and participation and, largely, on yourselves, the popular movements,” Francis wrote.



The letter was read aloud by a close ally of the pope, Cardinal Peter Turkson, who attended the meeting.

In the letter, Francis condemned the growth of populist and xenophobic movements around the world, saying they posed a “grave danger for humanity”. He also criticised leaders who rely on “fear, insecurity, quarrels, and even people’s justified indignation, in order to shift the responsibility for all these ills on to a ‘non-neighbour’”.



“Sooner or later, the moral blindness of this indifference comes to light, like when a mirage dissipates,” he wrote. “The wounds are there, they are a reality. The unemployment is real, the violence is real, the corruption is real, the identity crisis is real, the gutting of democracies is real.”



He offered praise to the activists who are organising in opposition to those threats. “I know that you have committed yourselves to fight for social justice, to defend our Sister Mother Earth and to stand alongside migrants. I want to reaffirm your choice,” he wrote.

The remarks would not be the first time Francis has appeared to take aim at the US president. The pope first criticised then-candidate Trump when he called for the building of a border wall between Mexico and the US, with Francis calling it an idea that was not Christian.

This week’s remarks came as several prominent US Catholic cardinals, including Joseph Tobin of Newark, denounced Trump’s executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, with Tobin calling the order “the opposite of what it means to be an American”.



The theme of migrants and religious intolerance was prominent in the pope’s letter to the activists, in which he emphasised the importance of not classifying “others in order to see who is a neighbour and who is not”.

But it took her killer – gripped by fear, shame and guilt, seven months to admit to the extent of his crime – that he placed his full weight on the child “in frustration” after tripping over her as she played on the floor.

He then told the little girl to tell her mother she had a stomach ache and sent her to bed. She died the next day from blunt force trauma to the abdomen, a ruptured liver and bleeding in both kidneys.

The 22-year-old man, whose name has been suppressed, pleaded guilty to child homicide over the death in 2015.

He placed his entire weight on the girl after he tripped over her, senior crown prosecutor Kerri Judd QC told the Victorian supreme court on Friday.

“In frustration, he turned her around and stepped on her stomach with one foot,” Judd told the plea hearing. “He took his other foot off the ground, thereby putting his entire weight on her.”

By noon the next day, she had become pale and limp and was declared dead in hospital soon after.

The accused did not admit to his crime for seven months, by which point the police investigation had intensified. A psychologist who treated the man said his client did not come forward sooner because of his sense of guilt, and fear of the consequences.

“Shame, guilt and fear had left him paralysed,” psychologist Patrick Newton told the court.

The mother of the child wiped away tears and had to excuse herself numerous times from court as the graphic details of the crime were laid bare. In her victim impact statement read to the court, the girl’s mother spoke of her feelings of betrayal.

“I was lied to for seven months when he knew the truth,” she said. “I no longer trust anyone after being betrayed ... like this.”

Defence barrister Simon Moglia said his client’s confession to police “demonstrates remorse, albeit after time”.

The man is due to be sentenced next Friday.Aucune statistique ne recense les violences policières ou les morts par balle consécutives à l'intervention de la police. On pourrait en compter une dizaine par an.

Le Monde | 26.11.2014 à 14h10 • Mis à jour le 27.11.2014 à 17h24 | Par Samuel Laurent

La mort d'un jeune Noir, Michael Brown, abattu par la police le 9 août aux Etats-Unis, et la vague de manifestations déclenchées par la décision d'un grand jury, lundi 24 novembre, de ne pas poursuivre le policier en cause, pose la question des violences policières et de l'usage d'armes à feu par la police, aux Etats-Unis comme ailleurs.

La France, récemment secouée par le cas de Rémi Fraisse, manifestant écologiste opposé au projet de barrage de Sivens, tué par une grenade offensive lancée par un gendarme mobile, n'est pas particulièrement bien classée en la matière : Amnesty International avait dénoncé, dans un rapport en 2009, « l'impunité » dont bénéficieraient les forces de l'ordre.

Mais il est extrêmement difficile d'établir une échelle de ces violences, d'évaluer le nombre de personnes blessées ou tuées par des policiers, ou la légitimité de ces violences : il n'existe en France aucune source officielle qui les recense.

1. Aucune statistique disponible



Les statistiques établies par l'observatoire national de la délinquance et de la réponse pénale (ONDRP) comptabilisent les violences sur personnes dépositaires de l'autorité publique – en hausse depuis 2008, passant de 22 332 à 24 250 –, mais aucune autorité ne compte le nombre de personnes tuées ou blessées par la police ou la gendarmerie.

Si on sait que huit gendarmes sont morts « dans l'accomplissement de leur devoir » en 2013, on ne trouve pas de comptabilité officielle des policiers tués en opération ni des causes de décès. Selon un site officieux, « victimes du devoir », on compterait également huit décès en opération l'an dernier. Mais on ne connaît pas les circonstances de ces décès.

Aux Etats-Unis, la Cour suprême comptabilise les morts dues à des policiers. En Allemagne, les autorités locales de plusieurs Länder recensent également l'utilisation des armes des policiers. Rien de tel en France.

80 On peut trouver une statistique, très partielle, au hasard d'un rapport parlementaire de 2012 : en 2011, les gendarmes ont déclaré avoir usé d'arme à feu à 80 reprises au total, contre 98 fois en 2010. Dans la moitié des cas, il s'agissait d'une situation de légitime défense. Dans 13 cas, les gendarmes ont fait usage de leur arme pour empêcher un suspect ou un véhicule de s'enfuir.

2. Une dizaine de tués par an ?

Les seules données qu'on peut retrouver sont partielles et émanent de sources non officielles, comme l'ONG Amnesty International, ou le site Basta Mag, qui évoque, en s'appuyant sur des sources de presse et sur des travaux d'historiens, 18 décès impliquant des policiers en 2012, et une moyenne de 10 à 15 morts liées à la police par an, et les recense dans une base de données chronologique.

Pour 2014, outre le cas Rémi Fraisse, on peut citer Thimothée Lake, un braqueur tué par des policiers à Toulouse ou, en octobre, un homme non identifié, souffrant de troubles psychiatriques, abattu par la police dans des circonstances encore peu claires, alors qu'il frappait sa mère âgée. En août, un détenu en cours de transfèrement vers une prison a été tué alors qu'il aurait tenté d'attraper l'arme d'un policier. Une enquête a été ouverte.

Toujours en août, un Algérien est mort dans des circonstances non éclaircies, au cours de son expulsion, d'une « asphyxie et régurgitation gastrique ». Le même mois, on peut encore évoquer un voleur de voiture tué par balle à Marseille en réplique à ses propres tirs sur des policiers. En juillet, dans l'Essonne, un Roumain de 42 ans a été atteint d'une balle tirée dans des circonstances encore floues par un policier et meurt.

3. Des enquêtes et des jugements

Des enquêtes sont ouvertes quasi systématiquement dès lors qu'un policier fait usage de son arme ou qu'une personne meurt des suites d'une intervention policière. Néammoins, ces cas interpellent généralement peu l'opinion, et le devenir des enquêtes reste bien souvent obscur. Il a fallu six ans à la justice pour conclure dans l'affaire de la mort de deux jeunes à Villiers-le-Bel (Seine-Saint-Denis) à la suite d'une course-poursuite, qui avait occasionné des émeutes. Le fonctionnaire de police a écopé de six mois de prison avec sursis.

Autre affaire, autre condamnation : en octobre 2013, un policier était condamné à un an avec sursis pour des violences sur un gardé à vue.

4. Légitime défense et armement de la police

Dans quel cadre un policier ou un gendarme peut-il utiliser son arme en France ? La loi est assez précise et restrictive. Les policiers n'ont en réalité pas de privilège juridique : les seuls cas où un policier peut tirer sans subir une enquête par la suite sont s'il se trouve en situation de légitime défense ou qu'une personne est directement menacée.

Plus précisément, un policier ne peut pas être responsable pénalement si, « devant une atteinte injustifiée envers [lui]-même ou autrui, [il] accomplit, dans le même temps, un acte commandé par la nécessité de la légitime défense [...] sauf s'il y a disproportion entre les moyens de défense employés et la gravité de l'atteinte ». Il est également irresponsable pénalement si « face à un danger actuel ou imminent qui menace [lui]-même, autrui ou un bien, [il] accomplit un acte nécessaire à la sauvegarde de la personne ou du bien, sauf s'il y a disproportion entre les moyens employés et la gravité de la menace ».

Il faut donc qu'un policier soit dans une situation de péril ou constate qu'une tierce personne est menacée pour faire usage de son arme.

Cette question de la « présomption de légitime défense » avait fait débat en 2012. Des députés UMP ont rendu un rapport sur la question fin 2012, plaidant pour que la police bénéficie des mêmes prérogatives.

Les gendarmes, eux, bénéficient, en raison de leur statut, d'un article de loi dédié datant de 1903 (mais modifié depuis). Ils ont le droit de « déployer la force armée » :

– Comme les policiers, lorsqu'ils subissent des violences « ou lorsqu'ils sont menacés par des individus armés » ;



– Mais aussi lorsqu'ils ne peuvent « défendre autrement le terrain qu'ils occupent, les postes ou les personnes qui leur sont confiés ou, enfin, si la résistance est telle qu'elle ne puisse être vaincue que par la force des armes » ;



– Ou encore si, après plusieurs sommations, des personnes continuent à chercher à échapper à leurs investigations ou à leur garde, et que ces personnes ne peuvent être arrêtées que par l'usage d'armes. La règle vaut aussi pour les véhicules.



Outre la police et la gendarmerie, les policiers municipaux sont de plus en plus nombreux à être armés : selon une récente réponse du ministère de l'intérieur à la question d'un député UMP, on compte près de 20 000 fonctionnaires de police municipale, dont 7 815 disposent d'une arme à feu.More than a hundred Uber drivers have mounted a go-slow protest through central London to put pressure on the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to insist the US company guarantee the minimum wage.

At least 100 Uber minicabs drove at walking pace down Edgware Road and Park Lane towards Westminster on Tuesday, honking their horns and blocking traffic as drivers angry at low pay for long hours stepped up direct action against the San Fransisco-based firm.

The protest infuriated some drivers who found themselves blocked behind a line of slow-moving Toyota Prius cars. One angry black-cab driver shouted: “Do the knowledge!” a reference to the way cabbies have to memorise streets before getting their license rather than rely on GPS maps as Uber drivers do.

The action was organised by James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who three weeks ago won a crucial employment tribunal verdict that Uber should treat its drivers as workers rather then self-employed. The ruling means drivers should be paid the national minimum wage, receive sick pay and holidays. Uber said it would appeal the judgment. Farrar and Aslam have established a representative group for minicab drivers, mostly working for Uber, called United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD).

The battle over Uber and driverless cars is really a debate about the future of humanity | Paul Mason Read more

“In May 2017, Uber’s licence comes up for renewal and the mayor has a duty to assess whether they are fit and proper to hold a licence,” said Farrar. “He must assess that Uber respects workers’ rights in order to continue having an operator’s licence in London.”

UPHD also sent a letter to Khan apologising for the disruption of its protest, but suggested Uber’s business model resulted in “abuses that would be more fitting of Victorian era London than a 21st-century global mega city”.

It said: “The fact that such abuses are carried out in a trade which is licensed and supervised by TfL [Transport for London] on behalf of all Londoners is nothing short of a public scandal. More than that, drivers working up to 90 hours a week on £5 per hour presents a significant public safety risk.”

Uber insists that its drivers earn more and said that the only case of a driver earning £5 per hour over 90 hours was because they were declining fares. But several drivers who took time off work to join the protest said their earnings were below the legal minimum.

“I am working 70 to 80 hours a week, which comes out at £4 an hour which is below the minimum wage,” said Ibrahim, 30, an Uber driver for 18 months.

“With these hours, people are going to be falling sick and filling up the NHS and they will be falling back on to benefits,” said Mujeeb, an Uber driver who said he worked 70 to 80 hours a week and only took home about £250after paying his expenses. “If the government doesn’t act, it will cost them.”



An Uber spokesperson defended the business model, and said: “Tens of thousands of licensed drivers in London choose to partner with Uber because they love the freedom and flexibility of being their own boss.”

It claimed its own polling showed 90% of drivers were “satisfied with driving with Uber, and a majority say the amount of money they make, as well their ability to balance work and family life, has increased since they started driving with us.

“We’re proud of the economic opportunities we have created for people who can choose to drive when and where they want. Drivers using our app made average payments of more than £16 an hour after Uber’s service fee this September, and 20% of drivers were logged into the app for 10 hours or less a week with just 25% logged in for 40 or more hours per week.”The world’s first transgender doll is being unveiled at the New York toy fair this weekend, modelled on the US teenager and LGBTQ campaigner Jazz Jennings.

Sixteen-year-old Jennings was propelled to fame as one of the youngest people ever officially documented as transgender. She has signalled her personal approval of the doll, which she thinks sends out a positive message about being transgender.

“Ever since I was little, I always loved playing with dolls,” she said in an interview with the New York Times ahead of the toy fair. “It was a great way to show my parents that I was a girl, because I could just express myself as I am. So this really resonates with me, because it was something so pivotal in my own journey.”

The doll is being made by the Tonner Doll Company, based in Kingston, New York, which specialises in making collectible fashion and specialist dolls for adults and children - including TV, comic book and movie characters such as Wonder Woman, Spider Man and Harry Potter. It boasts a plus-size doll in its range and claims to have a history of groundbreaking dolls based on “socially transformational heroes”.

“I’m a doll!” Jennings posted on her Facebook page. “Thanks Tonner for being so progressive!” In a company statement, Tonner’s chief executive, Robert Tonner, who personally sculpted the doll, said: “Jazz stands for everything I respect from a human nature point of view – she’s incredibly brave, intelligent, warm-hearted and creative.”

Tonner hopes to begin producing the dolls in a limited edition run in late spring or early summer and selling them online and via specialist toy retailers. A prototype of the plastic doll – 18 inches (45cm) high – will be unveiled at the Toy Fair in Manhattan this weekend.

Jennings was born male and came out as transgender at the age of five. She attracted national attention in a high-profile Barbara Walters interview on 20/20 when she was just six years old.



Since then, the Florida teen has made television appearances and toured the country as an advocate for transgender youth, addressing schools, universities and conferences. She has written two books: a 2014 children’s title, with Jessica Herthel, and a memoir, released last year. She is now the high-profile star of I Am Jazz, a reality show on the TLC channel, in which she has chronicled her physical and emotional struggles.

To match the outfit Jennings wears on the cover of her second book, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen, the doll will be wearing a pink top and denim shorts. That model is expected to retail for $89.99 (£72) in the US, while another, red-carpet-ready version of the doll will probably sell for more than $100.

Jennings told the NYT she looked forward to owning one of the dolls, which will have a place of honour in her bedroom. “I was just so excited,” she said. “I think this sends a very positive message about the transgender community.”



The New York Toy Fair will also be hosting the launch of a new range of Hatchimals, which were the must-have present for Christmas 2016. The new range of 70 collectable mini-Hatchimals – called Colleggtibles and priced at a more affordable £2.99 each, compared with £59.99 for the originals – will be grouped into nine themed families, with buyers also lured by special and limited editions.

Penguin Random House Children’s UK has recently acquired world publishing rights (excluding North America) from Canadian manufacturer Spin Master to a three-year licensing programme for Hatchimals, which will lead to books, sticker activity books and collectors’ guides.It was one of those nights that reminded us why the FA Cup third round is so special, even if Liverpool ended up surviving the sort of giant-killing that would have troubled Jürgen Klopp for years to come. Plymouth Argyle, 67 places below Liverpool on the league ladder, played with courage and spirit throughout and came within the width of an upright of taking this replay into extra time.

Instead the Premier League club prevailed and can look forward to a fourth-round tie at home against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday week courtesy of a collector’s item from Lucas Leiva. Now in the twilight of his Liverpool career, the 30-year-old chose an opportune moment to rediscover his touch in the opposing box with an 18th-minute header – his first competitive goal since September 2010.

Plymouth could have been forgiven for fearing the worst at that point but, to their immense credit, the League Two side responded superbly and pushed Liverpool right to the end, coming agonisingly close to an equaliser in the closing stages when Jake Jervis met Sonny Bradley’s knock-down with a wonderful scissor-kick that clipped the post.

For Jervis, and Plymouth, it was a case of what might have been on a night when more than 17,000 crammed into Home Park, the majority of them hoping to see a little bit of history created. They never got their wish but Derek Adams, the Argyle manager, and his players are entitled to take great encouragement from the fact that Liverpool were only able to score once against them over the course of 180 minutes.

It would have been twice had Divock Origi dispatched a late penalty but the Belgian telegraphed his intentions and Luke McCormick saved it. It was a moment that rather summed up Origi’s night. Daniel Sturridge, who was substituted in the second half, was another Liverpool player who made little impression.

For Klopp, who named a stronger side than the one that was held by Plymouth at Anfield yet still included four teenagers from the start, relief must have been the overriding emotion at the end. This was an awkward occasion in every respect, right down to the moment when one of the locals presented him with a giant pasty in the post-match press conference. Klopp smiled for the cameras before politely making the point that he would let someone else eat it on the way home.

Among the few positives on the pitch for Klopp was the sight of Philippe Coutinho coming through 65 minutes unscathed. It was Coutinho’s first start of any description since he damaged ankle ligaments against Sunderland in November and by the time he made way for Harry Wilson, the 19-year-old Welshman who was making his Liverpool debut, the Brazilian had left his mark on the game.

That Coutinho was involved in Liverpool’s opening goal was no surprise. The same, however, cannot be said for the identity of the scorer. To put Lucas’s goal drought into context, Roy Hodgson was in charge at Anfield when he last scored for the club. This time the pleasure was all Klopp’s as Lucas got away from Paul-Arnold Garita to meet Coutinho’s corner with a near-post header that McCormick got a hand to but was unable to keep out.

The goal did nothing to discourage Plymouth’s players or their vociferous supporters as the home team played with far more ambition than they showed in the 0-0 draw at Anfield. They produced some nice passages of play, especially in the first half, when the only thing missing was a goal.

The hosts came close on a couple of occasions. Oscar Threlkeld scampered forward from right-back, skipped past one challenge and delivered a dangerous low centre that Garita seemed destined to turn home, only for Trent Alexander-Arnold to make a superbly timed interception. Graham Carey had earlier tested Loris Karius from distance, forcing the Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius to claw the ball away from distance.

The pattern of the game remained the same in the second half as Plymouth, working tirelessly, continued to make life difficult for Liverpool, who enjoyed more possession but never looked particularly threatening. Sturridge, running on to a pass from Lucas, ought to have done better with a close-range volley.

Then came Jervis’s chance as he swivelled to spectacularly sweep Bradley’s header past Karius and on to the outside of the post. It was a reprieve for Liverpool and one that they should have punished in the closing minutes, when Yann Songo’o brought down Alberto Moreno in the area. Graham Scott, the referee, pointed to the spot but Origi was unable to convert.

Plymouth sensed it could still be their night but it was not to be, leaving them to focus all their attention on trying to win promotion from League Two, £1m richer from their FA Cup run and with plenty of fond memories to look back on. “I think over the two games we can been very proud of the performances,” Adams said. “I think we’ve put Plymouth Argyle on the map again, we’ve shown a worldwide audience that this football club can get back to where it belongs, and it belongs in the Championship.”Jake Turx, a reporter for a Jewish publication, asks Donald Trump on Thursday about antisemitic hate crimes.

Life has taught her to be patient, and to never give up. ‘I felt from the youngest possible age that it was unfair and intolerable that females were regarded as second-class citizens’My mom was 23 when she had me. When you are a kid, you have feelings and make judgments about wanting your parents to be a certain way. Suddenly, you are a parent yourself and you think: “Wow, how could she have done that, at 23, a single mom living in New York City, without all the tools she needed?” She always had a very optimistic, positive approach, which is trendy nowadays. But way before there were self-help books about it, my mom always followed her heart. I really admire that.

She was a young model and the lifestyle in New York was crazy. I think, ultimately, she was a bit overwhelmed, so she brought me to Maine to live with my aunt and uncle and cousins, and I would also live with my grandparents sometimes. So I had a very family-rich childhood. I learned that you lean into your family, ask for help, and show compassion. My grandmother is still my best friend. It could have been a different road – I could have grown up alone in an apartment with a nanny.

I’m so grateful to Todd [Rundgren] for choosing to be a father figure to me. It’s a big thing for a man to say, “I know this kid might not be mine, but I still want to be her father.” Although he and my mom weren’t together, he was always a very stable, loving force in my life. It was so cool to visit Todd in Woodstock in the 1980s. I would get up early and go find him, because he stayed up all night working with his computers and went to sleep later in the day. That was just his normal artist’s schedule. He would have big parties every summer. I was 12 when I first met Michael Stipe at one of them, and he is now one of my close friends. That summer, my mom and I moved from Maine to New York and I was fascinated by the city. It was a different time, and she let me walk around our neighbourhood on my own. She had a lot of street-smarts, so she showed me the ropes. And I looked 22 when I was 12.

When I realised that Steven [Tyler, Aerosmith vocalist] was my father, it was a moment that was bigger than me, it was almost spiritual. When you meet kin, there is an energy and sparkle between your bodies. It must be chemical somehow – DNA and genes. I felt a connection in a very strong way when I met him as a little girl and I didn’t know why at first, but I figured it out rather quickly.

Steven and I look so alike and we do things in the same way. It was fun getting to know his side of the family. My sister Mia will just move her hand in a certain way and the mannerism is so like mine, it’s crazy.

Both my fathers are unconventional. They are like unicorns or wizards. They are musicians through and through. The way they think is just different. Their eccentricities have made me more practical and more normal, in a way. As a parent, my fantasy is to cook every meal, read every story, do everything, and also work all day. I’m overly hard on myself.

I’m celebrating my new family coming together. Sailor is two, Lula is six months, Milo [Liv’s son with Royston Langdon] is 12 and Gray [her partner David Gardner’s son from a previous relationship] is nine. We’ve gone on this crazy adventure together of blending our families and moving to London. It’s beautiful.

I never expected to give birth with my sister and my dad in the room. Sailor surprised me and came six weeks early, which was pretty scary. David was on a flight. I called Mia and she came straight to the hospital, and she also called Steven. He walked into the room moments before Sailor was born, and cut his umbilical cord. It was wild.

Her spring capsule collection is available now.It was already brave of the custodians of the Batman franchise to let The Lego Movie mock their prize asset so mercilessly in 2014. The fact that they’ve doubled down with this feature-length parody suggests they figure either Batman can take it, or that he’s reached that point in the superhero cycle where it’s no longer possible to take him seriously. Either way, this gag-packed, knockabout action-adventure has a lot of fun with the character, while also broaching his pathologies in a way the “serious movies” rarely do. It doesn’t have the heart, the depth or the novelty of the first Lego movie, but it is relentlessly, consistently funny – which excuses everything.

Voiced with Christian Bale-like gruffness by Will Arnett, this is the macho, humourless, self-regarding Dark Knight we get here, who imagines he’s brilliant at everything and prefers to work alone. “Batman doesn’t do ’ships,” (as in “relationships”) he tells a crestfallen Joker, denying there’s anything special between them during a spectacular opening fight (as with its predecessor, this movie’s Lego-bricked animation is surprisingly expressive and cinematic). Afterwards, our hero goes home to an empty Batcave for some microwaved lobster, a little solo heavy-metal guitar, and a night alone in his home cinema with Jerry Maguire. He’s a bit of a loser, in other words.

Inevitably, Batman’s solitude is challenged. First, by his inadvertent adoption of a wide-eyed, orphan kid, the future Robin, whom he initially regards as an expendable pest (many fans would agree). Then by the Joker. Stung by rejection, he’s hatching an even bigger plan to win back Batman’s attention and get their symbiotic relationship back on track. Meanwhile, new police commissioner, Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson), is advocating a fresh, co-operative approach to crime, noting that “despite all the great work Batman has done for us, Gotham is still the most crime-ridden city in the world”.

In a regular superhero movie, that would be saying the unsayable, but this parallel Lego universe can get away with it, and a whole lot more. The movie is chock-full of meta-references, one-liners and in-jokes (a cinema in the background is playing Two Shades of Grey, for example). There’s a hint of political subversion in the suggestion Batman’s methods are extra-legal and unaccountable. There’s even a Guantanamo-like Phantom Zone where criminals are locked away, outside the law. Mostly, the movie pokes fun at other fictions: rival DC superheroes, characters from other stories (including Gremlins and Daleks), and above all, Batman’s own chequered heritage.

At one point, Batman’s butler, Alfred, reminds him he’s had similar crises of identity before, listing the years of all the previous Batman movies right back to Batman: The Movie, the 1966 Adam West version, from which we see a live-action clip. The Lego Batman Movie knows it’s closer to this than any subsequent iterations. We even get on-screen POW!s and BAM!s. But this is also very much in the vein of current pop satire such as Robot Chicken (where director Chris McKay cut his teeth), Team America and last year’s Deadpool. In fact, this is basically Deadpool for juniors.

That is some achievement when you think about everything this movie has to do. Let’s not forget this is, at heart, a not-so-subliminal promo for two enormous commercial concerns: Batman and Lego. The merchandising is physically built in: many a young viewer will covet Batman’s new Scuttler ship (yours for £84.99). Really, they should be paying us to go and see it. The fact that the movie can satisfy its commercial imperatives, smuggle in some satirical jabs, and wrap it all up in an apparently irreverent, self-satirising comedy for all ages could be viewed as admirable or sinister, but this is, undeniably, a sophisticated product.

The bizarre and ancient microbes were found dormant in caves in Naica, in Mexico’s northern Chihuahua state, and were able to exist by living on minerals such as iron and manganese, said Penelope Boston, head of Nasa’s Astrobiology Institute.

“It’s super life,” said Boston, who presented the discovery on Friday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Boston. She said the creatures were like time machines.

If confirmed, the find is yet another example of how microbes can survive in extremely punishing conditions on Earth.

Though it was presented at a science conference and was the result of nine years of work, the findings haven’t yet been published in a scientific journal and haven’t been peer reviewed. Boston planned more genetic tests for the microbes she revived both in the lab and on site.

The life forms – 40 different strains of microbes and even some viruses – are so weird that their nearest relatives are still 10% different genetically. That made their closest relative pretty far away, about as far away as humans were from mushrooms, Boston said.

The Naica caves – an abandoned lead and zinc mine – are 800 metres (2,625 feet) deep. Before drilling occurred by a mine company, the mines had been completely cut off from the outside world. Some were as vast as cathedrals, with crystals lining the iron walls. They were also so hot that scientists had to don cheap versions of space suits – to prevent contamination with outside life – and had ice packs all over their bodies.

Boston said the team could only work about 20 minutes at a time before ducking to a “cool” room that was about 38C (100F).

Nasa wouldn’t allow Boston to share her work for outside review before Friday’s announcement so scientists couldn’t say much. But a University of South Florida biologist, Norine Noonan, who wasn’t part of the study but was on a panel where Boston presented her work, said it made sense.

“Why are we surprised?” Noonan said. “As a biologist I would say life on Earth is extremely tough and extremely versatile.”

This isn’t the oldest extreme life. Several years ago, a different group of scientists published studies about microbes that may be half a million years old and still alive. Those were trapped in ice and salt, which isn’t quite the same as rock or crystal, Boston said.

The age of the Naica microbes was determined by outside experts who looked at where the microbes were located in the crystals and how fast those crystals grow.

It’s not the only weird life Boston is examining. She is also studying microbes commonly found in caves in the United States, Ukraine and elsewhere that eat copper sulfate and seem to be close to indestructible.

“It’s simply another illustration of just how completely tough Earth life is,” Boston said.Design critic Oliver Wainwright goes behind the scenes at the Robots exhibition at the Science Museum in London.

Klopp’s side rediscovered form when they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 at Anfield, their first league win since New Year’s Eve ending a damaging sequence of one victory – against Plymouth in an FA Cup replay – in 10 matches. Saturday’s performance came after Liverpool’s first full week without a game since before Christmas and Klopp claims the demands of 12 games in 40 days – from the win over Stoke City on 27 December to defeat at Hull City on 4 February – took a significant toll. He believes Chelsea were relatively fresh to extend their lead at the Premier League summit, having been eliminated from the EFL Cup in October.

Asked what was the biggest lesson he learned during Liverpool’s poor run, Klopp replied: “December-January. Not even Chelsea came through without no problems but they were able to play the same team all the time. They left the EFL Cup when, before it started? [It was the fourth round] I don’t remember them playing one game in that competition. ‘Get rid of this.’ I spoke to Antonio [Conte] for a long time at Anfield, maybe 25 minutes, and he mentioned it [the fixture schedule] but said they could play the same 13-14 players all the time. That is the big difference.

“In December we missed players and did not have the best schedule. From 31 December [a 1-0 win over Manchester City] to 2 January [a 2-2 draw at Sunderland] you could see the difference physically. Oh, my God – what have we done? It was not that we had all the players to change it at Sunderland. It was a few things. On a few things we had an influence and on others we did not have an influence – we conceded goals, offside against us, penalty against us.

“We could have had two, three or four points more. With two points more instead of an offside goal for Man United, and I don’t want to make a story of it, then we are in the same situation but with 51 points. Only because of one decision and the games staying the same. Hull – first half really not good, Southampton – not good enough, Chelsea – good, United – good, Swansea – silly but not bad, we played pretty good until we stopped playing. We are not used to being a top team, maybe we have to be. We are not clever like Chelsea who will be 2-0 up and just finish a game.”

Despite a problematic start to 2017, Liverpool drew 1-1 at Manchester United, having led for most of the match, and held Chelsea at home by the same scoreline before beating Mauricio Pochettino’s challengers convincingly. Klopp claims home and away defeats by Southampton in the EFL Cup semi-finals changed the complexion of Liverpool’s recent run, suggesting it would have been more beneficial to exit the competition earlier.

Klopp, who has taken his players to La Manga this week for what he described as pre-season training, added: “They are all human beings and of course they are influenced by the things they see every day. Did I learn anything new about them in the last few weeks? Yes. A lot of what I wanted to learn? No. But that is how it is. I am not one bit in doubt about the character of these players but of course we have to create mentality. We had a few moments when we didn’t deliver, didn’t perform, although not too often in the Premier League otherwise we couldn’t be where we are now.

Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool ‘should not go nuts’ despite win over Tottenham Read more

“It felt worse because of different cup competitions. We should have been out of the EFL Cup last year, and that would have meant two less defeats this year in a moment when we needed each second for bringing a player back from injury, for recovery, for training, all that stuff. It didn’t help but that’s how it is. We cannot make a wishlist and say: ‘What do we want?’ We have to deal with all the circumstances. Now, before the Tottenham game, we created a situation. You say to the boys: ‘Where will this lead us?’

“Man United had won so it was clear we needed to win to show what we really want to do in the rest of the season. It was important and it was a really good sign. It is not that I think is normal to react this way. You have to take everything and fight but it looks a little bit stiff, not fluent. But the boys were in a good moment and they used this.”Donald Trump’s apparent readiness to accept a one-state solution to the Middle East conflict that would permanently rule out a Palestinian nation is emboldening rightwing Zionists in the US – both among Jewish Americans and the much larger pool of pro-Israeli evangelical Christians.

Some Zionist groups welcomed with delight the president’s unexpected comment on Wednesday that tore up the longstanding US adherence to a two-state solution in which Israel would coexist peacefully alongside a fully formed Palestine.

“I’m looking at two-state and one-state and I like the one that both parties like,” he said.

Morton Klein, president of the oldest pro-Israel group in the US, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), said that Trump’s remark marked a turning point.

“We have entered a new sane, rational era in dealing with the Arab-Islamic war against Israel – it’s remarkable that he has backed off from supporting a Palestinian state,” he said.

ZOA has long opposed a Palestinian state. Critics of the one-state solution point out that it would destroy the fundamental character of Israel as a democratic Jewish state: Arabs and Palestinians would numerically be dominant in a single state and that in turn would either eradicate the Jewish nature of the country or force it to forgo democracy by relegating the Palestinians to second-class status.

As former secretary of state John Kerry put it last December: “If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic – it cannot be both – and it won’t ever really be at peace.”

Klein dismissed that objection as “one of the great propaganda myths”. He said the difficulty could be overcome either by allowing Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank “to continue living their own lives” within autonomous areas in which Israel still had control over security, or by allowing West Bank residents to become citizens of Jordan.

But advocates of a progressive two-state solution to the crisis expressed dismay at Trump’s shock departure from established US policy.

Dylan Williams, chief lobbyist of the Washington-based group J Street, which wants to see a democratic Jewish state living peacefully alongside a Palestinian country, said: “The president is really playing with fire here in a way that he probably doesn’t grasp yet. He seriously risks jeopardizing the bipartisan policy that has held for so long in the US, that a two-state solution is essential to a negotiated end to the conflict.”

The differing responses of ZOA and J Street are representative of a rift among the 6 million American Jews. “There are increasingly two American Jewries, Orthodox and Reform, and that split is increasing rather than diminishing,” said Herb Weisberg, a political scientist at Ohio State University who is writing a book on the politics of American Jews.

The more progressive-leaning Reform movement – which tends to side with the two-state solution – accounts for 35% of the overall community, according to Pew Research, together with another third that identify with no denomination at all.

By contrast, the more conservative-leaning Orthodox Jews amount to only 10%. But though they are the relative underdogs numerically, they carry an increasingly influential punch given their close ties to the Republican party – and to Trump, whose son-in-law and Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, is an Orthodox Jew.

Trump’s choice of US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has called for the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.

Of particular importance to the changing debate on Israel within the US is Aipac, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which enjoys a lion-sized influence on Capitol Hill. The lobby group presents itself as bipartisan, though in practice it has moved steadily towards the hardline position.

Technically, it still sides with the idea of a Palestinian state as part of the long-term solution to the conflict, but its shifting approach became clear a week after Trump’s election last November, when it expunged reference to the two-state solution from its website. (Following a public outcry, the material was put back up again).

Aipac did not respond to Guardian requests for comment.

Arguably the most important group steering the US-Israeli relationship is not Jewish at all, but Christian evangelical. Again, the numbers are significant: the Jewish community is tiny compared with up to 80 million evangelicals.

Within that group, twice as many white evangelical Protestants as Jews subscribe to the biblical belief that God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, Pew has found.

Their influence is amplified also by representation within Trump’s inner circle, in this case Vice-President Mike Pence, who describes himself as a “born-again, evangelical Catholic”.

He addressed Aipac in 2009 and said: “Let me say emphatically, like the overwhelming majority of my constituents, my Christian faith compels me to cherish the state of Israel.”

Evangelical Zionists are wielding increasing influence in Congress, emboldened by the Trump administration and Pence in particular. Christians United for Israel (CUFI), the largest of all pro-Israel groups in the US, has begun to exert pressure on Congress members by ranking them according to their voting record in an echo of how the National Rifle Association browbeats representatives into being pro-gun.

CUFI, which follows the biblical commandment to speak out in favor of Zion, would not talk to the Guardian about its position on Trump’s shifting policy. Its communications director, Ari Morgenstern, would only say: “Our longstanding policy has been to stand with the democratically elected government of Israel and defer to Jerusalem on such matters.”

But its director, David Brog, has said that its members are “skeptical of the two-state solution”.It was routine in the end, perfect preparation for Manchester City’s visit on New Year’s Eve and another reminder to Chelsea and the watching Pep Guardiola that Liverpool will remain in their company for some time to come. But there was more to an ultimately comfortable victory over Stoke City than a further demonstration of the ruthless efficiency that Jürgen Klopp has created at Anfield. It took confidence under pressure and absolute faith in their methods for Liverpool to stage an emphatic recovery.

When Daniel Sturridge rounded the goalkeeper Lee Grant and rolled in his first Premier League goal since April to complete victory he also took Liverpool to 100 league goals in 48 games under Klopp. Only Kenny Dalglish reached the century in as few games as Liverpool manager. The show of strength and the range of Liverpool’s attacking threat would not have been lost on Guardiola, whose presence in the main stand Klopp took as a mark of respect from a fellow contender.

But it was unmistakable how the home team had toiled against Stoke’s direct approach and two-man attack until Adam Lallana equalised Jonathan Walters’ early goal and how, even when unsettled, Liverpool never lost their belief or ability to hurt their opponents. Stoke’s generosity was boundless, with individual errors contributing to all Liverpool goals, and Klopp had the options at his disposal to ensure there would be no first managerial win at Anfield for Mark Hughes or top-flight league win here for his team. Roberto Firmino, his place never in doubt according to Klopp despite being arrested for drink driving on Christmas Eve, and an own goal from Giannelli Imbula joined Lallana and Sturridge in completing the recovery.

Hughes believed Stoke had the players and the gameplan to hurt Liverpool and so it proved when they took the lead from their first period of sustained possession and continued to trouble the home defence until Lallana levelled in the 35th minute. Peter Crouch, deployed as the obvious outlet against his former club, headed Mame Diouf’s cross goalwards and, though Ragnar Klavan hooked clear, Sadio Mané was slow to react to the second ball. Erik Pieters easily won their aerial challenge and delivered an inviting left-wing cross to the near post where Walters arrived ahead of Dejan Lovren. The Republic of Ireland international and boyhood Evertonian steered a glancing header beyond Simon Mignolet at his near post. Mignolet got a hand to the ball but was unable to redirect its path.

Joe Allen, who prospered in the first half on his return to Anfield, almost doubled the visitors’ lead when Jordan Henderson and Lovren failed to clear and he weaved his way into the area and shot low towards the far corner. Mignolet produced a vital save with his foot, the ball spun away from Crouch lurking in front of an open goal to Walters, and his follow‑up was blocked by Klavan. Stoke would have other opportunities on the counterattack but none as clear as that key moment. Liverpool heeded the warning and were ruthless once they awoke.

Henderson and Lallana went close, Firmino closer still when he reacted quickest to a Ryan Shawcross clearance and beat Grant with a low drive that Crouch cleared on the line. The pressure was growing but Stoke had defended well until a lapse by Glen Johnson offered Klopp’s team a way back in. Divock Origi produced a fine piece of centre-forward play to shield possession under pressure then spray the ball out to Mané on the right. His cross was met with a heavy touch by Lallana but, instead of clearing for a corner, Johnson miscontrolled and invited the England international – being watched by the national manager Gareth Southgate – to slip a clinical finish inside Grant’s near post from a tight angle. The pattern for the rest of the game had been set.

Firmino edged Liverpool ahead moments when he collected James Milner’s pass inside the area and found himself with time and space to pick his shot, despite Allen, Johnson and Shawcross being in proximity. The Brazil international produced a fine finish that kissed the inside of both posts before crossing the goal-line. Stoke complained to the referee Michael Oliver that play should have been halted with Mané lying injured in an offside position. He was neither interfering with play or responsible for the weak defending that continued unabated in the second half.

Any hopes Stoke harboured of a point were destroyed when Imbula started and finished a flowing move. Unfortunately for the visiting midfielder it came at the wrong end of the pitch. His poor header, under no pressure, gave possession to Henderson who unlocked the Stoke rearguard with a fine pass inside Johnson to Origi. The Belgium international crossed low and hard and the recovering Imbula converted into his own net under pressure from Mané.

Sturridge delivered Liverpool’s fourth 56 seconds after replacing Origi and thanks to a careless back-pass from Shawcross. The Stoke captain never looked up as he played Johnson’s square ball straight into the feet of Sturridge, who ended his uncharacteristic recent drought in the Premier League. The stage is set nicely for City’s visit on Saturday.Former deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg tells Owen Jones that as the EU referendum approached its climax, he told the then prime minister David Cameron he needed to deliver a more emotional message to combat the powerful Brexit slogan of ‘take back control’John Oliver returns to host HBO’s Last Week Tonight on Sunday to dissect the troubling falsehoods in President Trump’s statements and exactly where they originate.

Melissa McCarthy steals the show as Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live Read more

These were some of the verdicts last week on Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. But they were not based on cable news reports or newspaper stories. They were based on Melissa McCarthy.

“You like that, dork?” yelled the actor and comedian, playing Spicer as a scowling, demented bully as she picked up the famed White House lectern and rammed it into reporters in the briefing room. The Saturday Night Live sketch was so funny because it was almost true. Standup comedian Andy Kindler observed: “I think it’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen.”

Donald Trump’s presidency is a galvanising moment not only for protest and journalism but also political satire. From his haze of hair to his erratic tweets to the colourful characters who surround him, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving.

Promotional ads for Britain’s John Oliver, who returns for a new series on Sunday on cable network HBO, depict him cowering behind a desk with the tagline, “Scary times call for a scared man.” Late-night TV hosts Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah are relishing a White House suddenly swollen with comedy gold. Satire is booming online, from the Onion to countless parody accounts and social media memes.

But it is NBC’s Saturday Night Live – due to be hosted on Saturday by Alec Baldwin, now the definitive Trump impersonator – that has shown how wit can be weaponised. The president watches the show and reveals his thin skin by frequently firing back on Twitter.

Sidney Blumenthal, who was assistant and senior adviser to Bill Clinton when he was president, said: “Saturday Night Live is the vanguard of the opposition party, which is the media. There’s a desperate race for satire to keep in front of the reality, or surreality.”

Spicer is a prime example. The Guardian witnessed up close his first, blistering performance in the White House briefing room, when he ranted false claims about the size of the crowd at Trump’s inauguration and stormed out without taking questions. Much has been written since about his combative style, but it was McCarthy who pinned it wriggling on the wall as only satire can.

The Bridesmaids and Ghostbusters star, in a fittingly ill-fitting suit, captured Spicer’s gum-chewing scorn and penchant for hyperbole about his boss. Describing a recent Trump appearance, she proclaimed: “The crowd greeted him with a standing ovation, which lasted a full 15 minutes. And you can check the tape on that. Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy. The men all had erections, and every single one of the women was ovulating left and right. And no one, no one was sad. Those are the facts forever.”

McCarthy’s caustic performance has been viewed on YouTube more than 20m times. Spicer himself said she “could dial it back” but Trump remained unusually and ominously silent. Politico reported: “More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes, according to sources close to him … ‘Trump doesn’t like his people to look weak,’ added a top Trump donor.”

Every time you look at him, you’ll think of Melissa McCarthy. That he was played by a woman made it even more stunning Frank Luntz on Sean Spicer

Just as British politicians and royals found themselves framed by Spitting Image, and John Major by Steve Bell’s cartoons of him wearing his underpants over his trousers, Spicer may now always be seen through the prism of McCarthy’s caricature.

Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant and pollster, said the impression was “devastating. People who know him and work with him will never see him in the same light again. Every time you look at him, you’ll think of Melissa McCarthy. She looked like him and the fact he was played by a woman made it even more stunning.”

From the other side of the aisle, Bob Shrum, a Democratic consultant and strategist, reached for the same word: “Devastating.” He continued: “Forever after he will be Melissa McCarthy. You watch the daily briefing and you see Melissa McCarthy.”

Other senior Trump aides include Kellyanne Conway, notorious for statements about “alternative facts”, and Steve Bannon, an alleged white nationalist who has spoken admiringly of Darth Vader and Satan and is portrayed on SNL as the Grim Reaper. This week comedian and Trump foe Rosie O’Donnell changed her Twitter profile picture to look like him and offered to play the part.

Shrum said: “There’s so much here to satirise. Imagine trying to do same kind of satire to the same comic effect on the Barack Obama administration. People would laugh but it would not create that indelible impression of the president and those around him. Trump creates the opportunity for satirists that no president has done: not even Nixon.”

He added: “Saturday Night Live is very powerful. It’s become a cultural phenomenon in a way it hasn’t been for years. It’s got a whole art form in taking our politics and showing them through a different lens.”

According to Variety, the show’s ratings have increased by 22%, its strongest start to a season in more than two decades. Launched in 1975, SNL is an American institution with alumni including Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Amy Poehler and Kristen Wiig.

Saturday Night Live is what Roman satirists were in the ancient world. From cycle to cycle to cycle they hit it right Jon Meacham

After lean years it enjoyed a renaissance during last year’s election. Trump himself hosted one episode, drawing protests, but then he was mercilessly lampooned by Baldwin, while Kate McKinnon earned plaudits as Hillary Clinton in memorable spoofs of the presidential debates.

After Trump’s shock victory, McKinnon’s Clinton turned up on the doorstep of an electoral college member, silently working through handwritten cards in a pitch-perfect imitation of the film Love Actually. Baldwin’s Trump was confronted at a press conference by bare-chested Russian president Vladimir Putin brandishing a “Pee Pee Tape” – an example of how satire can cut through the fog of media rumour, denial and innuendo with a simple message.

Jon Meacham, a presidential historian, said: “Saturday Night Live is what the Roman satirists were in the ancient world. From cycle to cycle to cycle they hit it right. Remember Tina Fey as [former vice-presidential candidate] Sarah Palin. Now it looks as though we may be entering a golden age. The Trump presidency is a full employment act for political satire, both professional and amateur. If he passes no other stimulus bill, he has created a lot of work there.”

It is evident from Trump’s tweets that he devours cable TV news: sometimes he responds to an item that appeared minutes earlier on Fox News, or takes a swipe at CNN. He regularly lambasts the “failing” New York Times. But it is clear from his outbursts that, despite the heavy burdens of state, the most powerful man in the world also finds time to monitor Saturday Night Live.

Bill Burton, a former deputy press secretary who has stood at the lectern in the west wing, said: “What’s remarkable about how Saturday Night Live has treated the Trump administration is how the Trump administration has reacted to it. It’s effective in that it’s getting under the skin in a way it shouldn’t be getting under their skin.

“When you’re in the White House, you’re at the absolute pinnacle of global power. So to spend any time at all talking about a Saturday night TV show is remarkable.”

At its best, satire can speak to deeper truths than the news of the day. The Onion, founded by two students in 1988, has seen presidents come and go but never one like this. “Steve Bannon Mixes Discarded Climate Change Report With Saliva To Build Final Wall Of Nest,” read a headline last week, with a picture of an alien-like nest in the White House. Far newer on the scene is “Donaeld The Unready”, a Twitter account that casts the president as a medieval king: “Canute. What a loser. Can’t even hold back the sea. It’s just water. We’re going to be so tough on the sea. Canute was too soft. Sad.”

And when Spicer asserted last week, “I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn’t wear one,” pictures of Trump in that garment inevitably raced across social media. Dark humour has also been manifest on many of the placards carried by protesters in Washington and other cities. They have included “#FreeMelania” and “Super Callous Fragile Ego, Trump You Are Atrocious”.

For years, Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart – a “fake news” show before the term went from benign to malignant – skewered the powerful and punctured the 24-hour news cycle. With spectacularly bad timing, Stewart quit the show soon after Trump launched his election campaign. “America’s id is running for president!” the host declared in June 2015. “Thank you, Donald Trump, for making my last six weeks my best six weeks.”

The court had lost its jester but Stewart was succeeded by South African Trevor Noah, who has compared Trump to African dictators such as Idi Amin and Muammar Gaddafi. The comedy is seldom closer to the bone than when Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj, a Muslim, ponders what Trump’s attitude to the religion means for him. Former Daily Show correspondents Bee, Colbert and Oliver and SNL graduate Meyers have also run riot against the president.

Bee recently announced plans for a Trump-free alternative to this year’s White House correspondents dinner, an annual media gathering attended by the president, officials and celebrities. Whereas Obama proved a gifted speaker with comic timing, Trump’s first dinner is likely to be a more awkward affair. Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, said: “That’s a test. When you have your first White House correspondents dinner, you have to make fun of yourself. It’ll be interesting to see how he does.”

Along with the courts, civil society and media, satire is arguably a vital sign of democratic life and a check on authoritarianism. Steele, who was once turned into a Muppet by the Daily Show, said: “There is a long tradition; we get it from our cousins in Great Britain. I learned more about British government members through Monty Python than anything else. In one sense it’s showing respect but in another it’s not showing respect and that’s what makes it work.

“No one is calling for the overthrow of the government but we are getting you to look at your own foibles and showing that we are listening, we are taking you seriously and, when you screw up, we are going to tell you and tell the world.”

Poking fun at presidents … and Palin

Thomas Jefferson

Under the title “A Philosophic Cock”, America’s third president was depicted in a cartoon as a preening rooster courting a hen, alias Jefferson’s slave Sally Hemings, with whom he fathered a child when she was 17. Political opponents sought to destroy Jefferson’s presidency with accusations of promiscuous behaviour and his ownership of slaves.

Andrew Johnson

Thomas Nast, a German immigrant dubbed the “father of the American cartoon”, supported Abraham Lincoln but opposed Johnson’s Reconstruction policy, depicting him as a brutal autocrat and portraying southerners as ruthlessly exploiting African Americans.

John F Kennedy

Vaughn Meader, a standup comedian, gained instant celebrity in 1962 with his record The First Family, an impeccable voice impression of John F Kennedy and those close to him. But when Kennedy was assassinated, clubs and TV shows canceled Meader’s appearances. He turned to drink and drugs and often referred to 22 November 1963 as “the day I died”.

Gerald Ford

Chevy Chase of Saturday Night Live played Ford as bumbling and prone to falling over. Asked an economics question during a spoof debate, Chase’s Ford replied: “I’m sorry, but I was told there would be no math on the exam.” Comedian Andy Kindler draws a contrast with Trump: “When you go back to Chevy Chase making fun of Gerald Ford falling down, I wasn’t afraid of Gerald Ford blowing the world up.”

George HW Bush

Regularly played by Dana Carvey on Saturday Night Live. Carvey essayed the roles of both Bush and Ross Perot in a three-way debate with Bill Clinton, played by Phil Hartman, in 1992. Bush eventually invited him to the White House. A blogpost on Slate.com in 2015 was headlined: “Why Dana Carvey’s George H.W. Bush Is the Best Impression of All Time.”

George W Bush

His Saturday Night Live persona was created by Will Ferrell. In 2001, the New York Times said: “Mr Ferrell’s George Bush was an inarticulate, squinty-eyed frat boy doing his best to fake his way through final exams.” Ferrell still returns to the role on occasion: last year his Bush trashed Trump.

Sarah Palin

Tina Fey was uncannily accurate as the gaffe-prone Alaska governor who was John McCain’s running mate in 2008. In one Saturday Night Live sketch, Fey’s Palin said: “I can see Russia from my house.” Today many people think Palin herself made the statement and still mock her for it.Late-night hosts took aim at former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after just 24 days on the job.

On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked about Flynn’s assertion that he wasn’t aware that his calls with Russia would have been recorded.

The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Tonight at 11/10c, Michael Flynn is the first of Trump’s cabinet to resign. (We had our money on Spicer…) pic.twitter.com/I4yQShaqh7

“He didn’t know that the US government routinely taps calls to the Russians, which is stupid,” he said. “That’s the plot of every spy movie: America taps Russia’s calls. Everyone should know that.”

He also ridiculed Flynn’s excuse for not conveying all of the information to Mike Pence: the “fast pace” of the job.

“That’s not a valid excuse,” he said. “That just sounds like you’re trying to tell someone a story and you’re both on opposite trains, and that’s why you couldn’t tell them the story.”

On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert took pleasure in the overwhelmingly poor start to the ex-reality TV star’s presidency. “By now I’m sure you’ve all heard the news: the Trump administration is going great,” he said.

He referred to Flynn as “former national security adviser and man who doesn’t see what’s so damn funny” before joking about his actions: “It’s funny because it’s treason.”

He also commented on Trump’s lack of action throughout, despite former attorney general Sally Yates saying weeks prior that she was concerned Flynn was susceptible to Russian blackmail. “The president did nothing about it, but then he’s very busy attacking Nordstrom, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings and then firing Sally Yates,” he said.

John Oliver on Trump and the truth: 'a pathological liar' Read more

Colbert also found time to criticize the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, who claimed that Flynn leaving was not about legality but rather trust.

“Yes, it wasn’t a legal issue, it was a trust issue,” he said. “Trump stopped trusting Flynn because Flynn did something that was so darn illegal that Trump had to ask for his resignation. Say what you will about Sean Spicer, but he is the MC Escher of bullshit.”

Spicer also claimed that Trump has been incredibly tough on Russia. “Trump has been incredibly tough on Russia,” Colbert said. “I mean, the hotel dry cleaning bills alone.”

On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host also brought up Flynn’s short time as national security adviser. “Twenty-four days!” he said. “I use disposable razors longer than that. He didn’t even last as long as a David Blaine stunt.”

He also played footage of Flynn last year calling for Hillary Clinton to be charged for misconduct. “I guess that’s why Flynn’s resignation letter was just the words ‘lock me up’, written Shining-style on a typewriter,” he said.

He then moved on to Stephen Miller, who he said “looks like the guy who shows up with a flashlight when teens are getting drunk in a graveyard”.

There was also time to remind viewers of Kellyanne Conway’s deceptive tactics: “Just a reminder that if Kellyanne Conway is ever on TV saying there isn’t a tornado coming, get in the basement,” he said.

He also found footage of Trump claiming he had no idea that Flynn was being investigated for a connection with Russia. “Trump sounds like a guy who’s being told there’s a nude scene in a movie he’s definitely already watched,” he said.For Arsenal perhaps the most demoralising part is that nobody can even be greatly surprised any more. Once again they have flatlined in the first knockout stage of the Champions League, a competition that is simply beyond their reach. It will be the seventh successive season they have lost their way at this point and, for all the disappointments in the second part of the Arsène Wenger era, it is difficult to think of another occasion when they have looked so far removed from the elite.

Arsène Wenger admits Arsenal ‘mentally collapsed’ during Bayern Munich rout Read more

Wenger sounded broken afterwards and talked of his side having “mentally collapsed” but these faultlines are nothing new. This was just the latest evidence – possibly the most conclusive evidence – that the modern-day team is too vulnerable, too fragile and simply incapable of disturbing teams with Bayern Munich’s haughty self-regard. Arsenal’s supporters booed their team off the pitch and this time nobody should accuse them of lacking gratitude or of kneejerk reactions. If Arsenal genuinely want to be one of Europe’s superpowers, it is clear Wenger’s position needs a lot of thought between now and the end of the season.

It was certainly a collapse of spectacular and rare proportions once Bayern Munich puffed out their chests and scored three times in a 10-minute blitz early in the second half. Carlo Ancelotti’s team were unsparing once they realised their opponents were contemplating surrender and it was almost a surprise the Bundesliga champions waited until the 88th minute before scoring again, via the substitute Thomas Müller, and completing a rout that means Arsenal will require one of the greatest nights of Wenger’s reign to go through.

Unfortunately for Wenger, the idea of a 4-0 home win on 7 March feels implausible when his team are susceptible to these kinds of meltdowns. More likely Bayern will just add more goals. Wenger talked about the last 25 minutes being “a nightmare” but it was actually much longer than that. No team can defend this generously and get away with it. The lack of structure and organisation was startling and nobody should genuinely believe Alexis Sánchez’s first-half goal could yet instigate what, for Arsenal, would be nothing short of a football miracle.

Bayern Munich v Arsenal: Champions League last 16, first leg – live! Read more

Bayern have now won their last 16 Champions League assignments at home, accumulating 58 goals in the process. Thiago Alcântara scored twice during the part of the game when Wenger’s men caved in from a position of relative strength. Arjen Robben had opened the scoring in the first half and, however accustomed one might be to Arsenal’s shortcomings, it was still genuinely shocking to see what happened after Robert Lewandowski made it 2-1 eight minutes into the second half.

Arsenal, in stark contrast, have lost the first leg of their last-16 encounters six times in a row. On each occasion they have been beaten by two goals or more, conceding 19 in total, and though they were clearly hampered by an injury to Laurent Koscielny early in the second half, it still does not explain why Arsenal virtually gave up once Bayern went back into the lead shortly afterwards.

Wenger noted later that, at 1-1, Granit Xhaka and Mesut Özil both had chances to put Arsenal ahead. It was true and for a while the game had actually swung in Arsenal’s favour. Sánchez had the beating of Mats Hummels, a centre-half who can be vulnerable on the turn, and Lewandowski’s carelessness had left Koscielny on the floor for a penalty decision that, briefly, threatened to change the complexion of the night. Sánchez eventually managed to get the rebound past Manuel Neuer, scoring after Bayern’s goalkeeper had saved the penalty.

At the same time there was always the sense that Bayern had enough penetration in attack to add more goals and that Arsenal, defensively, were far too open.

Robben’s goal was a beauty but, from an Arsenal perspective, it summed up their disorganisation that he was allowed to cut in from the right, his favourite old trick, looking for the angle to take aim with his left foot. He has been doing it all his career and it was baffling, to say the least, that the two nearest opponents, Alex Iwobi and Francis Coquelin, did not sense the danger. Robben’s intentions were clear and he scored, brilliantly, with a soaring, diagonal shot into the top corner of David Ospina’s net.

Bayern’s second goal also originated on the right. This time Robben and the overlapping Philipp Lahm had doubled up on Kieran Gibbs. Lewandowski was in the penalty area, outjumping Shkodran Mustafi to score with an expertly placed header, and the body language of Arsenal’s players as they made their way back to the centre circle was one clue about what was to follow. Özil, with his sagging shoulders, will inevitably be scapegoated but this was a collective malaise.

Alcântara’s first goal came from one of the game’s outstanding moments, a beautifully disguised drag-back from Lewandowski to split open the entire Arsenal defence, and from that point onwards Ospina’s goal felt permanently under threat. The pressure was relentless and, with so many bodies in such a confined space, Alcântara’s next shot took a deflection to wrong-foot Ospina and make it 4-1. Bayern were still not done and Müller lashed in the fifth after Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain had given the ball away. Wenger’s press conference was cut short after three questions; he looked grey.The Walt Disney Company has severed ties with YouTube’s biggest star PewDiePie after he posted a series of videos featuring antisemitic comments.

PewDiePie, real name Felix Kjellberg, is a 27-year-old Swede who built a huge fanbase making opinionated videos, mostly about video games. With more than 53 million subscribers on YouTube, Kjellberg has turned his videos into a lucrative business, earning more than $14m per year from advertising, sponsorship and appearance fees.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest PewDiePie announcing Revelmode through a joint venture with Disney’s Maker Studios

A key part of PewDiePie’s empire is a joint venture he formed with Disney’s Maker Studios in 2014. This gave him co-ownership of a multi-channel network called Revelmode that produces videos, mobile apps and merchandise. Following an investigation into the antisemitic content by the Wall Street Journal, Disney has ended this joint venture.

According to the Journal’s analysis, over the last six months the YouTuber posted nine videos that include either antisemitic jokes or Nazi imagery, including one, posted on 11 January, that featured two men holding a banner that stated: “Death to all Jews”. Another video, posted 22 January, featured a man dressed as Jesus saying, “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong”.

A spokeswoman for Maker Studios said in a statement: “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate. Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.”

YouTube hasn’t removed any of the videos, although PewDiePie’s channel has pulled three of them.

On Sunday Kjellberg wrote a blog post “to clear some things up”.

He said that his comments were jokes that have been taken out of context and that the video with the banner was created to show “how crazy the modern world is”. He used freelance marketplace Fiverr to hire two men in India to make the offensive sign.

“I think it’s important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,” he said. “Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.”

“As laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don’t support these people in any way.”

PewDiePie’s comments have made him popular with neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, which has run a series of articles about the YouTuber, describing him as “our guy”.

“He could be doing all this only to cause a stir things up and get free publicity,” wrote the Daily Stormer.

“Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, since the effect is the same; it normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies.”

The site has even added a banner describing itself as “the world’s #1 PewDiePie fansite”.

Without the Disney joint venture, PewDiePie will have to produce his videos independently or find a new partner.The Girls Who Code founder is making it her mission to improve the technology sector’s diversity

The script predicted that La La Land would clean up at the Baftas. Instead the unashamedly old-fashioned feelgood musical – an antidote to the age – came away from the 2017 ceremony with five awards, including the top prize of best film.

Baftas 2017: full list of winners Read more

It was a good night but far from the juggernaut which had been widely anticipated. The prizes were spread strikingly widely with more than 15 winners including Manchester By the Sea, Fences, Lion, Arrival, Hacksaw Ridge, Jackie, Fences, and Florence Foster Jenkins.



Some had tipped La La Land to finally break the Bafta record set by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which won nine prizes in 1971.

It did not come close, although those involved can hold their heads high with awards for best film, best director for Damien Chazelle, best actress for Emma Stone, best cinematography and original music.

Ryan Gosling missed out on best actor to Casey Affleck for his unforgettable performance in Manchester By the Sea, and Chazelle was pipped to best original screenplay prize by Kenneth Lonergan for the same film.

Lonergan told the audience how his 15-year-old daughter had woken in tears after Donald Trump was elected US president, but had since been on five protest marches since. “I’m very, very proud of her.”

La La Land – a romance between an aspiring actor (Stone) and a jazz pianist (Gosling) – has proved popular with many because it is about as far from politics and worrying about Trump and Brexit and the refugee crisis, North Korea and beached whales in New Zealand, as it is possible to get.

But controversy was never far away from the glitzy, starry ceremony at London’s Royal Albert Hall.

Ken Loach: Tory government 'callous, brutal and disgraceful' and 'must be removed' Read more

Ken Loach, whose gritty, angry I, Daniel Blake won the outstanding British film award, was most passionate.



The 80-year-old thanked Bafta for endorsing a truth “that the most vulnerable and poorest people are treated by this government with a contempt and a callous brutality that is disgraceful ... it is a brutality that extends to keeping out refugee children we promised to help.”

Loach said the world was getting darker and there was a struggle coming between the rich, the powerful and the rest of us. “The film-makers know which side they’re on.”

Later he went further, saying that the “government had to be removed”. He hoped that voters would see his film, but there was little point politicians doing so, as “the people actually implementing these decisions know what they’re doing. It’s conscious.”

Their welfare policies, he said, harked back to the Victorian workhouse ethos of telling people that poverty was their fault. “They know they’re doing. We have to change them; they have to be removed.”

Stone also flirted with politics when she said in her acceptance speech that “the world is going through a bit of a time” and that it was important to celebrate creativity.

Surprises in multiple categories meant that many films won just one statuette. Jackie won the best costume design award, Arrival won best sound, Hacksaw Ridge won best editing, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them best production design.

The former Skins and Slumdog Millionaire actor Dev Patel won best supporting actor for his portrayal of a young man’s Google Earth search for his real mother in Lion, beating hot favourite Mahershala Ali. The movie in which Ali co-stars, Moonlight, was ignored entirely by the body.

He was visibly moved. “Wow! That just happened,” he said.“Words, words, words. I sit at home and watch this with my family; it is such an overwhelming feeling.”

Viola Davis had been widely tipped to win best supporting actress and she did so for her powerful performance in Fences.

She used the press conference after her Bafta win to caution that this year – in which Fences, Hidden Figures and Moonlight have taken a slew of silverware – may be an anomaly. “I believe what still is a deficiency is that we have one year a plethora of American-American movies and then the next year nothing.”

Other awards included the special visual effects prize going to The Jungle Book; the animated film award to Kubo and the Two Strings; make-up and hair to Florence Foster Jenkins.

Stephen Fry was hosting the awards for the 12th time. He kept proceedings light and frothy, and called none of his friends a bag lady, avoiding last year’s row which ended in him quitting Twitter after insulting costume designer Jenny Beavan. His one reference to Trump was saying only “a blithering idiot” would not think Meryl Streep was one of the greatest female actors of all time

The final award of the evening went to Mel Brooks who received Bafta’s highest honour, a fellowship. He joins an impressive list which includes Sidney Poitier, Helen Mirren, Woody Allen and Alfred Hitchcock who was the first recipient in 1971.

Brooks, who made the films The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, said before the ceremony: “I am not overwhelmed, but I am definitely whelmed by this singular honour.”

Accepting the award, Brooks said that to follow in the footsteps of people like Hitchcock, Olivier and Pressburger was singular honour. It was a sincere speech but also a funny one, apologising to Prince William for the American Revolution – “We were young” – and saying he had arrived in the UK forgetting to bring his passport. “I don’t think of England as a foreign country, I think of it as a vast Brooklyn which just speaks better.”

Other prizes included best adapted screenplay award to Luke Davies for the film Lion; the best documentary winner was 13th, Ava DuVernay’s powerful exploration of the American criminal justice system; and the best foreign language film went to Son of Saul, last year’s foreign language Oscar winner, which beat this year’s favourite, Toni Erdmann.

The new skyscraper promises to bring a hectare of forest into the city's central business district, as well as hundreds of new homes. Rather than cold steel and glass, the surface of this high-rise will ripple with organic life.

Made of two towers – one 80m high, the other 112m – Bosco Verticale is currently being planted with 730 specially cultivated trees, 11,000 groundcover plants and 5,000 shrubs. One of the principal architects, Stefano Boeri, calls it both "radical" and an "experiment"; a reaction against the "high parallelepipeds, clad by glass, steel or ceramic" he's witnessed in Dubai.

Big deal for 'biological architecture'

Jill Fehrenbacher, editor of Inhabitat and a follower of architecture trends, says proposals for buildings featuring copious vegetation are increasingly common. "I have yet to see very many of these 'living building' designs become reality, which is why the Bosco Verticale is such a big deal," she says.

The interdisciplinary team working on the project includes botanists as well as engineers. Their research has ventured into testing the wind resistance of certain species of tree in wind tunnels, as well as finding a suitably lightweight substrate able to meet plants' nutritional demands. The residents' needs are also important – trees will be trimmed so foliage doesn't interrupt their views.

Boeri explains that the Bosco Verticale "hands over to vegetation itself the task of absorbing the dust in the air and of creating an adequate micro-climate in order to filter out the sunlight. This is a kind of biological architecture, which refuses to adopt a strictly technological and mechanical approach to environmental sustainability."

Singapore sky gardens

The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore is another example of a towering building-cum-garden in a dense urban area, but this one is already open for business. WOHA, the architects, says it was inspired by headlands, promontories and planted terraces. Richard Hassell, the firm's founding director, enjoys blurring the distinction between hard architecture and soft landscapes but admits that working with plants is a challenge.

"For architects, it is quite a change in mindset to deal with living things," he says. "Normally an architect is trying to make things that are as static as possible, and resist wear and tear. But plants grow, and change, and drop leaves, and wilt and die if you forget about them."

Over-ambitious?

A 'living building' is never really finished. It will change over time and will require much more maintenance than one without plants. For both the Park Royal on Pickering and the Bosco Verticale, the upkeep will be centralised and carried out by specialist staff. Could such projects be called too labour- and energy-intensive? Jill Fehrenbacher doesn't think so.

"Living plants…clean the air and produce oxygen, they help humidify indoor air, they reduce storm water runoff and the urban heat island effect, and they help insulate a building," she argues. "Even though skyscrapers like the Bosco Verticale inherently use a tonne of resources and energy – simply by virtue of being a high-rise building – all of those trees and plants are going to be beneficial to the building occupants, neighbours and local environment."

And perhaps 'living buildings' have worth based on aesthetics alone. "At the very worst, a garden is a delight to the users, so even if there is minimum environmental value, there is still immense value in having more green spaces in dense cities," says Richard Hassell.

The visual impact of buildings like these can't be underestimated. Apparently Singapore's taxi drivers now make detours to drive past the planted hotel, while Stefano Boeri talks about his structures being "ecology billboards". Jill Fehrenbacher says such buildings will be everywhere in twenty years, as we "try to recreate some sort of primeval garden of paradise in our homes and workplaces".

Future landscapes

More than mere gardens, planted high-rises have the potential to change our cityscapes. "For sure this is an experiment but to have a sequence of Bosco Verticales, to reach a critical mass, this could be quite interesting," says Boeri. "To deurbanise the urban environment is a radical alternative to expensive technology."

The proof of a building's appeal is surely when the architect himself decides to move in. Boeri has reserved himself a small apartment in Bosco Verticale, explaining he's "extremely attracted" to the idea of living high up in these soon-to-be leafy towers of trees.‘Art cannot explain things but it can expose them – that’s why art here is so important and necessary,’ says Doris Salcedo as she takes us on a tour of Bogotá and her studio.

Since the Paralympics closing ceremony, the Maracana Stadium has been looted, the key Games precinct has been shut down and the city’s Olympic golf course is struggling.

The most alarming visual deterioration can be seen at the Maracana, where worms have damaged the now-threadbare playing surface, windows inside the stadium have been smashed, copper wire stolen from walls and ceilings, and a reported 10% of the 78,000 seats have been torn up. Late in January local electric utility company Light cut off power to the stadium in response to unpaid bills, claimed to be in the region of three million reals (USD$940,000).

At that point construction company Obrecht – part of the consortium managing the stadium – called for the state of Rio de Janeiro to take over the administration of the unloved venue. Earlier in January the Maracana had been looted, with thieves taking fire extinguishers, hoses, televisions and a bronze bust of Mario Filho, the journalist for whom the stadium was named.

“The worries over the present and the future of the stadium are only increasing,” the Rio de Janeiro Football Federation said in a statement on 10 January, in response to reports that the venue – heavily modified in 2014 to accommodate the Games – had been further damaged.

The ground, which hosted the final match of the 1950 World Cup, was also used by four major Rio club teams – Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense and Vasco da Gama – but has been empty since the conclusion of the Games as key stakeholders remain at loggerheads over who will manage it into the future.

The city’s $20m golf course is struggling to attract players. The course superintendent, Neil Cleverly, says the company he works for, Progolf, hasn’t been paid for two months by the Brazilian Golf Confederation. And the course architect, Gil Hanse, is not impressed.

“We are bitterly disappointed ... we witnessed this type of brinkmanship during the construction of the course, and we are hopeful that this is another example of having to hit a low point before things get better,” Hanse told Golf World.

Four other venues at Olympic Park – two arenas, the tennis centre and the velodrome – have also failed to attract new operators following the conclusion of the Games, meaning the entire facility has been effectively closed down and remains off limits to the local community.

Last used on 18 September during the Paralympics, Olympic Park had attracted 150,000 patrons per day during the Games. Management of the park has transferred from Rio’s City Hall – who couldn’t attract an appropriate bid for the facility during an attempted sell-off – to the the federal government.

Olympic Park was entirely deserted until last weekend, when a beach volleyball event was staged on makeshift sands on what were previously the Olympic tennis courts. Spectators were aghast at the wider state of disrepair in the park. “It’s an abandonment, a disregard for public money for the visitors who come here and want to see it used,” one spectator, Wanderson Wygers, told Rio newspaper O Globo.

“The legacy is incredibly poor,” said Theresa Williamson, executive director of Catalytic Communities – a Rio-based non-government organisation providing support to favela communities – in an interview with AAP. “This all coincided with the economic recession but in Rio, just like the boom here was more intense because of the Olympics, now the fall is more intense because of the Olympics. Everybody here is suffering right now, of all incomes and all stripes and colours.”

The future of the Deodoro sports precinct, home to the second-largest concentration of Olympic venues, is also uncertain. The Olympic precinct in Rio’s western zone was slated to be a park and recreation area following the Games. But City Hall has closed it, terminating the operating company’s contract last December. Rio 2016, the organising committee of the Games, are holding another tender to select a company to manage Deodoro, hoping it will re-open around March.

The Olympic athletes’ village remains open, but has proven an undesirable and prohibitively expensive housing option for local residents. The 800,000 square metre village – which the Australian Olympic Committee initially refused to move into at the beginning of the Games – was planned to be post-Olympic public housing, but few locals are buying into it.

In response, Rio’s new mayor Marcelo Crivella struck an agreement with a government-owned financial institution and construction company Carvalho Hosken Group to provide low-rate loans to sell the accommodation to civil entities such as the navy and army.

An Amnesty study found Rio’s Olympics left “a shady legacy of a city entrenched with marginalisation and discrimination ... and a record of human rights violations where violence remains part of the game”.

Theresa Williamson said about 80,000 of Rio’s poor were removed from their homes to make way for the Games. “For the most part, they now live in worst situations than they did before - and these were already the poor in a very unequal city,” she said.

The only tangible Olympic legacy are some public transport improvements, mainly in affluent areas. “Those are the only legacies that you could claim are positive ... everything else is very negative,” Williamson said. “People are overwhelmingly not well. Everybody you talk to is struggling in some sense.”

An earlier version said incorrectly that Rio’s Olympic golf course had shut down.The House on Thursday approved a resolution that would permit states to withhold federal family-planning funds from affiliates of Planned Parenthood and other healthcare providers that offer abortions. Abortion foes immediately hailed the measure, which is expected to pass the Senate, as a critical victory, while public health advocates worried that the cuts would blow a hole in the nation’s fragile family planning safety net.

The measure would overturn a rule, issued by Obama’s department of Health and Human Services, prohibiting states from withholding federal family-planning dollars from groups that provide abortions. States can only withhold those funds for reasons related to a provider’s ability to deliver family planning services, the rule says.



The Obama administration finalized the rule during his last weeks in office, and it took effect just two days before the inauguration of Donald Trump.

Healthcare without Planned Parenthood: Wisconsin and Texas point to dark future Read more

Planned Parenthood on Thursday seemed open to taking the issue to court. The group argues that because family planning grants are competitive – that is, they are supposed to be awarded based on a provider’s demonstrated abilities to distribute care – excluding Planned Parenthood is illegal under federal law.

“To date, every court to consider the issue on the merits has ruled that state politicians cannot block access to care at Planned Parenthood” through these types of cuts, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said.

The resolution targets Planned Parenthood’s participation in Title X, the federal program that allows medical providers to offer reproductive healthcare to millions of low-income Americans at little to no cost. States receive Title X funds as block grants and distribute the money on a periodic basis to the healthcare providers that are best qualified to provide family planning services.

Planned Parenthood receives more than $500m annually from the federal government, and about a quarter of that comes from Title X.

Planned Parenthood says it serves 1.5 million people through Title X, or more than one-third of the 4 million people who receive Title X services. Seventy-eight percent of those Planned Parenthood patients earn 150% or less of the federal poverty level, and about a third are black or Latina. The organization does not spend the funds it receives from states on abortion, but on services such as pap tests, HIV and STI screenings, breast exams and contraception.

Title X is a popular target for conservative lawmakers looking to slash government budgets. Republican governors in several states have attempted or succeeded in cutting the state’s family planning budget to nearly zero. And in 2015, Republicans on a House appropriations subcommittee offered a budget that would have eliminated Title X funds completely.

Healthcare providers are prohibited from spending Title X funds on abortion by federal law. But by choosing to single out Planned Parenthood, Republicans on Thursday portrayed the resolution as a referendum on abortion. The resolution’s sponsors, congresswoman Diane Black of Tennessee and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, have both cited misleading videos, which were edited to look like Planned Parenthood sold fetal parts for a profit, as a reason to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding.

The resolution is based on a little-used law that allows Congress, on a fast-tracked timetable, to overturn a new federal rule. It requires only 51 votes to pass the Senate, where Republicans control 52 seats, and Donald Trump is expected to sign.

Supporters of the measure denied that it would impact people who rely on Title X, because the money Planned Parenthood received would be rerouted to “comprehensive healthcare clinics”.

But public health advocates are skeptical that other providers are primed to absorb Planned Parenthood’s millions of patients.

Community health centers “have wait lists for the people they’re serving today, much less having to absorb all of Planned Parenthood’s patients as well,” Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said recently. “The notion they can suddenly ramp up their capacity to absorb all of the services Planned Parenthood can offer … is absurd.”

A recent study of community health centers and similar clinics found that only about one in five large centers prescribe and dispense the full range of contraception. More often than not, these centers don’t stock common methods of contraception, such as birth control.

Healthcare providers are already prohibited by federal law from spending Title X funds on abortion. In 2000, under pressure from anti-abortion groups, the Clinton administration approved a rule requiring Planned Parenthood and other providers offering abortion to keep Title X funds “separate and distinct” from abortion activities.

Republicans have since then sought to cut Title X funding to Planned Parenthood altogether, arguing that organizations that provide abortions should not receive any material support from the government. Several proposals introduced to the House of Representatives under George W Bush failed. But those efforts gained steam under Obama, and in 2011, then-congressman Mike Pence attached a rider to defund Planned Parenthood to a critical spending bill and nearly triggered a government shutdown.

Many states controlled by Republicans have also taken action to strip Title X funds from Planned Parenthood.

The governors of Tennessee and New Hampshire, respectively, stripped $1.04m and $1.8m in Title X dollars from Planned Parenthood in 2011. The same year, the Kansas legislature blocked Title X dollars to the group.

Just as Republicans argued on Thursday, the governors in those states claimed that other healthcare providers would step up to care for Planned Parenthood’s patients. But those are questionable claims. A year after Kansas kicked Planned Parenthood of its Title X program, the number of Kansans receiving contraception, STI tests, and cancer screenings subsidized by Title X had fallen by more than 14,000.

Some efforts to kick Planned Parenthood out of Title X have proved vulnerable to challenges in court.

A federal judge ruled last summer that Florida could not block Title X funds to Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood’s Florida affiliates had been using the funds to provide healthcare screenings and finance a school dropout prevention program.

But others states have managed to make their cuts stick.

In Texas, eliminating Planned Parenthood from the public safety net had a particularly profound effect on rural communities. “I hate to say it, but I think an awful lot of women just opted to go without care,” said Mike Austin, the chief executive of Midland Community Healthcare Services. His clinic emerged as the only major alternative to Planned Parenthood in Midland-Odessa in west Texas after the cuts.

He spoke about his continued use of the falsehood about his electoral college win being the biggest since Ronald Reagan.

Late-night TV roundup: Trump's government is 'fully engulfed in chaos' Read more

“Trump’s been repeating this lie since election day,” he said. “If you can’t trust your president to get the right information on a Google-able fact then can you really trust him with the harder stuff, which, by the way, is everything else the president of the United States has to deal with.”



He also referred to Trump’s obsession with getting friendly questions and responding childishly when given anything tougher.

“You have a president of a democracy who thinks press is only valid when they ask him easy questions, questions that he likes,” he said. “In fact, in his mind, he deserves it.”

On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was similarly taken aback by how strange his behavior was and questioned whether a solo press conference was a good idea.

“This was just him by himself,” he said. “Evidently he didn’t even bring his meds with him.”

He talked about Trump’s inability to accept responsibility after he claimed that the government he inherited was a mess. “No, you inherited a fortune – we elected a mess,” Colbert said.

He also played a clip of Trump’s electoral college falsehood being ripped apart by a journalist who gave him the real fact. Trump responded by saying that was the information he was given.

“How presidential,” he said. “It really reminds me of Harry Truman, who so famously said: ‘Look, I don’t know where it’s supposed to stop. I was given that buck.’”

He also joked about Trump’s suggestion that April Ryan, a journalist of color, should help him set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, saying that it could be arranged at “your next meeting of the black club” and that “all black people know each other and control each other’s schedules”.

He finally compared it to a “dictator giving a press conference”.

On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the ex-SNL comic called the conference “batshit crazy”, describing an afternoon of “bizarre paranoia”, and also looked back on Trump’s previous pressers with uncomfortable world leaders.

“Being a world leader sitting with Trump right now is like being a woman on a date with a guy and then his wife shows up screaming: ‘Your kids want to know where you are!’” he said.



He brought up Trump’s Florida rally that is set to take place this weekend, with many calling it the start of his 2020 push.

“We are not ready for another campaign,” he said. “People from the last campaign are still wandering around in the woods. You’re like somebody who wants a birthday month. Your birthday is over, get to work.”

He talked about Trump’s response to recent moves made by the Russian government, calling them “not good”, to which Meyers responded: “We’re talking about Russian military aggression, not a turkey sandwich at the deli.”



He also brought up Trump’s suggestion that a black journalist should set up a meeting with the CBC. “It’s racist to assume all black people know each other,” he said. “You don’t know all orange people. Hey Donald, could you set up a meeting with Snooki and the Lorax?”

On The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon came on dressed as Trump, saying: “You’re all fake news, I hate you all very much and thank you for being here.”

He joked: “We’ve made so much progress. In fact, if you ask any American, they’ll say that I’ve managed to make the last four weeks feel like four years.”



He also riffed on Trump’s blame-shifting. “We inherited a mess, such a mess,” he said. “Not even a giant Roomba could clean it up, which we are developing with Elon Musk. It’s top secret, confidential and I’m about to leak it in the next five minutes.”

After Andrew Puzder withdrew his name for secretary of labor, Fallon said: “We just named our new secretary of labor: Beyoncé.

This took the Swede to 23 goals in his debut United campaign, the most since Robin van Persie’s 30 in the 2012-13 season.

Ibrahimovic’s opener was a fortunate strike from a free-kick, which was followed up with a tap-in after the break before his spot-kick beat Stéphane Ruffier.

This hands a clear advantage to José Mourinho’s side, though St-Étienne might have made United pay for slack defending throughout, an example being when Nolan Roux should have grabbed an away goal near the end but chipped over.

Mourinho made two changes from Saturday’s 2-0 win over Watford. Out went David de Gea, who was a substitute, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who reported ill, and in came Sergio Romero and Marouane Fellaini.

As expected Paul Pogba lined up against his elder brother Florentin, who was named in defence by Christophe Galtier.

Just before kick-off a raucous travelling support made their section a sea of red and green and set off flares, a few of which were hurled on to the pitch. The smoke from these lingered and the Les Verts faithful were in loud voice as the match began.

A first scare for United came when a loose Eric Bailly pass allowed the French side to attack via Romain Hamouma, who drew Romero out of his goal but could not capitalise.

As they were facing France’s sixth-placed side at home, United could expect a first-leg win that would go a fair way to helping progress to the last 16. The 19 goals conceded by Galtier’s team in Ligue 1 is the second lowest so Mourinho knew his side would need patience to break the visitors down.

In fact, the wait lasted only 15 minutes. United lined up in a 4-3-3 that had Pogba on the left of the midfield trident and it was the No6 who initiated the attack from which United opened the scoring, by spraying a diagonal to the left.

When the ball came infield to Ibrahimovic, Jordan Veretout challenged and the referee, Pavel Kralovec, blew for a free-kick. Up stepped Ibrahimovic; his low shot hit Vincent Pajot in the wall, wrong-footed the goalkeeper Ruffier and had just enough pace to prevent Loïc Perrin clearing off the line.

From this breakthrough United dominated in passages with a mix of short and longer passes. Antonio Valencia may have been told to hit high balls and Fellaini posed problems when he roved forward to present a target.

When Ander Herrera missed a tackle on Hamouma there was a scare for United as the No11 motored forward and played in Henri Saivet. His snap shot was simple for Romero to save and then came a superb Anthony Martial run.

From inside his own half the forward skated through the defence and into the area. His effort rebounded off Ruffier and took Ibrahimovic by surprise, the centre-forward spooning over a left-foot attempt. As the half neared its end St-Étienne came close to equalising. Hamouma, the visitors’ stand-out performer, broke along the left and set up Kevin Monnet-Paquet but he could not beat Romero.

Mourinho’s interval message may have been to tighten up. There was a bright start when Ibrahimovic threatened in the area before Martial was booked for strong-arming Kévin Malcuit in the neck. Moments later the Swede hit the back of the net but he was offside.

Mourinho had made a first move at the break, swapping Fellaini for Jesse Lingard, who was pushed further up into a No10 role as United re-set as 4-2-3-1. Martial was arguably United’s best player and he zipped in on goal and let fly a rocket from his left boot that Ruffier did well to beat away.

The concern for United was that St-Étienne could still launch attacks and were dangerous on the break. On 62 minutes Saivet bounced Herrera off him and fed the ever-menacing Hamouma and there was relief for United when the ball was scrambled away.

Martial’s soaring confidence was summed up by a back-heel that fooled Saivet and drew a foul. Daley Blind delivered the dead ball, Pogba rose highest and he was unlucky to see the ball bounce to safety off Ruffier’s bar.

Mourinho introduced Marcus Rashford for the closing phase and it was the 19-year-old who pulled the ball back from the left for Ibrahimovic’s second.

Galtier complained about the free-kick and penalty that led to United goals. “I’m angry, frustrated about the appreciation of the game and errors made by the officials,” he said.Donald Trump dismissed reports of chaos and conspiracy in his administration and claimed his team was running like “a fine-tuned machine” during an extraordinary press conference at which he tried to reset his beleaguered presidency.

In a boisterous and often bizarre session, he fired off numerous broadsides at the media as he skipped from topic to topic in what critics saw as an attempt to deflect attention from his alleged ties to Russia.

“I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos, chaos,” Trump scolded reporters. “Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved.”

But soon afterwards that same “fine-tuned” administration was plunged into further disarray. On Thursday night, it was confirmed that Trump’s preferred replacement for his disgraced national security adviser has turned the job down.

'Russia is fake news': Trump decries reports of pre-election communication Read more

The president’s first solo media briefing since taking office was held ostensibly to announce Alexander Acosta as his new pick for labour secretary after his first choice, Andrew Puzder, withdrew from consideration.



But the event at the White House rapidly turned into a sprawling, freewheeling and pugnacious defence of his first four weeks as president and a bitter denunciation of the press.

In a remarkable press conference – spanning 77 minutes in which he took questions from 17 reporters – Trump:

Denied any connections to Russia or any knowledge of his election campaign team having contacts with Moscow, dismissing stories as a “ruse”



Slammed the “dishonest” media for putting out what he called fake news and doing a “disservice” to the American people



Claimed he had achieved more in his first four weeks in office than any previous US president, adding: “We’re just getting started”



Denied that his ban on travellers from Muslim-majority countries had been poorly executed, insisting: “We had a bad court”

Argued that he had “inherited a mess”, both domestically and abroad



Was told he was wrong to claim he had the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. He replied: “I was given that information”



Asked a black journalist, April Ryan, if she would set up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss his inner-city agenda: “Are they friends of yours?”

He argued that there had been “incredible progress” over the past four weeks: “I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we have done.”



The measures taken so far include withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, eliminating regulations that “undermine manufacturing”, plans to smash international drug cartels and strengthening the country’s borders. Trump contrasted himself with past politicians who made promises only to break them.

In a swipe at Barack Obama’s administration, Trump said: “To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.

“Jobs are pouring out of the country – you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea – we’ll take care of it, folks; we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.”

But as so often during the election campaign, it was the media that became his primary punchbag. He claimed it was serving not the people but special interests profiting from a broken system. “The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.”

Trump claimed he was talking about an entrenched “power structure” that needed attention. “We’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again to take my message straight to the people.”

He singled out broadcasters and individual reporters for particular criticism, insisting that they had lost the trust of the public. “I just see many, many untruthful things. It’s about tone. The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person. I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.”

The coverage of the press conference itself would be skewed, he added. “I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. Tomorrow, the headlines are going to be: ‘Donald Trump rants and raves.’ I’m not ranting and raving.”

Allegations about Trump’s connections with Russia hovered over the entire news conference. Apparently trying to square a circle, Trump claimed: “The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.”

He argued: “You know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.”

The president was asked repeatedly about whether his advisers had contact with Russia during the US presidential election campaign. He eventually conceded: “Nobody that I know of. How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse.”

Trump claimed that media reports about his administration’s relationship with Russia might make it difficult for him to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin. “Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me any more because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.”



He mocked Hillary Clinton, his defeated election opponent and a former secretary of state, for an attempt to “reset” relations with Russia, which included a mocked-up plastic button that he said “made us all look like a bunch of jerks”. And he challenged the room, asking whether anyone seriously thought Clinton would be tougher on Russia than he was.

The Trump administration was thrown into turmoil by Monday’s resignation of the national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his secret discussion of US sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak. On Thursday night, Robert Harward, who Trump wanted to replace Flynn, was confirmed to have refused the offer.

The president confirmed he asked Flynn to resign but insisted he was a “fine person” who did nothing wrong by speaking to Russia’s ambassador about sanctions.

“Mike was doing his job,” he said. “He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job.”

Instead, Flynn’s mistake was to mislead officials including the vice-president, Mike Pence. “He didn’t tell the vice-president of the United States the facts,” Trump said. “And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.”

He added: “I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence: very simple ... I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right.”

The president insisted the “real story” was that the intelligence community leaking information about Flynn’s conversations and details of the investigation into his campaign advisers.

“I’ve actually called the justice department to look into the leaks,” he said. “Those are criminal leaks.”

Trump also railed against embarrassing leaks of his phone calls with world leaders including Australia and Mexico, suggesting that people within the White House could potentially put the US at risk by leaking confidential future conversations about how to handle North Korea.

Trump has been accused of stoking division and hiring a white nationalist, Steve Bannon, as his chief strategist. He angrily turned on a reporter who asked him if his administration had incited acts of antisemitism. “Sit down!” he barked. “Number one, I am the least antisemitic person you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person.”

When the journalist tried to interject, Trump shouted over him: “Quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied that he was going to get up and ask a straight, simple question, so, you know, welcome to the world of the media.”

Trump was also caught in a falsehood about his electoral college victory being the biggest since Ronald Reagan but brushed it off. Zigzagging through various topics, he again insisted: “There’s zero chaos. This is a fine-tuned machine.”

But his grandstanding is unlikely to go down well on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Chuck Schumer, leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, demanded investigations by both Congress and the justice department into ties between the Trump administration and Russia.

“We do not know all of the facts, and in the coming days and weeks, more information may well surface about these disturbing revelations,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “But we already know that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

“I have been in Congress for a long time, and I’ve never, ever seen anything like this. The institutions of government are being tested in a way they have not been tested in some time ... I believe the stakes to be very high. This is not a drill. Nothing less than our system of checks and balances, the rule of law, and our national security is at stake.”

The Democratic House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, is pushing the interim director of national intelligence for a “comprehensive” briefing over the next two weeks. Pelosi will seek transcripts of the intercepted conversations Flynn had with Kislyak.

Trump’s original pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, abruptly withdrew from consideration on Wednesday.

Trump said Acosta, who did not appear with the president, “has had a tremendous career”. He noted that unlike Puzder, Acosta had been confirmed by the Senate three times and “did very, very well”.

If confirmed anew by the Senate, Acosta would become the first Hispanic member of Trump’s cabinet. He is now dean of the Florida International University law school.

Acosta has served on the National Labor Relations Board and as a federal prosecutor in Florida. He was named assistant attorney general for civil rights by George W Bush.

About 10,000 people were thought to have marched on Downing Street in London, with the crowd stretching the length of Whitehall by 7pm. Edinburgh, Cardiff, Manchester and Birmingham also had large demonstrations.

Protesters showed their anger on the day that a petition calling for the US president’s visit to the UK not to be classed as a state visit passed 1.5m signatures.

Speakers in London on Monday evening, including Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti, were barely audible above the chants of “refugees welcome here”, and “Theresa May, shame on you”.



The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, told the crowd she had come on behalf of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. “Donald Trump has been president for only a few days, and look at what he is doing,” she said. “We need to resist the Islamophobia and scapegoating of Muslims, we have got to resist it whether it is in the United States or here in the UK.”

One of the demonstrators in London was Browan Murphy, 17, who had travelled from East Sussex. “I just felt I needed to do something,” she said. “I am scared about what Donald Trump is doing and am angry about how Theresa May has reacted.”

Lotte Rice, a 28-year-old Londoner, said: “This is a key time to stand up and make our voices heard. What is happening is dangerous. If we come together, something positive can come from this.”

The London demonstration was one of several in the UK highlighting opposition to Trump’s executive order, issued at the weekend, that imposed a travel ban on people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

In Cardiff, several hundred gathered at the statue of the Labour hero Aneurin Bevan to protest. Jim Gray, a student, said he had been shopping for trainers nearby when he saw someone with an anti-Trump placard. “I followed them and here I am. It suddenly made sense to me. I’d been worrying about the travel ban and this seems a way of making my views known. I’ve never done anything like this before.”

That protest was organised by Ash Cox, 18, a history student at Cardiff University. “I’d heard others were taking place across the UK,” he said. “I thought we had to have a demo in Cardiff too. It took off so quickly.”

Claudia Boes, an occupational therapist, organised an anti-Trump women’s march earlier this month. “I think rather than there being individual protests, this is going to turn into a movement,” she said.

Chants heard up and down Queen Street in the Welsh capital included: “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Aled Edwards, chief executive of Churches Together in Wales, said: “I’ve had the privilege of working with ­refugees for the past 15 years and I think his ­treatment of refugees has been appalling.”

Omar, a 17-year-old Muslim student, said his confidence had been knocked by the start to Trump’s presidency. “I’ve travelled quite a bit in Europe and in the US. Suddenly I’m thinking will I be able to go to the US? I was born in ­Cardiff. I feel British and Muslim. But what he is doing is scaring me.”

In Edinburgh, several thousand protesters packed out a civic square in the city centre, before marching to the Scottish parliament. They chanted: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here”, and: “Resist, revoke, stop Donald Trump.”

Trump was greeted by protesters when he visited Holyrood to protest at Scotland’s support for windfarms five years ago. To cheers from the crowd, Assad Khan of Edinburgh University’s Islamic society, said: “This campaign of dehumanisation has to stop; of women, of Muslims, of the LGBT community, of disabled people, of all minority groups. It has to stop.”

Demonstrations were also under way in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. Placards and banners were held aloft in the former as a crowd of about 500 people chanted “hope not fear, refugees are welcome here”. Glasgow’s demonstrations continued in George Square after a three-hour rally in Buchanan Street.

In Manchester, a crowd gathered at Albert Square, outside the city’s town hall. The site is a stone’s throw from Lincoln Square, where a statue of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th US president, was erected to give thanks to Lancashire’s cotton workers for “their fight for the abolition of slavery during the American civil war”, after an economic blockade of slave-picked cotton from the southern US states caused massive unemployment in the region’s cotton industry.

Clare Solomon, 43, an agency catering worker, said: “Donald Trump did not get the support of the majority of Americans who voted in the presidential election. He has even less support for his sexist, racist, war-mongering, pro-business policies in this country.

“The grovelling of Theresa May, who hasn’t been elected prime minister by anyone, even in her own party, is repugnant and unacceptable. Her offer of a state visit is appeasement of a reactionary bully. It should be withdrawn.”

Solomon said she hoped Monday night’s demonstrations would be the beginning of resistance to Trump. “Last week [at the women’s protest], we could just feel that something new was in the air. People were talking about it all over the place. In the coffee shops, on the bus this morning on the way to work ... there’s a real buzz. There’s a real feeling of anger, but also a feeling of hope that’s there’s something we can do if we all unite together.”

Dean Smith, a 24-year-old sports journalist, was the main organiser of the Manchester protest. Smith said a tweet by American writer David Slack had prompted him to act on his horror at Trump’s directive.

Voices from Manchester and Edinburgh

Liz Parker (Manchester)

She said it was important that people sent a message to the government that they don’t agree with Trump’s actions. “To think that people in the world think that we agree because our leader refuses to speak out about it is ridiculous,” said Liz.

She says a demo like this one serves to get the message out. “Even just being here and it being in the news and on the TV means people around the world are going to see that we don’t agree with this and we want to help people,” she added. “We don’t care if someone is a Muslim or a Christian or what colour their skin is. We just want to live in harmony with the human race.”

Steinberger, who is an academic at Leeds University and an American citizen, was at the march with her four-year-old son Jacob. Her father arrived in the US on the Kindertransport.

“This is very personal. Lots of people are dying because of the attitudes that Trump represents,” she said.

“I don’t think I had a choice about whether or not to come here. It’s just too important. Trump is Islamophobic, but he is also antisemitic. I don’t think there’s a single vulnerable or minority group that he has a fondness for.”

Debora Kayembe (Edinburgh)

Kayembe, a human rights lawyer and Congolese refugee who specialises in resettling refugees in the US, won loud cheers when she told a substantial protest rally at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh: “I want you to understand today, that you are bigger than Mr Trump.”

So what is it with James Dolan, anyway?

Even if you don’t follow the New York Knicks or the NBA, you have probably heard about Dolan by now. Dolan is the CEO of Cablevision Systems Corporation, which means that he is also is the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden, and, by extension, the owner of the Knicks, the New York Rangers and the New York Liberty of the WNBA.

Derrick Rose's no-show just another sign of the Knicks' dysfunction Read more

When it comes to the Rangers and the Liberty, Dolan, who looks like a gnome, basically steps aside and lets his executives run the show. In the case of the Rangers, the team’s 73-year-old president, Glen Sather, is a former player and coach who, after nearly a decade of false starts, has put together a team that is an annual contender for the Stanley Cup.

Three years ago, Dolan hired Phil Jackson, a former player with even more of a successful background as a player, coach and executive than Sather, to be the president of the Knicks. It seemed to make perfect sense: Jackson would amass a team capable of contending for the franchise’s first NBA championship since 1973, when he was a superb substitute.

Except it has not worked out that way. It appears the Knicks will miss the playoffs for the fourth straight season, and the fans – and alumni – have run out of patience waiting for the team to get any better. Dolan is probably out of patience, too. But it is clear that Dolan does not like the fans and alumni laying into his business plan with the Knicks.

Dolan is probably somewhere in the middle on the scale of meddlesome sports team owners, but he has shown to be astonishingly tone deaf, and virtually inept at public relations. Sometimes, he is so ham-handed at dealing with people that it is almost as if he wants to draw negative attention to himself. And so, once again, he has.

Last week, he ejected Charles Oakley, a former Knicks power forward who has been a vocal critic of Dolan, from a game at Madison Square Garden. Dolan claimed Oakley was taunting him from his nearby seat – which Oakley said he had paid for – and Dolan then banned Oakley from Knicks’ games at the Garden.

But that was not even the worst part.

The Knicks said of Oakley in a statement: “He was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon” – the implication being that Oakley has a drug or alcohol problem. Dolan, who almost certainly saw the statement before it was issued, was vilified by fans and media. It was as if Dolan expected Oakley to behave a certain way.

Oakley played for the Knicks from 1988 to 1998, before Dolan came along, and the message was clear: Dolan felt Oakley was embarrassing him because Oakley was too critical of the team for which Dolan is ultimately responsible. In a way, it does not matter if Oakley was right about what he was saying, but to Dolan, Oakley had stepped out of his place.

So, in Dolan’s mind, it was well worth it to have Oakley removed from the Garden by security guards. Dolan knows the Knicks stink. He knows the fans know that, too. But he did not think he could afford to have a guy like Oakley incite a revolt – a mutiny! – at the Garden, of all places. The ejection, ban and amateur psychoanalysis was all worth it.

The feud stayed in the news for days, which was hardly a terrible thing for Dolan. The feud just happened to fall into that soft spot of the New York sports schedule between the Super Bowl and spring training, and the Knicks were not going to earn any kind of status on the back pages of the tabloids because they are playing great basketball.

Because Dolan is white and Oakley is black, a racial undercurrent developed; the Rev Al Sharpton threatened to picket the Garden if Dolan did not lift his ban on Oakley. Compared with other stuff going on in this country right now, the Dolan-Oakley feud was not a big deal, maybe not even outside New York. But New York is big enough.

Madison Square Garden security chief fired over Charles Oakley altercation Read more

By Monday, Dolan and Oakley had been summoned to NBA offices, where the league commissioner, Adam Silver, with Michael Jordan himself participating on the phone, mediated a peace treaty between the two. Dolan lifted the ban on Oakley. But Oakley told the New York Daily News on Tuesday that he wanted a public apology from Dolan before he came back.

That put the ball right back in Dolan’s court, where he could be magnanimous and apologize or keep Oakley and the city in suspense. Dolan could save face, or he could keep the matter dragging along for a while. The Knicks – and, more importantly, James L Dolan – stay in the headlines.

Dolan’s father, Charles, started Cablevision and gave his son a ride on his coattails, but Dolan had bumbled along earlier in life, battling drugs and alcohol as he chased a career as a musician, which gave his comments on Oakley a certain snark. He rarely makes appearances in his role as an owner, awkwardly reading statements at the few news conferences he attends.

Maybe he just craves attention now and then. Or maybe the rest of his needs in his life are just so tended to that this is a way for him to stir up a little trouble, to take on a challenge, as he did when he decided to fight Anucha Browne Sanders in court over sexual harassment charges against former general manager Isaiah Thomas and MSG in 2006. Dolan lost.

It would seem as if Dolan will lose to Oakley in the court of public opinion this time, too. But what will he lose, really? He will still be a rich man with sports teams as toys. He gets attention whenever he wants; the ejection of Oakley did not have to happen. He can throw enough money at any problem to make it go away. He is just flexing the folds of his thick wallet.Ukip leader Paul Nuttall gets emotional after asking if he still had the party’s backing at the Ukip spring conference in Bolton on Friday.

But if you paid close enough attention, Gaga weaved in a message of inclusion and unity – mixing diamantés with political activism.



Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance: heavy on the hits, light on the politics Read more

Her show opened with a medley of classic American patriotism: God Bless America melded into This Land Is Your Land, and finished with a declaration of the Pledge of Allegiance.

She stood on the roof of the stadium as she sang them, lights in the shape of the American flag across the field beneath her.

For weeks, speculation had swirled over whether Gaga would use the world stage to make a political statement against Donald Trump, particularly regarding her pet topic of LGBT rights.

But while Gaga didn’t directly call out Trump, her performance addressed race and LGBT issues through her lyrics, collection of diverse dancers and show staging.

Born This Way, her No 1 hit, has long been considered a gay anthem, and her performance of it marked the first time the word “transgender” had been said during a Super Bowl half-time show.

She sang:

Don’t be a drag, just be a queen Whether you’re broke or evergreen You’re black, white, beige, chola descent You’re Lebanese, you’re Orient Whether life’s disabilities Left you outcast, bullied, or teased Rejoice and love yourself today ‘Cause baby you were born this way No matter gay, straight, or bi Lesbian, transgendered life

During her rendition of Million Reasons, from her latest album Joanne, Gaga walked through the crowd, choosing a woman of color to hug as she sung “why don’t you stay, stay”, a move many fans on Twitter interpreted as a subtle statement about race and immigration politics.



On Friday, Gaga said that she would not directly mention Trump because “I want people that watch the half-time show to feel the greatness of the USA”.

She also noted that she wanted to use her voice to bring people together.

“Saying anything divisive would only make things worse. And that’s just not what I want for my country,” she told Atlanta’s 98.5 KLUC.

While her Super Bowl statement was slightly opaque, Gaga protested at Trump Tower in Manhattan the day after the election, holding a Hillary Clinton campaign sign declaring “Love trumps hate”.

She also spoke out after Access Hollywood tapes leaked revealing Trump boasting that he could grab women “by the pussy”.



“Here we were, in 2016, and the fact that the sort of language that was being used to talk about women was everywhere — on TV, in politics — was eye-opening. I felt depressed and hurt by it because that’s what that kind of language does,” wrote Gaga in an essay for Harper’s Bazaar.Great Britain won their Davis Cup tie against Canada after the teenager Denis Shapovalov was defaulted for hitting a ball into the face of the umpire, Arnaud Gabas.

Shapovalov was trailing Kyle Edmund 6-3, 6-4, 2-1 and had just been broken in the decider when he smashed a ball in anger that struck Gabas in the eye. With Gabas holding his face in pain the referee, Brian Earley, had no choice but to rule a default.

The 17-year-old Shapovalov later apologised to Gabas, saying he was “incredibly ashamed and embarrassed”. Gabas, who had bruising to his left eye, went to hospital in Ottawa for a precautionary check-up.

“I went back and spoke to the umpire afterwards and apologised directly to him,” Shapovalov said.

“Luckily he was okay but obviously it’s unacceptable behaviour from me. I feel incredibly ashamed and embarrassed and I just feel awful for letting my team down, for letting my country down, for acting in a way that I would never want to act.

“I can promise that’s the last time I will do anything like that. I’m going to learn from this and try to move past it.”

The US firm’s attentions drew fire from trade union Unite, which branded Kraft “predatory” and predicted that any deal would trigger job losses among the two companies’ combined UK workforces of nearly 9,000. It said Kraft Heinz, backed by Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway – the investment vehicle of billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett – was out to make a “quick buck”.

But a source familiar with the discussions played down the prospect of a deal being struck, even if Kraft Heinz increases its cash-plus-shares offer. The source said there was an “element of opportunism” to Kraft’s bid because stock market gains made by US firms since the election of Donald Trump had inflated the value of their shares.

“They’ve been sitting with the calculator out waiting for the green light to go on, and now they’ve pounced,” the source added. “Hopefully the lack of logic to the transaction is enough to make them down tools.”

Unilever is expected to warn investors that Kraft would load up the company with debt to fuel growth while slashing costs, hindering investment in premium brands such as Dove soaps and Magnum ice cream.



Kraft’s second-largest shareholder, 3G, is famed for boosting returns through aggressive cost-cutting including heavy job losses, a strategy it has deployed at beer firm ABInBev and has also pursued since the merger with Heinz. Beto Sicupira, who co-founded the business with Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, once said: “Costs are like [finger]nails: they always need to be cut.”

Despite Unilever’s reluctance to talk to Kraft, shares in the London and Rotterdam-based company shot up 13.4% to close at an all-time high of £37.97 on Friday.

Kraft is expected to sweeten its opening bid of £115bn, a price tag that would already be the second largest in corporate history behind Vodafone’s $203bn (£163bn) takeover of Germany’s Mannesmann in 2000. If an agreement can be reached, it would create a firm described by Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets as “one of the biggest groups in the world, selling over 400 consumer/household goods to over a third of mankind”.

The combined company would have a stock market value of more than £200bn, revenues of £68bn, and would also control 3% of the world market for packaged food, according to market research group Euromonitor. The combined workforce would be 210,000 people, nearly 9,000 of whom work in UK facilities such as the Kitt Green factory near Wigan, which produces more than 1bn cans of baked beans a year.

Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a takeover, which would trigger a payout of bonus shares worth nearly £12m.

Analysts said that while any deal would create massive cost savings, it would also give the combined firm the muscle to drive up prices on popular brands such as Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.

“Market power would be much increased as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,” said Professor John Colley of Warwick business school. “Strengthened pricing power for so many major brands would not benefit the consumer.”

Britain’s largest trade union, Unite, warned that cost cuts following a takeover would put UK jobs under threat and said it was seeking a meeting with Unilever’s management. “Kraft Heinz and their backers’ reputation for cost-cutting, we believe, will lead to great brands being harmed through job cuts and a never-ending drive to push costs down,” said national officer Rhys McCarthy.

“This takeover bid is, we fear, driven by a desire for a growth in sales, not through product innovation and maintaining great brands, but by gobbling up a major competitor and slashing costs to generate a quick buck.” He added that a takeover would lead to “job losses and poorer products for consumers”.

The proposed takeover is the latest in a string of deals since the UK voted for Brexit. Since the referendum on 23 June, the value of the pound has slumped, making UK-based businesses relatively cheaper for foreign buyers. Chip designer Arm Holdings was snapped up for £24bn by Japan’s Softbank, while Rupert Murdoch’s Fox has taken the opportunity to bid for the 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky that it does not already own.

Before its merger with Heinz in 2015, Kraft came under fire in the UK for its conduct during the prolonged battle to take over Cadbury, which was later included in the Mondelez snacks business that the US firm spun off in 2012.

Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Kraft would have to table a much higher bid to succeed. “A short-term premium today is no compensation for losing the growth that Unilever could produce for decades to come,” he said. “So to win over a majority of Unilever’s shareholders, we think Kraft Heinz will need to dig very deep indeed.”

“Thank you,” I said. What I didn’t mention was that she was my daughter, not my sister. But it was a step up from the usual reaction when people saw us out together.

I was not prepared for all the judgment that comes with being a mother at 20. Everyone looked at me as though I were a criminal. I appeared young for my age, too. In my leather jacket, miniskirt and Adidas running shoes, I probably passed for 16. Women would come up and ask, “Excuse me? Is that your baby? How old are you?” There was much tsking.

When my daughter became a little older and people began mistaking us for sisters, I went along with it because that seemed to help with our PR.

I didn’t have a mother when I was growing up. All I knew about motherhood was that it was so awful that my mother had run off when I was seven, not wanting to have anything to do with it. As a result, I didn’t have much of a childhood, either. Let’s just say it was difficult and that I was delighted to become a young adult and never to have to think about that phase of life again. But while I was at university, childhood decided that it wasn’t done with me.

I lived in a huge, beautiful, rundown apartment. There was torn wallpaper in all the rooms and columns with fauns playing pan flutes in the hallways. You could see your breath in winter. I shared it with six guys who were humanities students. We usually went to bed at 5am, after getting high and laughing about philosophical conundrums all night.

I believed that turning 20 brought all sorts of new freedoms. I didn’t think it brought new responsibilities.

Then strange things started to happen. I couldn’t remember my lines in theatre class. Songs made me cry. I couldn’t listen to the Smashing Pumpkins because they made me feel too much. And taking warm baths made me think about death. Riding on the subway made me throw up.

I went to see a doctor, who informed me I was five months pregnant. I was so shocked. I remember asking whether it was OK to go to a Beastie Boys concert. What about Aerosmith?

I didn’t have a single complication during my pregnancy. The baby was snuggled up in its space pod – on deep sleep – until its arrival at planet Earth. Nothing could awaken or disturb her.

It was so freakish to be having a child at my age, that as I grew bigger, my friends gathered around me to marvel. I pulled up my black, ragged sweater and showed them my belly. They all reached out and touched it. It was proof that a strange rumour they had heard since they were children was true. It was the beginning of life, which like death – wasn’t supposed to happen to people our age.

I was the subject of much gossip. All the boys I knew pretended they were the baby’s father.

Despite having been a party girl that year, I did know who the baby belonged to: a boy I’d been sleeping with on and off since I was 16, named Chris. His mother visited me in my apartment. She said Chris and I had to move into an apartment together. She even gave us the address of one to look at. What did we know? She was emphatic, so we moved in together.

He was creative and sweet, good at drawing and design, and at arranging things in the flat prettily. Plants seemed to like to grow around him. He always had friends, and owned a great cat. But he was unable to deal with disappointment. His mother had no idea he had a serious drug problem. Despite having a baby to look after, Chris did not stop getting high. He just got worse.

When our daughter was about five months old, I found Chris lying on the bed, his face blue. Later, as one of the ambulance drivers was reviving Chris, the other told me Chris was would eventually overdose and die. I knew it, too. I also knew I wasn’t going to wait for it to happen. I was going to leave him. I stood on the balcony that night looking at the city. The gravity of being 20 and about to become a single mother sank in.

I moved with my daughter into a tiny, cheap apartment and did minimum wage jobs, which were all I could get at that age. Thank God my child was cute. All her clothes came from charity shops or free clothing bins at the women’s centre. I got her a black wool coat with white plastic buttons shaped like ducks. She refused to brush her hair. It was a crazy blond nest. She always looked as if she had come in from a windstorm. Occasionally, our cuteness prompted people to acts of kindness. An ice-cream truck driver always gave her free ice-cream.

I was still self-absorbed. I left her on the subway twice. And in a grocery cart. I was off down the street eating a banana when I remembered about her.

I had always wanted to be independent. But I had this baby who followed me everywhere, needing things. She wanted help tying her shoes. She talked like a Beckett clown. She was worried about existential nonsense. Once she told me she was afraid she would be killed by a snail. “A snail? A snail! No one is afraid of snails.” I looked at her sitting sadly, her hands clasped together, worried about snails. “Don’t worry,” I said. “I won’t let a snail kill you.” “Thank you,” she said.

At some point, I figured I might as well accept being a mother.

When I look back on those days, I don’t think of myself as an adult. I was still in the realm of make-believe

On a grey day at an empty amusement park, we decided to test how many times you could ride on the rollercoaster without getting sick. By the 20th time, we were discussing dinner with our hair upside down, as though we were on the city bus.

We went to every showing of Swan Lake that came to Montreal. I loved anything to do with swans. Once we took a paddle boat out to the centre of a pond. We threw some bread in the water around us, so we could be surrounded by swans. I thought we could achieve a higher consciousness. We ended up paddling for our lives.

We decided to mimic Nabokov’s butterfly collection. We had little access to exotic butterflies, so our pinboard was covered with dragonflies, beetles, cicadas and houseflies. But it was splendid. We sat in front of paintings at the museum arguing about them. We stood outside the wolf’s cage at the zoo, imagining its thoughts. We could debate for hours. It was as if I had a mad assistant, a sidekick. We were like Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.

Then, in my 30s, my life started to come together. I started to have an income. She was a teenager and we had become members of the middle class. When I look back on those days, I don’t think of myself as an adult. I was still in the realm of make-believe. I think of my daughter’s childhood as part of my own. We had a lovely one together.

Before leaving work, the 25-year-old executive assistant checks the pollution reading on his AirVisual app, which provides real-time measurements of PM2.5 – the tiny particles found in smog that can damage your throat and lungs.

Hanoi’s PM2.5 levels typically range from 100 to 200 micrograms per cubic metre – regularly within the globally acknowledged “unhealthy” category. But on 19 December last year, they hit “hazardous levels” at 343μg/m3, which was higher than Beijing.

Shocked by this reading, Dung shared a screenshot with his friends on Facebook, writing: “I can’t believe my eyes. Stay safe folks!”



He’s aware of the limitations of air quality data, which can vary between different parts of the city, but apps like this are the best tools he has.

According to the independent data measurement site AQIVN, there were at least 15 days in 2016 where average PM2.5 levels in Hanoi were “hazardous”, at 300μg/m3 or higher. On 5 October last year Hanoi had the worst air pollution among major cities across the world, generating widespread outcry over public health.

Dinh Nam, a lecturer at the Vietnam National University in Hanoi, does not need an app to tell him that the air quality is bad. “Every day I motorbike over 8km to get to work,” he says. “I can see the smog sitting on my clothing and my skin every night.”

Nam moved to Duong Noi, a new urban area far from the city centre, four years ago hoping to escape the pollution and traffic that the dense centre brings. However, as Hanoi continues its aggressive expansion policy, smog has caught up to his family; the area, which is close to the Yen Nghia industrial zone, has seen a simultaneous boom in high-rise construction and industrial development. The fumes from motorbike exhausts, construction and industry have made breathing a source of fear for Nam’s family. Aside from flimsy face masks, he has no other means to protect himself and his children.

When Hanoi joined a growing group of global cities to launch its first bus rapid transit route on the last day of 2016, it should have been good news for Nam. It was hoped that the new BRT would take some of the 5 million motorbikes and scooters off the roads and reduce congestion and pollution in the city.



Despite now having a BRT stop 500 metres from his house, Dinh Nam remains skeptical of the $53.6m development, funded by loans from the World Bank. “When the project was initiated 10 years ago, this area was much less congested than it is now. Now, the roads are so crowded it can’t be effective,” he says.

Dinh Nam’s skepticism represents the backlash BRT has faced in Vietnamese media since its launch. Many are angry that the BRT’s exclusive lane takes up almost half of some roads, exacerbating congestion for other motorbikes and cars. Others have predicted that BRT would never achieve the promise to cut travel time in half, given the challenges faced by keeping the lane free. But long before the launch, questions were already raised on whether the loan would be worth it.

The media’s declaration that BRT was dead upon arrival indicates declining trust towards the government’s handling of environmental and infrastructural challenges.

An ongoing struggle



Despite the brouhaha, many have already incorporated BRT into their daily routine. The 5pm bus towards Kim Ma on Thursday had all of its seats occupied and a handful of people standing. A dozen more gathered behind the shiny automated doors at the Giang Vo station, waiting to get in.

An official report from Hanoi’s transport document concluded that BRT passengers had risen over 62% in the first 12 days of its launch, averaging 41 passengers per trip. However, this means BRT is still operating under capacity, as can hold up to 90. Furthermore, it seems most passengers are students or retirees who are probably already accustomed to using public transport.

Given the low adoption, it is still too early to say whether BRT will have a positive impact on Hanoi’s air quality. The average monthly PM2.5 reading for January 2017, calculated using historical data collected at the US embassy directly on the BRT route, even shows an uptick in air pollution compared with December. However, it could be to do with the changing traffic patterns during the Vietnamese new year at the end of January.

Dr Hoang Xuan Co, an expert at the Research Centre for Environmental Monitoring and Modelling in Hanoi, says: “In theory, implementing BRT should improve air quality by reducing the amount of private transportation. However, there are ongoing challenges with implementing BRT: the infrastructure in Vietnam is still incomplete [for example, there are no hard dividers between the BRT lane and the regular street], and people’s transportation habits are unchanged. It has been almost one month, the people have yet to see BRT really impacting air quality.”

Hanoi currently has a declining 1.3 million daily bus users, a small number in comparison to the millions of motorbike drivers. The city also has a growing appetite for cars. It is worrying that many motorbike drivers who live within the BRT route and are highly critical of its construction say they have not even considered trying it.

Motorbike culture has engrained a need for flexibility and control in many Hanoians – some do not even get off their bikes when picking up meat and produce at wet markets. Dinh Nam is afraid that transitioning to BRT would reduce his flexibility in taking care of his family. “BRT is not for me because I sometimes have to pick up my kids,” he says.

Transforming a motorcycle city: the long wait for Hanoi's metro Read more

Nguyen Dung, meanwhile, avoids the BRT as she does not want to walk to and from the bus stop.



Vu Anh Tuan, director of the Vietnamese-German Transport Research Centre, believes BRT faces the challenge of promoting public transport in a motorbike and car culture.

“BRT is a wise investment because it can complement the planned metro system to form routes throughout the city, while keeping costs low. Its impact needs to be assessed by what the entire public transit network can do in the long term,” he writes in a passionate Facebook post.

“The media … will cause people to develop false perceptions about public transportation, especially BRT.”



It seems Hanoi’s new BRT system will only be able to make an impact on both reducing congestion and air quality if people are willing to change their habits.

I don’t know if he will return this season. I don’t know. People say between two to three months.”

Jesus’s enforced absence may allow a recall to City’s starting XI for Sergio Agüero, who had been dropped for the past three games.

Guardiola said: “It’s not easy for the player who does not play. Sergio was more than professional. I don’t have doubts about Sergio - he has to do what he has done since the beginning of his career.

Mark Zuckerberg opens his missive with a grammatical ambiguity: who are “we”? Is this a letter to Facebook, or to the world? It can be read both ways. But regardless of the intended audience, there’s a subtext to the opening paragraph which informs the whole 5,700-word letter: for an increasing number of people, the answer to Zuckerberg’s question is “no”. Zuckerberg wants for more than Facebook to be an insanely profitable mega-corporation. He wants the company to be seen as a force for good in the world, and right now, he’s concerned that it isn’t.

History is the story of how we’ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to nations.

This is the Facebook theory of history, and it’s a long way from “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”. But it sets the scale of Zuckerberg’s thinking: he genuinely views Facebook as a new paradigm for the organisation of human civilisation.

I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology: “We always overestimate what we can do in two years, and we underestimate what we can do in ten years.”

Strangely, Zuckerberg declined to cite the author of this “saying”: Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who wrote those words in his 1996 book, the Road Ahead. Perhaps he wants to avoid comparisons between the two men, who are increasingly alike, just 20 years apart.

In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us … Our job at Facebook is to help people make the greatest positive impact while mitigating areas where technology and social media can contribute to divisiveness and isolation.

This is the new mission statement for Facebook. It’s more nuanced than “connect the world”, and shows much greater self-awareness than “move fast and break things”. But is it too self-apologetic? It’s hard to imagine anyone at Facebook being motivated by such a caveated principle.

Building a global community that works for everyone starts with the millions of smaller communities and intimate social structures we turn to for our personal, emotional and spiritual needs.

Zuckerberg identifies “five important questions” for Facebook to answer; the first is how to build “supportive communities”.

We recently found that more than 100 million people on Facebook are members of what we call “very meaningful” groups. These are groups that upon joining, quickly become the most important part of our social network experience and an important part of our physical support structure … Going forward, we will measure Facebook’s progress with groups based on meaningful groups, not groups overall.

The first of the odd switches in tone, as Zuckerberg shifts from huge statements for how to change Facebook’s impact on the world to an announcement of a different internal metric. Those “very meaningful” groups certainly sound like a smart thing for Facebook to focus on, but it’s not immediately clear how much Facebook can influence their creation: how many of these groups are created by Facebook, rather than just being groups which would have existed since time immemorial, now being organised on Facebook?

We plan to build more tools to empower community leaders to run and grow their groups the way they’d like, similar to what we’ve done with Pages … We plan to expand groups to support sub-communities … We can design these experiences not for passive consumption but for strengthening social connections.

The odd shift in focus continues. A significant chunk of the letter is spent discussing fairly niche product refreshes. It might be important for Facebook’s long-term strategy, but it feels disconnected from the earlier lofty rhetoric.

To help during a crisis, we’ve built infrastructure like Safety Check so we can all let our friends know we’re safe and check on friends who might be affected by an attack or natural disaster. Safety Check has been activated almost 500 times in two years and has already notified people that their families and friends are safe more than a billion times

The letter shifts to something in the vein of a pre-emptive apology, basically here to remind you that Facebook is good. But Safety Check hasn’t been the PR slam-dunk it might seem it was. Initially, the product opened Facebook up to accusations of racism, since it had to be manually activated by Facebook staff, leading to a perception that attacks on developed nations received priority treatment. Then, when it was automated, it helped spread false reports of an attack in Thailand that never actually happened.

Looking ahead, one of our greatest opportunities to keep people safe is building artificial intelligence to understand more quickly and accurately what is happening across our community. There are billions of posts, comments and messages across our services each day, and since it’s impossible to review all of them, we review content once it is reported to us. There have been terribly tragic events -- like suicides, some live streamed -- that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner. There are cases of bullying and harassment every day, that our team must be alerted to before we can help out. These stories show we must find a way to do more. Artificial intelligence can help provide a better approach. We are researching systems that can look at photos and videos to flag content our team should review. This is still very early in development, but we have started to have it look at some content, and it already generates about one-third of all reports to the team that reviews content for our community. It will take many years to fully develop these systems. Right now, we’re starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda.

Here we have the first mention of artificial intelligence as the future solution for a myriad of problems. It is a recurring theme throughout the letter: a difficult problem gets punted to the AI team to be solved at some point that even Zuckerberg acknowledges may be far off. Some of these problems will be successfully tackled by improved AI, but others won’t. The propaganda problem, for instance, seems extraordinarily hard. Does the prospect of future solutions mean Facebook can get away with not acting in the meantime?

The two most discussed concerns this past year were about diversity of viewpoints we see (filter bubbles) and accuracy of information (fake news). I worry about these and we have studied them extensively, but I also worry there are even more powerful effects we must mitigate around sensationalism and polarization leading to a loss of common understanding.

Almost exactly in the middle of the letter, surrounded by explanations of all the good things Facebook does, we get on to the section which is why this letter exists in the first place. Facebook’s effect on the generation of fake news and filter bubbles has sparked consternation worldwide, with the site being directly blamed for “radicalisation” of the far right in multiple nations. It has concerned Facebook executives at the highest levels, including Zuckerberg. But the question is, do they accept the accusations? And what are they going to do about them?

Social media already provides more diverse viewpoints than traditional media ever has. Even if most of our friends are like us, we all know people with different interests, beliefs and backgrounds who expose us to different perspectives. Compared with getting our news from the same two or three TV networks or reading the same newspapers with their consistent editorial views, our networks on Facebook show us more diverse content.

This is a bold claim, and one many media experts would dispute. Facebook is good at giving multiple sources, but is it really good at giving “different perspectives”? Experiments designed to reflect political polarisation suggest maybe not: the newsfeed algorithm acts to concentrate viewpoints like little before. Even if you do have friends and family members with different interests and backgrounds, Facebook will hide those differences from you in order to give you the News Feed you’re comfortable with.

But our goal must be to help people see a more complete picture, not just alternate perspectives. We must be careful how we do this. Research shows that some of the most obvious ideas, like showing people an article from the opposite perspective, actually deepen polarization by framing other perspectives as foreign. A more effective approach is to show a range of perspectives, let people see where their views are on a spectrum and come to a conclusion on what they think is right. Over time, our community will identify which sources provide a complete range of perspectives so that content will naturally surface more.

Even if Facebook doesn’t actually show different perspectives, Zuckerberg is arguing, that may not be a problem. Maybe those different perspectives could lead to more polarisation, not less? It feels a bit like the classic lawyer’s argument: the discourse isn’t broken, and if it is, my client didn’t do it, and if they did, it was a good thing anyway.

Accuracy of information is very important. We know there is misinformation and even outright hoax content on Facebook, and we take this very seriously … Our approach will focus less on banning misinformation, and more on surfacing additional perspectives and information, including that fact checkers dispute an item’s accuracy.

The other side of the polarisation problem: “fake news”. Facebook is in a tricky position, and Zuckerberg knows it The firm can’t deny that it’s a problem that Macedonian teens can make up stories for an audience of millions, mediated almost exclusively by Facebook. But the term “fake news” is so contested that any solution will inevitably fall far short of satisfying everyone.

We noticed some people share stories based on sensational headlines without ever reading the story. In general, if you become less likely to share a story after reading it, that’s a good sign the headline was sensational.

Facebook’s News Feed tweaks can seem small, but their changes reverberate throughout the media world with enormous effects, bankrupting some outlets while heaping windfalls on others. This particular tweak seems smart.

A strong news industry is also critical to building an informed community. Giving people a voice is not enough without having people dedicated to uncovering new information and analyzing it. There is more we must do to support the news industry to make sure this vital social function is sustainable -- from growing local news, to developing formats best suited to mobile devices, to improving the range of business models news organizations rely on.

This feels like a nice sleight-of-hand. Unlike much of the rest of the letter, which follows pattern of acknowledging a problem before presenting a (potential) solution, this is just the problem: Zuckerberg doesn’t really have any ideas about how to solve it.

The vast majority of conversations on Facebook are social, not ideological. They’re friends sharing jokes and families staying in touch across cities. They’re people finding groups, whether they’re new parents raising kids or newly diagnosed patients suffering from a disease together. Sometimes it’s for joy, coming together around religion or sports. And sometimes it’s for survival, like refugees communicating to find shelter.

In other words, worrying about the corrosive effect of Facebook on political discourse is for the metropolitan liberal elite. Most of what Facebook is used for doesn’t as adverse effects, so just cheer up and click “like” on a baby photo.

Our society will reflect our collective values only if we engage in the civic process and participate in self-governance. There are two distinct types of social infrastructure that must be built: The first encourages engagement in existing political processes: voting, engaging with issues and representatives, speaking out, and sometimes organizing. Only through dramatically greater engagement can we ensure these political processes reflect our values. The second is establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in collective decision-making. Our world is more connected than ever, and we face global problems that span national boundaries. As the largest global community, Facebook can explore examples of how community governance might work at scale.

This is how Facebook wants to be thought of when it comes to politics Rather than a passive funnel through which distorted news arrives at people’s screens, it wants to be an active location for political engagement.

First, our community is evolving from its origin connecting us with family and friends to now becoming a source of news and public discourse as well … Second, our community spans many countries and cultures, and the norms are different in each region … Third, even within a given culture, we have different opinions on what we want to see and what is objectionable … Fourth, we’re operating at such a large scale that even a small percent of errors causes a large number of bad experiences.

Zuckerberg has identified the problems faced by Facebook’s censorship regime. For some, there’s an easy solution, such as tweaking the community standards to allow more boundary-pushing imagery with strong news value. For others, there’s a more hand-wavy solution: AI again. At some point in the future.

The approach is to combine creating a large-scale democratic process to determine standards with AI to help enforce them … With a broader range of controls, content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow … It’s worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text, photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech, graphic violence, sexually explicit content, and more. At our current pace of research, we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017, but others will not be possible for many years.

Again, Zuckerberg acknowledges these are really hard technological problems and any easy AI-based solutions are a long way off. Zuckerberg seems to be hoping concerned users will accept “we’re trying” as an acceptable position for Facebook to take.

I am reminded of President Lincoln’s remarks during the American Civil War: “We can succeed only by concert. It is not ‘can any of us imagine better?’ but, ‘can we all do better?’ The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, act anew.”

Zuckerberg’s final section ends with a quote from Abraham Lincoln, which has renewed speculation that his new interest in addressing political problems is a lead-in to a presidential campaign in 2024. But the letter as a whole suggests a more nuanced reading: While the Facebook chief executive is undoubtedly considering an entry into political life, he is also recognising that running the world’s largest social network is effectively a political career in itself. Maybe in Zuckerberg’s vision of history, after tribes and cities and nations, comes Facebook. There, he is already the leader.Minutes after Donald Trump insisted he was “the least racist person” at a press conference on Thursday, the president asked a black reporter to arrange a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC).

The American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan asked the president if he was going to include the CBC in conversations he will have about his “inner city” policies.

Trump responded by repeatedly asking Ryan if she could set up a meeting with the caucus, members of which the president suggested could be “friends” of hers.



Trump press conference: president says team running 'like fine-tuned machine' Read more

“Are they friends of yours? No, go ahead,” Trump said. “Set up the meeting.”

Trump ended his interaction with Ryan by saying: “Let’s go. Set up a meeting,” before moving on to accuse the Democratic representative Elijah Cummings, a senior member of the caucus, of being instructed not to meet with him.



Cummings, a former chair of the caucus, denied the accusation and said he was looking forward to meeting with Trump about health policy. “I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today,” Cummings said in a statement.

After the press conference, Ryan said on Twitter: “I am a journalist not a convener! But thank you for answering my questions.”

The caucus also tweeted a statement shortly after the conference: “Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We’re the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad!” A link to the letter was included.

Later on Thursday, Ryan tweeted that the administration had reached out to the CBC to set up a meeting with the president.

Ryan’s question came days after she said Omarosa Manigault, a communications official in the Trump administration, had “physically intimidated” her.

Ryan accused Manigault of making verbal threats against her, including telling the reporter she was among several journalists on whom Trump officials had collected negative information for a dossier. In response to the allegations, Manigault told the Washington Post: “My comment: fake news!”

About eight minutes before Ryan asked her question, Jake Turx, a reporter for a Jewish publication, had asked Trump what the government was going to do about antisemitic hate crimes that have occurred since he took office.



“Sit down,” Trump told the reporter. “Number one, I am the least antisemitic person you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person.”

Trump went on to say his opponents were responsible for some of the antisemitic acts, without providing evidence for the claim, and concluded by calling the question “insulting”.

Elsewhere on Thursday, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, were asked to leave a meeting between lawmakers and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) acting director, Tom Homan.

Trump’s campaign has been accused of fomenting racial divisions in the country, ever since he announced he was running for president with a speech in which he accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists.

Anti-hate watchdog groups have criticized the appointment of Stephen Bannon to a top adviser role in the White House for stoking these divisions, as he is a founding member of the far-right website Breitbart News. Activists had warned the decision would embolden antisemites, racists and misogynists.



Trump’s organization has been accused of mistreating black tenants, culminating in a government lawsuit that accused Trump Management of discriminating against black tenants in 1973.

Trump, the company’s then president, was named as a defendant in the justice department’s lawsuit, which was settled after Trump filed a $100m countersuit against the agency.

As part of the agreement, Trump Management had to ensure its staff were following their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and adequately reaching out to the community in line with fair housing practices.Waiters at a cheap and cheerful restaurant in central France have been worked off their feet since the eatery earned a coveted Michelin star – by mistake, the daily Le Parisien reported on Friday.

“We’re swamped,” Veronique Jacquet, who runs the Bouche à Oreille [Word of Mouth] bar-restaurant in the town of Bourges, told the paper. “I don’t have much space and there are only four waiters.”

Regulars pay €12.50 (£10) for homemade beef bourguignon, munching it over red-and-white polka dot tablecloths.

Guide Michelin France, which published its 2017 version on Thursday last week, mistook Jacquet’s place for another restaurant of the same name. It took nearly a week to correct the error on its website.

“We apologised to the two establishments and we are sorry to have misled our clients,” the guide’s Claire Dorland-Clauzel told Le Parisien.

The mistake showed up only on the website, and not in the red print version or on the mobile app of the foodie bible which can make or break aspiring top chefs with its system of awarding up to three stars to the finest restaurants.

The other Bouche à Oreille is 180km north, in Boutervilliers near Paris, with carpeted floors, linen tablecloths and dishes including lobster flan, calf’s brain, and a crunchy pear and chocolate, complete with champagne, for €48.

Chef Aymeric Dreux took the mistake in his stride: “It was a little boo-boo that caused no harm and was corrected.” Dreux, who first earned the star in 2015, added: “I called [Jacquet] in Bourges. The whole thing made us laugh.”

Jacquet’s cook Penelope Salmon, asked whether she ever dreamed of earning a Michelin star, said: “No, not at all. I cook with my heart.”About this project

Desert in the City - Hardcover Book

Desert in the City is a photography project where a deserted city is shot during a holiday season. The project has now 4 cities after Desert in Paris (Christmas 2014), London (Christmas 2015), New York (Thanksgiving 2016) and Rome (Christmas 2016). This kickstarter aims at financing the Hardcover photobook with every single picture of the project - 100+ pages with more than 120 pictures of deserted cities, and an exhibition in Paris in november.

More than two years ago I was looking for a way to create a series of pictures that would make a beautiful "portrait of a city".

I thought of photos of New York I had done just before Irene hurricane back in 2011. Streets were totally empty during the curfew and I had the chance to wander in an empty Manhattan.

So I asked myself : how could I shoot an empty Paris ? With no people, no cars, no tourists, and still magnify the city of love. It turns out there is a moment in the year when streets are totally empty, when people are home or away, when nobody is partying all night long : that magical moment is Christmas.

After an amazing run on Kickstarter last year where the project became 'Most Popular' in the photo category with Desert in Paris and Desert in London, I had my eyes on the city that may be the most challenging : New York, the city that never sleeps.

I thought there may well be a holiday where people fly off from New York or stay at home with families : Thanksgiving.

Desert in New York

Skyscrapers everywhere, iconic locations by hundreds and a huge city where just walking to see it all would seem dumb, I had challenges both technical and physical. Luckily I have been to New York quite a few times in the past so I already knew most of the locations.

Still I needed a full week of scouting to identify the zones where I could get several shots by walking, and to spot where I could compose photos with such a massive city.

So I walked 12+ miles between 23rd and 24th of November in two main areas where iconic locations are concentrated :

a Mid-Town triangle composed of Times Square, Central Park and the Flatiron

The Financial District with close access to Brooklyn bridge. The High Line was on the way for a quick stop.

Desert in New York is now composed of 40+ pictures, some of them are the most impressive I have ever shot for Desert in the City. Most of the pictures are long exposure photography and nobody was erased from them.

The day I was about to leave Paris for New York, Matthieu Blanco a friend who happens to be a film-maker called me for other businesses. He had just moved for a few months in Montreal and decided right away to meet me for one of those nights and follow the whole process. A bold move that allows to show how everything is done. It’s also great to have a different memory of those crazy nights.

Desert in Rome

I had in mind to produce a Hardcover Book for the whole project and I needed more pictures to complete it, and I still had a Christmas holiday ahead of me. So when a photo trip to Tuscany was confirmed for me just after Christmas, I decided right away to shoot Desert in Rome.

Again I spent Christmas walking in Rome after 5 days of scouting. This 4th installment of the project was again very challenging, it seems that people from Rome celebrate Christmas all night long at Trevi fountain :) I waited 2hrs there to get the picture I wanted.

Desert in Rome is composed of 25+ pictures that will all be in the Hardcover book.

Hardcover Book

This Kickstarter campaign aims at producing & publishing a Hardcover Book with 120+ pictures from Desert in the City. Every single picture from the project will be in it, including Desert in Paris and Desert in London alongside New York and Rome.

When I proposed Desert in Paris to magazines in France two years ago I had no answer, not even rejections. But when I saw people reacting to the pictures and blogs sharing them I hoped that crowdfunding could be the best way to continue the project in new cities.

This is the biggest challenge since a hardcover book needs an edition of at least 500 copies in order to have great prints at controlled costs. Except the videos, everything is self published so I intend to have the best quality possible for the prints, paper and materials.

Publishing a hardcover book would be a wonderful accomplishment, but it won't happen until I have funds to print 500 of them. With first estimates of production costs for a hardcover book, shipping and video editing, overall budget is 20 000€. With 8% going to Kickstarter and the exhibition costs north of 5 000 €, the goal is 30k. This is big.

If the first goal is reached I intend to stretch it to a second edition of 500 copies.

What's Next ?

Photography Workshops

I have been teaching photography for the past two years in university, workshops and photography trips with Photographes du Monde.

Sharing my passion for photography is an important part for me, and maybe some people would like to learn and experiment the techniques involved in Desert in the City project.

So I propose to participants of this Kickstarter to conduct a 'Night photography & long exposure' workshop with 4 hours of theory & practice in one night & 2 hours post-production the next day :

in Paris : June 2017

in New York : September 2017

Exhibition

Desert in the City exhibition is planned for november 2017 at Hegoa Gallery in Paris.

It will mainly feature new cities from the project : New York & Rome.

Whatever the results, I intend to shoot next cities in 2018 : Hong Kong & Tokyo.Faith Evans is making a duets album using unheard music by Notorious BIG. Modelled on Nat “King” Cole and Natalie Cole’s version of Unforgettable, the forthcoming LP will be a posthumous tribute to Evans’ late husband.

“It’s gonna be really, really dope,” Evans told Hip Hollywood. “It’s something I’ve been thinking about doing for many, many years … [and] I finally got all my ducks in a row to try and make it happen.”

Evans plans to call the album The King & I. “It’s definitely unheard music,” she said. “Unheard music in the presentation of it, that’s what I will say.” Although she is currently promoting her latest solo album, Incomparable, Evans hopes to release this new full-length “in the next year”.

Almost a decade has passed since the release of Notorious BIG’s last posthumous LP, which was also a collection of collaborations. Duets: The Final Chapter featured Evans on two songs, alongside Biggie team-ups with acts such as Missy Elliott, Eminem, Jay Z and Korn.

Evans and Notorious BIG, whose real name was Christopher Wallace, were married in August 1994. Her career took off the following year, beginning with an appearance on Biggie’s One More Chance (Remix). She has since scored seven solo singles on the US top 40, and another five hits with performers like Diddy, Whitney Houston and Twista.

He understands the solitary nature of elite sport better than most professional athletes, and describes its impact with layered elegance, but even Thorpe was jolted by the isolation he felt as he prepared to swim competitively again in Singapore last November. After four years in retirement, his five Olympic gold medals and famous old Thorpedo racing persona meant nothing as he climbed on the blocks.

"I've never felt more alone than in that moment," Thorpe says simply. "The water is normally my space – because I get quite territorial. But I realised that, despite all my training, I was about to put myself back out there as a competitor. I was surrounded by people but I still had this intense loneliness. Sport can sometimes isolate you and I've come to realise through all the travelling and all the hotel rooms that there is this recurring Lost In Translation moment."

It's typical of Thorpe, and an example of why he is so interesting to interview, that he should refer to Sofia Coppola's film amid his explanation of a difficult sporting comeback. In Lost in Translation, Bill Murray plays the part of a fading actor who suddenly confronts his acute loneliness and alienation in a Tokyo hotel. Thorpe, however, has ended up in far darker and more frightening places.

The 30-year-old's attempt to swim for Australia at this summer's London Olympics ended in disappointment. Yet set against his depression, which he has revealed for the first time in his stark but powerful new book, Thorpe's return assumes fresh meaning. "In terms of making the Olympics it was a complete failure," Thorpe concedes, as he reflects on his non-selection, "but I've rediscovered what I loved about my sport when I walked away from it, loathing it. I find such beauty in the repetition of training – in its rhythms and rituals. I had lost that. But, even if I prefer training to racing, part of me wants performance. It's less about winning than turning in a performance that matches my preparation."

Such purity ensured that Thorpe resumed training as soon as his stint as a BBC commentator at London 2012 ended in August. He plans to swim at next year's world championships in Barcelona and at Glasgow's 2014 Commonwealth Games – while possibly continuing two years beyond that at one last Olympic Games in Rio. Following the return of a former great sportsman is always poignant but, with Thorpe, there is a sense that swimming also provides a refuge from depression.

"There are some mornings when, if I didn't have the routine of training, I would struggle to get out of bed. But, when you get to training, all of a sudden things seem a little better. Of course racing can bring about increased pressure. But when I'm racing I usually manage my depression and anxiety really well. The pulse of anxiety is appropriate then. It's just more troubling on ordinary days."

Thorpe thinks carefully before he answers most questions. And his pause is especially considered when asked to describe his worst days of depression. He eventually offers a telling account which uncovers the extent to which depression can be physically, as well as well as psychologically, debilitating. "It's like a weight is pressing down on you. There are days when you just can't get out of bed. You cannot face the world. You tell yourself simple things like: 'Just get to the kitchen and get a glass of water.' But not being able to do something so basic is frightening.

"There were lots of times where I just could not bear to leave the house. You actually scour the cupboards for food. You become quite resourceful with what's left. And if there's nothing in the cupboards you just don't eat. Sometimes this feeling lasts just days. Other times it can be weeks. But you learn to identify the triggers. You can start to minimise the length of your depression.

"I realise now when I start to withdraw from doing things with my friends that I need to force myself. My doctors say [Thorpe emits a dry laugh]: 'Fake it till you make it.' So even if I don't feel like going out with my friends I know I need to. It's tough but, once you've forced yourself, it doesn't seem so bad and you can minimise the low."

Courage is needed to address such problems and Thorpe, who is an intensely private man, makes it seem as if "the cancer of attention" had contributed to his depression. So how was he finally able to voice a secret he had harboured so long? "It helped knowing doctors don't talk. It's also realising you need help. I still don't understand it entirely but being able to share it has helped because part of being depressed is being completely irrational. It's important to apply some rational thought.

"I think depression is genetic and I probably would've dealt with it whether I was famous or not. But people sometimes don't think you have a right to feel like this because you've been famous or successful. It just doesn't work like that. You can be a really great athlete and have all the attributes of mental toughness but, in real life, it doesn't work. I was really tough when I raced but I couldn't hold the rest of my life together."

Thorpe had been a world champion at 15, and won three gold medals at his home Olympics in Sydney in 2000. Yet a year later, and only 19, his illness had become so "crushing" Thorpe needed clandestine psychiatric help. He still could not bring himself to tell his friends or family and the unbearable weight continued to bear down on him. He finally contemplated suicide.

"It made me understand I needed to see someone more frequently and to get medication that worked. I feel I'm on to the other side of it now. I've got a handle on it but I would never say I'm in control of it because I know how quickly it can change. But I'm in a place where, for the first time, I'm comfortable talking about depression."

Does Thorpe believe that discussing his illness will diminish its hold on him? "I'm not sure. I assume it's better I'm not bottling it up. But it also means I've exposed myself."

It's hard to shake the assumption that Thorpe's demons have been deepened by media hounding and speculation about his sexuality. In one telling anecdote he writes of how the mother of Grant Hackett, another famous Australian swimmer, spoke of her sadness when she saw how he walked with his head lowered in public. Thorpe, in contrast, felt a burst of empathy with Hackett. "You feel you have to hide yourself," Thorpe says. "I don't want people to feel sorry for me but that's what fame is. Sometimes it's incredibly difficult to deal with and sometimes it's great. It's just not simple."

Thorpe was friends with Heath Ledger, the gifted Australian actor, and his partner, the actress Michelle Williams. A few years after his success in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger died after an accidental overdose. Just like Thorpe, he had struggled with depression and an intrusive Australian media.

"We had some interesting discussions around fame," Thorpe says. "What fame is and how we felt about it. But the last time I saw Heath we spoke of the summer we'd all just had as 'the happy summer'. It seemed as if everything was great for all of us. But things changed very quickly for him."

Was Ledger aware of the pressure Thorpe also faced? "Of course," Thorpe chides gently. "He liked sport and he was from Australia, so come on!"

Innuendos about Thorpe's sexuality began when he was a boy – and he remembers first being asked if he was gay in an interview when he was only 15. Thorpe insists in his book that, "for the record, I am not gay and all my sexual experiences have been straight". He argues that his interests in fashion and art and "beautiful things" have led to mistaken assumptions about him. His sexuality really doesn't matter but he then makes a sad aside: "The truth is I've spent most of my adult life trying to avoid relationships … if people get too close to me I often end up pushing them away."

But Thorpe provides a cautionary suggestion which can be applied to his private life. "The world is a lovely shade of grey and there needs to be more balance in the way lives are described. I know people need certain results to stay in their job so things get exaggerated in the media. It often seems as if there is not much else besides success and misery. I think what happens is that people in my position don't give out all the information because there is not enough trust. They don't want it to be sensationalised.

"I look at athletes and I see what they have to offer but they never reveal it in public. I see textbook media answers where I am just frightened by how boring it is. But they're scared to show themselves. We need to get back some trust between the media and athletes."

Australia's media can be hysterical in its treatment of sporting failure. Thorpe raises an eyebrow when I read to him some reports from the London Olympics which described James Magnussen's silver in the 100m freestyle as "the biggest Australian flop since Crocodile Dundee 3" and the failure of him and his team-mates to win a medal in the relay as "the biggest defeat since Gallipoli". Thorpe shrugs: "We should not be talking about sport in this way. But he had talked his prospects up a lot and when you do that you have to deliver. If he had won we would've accepted that this is the way he talks – like an American track-and-field sprinter. But because he didn't swim very well he invited that upon himself. Of course it's still exaggerated because we're talking about sport and not war."

Thorpe is different to most sportsmen and yet, for all his refined interests and sometimes fragile personality, he retains a hard competitive edge. "A driven part of me loves elite performance and I may be able to capture that again. I want to swim as well as I used to and if I do that it would mean winning medals again. If I get to a point in training where I don't think that's achievable I'll have to rethink everything. In 2016, at the Rio Olympics, I'll be 33. It's completely feasible I could swim there. But I'm taking it step by step. We have trials for the 2013 world championships in April. That's my next big goal.

"Before the London trials I did times in training I'd never done but I need consistency. So that's why big blocks of training are important. I just want to get back in the pool and train hard and that eagerness makes me realise how much I want it. It's helping me as a person and who knows where I'll end up as a swimmer. I'm excited to find out – and that's not something I could have said a few years ago."

A federal appeals court on Monday upheld the National Football League’s estimated $1bn concussion settlement with retired players, calling the agreement imperfect but fair.

A small group of players had objected to the deal, which was approved in April 2015 by US district judge Anita Brody in Philadelphia, because it did not cover potential victims of a degenerative brain disease that scientists have linked to repeated blows to the head.

'It's been devastating': former NFL players count the cost of concussion Read more

“It is the nature of a settlement that some will be dissatisfied with the ultimate result,” circuit judge Thomas Ambro wrote for a three-judge panel of the third US circuit court of appeals in Philadelphia. “But they risk making the perfect the enemy of the good.”

Representatives of the NFL, the objecting players and the retirees who signed on to the deal did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The settlement calls for payments of up to $5m each to former players diagnosed with certain neurological disorders, but it does not address chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which some researchers say can be caused by concussions.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of more than 5,000 retired players, though the settlement could cover more than 21,000 former players, according to the court.

Roughly 200 retirees objected to the agreement, saying it did not account for players yet to be diagnosed with CTE. They also argued the deal unfairly favored currently injured retirees and left thousands of former players who have not yet been diagnosed with neurological diseases without a remedy.

CTE has been discovered during autopsies for several former players, including Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau and Pro Bowl safety Dave Duerson, who both killed themselves. In March, the NFL for the first time acknowledged a link between football and CTE.

But the appeals court noted that the research surrounding CTE is still nascent, with no current way to test for the disease while an individual is still alive. It also said many of the symptoms associated with CTE, such as memory loss, are eligible for compensation under the settlement.

The league estimates that 6,000 former players, or nearly three in 10, could develop Alzheimer’s disease or moderate dementia.Jürgen Klopp’s dream of winning every remaining league game may not be idle fantasy after all if his side can come up with this sort of quality on a regular basis. Liverpool certainly got the unlikely project off to an auspicious start with a comprehensive victory over Tottenham, keeping up their unbeaten record against other top-six Premier League teams in the process and winning their first league game of 2017 in some style.

Klopp said he wanted his players to produce a performance to make Anfield smile, and they did just that, though it always helps when Liverpool can name all four of their leading attackers – Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Adam Lallana and Sadio Mané – in the same team. It does not always work, the quartet appeared in the unexpected defeat at Hull last week, but here Liverpool’s energetic running was causing Spurs problems from the off and Mané in particular looked unplayable at times. The Senegal international had the chance to join Spurs in the summer but the club felt his wage demands were too high. Perhaps it was no accident that he chose this game to show his true worth.

Liverpool started like a team determined to make an early impression, and might have scored before Mané gave them the lead had not Coutinho’s goalbound shot struck the trailing heel of Toby Alderweireld. Tottenham were holding a high defensive line and giving the home side space to run into, which is exactly what happened when a visiting attack broke down and Georginio Wijnaldum was able to slip Mané into an almost empty Spurs half a couple of minutes later. After holding off what remained of the Spurs defence Mané only had Hugo Lloris to beat, which he did deftly enough despite appearing to lose his footing in the act of shooting.

If that was an ideal start for a side short on confidence, it got better with a second goal within a matter of just over a minute. This time a ponderous Eric Dier was caught in possession by Mané, who probably imagined either Firmino or Lallana would put the ball in the net, only for both Liverpool players to be denied by excellent saves from Lloris. The danger was not cleared, however, and when the ball came back in his direction Mané scored at the third attempt.

Playing centre-half in Jan Vertonghen’s absence, Dier did make some amends by getting across to stop Mané’s run into the penalty area after half an hour, though by that stage the Liverpool player could already have completed a hat-trick. He hit the side-netting from a decent opportunity midway through the first half, then followed up on Liverpool’s next attack to bring another diving save from Lloris.

Liverpool also had centre-half problems, Lucas Leiva standing in because Dejan Lovren was injured and Ragnar Klavan sick, though in the first half Tottenham were unable to put the home back line under any sustained pressure. It was Liverpool finding all the space and creating all the chances, and Coutinho really should have put them further ahead when he took his time with a clear shooting opportunity and still ended up putting the ball too close to Lloris.

It was not quite one-way traffic: Son Heung-min brought a save from Simon Mignolet before the interval and Christian Eriksen was too high with a free-kick from the edge of the area. However, Harry Kane and Dele Alli were not featuring in as many Spurs attacks as Mauricio Pochettino would have liked and neither were the full backs providing the usual width and penetration.

Liverpool ended the first half as they had started it, swarming all around the Spurs box, and they should probably have had greater reward for their movement and invention than a couple of corners that came to nothing.

At times the home side were passing for fun inside the area, and though their enterprise was a pleasure to watch, Klopp would almost certainly have preferred a little more directness and a third goal to reflect their overall superiority.

The closest Spurs came to mounting a comeback in the second half was when Kane hit a post from an offside position. Their frustration began to show after an hour, with Alli and Kane both fouling Nathaniel Clyne in quick succession, the latter receiving a caution for an unnecessary stamp.

When Emre Can was sent on for the last few minutes, Dier welcomed him with an uncompromising challenge that also brought a booking. Alderweireld became the fifth Spurs player booked when he brought down Firmino as he raced into the area, with the visitors in danger of losing their composure in the closing stages.

Liverpool were unable to add another goal but they remain on top of the imaginary mini-league comprising the top-six teams. Despite ending Chelsea’s unbeaten run, it is Spurs, lucky to claim a point at the Etihad last month, who now appear to be struggling to impose themselves on top-six rivals.Trey Parker and Matt Stone said writing for the animated sitcom had become ‘really tricky’ as ‘what was actually happening was way funnier than anything we could come up with’.

The ride-hailing app could now be open to claims from all of its 40,000 drivers in the UK, who are currently not entitled to holiday pay, pensions or other workers’ rights. Uber immediately said it would appeal against the ruling.

Employment experts said other firms with large self-employed workforces could now face scrutiny of their working practices and the UK’s biggest union, Unite, announced it was setting up a new unit to pursue cases of bogus self-employment.

Research by Citizens Advice has suggested that as many as 460,000 people could be falsely classified as self-employed, costing up to £314m a year in lost tax and employer national insurance contributions. Four courier firms are already facing legal action from cyclists who want similar recognition as staff employees and the rights that go with that status, while delivery firm Hermes is under investigation by HM Revenue & Customs.

The Uber ruling could force a rethink of the gig economy business model, where companies use apps and the internet to match customers with workers. The firms do not employ the workers, but take commission from their earnings, and many have become huge global enterprises. Uber now operates around the world, with the company valued at more than £50bn.

The decision of the employment tribunal comes amid mounting concern within government about the growing trend towards self-employed workforces. The government has recently announced a six-month review of modern working practices and HMRC is setting up a new unit, the employment status and intermediaries team, to investigate firms.

MPs launched an inquiry last week into pay and working conditions in the UK which will look at the status and rights of agency and casual workers and the self-employed for the purposes of tax, benefits and employment law, and how to protect them.

Friday’s ruling by a London employment tribunal involves a case taken by two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, on behalf of a group 19 Uber workers who argued that they were employed by the San Francisco-based firm, rather than working for themselves.

At a hearing in July, Farrar told how he was put under “tremendous pressure” to work long hours and accept jobs and said that there were “repercussions” from the company if he cancelled a pickup. He said some months he earned as little as £5 an hour – far below the £7.20 that employers are obliged to pay workers aged over 25.

Uber argued that it was a technology firm not a transport business and that its drivers were independent self-employed contractors who could choose where and when they worked.

The judges were scathing about Uber’s arguments, however, accusing the firm of “resorting in its documentation to fictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology” and even quoting Hamlet to suggest that the group’s UK boss was protesting too much about its position.

“The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common ‘platform’ is to our minds faintly ridiculous,” the judges said. “Drivers do not and cannot negotiate with passengers … They are offered and accept trips strictly on Uber’s terms.”

Nigel Mackay from the employment team at law firm Leigh Day, which represented the drivers, said: “We are pleased that the employment tribunal has agreed with our arguments that drivers are entitled to the most basic workers’ rights, including to be paid the [national living wage] and to receive paid holiday, which were previously denied to them.

“This is a ground-breaking decision. It will impact not just on the thousands of Uber drivers working in this country, but on all workers in the so-called gig economy whose employers wrongly classify them as self-employed and deny them the rights to which they are entitled.”

The GMB union, which took up the case for the drivers, said that it was a “monumental victory” which would have an impact on thousands of workers in other industries “where bogus self-employment is rife”.

Maria Ludkin, GMB’s legal director, said: “Uber drivers and thousands of others caught in the bogus self-employment trap will now enjoy the same rights as employees. This outcome will be good for passengers, too. Properly rewarded drivers are the same side of the coin as drivers who are properly licensed and driving well-maintained and insured vehicles.”

Farrar said he was thrilled with the “emphatic” ruling. He said his industry had seen the deterioration in workers’ rights since Uber entered the market. “We’ve brought that to a halt,” he said.

Employment experts said that other firms with large self-employed workforces could now face similar action. “This judgment is likely to have massive implications, as we see an increasing number of start-up businesses effectively adopting Uber’s model,” said Tim Goodwin of law firm Winckworth Sherwood. “The effect of this judgment is that those kinds of business may owe a lot more to their workers, such as paid holiday and minimum wage, than they had bargained for.”

The ruling should be regarded as “ a salutary lesson by businesses who try to arbitrarily ‘classify’ workers as contractors to avoid affording them their full rights as workers,” Goodwin said.

The GMB’s Ludkin said employers should be “on notice” that it was reviewing similar contracts. “This is old-fashioned exploitation under new-fangled jargon, but the law will force you to pay GMB members what they are rightfully due,” she said.

There were calls for more clarity over employment status, with Citizens Advice pointing out that many people were locked out of employment tribunals by fees of up to £1,200.

“The fact it takes an employment tribunal to decide whether these drivers are self-employed shows that proving employment status is an extremely complicated and costly process,” said its chief executive, Gillian Guy. “For many people struggling at the sharp end of insecure work, such as in false self-employment, taking such a case is simply not an option.”

The ruling is not the end of the process for Uber. The firm will take the case to the employment appeal tribunal, and following its decision there could be further hearings in the court of appeal and then the supreme court. Any payments due to drivers will not be calculated until that process is over.

Other drivers with the firm will not automatically receive payouts but, if the firm accepts the ruling, it will have to change its contracts to avoid more cases being taken by drivers. Lawyers say that its terms and conditions are similar for all of its UK employees.

Jo Bertram, the regional general manager of Uber in the UK, said many of the firm’s drivers did not want to be classified as workers: “Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss.

“The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want.”

Let me ask you a question. Would you like a series that has everything? Good. Because it is, emphatically, HERE.

Big Little Lies is the latest offering (this time adapted from a bestselling book of the same name) from David E Kelley (the creator of Boston Legal and – back in the day, children – Ally McBeal). It is set among the moneyed honeys of Monterey, California, and opens with a murder – of whom and by whom it is not yet revealed, but as we flash back and crack open the brittle carapaces of perfection surrounding all the residents’ lives it becomes deliciously clear that almost everyone is a potential victim, suspect, or both. The townspeople, as they are interviewed in the present day by the police, add something between an unreliable narration and a bitchy Greek chorus to proceedings.

At one level, it’s soapy melodrama. A lot happens in Monterey. A lot. Most of it involves the indefatigable Madeline Mackenzie, stay-at-home-apart-from-the-20-hours-of-community-theatre-she-does-a-week mom, problem-solver and grudge-bearer extraordinaire played by Reese Witherspoon. Imagine a grownup, thwarted Tracy Flick leavened with a dash of Witherspoon’s other most famous role, Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. She takes newcomer and single mother Jane Chapman under her wing when Jane’s son Ziggy is accused without proof of injuring the daughter of Madeline’s nemesis, career woman Renata “I’ve just agreed to sit on the board of PayPal! What was I thinking!” Klein.

Whatever time she can spare from feuding with Renata she spends feuding with her ex-husband and his new, younger wife Bonnie. The divorce was 15 years ago, but wounds will not heal if you spend your days picking at them. The only thing Madeline does not know about the good-ish people of Monterey is the secret her best friend Celeste – Nicole Kidman – is hiding from everyone. She too believes (albeit with greater pleasure and less envy than most) that Celeste’s marriage to her preternaturally sexy husband (Alexander Skarsgård) is as perfect as he looks.

But if it starts off as simply a Desperate Housewives with even more money and even nicer houses (and good jokes – enjoy the mayor who wants to nix Madeline’s production of Avenue Q on the grounds that “We can’t have puppets fucking in Monterey”, and Madeline’s choice of alias under which to post comments on her teenage daughter’s Facebook page; God) it rapidly evolves into something much better.

It sets up all the cliches of female rivalry, maternal hypercompetitiveness and marital fidelity (or lack thereof) and then sets about investigating and deconstructing them, aided by the marquee cast giving, to a man and woman, probably career-best performances. The characters deepen so that, while it may still be clear that if people like this exist, we have indeed entered the endgame of late western capitalism, we no longer want to boot them through their plate-glass coastal windows and enjoy their crumpled bodies spoiling the expensive view. And if its examination of the after-effects of rape is underdone, its portrait of domestic violence – the unspoken compromises, the shifting power plays, the incremental, inexorable escalations, the pervasiveness of denial – is masterly.

Come for the soapy fun but stay – and you will, because the addictive melodramatic element never leaves it – for this. At its core, Big Little Lies has the ring of truth.

Big Little Lies airs in the US on HBO from 19 February and in the UK on Sky Atlantic in March.I’m 33, and my husband and I have been trying to conceive for three years. When we were ready, we threw caution to the wind and decided that if it happened naturally, it would be wonderful. Then as the months passed, we began to wonder if there was something wrong, so we got tested. My husband’s fertility is A++; his swimmers are practically Phelps-like in their speed and precision. My eggs, on the other hand, are a little more Humpty Dumpty.

In the past year I’ve been referred to doctors, specialists, naturopaths and acupuncturists. They all ask the same questions. And despite their years of experience, most of them still fill silences with ridiculous lines like, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” The last thing you should say to a woman who is desperately trying to have a baby is, “Try not to think about it.” It’s all we think about.

We unlucky few reach a point in the road where we start living our lives period to period, or pregnancy test to pregnancy test. We wake and immediately calculate which day it is in our cycle. Is today a sex day? Am I ovulating? Every little pull or twinge in our tummies, we read far more into than we should. Imagine, then, how tough it is when all the practitioners tell you to lower your cortisol levels and stop stressing about conception.

I’m doing my best to remain calm and working every day on finding inner peace and fulfilment – even if my truest fulfilment in life would be to become a mother.

If you know someone who’s trying for a baby, don’t ask questions, and unless you’ve struggled with conception yourself, don’t offer advice. It doesn’t help.

Warsaw, Poland

“The air pollution problem in Poland is beyond any western standards. Despite poor conditions, Poland has done nothing to reduce used car imports, promote renewable energy, protect green areas or rationalise precaution levels. (Right now an alert is announced at 600% of the norm and the ministry for environment refuses to change that level because “they would have to announce the alert too often”.)

“Where I live (Warsaw) the air quality is very bad. The intensive development of apartment buildings in suburban areas without proper public transportation pushes people into cars and reduces green space. Over the last decade Warsaw suffered a net loss of 160,000 trees.

“Recently as more groups join the demand for better air, the city hall pretends they care, but there is no real action. I became a father five months ago and air quality has become a reason to stay indoors against our will for most of the winter. I’m a member of Warsaw’s city activist group Miasto Jest Nasze (the City is Ours), an organisation which set up Warsaw’s smog alert.” (Tymon Radwański)

“Residents of Port Harcourt became aware of a black substance falling from the sky last November. Authorities said an investigation was going to be carried out but not much happened until late January and early February when this pollution became unbearable.

“A lot of residents believed local refineries were the likely cause and took to social media to ask the state government to act. Finally, a committee was set up and a report released showing the soot is petroleum based, but the government said they couldn’t determine which activities were the cause.” (Babajide Odulaja)

“If you wipe surfaces indoors and outdoors with a white towel or tissue paper, you get a black smudge. Perhaps more worrisome is that if you clean your nostrils with a white material, you come up with a jet black residue. If you walk barefooted, the soles of your feet turn black.” (Eben Dokubo)

(Update: The situation was declared an emergency this week. According to reports the state government have shut down a Chinese construction company apparently responsible for the pollution.)

“Air pollution is visible here on most days. You can taste it in the air. I believe it’s caused by low-quality diesel, and the high number of motor vehicles. There is no rail system and freight is transported by road. Heavy vehicles emit a thick, black exhaust that is frightening to see and lingers in the air.” (Anonymous)

“I grew up in Los Angeles in the 50s and 60s. I remember days where the air pollution was so bad your eyes would burn and it hurt – actually was painful – to take a deep breath. Combine that with the heat and a shining grey sky that beat down on you, where the soup was so thick all you could see of the sun was a diffuse bright patch in the sky, where even the grass turned brown and the trees died from the pollution, and you have a hell on earth of the sort described by Tolkein when he wrote about the wastelands of Mordor.” (EvilMidnightBomber)

“When the air pollution is bad, many people in my office develop coughs and sick days are taken. I like to walk or ride a bicycle home, but I always need to check the air quality before leaving work. Today I decided to take the bus home because the air quality reading was 150. I have also cancelled weekend plans with friends due to the unhealthy air levels. It can be very depressing.

“When the neighbouring city Hangzhou hosted the G20 and they shut down all the factories for two weeks it was amazing. Shanghai had clear blue skies the whole time.

“We are a part of the #BreatheMongolia and #MongolsAreSuffering initiatives. Protests and demonstrations in Ulaanbaatar have been raising awareness of the dangerous air pollution in the city and calling upon the government for solutions to the crisis as soon as possible. Thousands of demonstrators marched holding black balloons that represent their damaged lungs caused by air pollution and hung the balloons on the fence around the government house, aiming to show that around 500 children die annually in Mongolia due to air pollution.

“It has officially been declared that air pollution in Ulaanbaatar has reached disaster levels, exceeding 120 times the safe limit; 80% of the air pollution comes from the districts of ger (traditional circular felted tents) households, where people burn coal to stay warm.

“The top three diseases that resulted in the largest number of deaths in Mongolia in 2013 were air pollution-related. Studies show that air pollution exposure also results in miscarriage, premature birth and has an impact on the intellectual and physical development of a child. We know of someone who had multiple miscarriages while living in the city and had to move out to the countryside in order to give birth successfully. The people of Mongolia deserve clean air.” (Nomi Ganbold and JaRed Cameron)

“I am asthmatic and air pollution makes me sick. In 2014 I packed up and left Delhi, moved to the mountains. But I have to keep coming back to the city and fighting air pollution has become a personal battle for me. I have seen healthy friends become sick in November 2016 as air pollution was at its peak. Tier two and tier three cities in India are worse though, there are no records on them and nothing to make people aware of it.” (Shibayan Raha)

“The air pollution in Delhi is actually pretty scary. I really haven’t ever experienced anything quite like it. There are days where I just have to stay inside because if I go out, I know the next day I’ll be struggling with sinus issues and laboured breathing. I have had a chronic cough since I have been here.

“Long-awaited” is one of the oiliest cliches in the music industry’s PR lexicon and the press release for the forthcoming album The King & I takes it to Orwellian heights: “Faith Evans and the Notorious BIG release long-awaited duets album.” Most fans stopped anticipating new material from one of hip-hop’s greatest MCs when he was murdered 20 years ago, but apparently some have been impatiently waiting for him to get his finger out.



If anyone has the moral right to use Biggie’s voice, then it’s Evans, his widow, and the project has the blessing of Biggie’s mother, Voletta, but has he not done enough by now? His verses have already been repurposed on 1999’s Born Again; Runnin’ (Dying to Live), his necrophiliac “duet” with the similarly deceased 2Pac; Michael Jackson’s Unbreakable; and 2005’s prematurely titled Duets: The Final Chapter. What more do we want from him?

Notorious BIG could be resurrected in holographic form Read more

There’s something uniquely creepy about the duet from beyond the grave. A good duet requires both singers to be, if not in the same room, then at least cognisant of each other’s presence. A duet where only one person knows what’s going on isn’t worthy of the name. The first one I heard was Natalie Cole’s mawkish exchange with her late father Nat King Cole on Unforgettable in 1991, 26 years after his death, but this regrettable trend actually began back in 1965 with Father & Son by Hank Williams Sr and Hank Williams Jr, “singing together in a recording miracle”.

Whoever conceived that bit of studio chicanery has a lot to answer for, from Lisa Marie Presley communing with Elvis on Don’t Cry Daddy (these titles!) to Rod Stewart exhuming Ella Fitzgerald on What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?, a question to which the answer should be: “Not much, Rod. I died in 1996.” Weirdest of all was My Dream Duets, on which Barry Manilow “performed” with Marilyn Monroe, Dusty Springfield and nine more dead singers, presumably because nobody had the guts to stop him. At least Drake and producer 40’s ominous plan to Frankenstein a new Aaliyah album hasn’t come into existence – at least not yet.

An artist is more than a voice. When he was alive, Biggie chose which verses to commit to record and what music to use. He had taste and integrity. In death he has become just a voice on tape; a subjective memory; a device in somebody else’s narrative. The best thing you can say about The King & I is that Biggie would have been happy to duet with Evans, unlike previous posthumous collaborators Nelly and Korn, but for God’s sake let this be the final final chapter.

The King & I is released on Friday 19 MayOklahoma’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, has won Senate confirmation to head the Environmental Protection Agency, a federal agency he repeatedly sued to rein in its reach during the Obama administration.

The vote on Friday was 52-46 as Republican leaders used their party’s narrow Senate majority to push Pruitt’s confirmation despite calls from Democrats to delay the vote until requested emails are released next week.

EPA fears 'unprecedented disaster' for environment over Scott Pruitt pick Read more

As part of a public records lawsuit, a state judge in Oklahoma on Thursday ordered Pruitt to release thousands of emails that he exchanged with oil and gas executives by Tuesday. Pruitt has refused to release the emails for more than two years.

Democrats boycotted a committee vote on Pruitt’s nomination last month, citing his refusal to hand over the emails, and on Friday called on the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to delay Pruitt’s confirmation vote until the nominee turned over the thousands of requested emails from his time as attorney general.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, tried to draw a direct line between Pruitt’s withheld emails and last year’s demands from Donald Trump and congressional Republicans during the presidential campaign.

“Emails! Remember emails?” Schumer asked on the Senate floor. “‘We should get them out!’ they said about Hillary Clinton … If they weren’t worried about them, then why rush?”

To dramatize their cause, Senate Democrats kept the Senate in session through the night with a series of speeches opposing his confirmation. Democrats were still marching to the floor at daybreak.

As Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt filed 14 lawsuits challenging EPA regulations. He joined a multi-state lawsuit opposing the Obama administration’s plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt also sued over the EPA’s recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the Clean Water Act. It has been opposed by industries that would be forced to clean up polluted wastewater.

“There’s a hungry fox guarding the henhouse at our Environmental Protection Agency,” said Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, in a statement. “Pruitt is worse than unqualified – he’s openly hostile to the idea of protecting our environment. The devastating consequences of this appointment may be felt for generations to come.”

Trump has tapped some of the wealthiest Americans to serve in his cabinet, and ethics reviews have slowed the confirmation process. So have Senate Democrats, who have mostly opposed all the nominees and forced hours of debate.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cartoon: Hilary Brown

So far, the Senate has confirmed 14 out of 22 Trump cabinet or cabinet-level picks requiring confirmation.

Pruitt’s nomination was strongly opposed by environmental groups and hundreds of former EPA employees, who predict he would roll back the agency’s environmental enforcement efforts. During his Senate confirmation hearing last month, Pruitt said he disagreed with Trump’s past statements that global warming is a hoax. However, Pruitt has previously cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and manmade carbon emissions are to blame.

The 48-year-old Republican is closely aligned in his home state with oil and gas companies, whose executives have backed his political campaigns. Though Pruitt ran unopposed for a second term in 2014, public campaign finance reports show he raised more than $700,000, much of it from people in the energy and utility industries.

The Center for Media and Democracy filed multiple public records requests for Pruitt’s emails to coal, oil and gas corporations going back to 2015. It sued him last week.

In a hearing on Thursday, Oklahoma district court judge Aletia Haynes Timmons concluded “there really is no reasonable explanation” for why Pruitt’s office had not complied with the request for his emails. Timmons ordered Pruitt to turn over the records by Tuesday and to comply with other open records requests by the group in 2015 and 2016 within 10 days.

Pruitt’s office said about 400 documents were turned over on 10 February, but Timmons said more than 3,000 had been withheld.The Artist and their City, episode 2

The Turner prize-winning sculptor Antony Gormley is known for placing casts of his own naked body around cities. Now in our special Guardian Cities / Tate series, he takes us on an intimate tour inside ‘his’ London, gives us an exclusive peek at new works in his Kings Cross studio … and tells us why he’s scared for London’s futureThe Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has unveiled new energy products aimed at illustrating the benefits of combining his firm, which makes electric cars and batteries, with solar installer SolarCity.



The billionaire entrepreneur showed off solar roof tiles that eliminate the need for traditional panels and a longer-lasting home battery, which Tesla calls the Powerwall, aimed at realising his vision of selling a fossil fuel-free lifestyle to consumers.

“This is sort of the integrated future. An electric car, a Powerwall and a solar roof. The key is it needs to be beautiful, affordable and seamlessly integrated,” Musk said while showcasing the products on homes once used as the set for the US TV drama Desperate Housewives in Los Angeles.

Musk is the biggest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity, which is run by two of his cousins. Analysts have questioned the deal’s proposed synergies, with some suggesting the merger is a way for Tesla to rescue loss-making SolarCity. A vote on the acquisition is due on 17 November.

The rollout of the product, expected as soon as next summer, would be “unwieldy” if the two companies are not combined, Musk said.

Having two separate companies “slows things down, makes them more expensive. It’s worse for shareholders,” he said.

Musk declined to answer a reporter’s question about how Tesla’s balance sheet would accommodate the acquisition of SolarCity.

By incorporating solar modules into rooftops, Tesla is hoping to succeed with a solar technology that to date has had little success. Just this year, Dow Chemical said it would stop selling a solar tile it launched five years ago.

Tesla’s glass solar roof tiles would look far better than any similar product, Musk said. They can be manufactured in a range of styles, which were demonstrated on the rooftops on the set.

Tesla gave little detail on cost, except to say that the cost of the roof would be less than a conventional roof plus solar. The product will appeal to home builders and those looking to replace their roofs, Musk said, adding that the shingles would be more durable and have better insulation qualities than conventional roofing.

SolarCity co-founder Peter Rive, Musk’s cousin, said the solar roofs could easily have a 5% share of the new roof market in a year or two.

Death of Kim Jong-nam: depictions of North Korea hide threat of dictatorship Read more

South Korea’s spy agency said on Wednesday that two women believed to be North Korean operatives poisoned the 45-year-old exile in a shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur international airport.

Kim, who had not yet passed through security, was preparing to take a late-morning flight on Monday from the Malaysian capital to his home in Macau, according to South Korean MPs briefed by security services.

Selangor state’s police chief, Abdul Samah Mat, told the Guardian that Kim Jong-nam arrived in Malaysia on 6 February, a week before he was attacked. “He was travelling on a North Korean passport,” he said. “The postmortem is in progress. It’s up to the pathologists on how long it will take. Sometimes it involves lab tests.”

US government sources also said they believed that Kim Jong-nam was murdered by North Korean assassins.

Japan’s Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed Japanese government official as saying that the two suspected assailants may already be dead, but offered no further details.

The theory that Kim had been targeted by spies from the country he left more than 15 years ago gathered pace after Malaysian officials released CCTV image purporting to show one of the alleged attackers as she waited for a taxi outside the airport shortly after the incident.

The local Malay Mail newspaper published a grainy photo of a woman it said was suspected by police of killing Kim Jong-nam. The image showed a young female, carrying a bag and wearing a white jumper that said “LOL” in large black print across the front. The Guardian has been unable to confirm if the woman is a police suspect.

Kim, whose father was the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, claimed to have no political ambitions, but just weeks after his half-brother’s elevation to the leadership in late 2011 he told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi that the world would view his leadership as a “joke”.

In the same email exchange with Gomi, Kim spoke disparagingly of his younger brother, saying he lacked “any sense of duty or seriousness” and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea’s eventual collapse. Two years earlier, he told Japan’s TV Asahi that he “personally opposed” the hereditary transfer of power in his family.

People with contacts in the north believe Kim Jong-un had long targeted his brother, who reportedly divided his time between Macau, China and Singapore, and enjoyed some level of Chinese protection.

South Korean intelligence officials claimed the regime had been planning his assassination for five years, but did not explain why they thought that was the case.

Kim Jong-nam was once considered the heir apparent to the North Korean leadership but left the country to lead a life in exile after attempting to enter Japan on a forged Dominican Republic passport in 2001 – an incident that caused embarrassment to his father. Kim had told Japanese immigration officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

Jiro Ishimaru, of the Osaka-based Asia Press, said Kim’s murder could only have been ordered by his half-brother, whom he had never met.

“Any criticism of the Kim dynasty is viewed as unforgivable, no matter where it comes from,” Ishimaru told the Guardian. “It’s the worst thing you can say about the regime, and certainly not the kind of comment that the leadership would be able to shrug off, no matter how long ago it was said.

“The only person inside North Korea with the power to decide whether Kim Jong-nam lived or died is Kim Jong-un.”

Mark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul, agreed, saying: “It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un.”

Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who want to depose his brother.

Kim Jong-nam had told airport workers that someone had attacked him “from behind” and sprayed him in the face with an unknown liquid. He died in an ambulance on the way to hospital.

The Guardian view on North Korea: the real cause for concern | Editorial Read more

“He told the receptionist at the departure hall that someone had grabbed his face from behind and splashed some liquid on him,” said Selangor state’s criminal investigation chief, Fadzil Ahmat, according to Malaysia’s The Star newspaper.

“He asked for help and was immediately sent to the airport’s clinic. At this point, he was experiencing headache and was on the verge of passing out. At the clinic, the victim experienced a mild seizure. He was put into an ambulance and was being taken to the Putrajaya hospital when he was pronounced dead.”

Malaysian police confirmed the death of a 45-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang. “Investigation is in progress and a postmortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.

South Korea’s government called an emergency security council meeting and condemned Kim’s death. “If the murder of Kim Jong-nam was confirmed to be committed by the North Korean regime, that would clearly depict the brutality and inhumanity of the Kim Jong-un regime,” the country’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said.

In exile, Kim Jong-nam had largely managed to stay out of the spotlight. He had lived both in mainland China and Macau, and was also spotted in Malaysia. He reportedly fled to Singapore from Macau in 2012, fearing for his life after his brother assumed power, and suspecting that the regime’s agents had discovered where he lived.

It is not clear if he had returned in recent years, but his family – his second wife and their three children – were living in the former Portuguese colony. A South Korean MP claimed Kim also had a wife and son in Beijing.

He was known to travel around Macau without bodyguards, and was occasionally spotted at nightclubs in the Hotel Lisboa, according to a 2007 investigation by the South China Morning Post.

Since becoming leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has sought to tighten his grip on power by ordering the purges and, in some cases, executions of high-level officials he believes represent a threat to the regime. The most high-profile victim was his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, who was executed on several charges, including treason, in 2013.

North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, although details of the incident are shrouded in mystery. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organise a hit-and-run targeting Kim in China in 2010.

Kim reportedly pleaded for his life after another attempt to kill him in 2012, according to South Korean lawmakers who had been briefed by the head of the country’s national intelligence service, Lee Byung-ho.

“According to [Lee] … there was one [assassination] bid in 2012, and Jong-nam in April 2012 sent a letter to Kim Jong-un saying: ‘Please spare me and my family,’” Kim Byung-kee, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters.

Agencies contributed to this reportHello. It’s been a week since we spoke and it has been one long week, hasn’t it?

Some of you wrote to me with claims that you were wary of, things you had read or heard that you wanted fact-checked. That’s what I’m here for. But the sheer number of questions made me think that maybe it would be better to start by sharing some advice on how to verify statements yourselves.

To do this, I’ve written a step-by-step guide to fact-checking just one claim made by Donald Trump during Thursday’s press conference:

There are two Chicagos, as you know. One Chicago that is incredible, luxurious and safe. There is another Chicago that is worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East.

Step 1: Find out if Chicago really is segregated. (Heads up, do this now – it might be harder in the future. Two new Republican bills would stop government money from being used to collect data on racial segregation in the future.)

Is Trump right that the media's terror coverage falls short? Read more

To do this, I’d do a Google image search for “racial segregation by US city” and then I’d research the origins of any map that looks relevant.

The most useful image result is University of Virginia’s “racial dot map”. Read the methodology which says “The map displays 308,745,538 dots, one for each person residing in the United States at the location they were counted during the 2010 Census. Each dot is color-coded by the individual’s race and ethnicity.”



Find Chicago and confirm that the city is indeed segregated (as are many others in the US).

Step 2: Ignore the word “incredible” (that is how my mom describes me when she is deliberately trying to avoid adjectives that can be verified) and find out if one part of Chicago is “luxurious and safe”.

Find crime maps (again, use a Google image search), but ignore crime maps that don’t take into account population (remember, people aren’t evenly distributed throughout a city, so those “crime hotspots” you’re looking at are probably just people hotspots).

Instead, find per capita crime maps. These ones take into account population size by dividing crimes by the total number of people living in a place. Discover that the homicide rate in Chicago does vary a lot by neighborhood but there’s no evidence of “two Chicagos”. It looks as though there are several.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Homicides in Chicago. Photograph: The Trace

Step 3: Set aside (momentarily) the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever to compare one US city to an entire region in the world. Also set aside racist undertones that Middle East is full of Arabs and therefore full of barbarians (and that white Chicago = good and black Chicago = bad).

We’ll still check Trump’s claim that Chicago is worse than most of the Middle East. Find data from the World Bank about the intentional homicide rate in each country. Make sure that you are making comparisons on the same scale (ie the data for Chicago is per 100,000 people, so the World Bank data should also be in the same units. It is.) Discover that as of 2014, there are 10 countries in the world where the intentional homicide rate is over 20 people per 100,000. None of these are countries in the Middle East.

Step 4: So it seems like Trump is right but that seems strange given the ongoing violence in Syria and Iraq. Check definitions to make sure there isn’t some other reason why countries in the Middle East aren’t at the top of the list. The World Bank counts intentional homicides as those “purposely inflicted as a result of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups”. But the definition goes on that “killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded”.

Realize this is why countries like Syria do not appear higher up on the list. Wonder why Trump is comparing homicides in a US city to international war zones.

Step 5: Get historical perspective. Find the most recent data and oldest data you possibly can to see how this has varied over time. Google “historic crime data Chicago”. A study from Yale which looks at crime in Chicago from 1965 to 2013 finds that Chicago is on track to have both the lowest violent crime rate since 1972, and lowest homicide rate since 1967 – but it turns out that study is not recent enough. Between 2015 and 2016, the number of murders increased by 59%, according to the study.

But whenever you hear about a percentage increase, find out what the number was before it increased (maybe there were 10 murders in 2015 and 16 murders in 2016 – that’s a 59% increase but it’s not so bad). It turns out though that there were 762 murders last year, according to the Chicago police department. That seems like a lot, but is it? See the final step ...

Step 6: Get context. Find out if Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country. Search for compiled police data which shows that it doesn’t – Chicago has the 12th highest homicide rate of any US city between 2011 and 2016 (the first three are Detroit, St Louis and New Orleans). Wonder why Trump is repeatedly calling out Chicago and not other cities.

Step 7: Remember that reality is complex. These 916 words don’t fully capture it (and Trump’s 32-word soundbite is further from the truth than Chicago is from the Middle East).



Would you like to see something fact-checked? Send me your questions! mona.chalabi@theguardian.com / @MonaChalabiAt least two people have died after one of California’s strongest storms in years brought torrential rain and flash floods to the state.



More than 100 homes have been evacuated over fears of mud slides near Los Angeles after the pacific storm, dubbed a “bombogenesis” or “weather bomb”, parked itself over southern California, opening sinkholes and cutting power to thousands of people.



More than 300 flights at Los Angeles international airport have also been cancelled or delayed. The storm stretched far out into the ocean and was at its strongest late on Friday afternoon. It is expected to last until Saturday afternoon.

One man was found dead in a submerged vehicle in the desert town of Victorville after several cars were washed down a flooded street, San Bernardino county fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said.

A second man was electrocuted in the Sherman Oaks area of LA when a tree falling in heavy rain downed power lines that hit a car.



Later in the same neighbourhood, a sinkhole swallowed two cars, the second on live TV as viewers watched it teeter on the edge before plunging in. Firefighters rescued one person from the first car, and the driver escaped from the second vehicle before it fell into the hole.



Inland at the Cajon Pass, the shoulder of a road crumbled and sent a parked fire truck spilling over the side, but no one was injured.

In LA’s Sun Valley, 10 cars were trapped in swift-moving water on a road and 15 people had to be rescued. About 150,000 households in the LA area were without electricity, and 180 homes were evacuated in the city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains.

Amtrak cancelled services for much of California’s southern and central coast, and several stretches of road were closed by flooding.



There were several traffic deaths on wet and flooded roads, but it was difficult to determine which were a direct result of the storm.



“The storm looks to be the strongest storm to hit south-west California this season,” the National Weather Service said. “It is likely the strongest within the last six years and possibly even as far back as December 2004 or January 1995.”

Meteorologists call this kind of storm a “weather bomb”, defined as “a rapidly deepening extratropical cyclonic low-pressure area”.

By evening, Ventura county and northern Los Angeles county had recorded 24-hour rain totals of up to 7.5 inches (19cm), with the San Marcos mountain pass in Santa Barbara county receiving nearly 8.5 inches.

Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for WeatherBell Analytics, told the LA Times 10 trillion gallons of rain would fall on California in the next week, enough to fill 15 million Olympic-sized swimming pools or to power Niagara Falls for 154 days.

“It’s crazy,” said Robin Johnson, an academic adviser at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It’s just pouring down rain. The wind is just going nuts.”



The storm also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco, but it was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.

It is part of a series of storms to have hit California recently, after the state suffered from five years of drought.Annette Bening, the star of Mike Mills’s Oscar-nominated 20th Century Women, speaks of her admiration for former president Jimmy Carter, whose ‘crisis of confidence’ speech features in the film, and her belief that his scepticism about materialism has been proved correct.

• 20th Century Women is released in the UK on 10 FebruaryWho will win the title?

Robert Kitson Ireland. Hard to see them folding at home to England on the final weekend with a potential title and Lions tour berths up for grabs.

Paul Rees Ireland have home advantage over injury-hit England and travel to Cardiff where they have lost only three times since 1983 and they were the most impressive European side in the autumn.

Andy Bull Ireland. They improved hugely in the autumn, and all those injuries mean England surely aren’t going to be quite as strong as they were in 2016.

Michael Aylwin Scotland. A long shot, and we’ve been excited about Scotland before. Then disappointed. Again. But confidence is high. England and Ireland also contenders, obviously.

Gerard Meagher England. They comfortably boast the greatest strength in depth and are still improving under Eddie Jones. And if all else fails, Owen Farrell’s goal-kicking will not.

Which will be the key match?

RK Scotland v Ireland in round one. A Scottish victory would make everyone sit bolt upright.

PR Scotland v Ireland and Wales against England on the opening two weekends.

AB Ireland v England in Dublin. Rightly or wrongly, there’s an idea that England have a little of that old arrogance about them. The Irish have been waiting for another shot.

MA Scotland v Ireland. The Scots will need to win this and enjoy underdog status. But will probably then lose at Twickenham. Ireland to beat England in Dublin.

GM Wales v England. Wales will relish being underdogs at home but if England prevail they will take some stopping. Scotland v Ireland is also hugely significant.

Who will be the key player?

RK Alun Wyn Jones. Should Wales struggle under his captaincy, who will lead the Lions this summer?

PR Jonathan Sexton’s fitness will be crucial for Ireland, Nathan Hughes needs to find Billy Vunipola’s boots a comfortable fit and Finn Russell must spark Scotland.

AB Maro Itoje, left. If there is a player who can haul England through this tournament and their transition to a younger team for 2019, it’s him.

MA Finn Russell. The way he failed to win the match against Munster was worrying but thinking on his feet as an underdog will suit him – indeed, render him lethal.

GM Johnny Sexton. If Ireland win without him in Scotland and he is fit thereafter they may just be favourites. Huge roles too for Nathan Hughes and Zander Fagerson.

Where might there be a shock?

RK Wales will have their work cut out against Italy in Rome.

PR Murrayfield, where Ireland and Wales will tread warily.

AB Scotland are stronger now than they’ve been in a long, long while, and are well capable of beating any of the other five sides.

MA This is the annual ‘can Italy win a game?’ question. They might well beat Wales on the opening weekend, but would that be a shock?

GM Scotland will fancy a first win in Paris since 1999, particularly if they beat Ireland. If Wales are not bold in selection and approach in Rome they may come unstuck.

Bonus points will mean …

RK Little initially but a lot more in mid-March.

PR More to losing teams than winners. Italy may benefit from teams getting distracted by the lure of five points before they have secured four.

AB A little more running rugby in the final few minutes, and a lot more confusion about who needs to do what to win on the final weekend.

MA Nothing on the field. They might resolve a tie-break but there’s already a system for that called points difference. Waste of time and energy.

GM Not much. England should get the most but will probably still need to beat Ireland.

Grace Mugabe accused some ruling Zanu-PF party officials of plotting to take over from her husband and said that if he dies supporters should put his name on the ballot to show their love for him.

“If God decides to take him, then we would rather field him as a corpse,” she told thousands of supporters at a rally in Buhera, eastern Zimbabwe. She spoke in the local Shona language.

The president, who will be 93 on Tuesday, has scaled back his public engagements, while his wife, who is 51, has become increasingly visible in politics.

Mugabe has been in power since white minority rule ended in Zimbabwe in 1980 after years of war. A big celebration is planned for him on 25 February.

Grace Mugabe warned associates of her husband from the era of the guerrilla war against white rule that they were also too old to take power.

“Anyone who was with Mugabe in 1980 has no right to tell him he is old. If you want Mugabe to go, then you leave together. You also have to leave. Then we take over because we were not there in 1980,” she said, pointing to herself.

Grace Mugabe has professed fierce loyalty to her husband, previously saying she would get him a wheelchair and push it for him so that he can continue to rule.

Mugabe has declared he wants to live until he is 100 and rule for life, and has complained about ruling party factions jostling for influence as a succession battle looms.Highlights from the 2017 Bafta Awards, which took place at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday night. La La Land, Manchester by the Sea and Lion were all winners on the night, and host Stephen Fry (as well as many of the award recipients) took the opportunity to touch on politics during the course of the showOfficials in Pakistan say they have killed at least 39 suspected militants in a sweeping security crackdown a day after a massive bombing claimed by Islamic State killed 88 people and injured hundreds more at a crowded shrine.

Overnight raids targeting militant hideouts also led to the arrest of 47 suspects, security officials said.

Thursday’s terror attack, the country’s deadliest in years, stunned the nation and raised questions about Pakistani authorities’ ability to rein in militant groups despite several military offensives targeting insurgents.

A suicide bomber detonated the bomb among crowds gathered for the busiest day of the week at the shrine to Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan, a town in the southern Sindh province.

The Pakistani military summoned officials from the Afghan embassy and said it handed Kabul a list of 76 suspected terrorists, demanding immediate action by Afghan authorities and their extradition to Islamabad.

The military did not specify who was on the list, but Islamabad has long claimed that militants are hiding in Afghanistan with the purpose of fomenting violence inside Pakistan.

An Afghan police official said Pakistan had launched an artillery assault in Nangarhar province, eastern Afghanistan, where a self-declared Isis affiliate is based.

On Thursday Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, a Pakistan army spokesman, said acts of terrorism were being carried out “from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan”. Without providing further details, he said: “We shall defend and respond.”

Amaq, a news agency affiliated to Isis, claimed the jihadi group had carried out Thursday’s attack. It was the latest such attack on devotees of Sufism, a mystical and generally moderate form of Islam despised by radical fundamentalists.

“The explosion took place when a large number of people were inside the shrine boundary,” a local police officer said. “A huge number of people come to the shrine every Thursday to take part in ritual dances and prayers. It is not possible to ensure the security of every person coming and going.”



Sughra Bibi, a 45-year-old woman taken to hospital with shrapnel wounds to her stomach, said she was near the front of the crowd watching the devotional dancing when the explosion occurred. “The terrorists are targeting us just because they hate our shrines,” she said. “They attacked another shrine a couple of months ago. But we will never give up our faith.”

Tanveer Ali, a local man whose wife and son were injured, said those responsible had sinned against Islam by targeting civilians. “The terrorists will have to answer for this on the day of judgment,” he said.

Another witness, Raja Somro, inside the shrine at the time of the attack, told a local television network that hundreds of people were performing their spiritual dance called dhamal when the attacker struck at the shrine. “I saw bodies everywhere. I saw bodies of women and children,” he said. Local television channels aired footage of worshippers crying for help after the blast.

On Friday authorities raised the death toll to 88 after some of the critically wounded died. The Sindh provincial health department said a total of 343 people were wounded in the attack. Most were discharged after treatment but 76 are still in hospital, the department said.

Emergency services in Sehwan are basic so some people people were sent for treatment in Hyderabad, 90 miles away.

Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in recent days, including an attack on peaceful protesters in the heart of Lahore, a bombing in Quetta that killed two police officers and an explosion in the frontier city of Peshawar.



Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, issued a statement saying an attack on Sufis was considered a “direct threat”.

A state-run television station quoted Sharif as saying that the country’s military and other security forces would use all their resources to track down and arrest the culprits. The military chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa appealed for calm, telling Pakistanis: “Your security forces shall not allow hostile powers to succeed.”

But, in a strongly worded statement, he vowed: “Each drop of the nation’s blood shall be revenged, and revenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone.”

Isis has claimed a handful of previous attacks in Pakistan, including one on a Sufi shrine in November in Balochistan province. The militant group is not thought to have an extensive organisation in Pakistan, but has forged close ties with local terror franchises including a faction of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a long-established Sunni sectarian outfit.



Isis also claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on police cadets in the city of Quetta last year, thought to have been a joint operation with various jihadi groups.



Two suicide bombings in north-western Pakistan also killed six people, following an almost three-month-long lull in the volatile region. A breakaway Taliban faction claimed responsibility for one of the attacks, according to Associated Press.

Pakistan has waged several offensives against militants in recent years, including a big operation that started in mid-2014 in the last key insurgent sanctuary of North Waziristan. Pakistan declared the offensive a success, saying it had uprooted militants, killed hundreds and forced many to flee across the border into Afghanistan.The annual Oscars luncheon group photo is always an awards-season highlight. It marks the moment when the great and good of the acting world – billions of dollars’ worth of talent – pose for a photo taken at such an unflattering angle that it makes them all look like angry little Borrowers crowding around the foot of your bed ready to eat your face off while you sleep.

As ever, this year’s photo offers fascinating insights into the behaviour of the successful, and several key themes have emerged. Let’s take a closer look.

The year of the funny hands

When you pose with more than 150 other celebrities, it’s easy to get lost in the soup of faces. This year, however, a few renegades have figured out how to claw back some limelight: the wacky hand gesture. Moonlight co-writer Tarell Alvin McCraney (back row, middle) is either spreading out his fingers to demonstrate how many nominations his film received, or he’s such a big-time Timmy Mallett fan that he’s doing the Wacawave for the camera in tribute. Also notable in this category is Kevin O’Connell, standing to the right of the Oscar. Officially the unluckiest nominee in Oscars history – he’s been nominated 21 times in the best sound mixing category without a win – O’Connell still manages a nifty “get a load of this guy” thumb poke. But be warned: the wacky hand gesture has many repercussions. One guy, on the right three rows from the front, is holding up three fingers in such a way that his face is obscured. Poor man. He should know the one true motto of the Oscars nominees class photo: if you live by the wacky gesture, you’ll die by the wacky gesture.

The year of the not quite knowing where the camera is

When you’re as skilled in the art of narcissism as these people, finding a camera should be the easiest thing in the world. And yet look closely enough and you’ll see that this photo is full of missed glances. The bald guy on the far left is staring at an empty chair. The man to Denzel Washington’s immediate right is lost is the sort of reverie you experience only when you get to stand next to Denzel Washington.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Why so sad, Casey Affleck?

The tiny man behind Emma Stone has focused so much on even getting into the photo that he’s forgotten to point his head the right way. And then there’s Casey Affleck, who looks sullen and distraught, as if the thought of eating Chilean sea bass with couscous in the same room as Nicole Kidman has prompted a profound existential crisis . And who can blame him?

The year of not understanding the dress code

Pharrell, look around you. Everyone else has made an effort. Everyone is dressed nicely. I mean, Gianfranco Rosi is wearing a cravat, but that’s about as egregious as it gets. Now, look in a mirror. You’re wearing jeans and a baseball cap and a Nasa sweater. I get that you’re a busy man – I mean, your wife just had triplets – but would it kill you to smarten up a little? You look as if you have to rush out and help your dad lay some concrete for a shed foundation . I know you’ve got nicer hats than this. It’s usually impossible to get you out of the bloody things.

At the time of writing, no publication has managed to identify the man standing second from left three rows back. Or maybe they did, and he murdered them. It’s hard to say. But what’s clear is that he’s found you, and he knows where you live, and he wants his money back. He’d rather not hurt you – there’s no way he’s going back to prison, not after last time – but he won’t be held responsible for his actions if you don’t give him his money back, in its entirety, in a duffel bag, in nonsequential bills. After all, that’s a pretty face you’ve got there, and it’d be a shame if it got messed up somehow.Ryan Lochte is banned from swimming through next June and will forfeit $100,000 in bonus money that went with his gold medal at the Olympics, part of the penalty for his drunken encounter at a gas station in Brazil during last month’s Games.

The US Olympic Committee and USA Swimming announced the penalties on Thursday. Lochte agreed to a ban that will also render him ineligible for world championships next July because he won’t be able to qualify for them at nationals the previous month.

He’ll get no monthly funding from either organization, can’t access USOC training centers, must perform 20 hours of community service and will miss Team USA’s post-Olympics trip to the White House.

Agreeing to four-month suspensions were Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen, who were with Lochte at the gas station. Those sanctions, which end on 31 December, also strip funding and training access and preclude them from the White House visit.

Bentz, 20, will also serve 10 hours of community service for violating a curfew rule for athletes under 21. “As we have said previously, the behavior of these athletes was not acceptable. It unfairly maligned our hosts and diverted attention away from the historic achievements of Team USA,” the USOC CEO Scott Blackmun said. “Each of the athletes has accepted responsibility for his actions and accepted the appropriate sanctions.”

The USOC gives a $25,000 bonus to Olympic gold-medal winners, and USA Swimming has awarded a $75,000 gold-medal bonus at past Olympics.

But that money pales in comparison to what Lochte lost last month when key sponsors, including Speedo USA and Ralph Lauren, abandoned the 32-year-old in the wake of his actions at the gas station, then his rapidly changing accounts of what really happened. Estimates have put the financial hit for those losses at around $1m.

While the near-10-month suspension is four months longer than the one Michael Phelps received in 2014 for his second DUI, his absence from next year’s world championships isn’t considered major, in part because those championships typically attract a lesser field in the year after the Olympics.

Despite his embarrassment, Lochte has maintained a high profile, posting regularly on social media and accepting a spot on the upcoming season of Dancing With The Stars.

Last month, Brazilian police charged Lochte with filing a false robbery report, but Lochte has not said whether he’ll return to Brazil to defend himself.

Lochte’s gold in the 4x200 freestyle relay was one of 121 overall medals the United States won at the Olympics, yet his actions at the gas station overshadowed a large portion of the second half of the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee’s ethics commission is also looking into the incident.

“When Code of Conduct infractions occur, it’s our responsibility to take action that reflects the seriousness of what happened,” USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus said. “Unfortunately, this story line took attention away from the athletes who deserved it the most.”Following Donald Trump’s inauguration, Tom McCarthy will spend time in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, home of the defunct Bethlehem Steel mill and one of only 209 counties across the US to vote for Trump after going for Barack Obama twice.

Yet Texas is poised to propose a similar law in 2017.

Texas federal judge halts Obama protection of transgender health rights Read more

In November, one of the state’s most senior politicians published his top 10 priorities for the next legislative session. A “Women’s Privacy Act” was at number six, right after banning immigration “sanctuary cities” and insisting on photo ID at the ballot box.

The act, said lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, is necessary so that “women and girls” can have “privacy and safety in their restrooms, showers and locker rooms”.

When filed, the bill is likely to turn national attention to Texas in the wake of North Carolina legislators’ failure to repeal their bill during a special session on 21 December. Patrick issued a statement the following day congratulating them.

The so-called bathroom bill in North Carolina includes a provision that requires people to use public bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. Critics have described it as a thinly veiled attack on the transgender community under the guise of protecting public safety.

Patrick hasn’t released his own proposed bill, but has said it would allow businesses to create their own bathroom policies.

Despite the demonstrable negative consequences in states that have passed laws that undermine LGBTQ equality, the coming months will indicate whether the ascent of Donald Trump to the White House is emboldening religious conservatives to press for more such bills after a series of gains for gay and transgender people at the federal level under the Obama administration.

A federal court ruling Saturday may further embolden these efforts. A Texas judge temporarily halted Obama administration rules that are intended to ban discrimination by doctors and hospitals against transgender persons. Joining Texas in the suit were Wisconsin, Kentucky, Nebraska and Kansas.

In August, the same judge sided with 13 Republican-controlled states to block transgender protections in public schools sought by the Obama administration.

‘Something that should be avoided’

So-called “religious freedom” provisions similar to those that caused controversy in Indiana in 2015 are also set to be aired in the Texas statehouse next year.

“I certainly believe that logically thinking people would look to North Carolina and look to Indiana,” said Chuck Smith, chief executive of Equality Texas, an LGBTQ advocacy group.

North Carolina 'bathroom bill' blocking LGBT protections unlikely to see repeal Read more

Such people would see, he said, “the economic consequences that were experienced in those states as a result of filing discriminatory legislation, and a logically thinking person would come to the conclusion that that is something that should be avoided in the state of Texas.”

The state’s chamber of commerce, the Texas Association of Business (TAB), reached that view. It has produced a 23-page report warning of dire economic consequences if the state follows North Carolina’s path by pursuing a policy that would harm tourism, alienate employers and dissuade talented millennials from staying in or moving to Texas.

“If you just look at North Carolina and Indiana and put that over a Texas-sized footprint of our economy, it could be up to $8.5bn and 185,000 jobs lost, it is very dramatic,” said Chris Wallace, the association’s president.

“We want to remain one of the top states in which to do business, so why would we want to do anything to risk any of that, by legislation that’s really unnecessary and unenforceable?

“The question of how you would enforce people going into the right bathroom…What, so you have to take your birth certificate? It gets really tricky.

“We’ve got too many core issues that we need to be worried about in this state – education, transportation, water, many more. Economic development, keeping us strong. We don’t need these types of issues to overshadow our core agenda items.”

Att a Texas Tribune event in November, Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas house of representatives, said he had other, more urgent concerns than the bathroom bill.



Patrick, though, appears unmoved. In a statement earlier this month his office called the TAB report “misinformation and fear-mongering regarding a bill they haven’t even seen”. It also defended the proposal as a way to “assure that sexual predators, like those who exploit the internet, will not be able to freely enter women’s restrooms, locker rooms or showers, and that businesses are not forced by local ordinances to allow men in women’s restrooms and locker rooms”.

Patrick’s spokesperson did not return a Guardian request for comment.

‘We have a friend in the White House’

Sexual assault in any location is, of course, already illegal, while there is no evidence that non-discrimination laws have resulted in increased rates of sexual assault. By contrast, LGBTQ advocates argue that violence and bias against transgender people is a very real problem exacerbated by prejudicial laws.

North Carolina’s HB2 was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost his bid for re-election in November. The backlash saw sports events and concerts cancelled and businesses scrapping investment plans.

Patrick, 66, was a radio talkshow host perhaps best-known for getting an on-air vasectomy until he was elected as lieutenant governor in 2014 on a platform of stopping the “invasion” of undocumented immigrants. He was the Texas state chairman for the Trump presidential campaign.

“Starting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas,” Patrick said in November.

Smith, of Equality Texas, said that Texas’s conservative politicians telegraphed their intentions to introduce more anti-equality legislation long before Trump’s victory.

“I believe we have seen a heightened sense of concern about the possibility of favourable policies being rolled back on a federal level,” he said. “At the state level we already saw the threats that were lying ahead and those haven’t really changed.”

The US supreme court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide in June 2015. That major victory for gay rights appears to have inspired a pushback by conservative Republicans in states.

Mexico's gay couples fight backlash against same-sex marriage Read more

According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 200 “anti-LGBTQ bills” were introduced across the country in 2016 sessions – most failing to pass – and more than 111 million people live in states without clear state-level protections against LGBTQ workplace discrimination.

Smith is also concerned that 2017 will see Texas legislators press for “religious freedom” laws that would, for example, exempt Christian retailers who believe homosexuality is a sin from providing services for gay weddings.

So far there are a handful of Texas bills which advocates consider anti-LGBTQ that have been filed amid the usual slew of pro-gun, pro-God, anti-undocumented immigrant, anti-abortion and anti-federal government proposals up for discussion when the legislative session starts in January.

One would eliminate local non-discrimination ordinances if they have protections that go beyond state law – reminiscent of HB2. Another calls on the state not to enforce federal laws that the Texas legislature deems to violate the state constitution – which since 2005 has defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

A high-profile revision of the law on a parent’s right to know information about their child has raised fears that it could force teachers to out students.Rex Tillerson began his first foreign outing as US secretary of state on Thursday, meeting counterparts from G20 countries in Bonn, but he has left behind in Washington a department that is severely weakened and cut out of key policy decisions.



Since starting the job two weeks ago, Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil executive, has soothed nerves at the state department by consulting widely with regional and country experts, but it has been hard to disguise the gap between the department headquarters at Washington’s Foggy Bottom and the White House where far-reaching foreign policy decisions are being made.

Trump's state department purge sparks worries of 'know-nothing approach' to foreign policy Read more

Senior state department officials who would normally be called to the White House for their views on key policy issues, are not being asked their opinion. They have resorted to asking foreign diplomats, who now have better access to President Trump’s immediate circle of advisers, what new decisions are imminent.

The public voice of the state department has fallen silent. There has not been a daily press briefing, the customary channel for voicing US views and policy on world events, since January.

When he flew to Germany, Tillerson took a small press pool with him but did not give it the opportunity to ask questions. At his first meeting on Thursday with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, journalists were hustled out of the room before Tillerson opened his mouth, according to the Bloomberg news agency, rather than be allowed to stay to record the routine exchange of introductory platitudes. When Tillerson emerged, he delivered a very short statement, but refused to take questions.



The new secretary of state’s aversion to press scrutiny may be inherited from his past job at the head of an exceptionally secretive and hierarchical corporation. But it may also reflect the fact that Tillerson’s department has been cut out of the loop when it comes to key decisions.



Neither he nor his staff were consulted on the executive order imposing a travel ban on refugees and nationals of seven predominantly Muslim countries. A memo strongly dissenting from the policy has been signed by about 1,000 state department employees.

When Trump decided over a dinner to approve a special forces counter-terrorist raid in Yemen, there was no one from the state department present who would normally have highlighted the dangers of civilian casualties from such operations for wider US interests in the region. The raid on 29 January went badly wrong and 25 civilians were killed, including nine children under the age of 13.

Tillerson has had lunch with Trump since taking the job, but he was taken by surprise when the president at the last moment rejected his choice of deputy secretary of state, Elliott Abrams, because Abrams had criticised him during the campaign.

Tillerson had previously assured Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, that he would have a free hand in choosing staff. He has brought a handful of personal aides with him but many of the state department senior staff either resigned or were summarily dismissed days before Tillerson arrived in the building, and there is no list of nominees to replace them. Given the time vetting and congressional confirmation takes, Tillerson is now facing many months of working with a severely depleted team of senior staff.

“What concerns me is that in the absence of any confirmed officials other than the secretary, they will not have the weight to make those educated voices heard as the White House makes policy,” said Thomas Countryman, former assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation and one of the senior staff who was suddenly sacked before Tillerson’s arrival.

“My nagging suspicion is that the White House is very happy to have a vacuum in the under-secretary and assistant secretary levels, not only at state but across government agencies, because it relieves them of even feeling an obligation to consult with experts before they take a new direction.”

In normal times, the state department is a constant part of an inter-agency policymaking process coordinated by the national security council. But the NSC is in crisis and not just because its leader, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign after details of his discussions with the Russian ambassador were revealed.

The NSC itself is being bypassed on key decisions by a small group of highly ideological advisers around Trump led by his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, a former Breitbart News executive with ties to the far right. Bannon has presented his role as one of a deliberate disruptor of the Washington establishment and its normal ways of functioning.

“Even in normal circumstances, it would be difficult for a department to carry weight in an inter-agency debate with no deputy secretary, under-secretaries or assistant secretaries, that have been nominated, much less confirmed,” said Tom Malinowski, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour in the Obama administration. “The building needs internal leadership to be able to exert external leadership, and that always takes a little bit of time. What’s different in this situation is that it’s happening at a moment when the country’s foreign policy is probably more unsettled than at any point in our history.”CCTV shown to jury members depicts officers restraining 32-year-old Thomas Orchard. The church caretaker, who had mental health issues, later suffered a cardiac arrest in his cell. Custody sergeant Jan Kingshott, 45, and civilian detention officers Simon Tansley, 39, and Michael Marsden, 56, deny Orchard’s manslaughter, who was arrested following a disturbance in Exeter city centre

Six Nations: 1st

Eddie Jones followed Joe Schmidt and Warren Gatland in winning the Six Nations at the first attempt and England then got better. England did what they had to in the championship and little more. Jones had little time with his players before the tournament but they were impressive in defence and attack in defeating Australia 3-0 and won their four autumn internationals comfortably by double-figure margins to leave them unbeaten in 2016 and second in the world rankings, averaging more than 30 points a match.

Injuries will test them at the start of the Six Nations, with the Vunipola brothers out along with Chris Robshaw. James Haskell, George Kruis and Dylan Hartley have played little or no rugby this year, which suggests England may be undercooked against France. Without the Vunipolas, England will have to find other means of getting over the gainline: Jones operated without a powerful midfielder last year but has Ben Te’o to call on should he need a tactical adjustment. Strength over the ball should not be an issue, despite the players missing. The champions will be strong in the set piece and they look the most flexible of the six teams.

2016 record: P10 W4 L6

Six Nations: 5th

France’s final match last year was a five-point defeat to New Zealand, although at one point in the second half they trailed 24-9. They tightened up defensively in the second half of 2016, but they do not score enough points to beat the top sides, reaching 25 only once against a tier one side, in Argentina in the summer.

That makes the loss of the centre Wesley Fofana, their most creative midfielder, all the more acute: he has been replaced in the squad by a rather different centre, Mathieu Bastereaud, although Guy Novès has Gaël Fickou in reserve.

Novès, who took over after the 2015 World Cup, has used defence as his starting point wanting a foundation laid before resurrecting French flair. He has a choice to make at scrum-half, where Baptiste Serin is pushing Maxime Machenaud, if not at fly-half, a problem position for France this decade. They have power at forward and the ability to counterattack but this French revolution is gradual and a first top-half finish since 2011 would represent success.

Six Nations: 3rd

Ireland had a two-tone 2016: a disappointing defence of their Six Nations title was followed by a narrow series defeat against South Africa after winning the first Test with 14 men and an historic victory over New Zealand in Chicago which not only ended the All Blacks’ long winning streak but was the first time they had won the fixture.

They ended the year, after the World Cup holders exacted revenge in a tight, tense return in Dublin, by beating Australia, becoming the first European nation to defeat the southern hemisphere’s big three since England in 2003.

Ireland have, under their New Zealand coach Joe Schmidt, generally avoided risk but as 2016 went on they offloaded more in a gameplan that was not quite as prescriptive. If they are not going the way of England, where the emphasis is on player responsibility, a slightly looser rein has made them more dangerous but they need Jonathan Sexton, the master of tactical kicking, to overcome the calf problem that rules him out of the opening game.

Italy

2016 record: P10 W4 L6

Average points v Tier One: 16.7

Six Nations: 6th

Another new era for Italy with Conor O’Shea at the helm assisted by Mike Catt and Brendan Venter. Since joining the Six Nations in 2000, they have won 12 matches and lost 72. Much, as ever, will fall on their No8 and captain, Sergio Parisse, and, as their scoring record shows, they are the team in the championship least suited to the faster pace of the international game.

The forecast of showers in Rome may increase the number of set pieces against Wales but O’Shea tried a new combination at half-back in the autumn in Carlo Canna and Giorgio Bronzini – the latter was playing domestic league rugby a year ago – and there will be a tactical shift in the coming years. Their task is to be competitive for longer than the first round and keep players motivated – O’Shea’s forte.

2016 record: P10 W6 L4

Average points v tier one nations: 21.9

Six Nations: 4th

Since winning the last Five Nations in 1999, Scotland have had only three top-half finishes in the Six Nations and reached no higher than third in the table. There is cautious optimism with visible signs of progress under Vern Cotter last year: more tries and points were scored, another narrow, late defeat to Australia was followed by victory over Argentina and there is competition for places in a number of positions, most notably the midfield, second row and back row.

In 2014, Scotland scored 47 points in the Six Nations, 38 of them against Italy and France, and scored only four tries. The latter total rose to 11 last year, the first time they had reached double figures since Italy’s inclusion in the tournament. The manner in which Glasgow qualified for the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup for the first time has provided a pre-tournament bounce. A relative lack of experience and power make them unlikely title contenders but they have the capacity to shock.

Wales

2016 record: P13 W6 D1 L6

Average points v tier one nations: 24.2

Six Nations: 2nd

Wales won three of their four autumn internationals, their best return in the series, but won few plaudits from supporters and pundits. Under the interim coach, Rob Howley, they are moving away from the formula that won them the title in 2012 and 2013 when their threat was physical and aerial, recognising that victory against a tier one nation is statistically unlikely now without scoring 25-30 points.

Wales got into the 30s only against Italy last year (Japan are tier two) while conceding 30 points or more four times. Howley named seven new caps in his squad and, if he is likely to start with the tried and tested against Italy in Rome, the return of Rhys Webb at scrum-half will add impetus.

It is at fly-half where a selection dilemma may come. Dan Biggar, who stood out in the World Cup when Wales were still in direct mode, is being challenged by Sam Davies who likes to stand flat and attack the line. Biggar prefers to lie deeper. Will the attack coach Alex King – whose time at Northampton where they played a deep-lying 10 in Stephen Myler – ended early, coax Biggar into providing more of an attacking threat?

Luke Charteris, with a broken bone in a hand, and Taulupe Faletau, will not play against Italy on Sunday.

Key man George NorthWe’re 15 minutes into the Monday morning class at Hot 8 Yoga in Beverly Hills. Francesca Asumah, one of the most sought-after instructors in California, is putting 48 perspiring humans through a sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises popularised by the celebrity yogi Bikram Choudhury. The temperature is a sapping 40C. Sweat slicks over yoga mats. Beautiful bodies melt into shapes that seem beyond the realm of ordinary human geometry.

Asumah’s class, titled A Dance With The Ancients, falls somewhere between gym session and sermon. “You must learn to love yourself, guys!” she encourages us in a northern English accent (she’s half-Ghanaian, half-English, and from Manchester). “If everyone loves themselves, then the whole world will be loved. And beware false gurus! Gurus are middlemen. We are all born in the temple. If anyone claims to be your guru, run a mile, people!”

The message has a special charge in this room. This is the home of what the yogis in my class call “the Bikram community-in-exile”: people who used to be at the heart of the movement, and who say they suffered horrendous abuse in their pursuit of yogic enlightenment. Sweating next to me is Minakshi “Micki” Jafa-Bodden, 48, former legal adviser for the Bikram yoga company. She wants me to appreciate the hold that these poses have before she will talk any further: “You can’t understand me unless you understand Bikram yoga.” And it’s just as well Jafa-Bodden remains devoted to the 26 poses: last month, Los Angeles county court gave her control of the entire global empire.

***

If you’re not up on your chakras and pranayamas, you could be forgiven for thinking that “Bikram” is a term for a kind of hot yoga performed by celebrities and Hollywood types in unsanitary conditions. It is that: Andy Murray credits it with helping his “fitness and mental strength”; Serena Williams and David Beckham are said to be fans. But it is also a sequence of moves that takes its trademarked name from one man. At his early 2010s peak, the pony-tailed, waxed-chested image of Bikram Choudhury adorned the walls of around 650 licensed Bikram yoga studios across the world. For many, he was a spiritual leader as well as the inventor of an exercise class.

Little is known of Choudhury’s early life. Born in Kolkata in 1946, he claimed to have been invited to America by Richard Nixon, and to have taught yoga to the Beatles and Nasa astronauts. He once told a class that he invented the disco ball.

What is certain is that his yoga gave his students something they found life-changing. Asumah first went to a Bikram-affiliated studio in London in 2000. “I immediately saw the benefit of it,” she says. “At a normal yoga class, you do whatever poses the teacher feels like teaching you. Our form of yoga is different. I’m 64. My quality of life is so joyful and I know it’s because of the yoga.” She believes the 26 poses contain a “sacred geometry” that has been handed down from “the ancients”. Choudhury also claimed his form of yoga was more rigorous and authentic than westernised forms preaching peace and love.

Choudhury first set up a studio in a basement in Beverly Hills. From the mid-1970s onwards, he drew in a celebrity clientele, including Michael Jackson, Jeff Bridges, Shirley MacLaine, Barbra Streisand and Raquel Welch. His classes, heated to a regulation 40C (designed to mimic conditions in Kolkata), offered a combination of constructive hazing, cosmic wisdom and pantomime eccentricity. He would wear Speedos and issue bizarre commands; in 2011, a writer for GQ magazine went to a class and reported him telling a student, “You, Miss Teeny-Weeny Bikini! Spread your legs!” He loathed the colour green and banned people from wearing it. He had never seen carpet until he arrived in America, and believing it represented the height of luxury had all his studios carpeted, hygiene be damned.

Initially, Choudhury asked for donations and slept on the floor of his studio; but as his celebrity grew, so did his material demands. He claimed he had trademarked his sequence and filed aggressive lawsuits to prevent former students from adapting his 26 moves (including a suit accusing Raquel Welch of stealing his sequence for her exercise book). In 2012, a California federal judge dismissed Choudhury’s attempt to trademark his sequence, ruling that a series of yoga poses cannot be copyrighted. As a New York studio owner, Greg Gumucio, whom Choudhury tried to shut down, told ABC news: “It’s kind of like if Arnold Schwarzenegger said, ‘I’m going to do five bench presses, six curls, seven squats, call it Arnold’s Work, and nobody can show that or teach that without my permission.’”

Choudhury’s most reliable stream of revenue was his twice-yearly teacher-training sessions, where up to 400 students would pay around £10,000 to undergo nine weeks of intensive yoga to become certified Bikram instructors. These earned Choudhury a personal fortune estimated at $75m, including a fleet of 43 luxury cars.

I saw it as my forever job. It allowed me to combine my love of yoga with the legal and business side

Benjamin Lorr, who wrote a book-length study of Choudhury called Hell-Bent in 2012, attended a training course in Las Vegas in 2009 and found himself drawn to Choudhury, despite describing him as “clearly a buffoon”. By the third evening, Choudhury had told the class that he launched Michael Jackson’s career, cured Janet Reno’s Parkinson’s disease, was once best friends with Elvis, and had experienced “72 hours of marathon sex, where my partner has 49 orgasms. I count.” (He married his wife Rajashree, herself a certified Bikram instructor, in 1984.)

But for Lorr, Choudhury’s ridiculousness only added to his charisma. He had the quality of being present in the moment. “You see it with Donald Trump, too – it’s this unscripted responsiveness,” Lorr tells me. “Bikram has an incredible ability to zoom in on specific people, combined with an ability to act as if he’s being true to himself.” And then there’s what Lorr calls the “volume game”. “When there are 380 people in a room cheering, you begin to wonder: ‘Why am I the only who’s sitting out of this?’ So you find yourself clapping and cheering, despite the fact that what he just said was moronic, or homophobic, or racist, or offensive.”

It was at these training camps – held in large hotel resorts – that Choudhury’s worst alleged abuses took place; there are now six separate suits working their way through the California courts, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. Jafa-Bodden is so far the only woman who has managed to defeat Choudhury in court: last month, a Los Angeles county jury awarded her a total of $6.8m in damages for a range of charges including unlawful dismissal and sexual harassment.

But recovering her damages has not been easy. Choudhury has since fled to India; his fleet of cars has vanished. When cornered by a TV journalist from HBO’s Real Sports at a teacher-training camp near Mumbai last October, Choudhury insulted his accusers and claimed that 5,000 women a day would line up to have sex with him: “Why do I have to harass women? People spend $1m for one drop of my sperm. Are you that dumb to believe those trash?” he said on camera. He also boasted that “this yoga is worse than cocaine. You can get rid of cocaine, but once you’re used to this yoga, you can’t stop.”

Back in March 2011, when Jafa-Bodden first stepped into Choudhury’s Beverly Hills HQ, she was convinced she had just landed her dream job. She was born in Assam, India, received her legal training in Britain, and had spent her career moving between Europe, India and the Caribbean, working in international litigation. She was introduced to Choudhury by his Indian lawyer, Som Mandal. Choudhury insisted that she start right away, and he and Rajashree helped her with her immigration papers, going so far as to choose (and furnish) a flat for her.

As a single mother with a six-year-old daughter, it seemed the perfect opportunity. “I saw it as my forever job,” Jafa-Bodden recalls. “It allowed me to combine my love of yoga and spirituality with the legal and business side of things. I was ready to take on a bigger role, and I also thought I was coming to work for a family-oriented company.”

Jafa-Bodden has the supple movements and clear complexion that comes from taking three or four hot yoga classes a week. She combines a disarming friendliness with a lawyer’s caution. She insists on meeting me twice before she will answer my questions: once for afternoon tea, once for yoga. When I am finally granted a formal interview at her attorneys’ offices in Santa Monica, she welcomes me wearing a camouflage jacket with the words “TRUST THE UNIVERSE” spelled in diamante on the back.

Her first inkling that something wasn’t right came when Choudhury and Rajashree invited her to their mansion in Beverly Hills a couple of days after she took up her position. “It was like the lair of a Bollywood villain. It was very showy and elaborate, not quite what I was expecting from a yoga guru.” Still, she says, he was on his best behaviour. “I’ve dealt with high-net-worth individuals in all sorts of countries, and my read on Bikram was just that he was eccentric.”

Meanwhile, in her day job, she found “operational dysfunction: a total co-mingling of personal and corporate assets”. Choudhury had a tendency not to settle his hotels bills, so her first task was to fight Marriott hotels over an unpaid sum of $1.8m. Choudhury also liked to use the company account as a personal credit card. But initially Jafa-Bodden saw this as an opportunity; she felt she had the necessary expertise to straighten out the business. It was only when a lawsuit from a former trainee named Pandhora Williams landed on her desk that she realised the extent of her problems.

***

The Bikram teacher-training courses centre on two mass 90-minute hot yoga sessions a day interspersed with anatomy seminars, spiritual lectures and rote learning of 45 pages of copyrighted Bikram dialogue. Choudhury likes to conduct the evening class from a throne with one attendant typically brushing his hair and another massaging his legs. Francesca Asumah attended a course in spring 2002. “He walked in and everybody started jumping around and cheering,” she recalls. “Because I’m English, and we don’t really do cults, I didn’t really understand what was going on. But everybody was worshipping him.”

She was 49, and believes her “difficult” attitude led to her being shunned by Choudhury’s inner circle; the typical attendees were aged 22 to 35 and seemed more impressionable. “There were a lot of really beautiful bodies, all dressed in tight shorts and bikinis.”

In the evenings, Choudhury would invite his favourites to watch Bollywood movies with him. Anyone who fell asleep would be woken up; the ordeal would often go on until 3am. The first yoga session of the next day was 8am, and was often accompanied by vomiting, fainting and weeping. Nonetheless, despite the hardships, most students agreed it was worth it. “There were a few people who would exchange looks and raise their eyebrows,” Asumah says. “But you’d spent your £10,000. And the yoga’s good. And you’d just try to bear what you can.”

The case that landed on Jafa-Bodden’s desk in May 2011, the suit from Pandhora Williams, related to a training session at the Town and Country Resort in San Diego the previous autumn. Williams’ lawyers alleged that Choudhury had invited the class to lie down in savasana (corpse pose) whereupon he launched into a homophobic rant, announcing that all gay people should be put on an island and “left to die of Aids”. After the class, Williams had asked, “Bikram, why are you preaching hate? Yoga is supposed to be about love.” She alleges that he replied, “We don’t sell love here, bitch,” then told an assistant, “Get that black bitch out of here. She’s a cancer.” Williams was ejected from the course – and Choudhury refused to refund her $10,900 fee. So she sued for racial discrimination.

“I realised that if half of this was true, we were facing a very serious situation,” Jafa-Bodden tells me now. She conducted internal investigations and challenged Choudhury on his behaviour. She found him unremorseful. “He would pick on someone in the crowd. If someone got up to go to the toilet, he would say, ‘Where are you going? To change your tampon?’ He uses profanities, he’s antisemitic, he’s homophobic. He’ll say things like, ‘Blacks don’t get my yoga.’ And once he starts on his tirade of profanity, he doesn’t stop. Once he’s picked on you, then you’ve had it for the entire class.”

Why did no one stand up to him? “There’s very little you can do. He’s up there on a podium, he’s miked up, and it’s really hot.” Many trainees feared losing the thousands of dollars they had already spent on the fees. “Their livelihood depends on putting up with it. The problem was that Bikram had set things up in such a way that, without his continued patronage, you can’t teach anywhere else. So some of his victims would come back to his training and just try to take precautions.”

Once people have bought into any cult, there’s no rational way you can change their minds

Further allegations followed. Jafa-Bodden was required to read the manuscript of Lorr’s book Hell-Bent for libel, but found nothing actionable. The book’s allegations of sexual impropriety opened the floodgates. “Once people have bought into any cult, there’s no rational way you can change their minds – it has to be an emotional change,” Lorr tells me. “It was only when people started to see how much hurt he had caused that they began to change their minds.”

In 2013, a series of rape allegations were made. A former student, Sarah Baughn, claimed that Choudhury had sexually assaulted her at a 2008 training camp, pleading, “I am dying. I can feel myself dying. I will not be alive if someone doesn’t save me.” A Canadian student, Jill Lawler, sued Choudhury for a litany of charges, including sexual assault, gender discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual battery; she was 18 when the alleged crimes took place. Another student, Maggie Genthner, alleged that he raped her twice, forcing her legs into yoga postures and laughing at her.

Jafa-Bodden says she repeatedly challenged Choudhury on his behaviour, but he simply expected her to make the allegations go away. “At the outset, he expected me to be submissive,” she says. “He told me he was a god who could do whatever he wanted and that I was ‘stupid and too westernised’.”

Jafa-Bodden claims that, on one occasion, Choudhury held a meeting in his presidential suite and encouraged her to join him in bed. “He would tell me to go and ‘shut up’ the witnesses,” Jafa-Bodden says. “One woman sent a Facebook message saying that Bikram had tried to put his penis in her mouth – a horrific allegation. I went to Bikram and said, ‘What is this?’ And he said, ‘I thought we’d taken care of that bitch in Hawaii.’” After she told him he wasn’t allowed to bring trainees to his bedroom, he mocked her in front of a class: “He stood up on his podium and said: ‘My lawyer tells me I can’t have a girl in my room. So I’m now going to have two!’”

Jafa-Bodden became depressed, which she says has led to ongoing problems with anxiety. “My entire life revolved around Bikram and his yoga. It was like living in a parallel universe,” she says. She considered leaving the country, but was trapped. “I never received my pay cheque on time or for the full amount agreed. I was dependent on Bikram for everything, including my work visa, my apartment, my car. My cellphone was connected to his and my every move was monitored. It would have been very risky to flee without a well-thought-out exit strategy. He would say they’d revoke my green card, so I’d be deported back to India.”

Finally, in February 2013, she was subpoenaed to testify in the Williams case, which sent Choudhury “crazy”. “He said ominously, ‘Well, we’ll just tell them we don’t know where you are.’ I was so frightened.” The next month, he terminated her contract. With no car and little money, she moved with her daughter to a guesthouse until she was able to find a small one-bedroom apartment.

Jafa-Bodden eventually turned to her former adversary, Carla Minnard, the Californian attorney who had subpoenaed her in the Williams lawsuit. “My motto is, where there is darkness let there be light,” Jafa-Bodden says now. “I feel I have to show my daughter that you have to fight through the fear.” She sued Choudhury for unfair dismissal and sexual harassment.

An Irish former employee, Sharon Clerkin (herself allegedly dismissed for becoming pregnant), testified at Jafa-Bodden’s trial that Choudhury continued to demean women at teacher training, calling them “bitches” and boasting about allegations that were then surfacing on social media (“it’s good for business”).

The jury unanimously ruled that Jafa-Bodden had been subject to sexual harassment, nonpayment of wages, wrongful dismissal and a number of further charges. In December, with Choudhury refusing to return to the US, the judge ordered that the income from his studio franchises and his intellectual property be handed over to Jafa-Bodden. Last month, she filed a separate suit against Rajashree, who divorced Choudhury in 2016 and remains in the Beverly Hills mansion. (At the time of the divorce, it was ruled that she wasn’t required to pay damages in any pending or future cases; Jafa-Bodden and her lawyers are challenging that verdict.)

Choudhury continues to advertise training camps outside the US. A session in Acapulco is priced at about £10,000

To date, there have been no criminal charges brought against Choudhury; all the women are pursuing civil cases. Choudhury denied all of Pandhora Williams’ claims before they settled out of court in May 2013, and has dismissed the other allegations as “lies lies lies”. However, he has repeatedly refused to return to the US; last month he violated a court order to complete a video deposition in the Clerkin case. A few weeks later, his attorney in that case quit, saying Choudhury was no longer cooperating or paying his bills.

Responding to a Guardian request for comment, Bikram’s Indian lawyer, Som Mandal, last week denied all the allegations. He said that Bikram had hired new lawyers and would be appealing the verdict in the Jafa-Bodden case.

For her part, Jafa-Bodden says she is less interested in the money than in seeing justice done: “It’s about accountability.” Meanwhile, many Bikram studio owners are removing photographs of Choudhury and distancing themselves from their former guru. There are around 30 yoga studios that carry the Bikram name in the UK, and many are rebranding: Bikram Yoga North, West, City and Primrose Hill in London now go under the name Fierce Grace.

Outside the US, Choudhury continues to advertise training camps: his next teacher-training session in Acapulco, Mexico, this April is again priced at about £10,000. “That’s so concerning for us,” Jafa-Bodden says. “Innocent and impressionable young trainees might be going to these camps in jurisdictions where there may not be as many protections.”

You’d understand it if Jafa-Bodden never wanted to step inside another yoga studio again, but she remains devoted to the series of 26 poses. “It must seem mystifying to someone who is not into Bikram yoga,” she laughs, “but I do actually think yoga is the answer.” She credits Asumah with seeing her through her worst moments.

Asumah herself has every reason to leave yoga behind. Her first husband died of a heart attack after taking a yoga class in Ibiza, and she blames Choudhury for the failure of her second marriage. Yet she has forgiven him. “If you spoke to me when I was in the depths of hurt, I’d have spoken differently. But he didn’t make me bitter. The highest form of love is forgiving the unforgivable.”

All of which leaves Jafa-Bodden with a dilemma. She is effectively president of Bikram Inc. But there is a serious issue with the name: in the process of de-Bikramisation, she wants to separate the yoga from the man who created it – not so easy when it’s a brand known the world over (most devotees don’t make the connection with the megalomaniac in Speedos). And she still remains devoted to the Bikram community. Can she rebuild the business as something new? As Asumah says, “Sometimes you get a rotten branch, and you have to cut it off, but it doesn’t mean the whole tree’s gone.”404

Please follow one of the links below to continue exploring.It was not a question of race, insisted Grammys boss Neil Portnow, in the wake of the furore surrounding Adele’s victory over Beyoncé for the album of the year award – the top prize – at this year’s awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. “I don’t think there’s a race problem at all,” Portnow told Pitchork. “We don’t, as musicians, listen to music based on gender or race or ethnicity.”

Portnow’s problem is that a lot of people aren’t convinced by his argument that the 14,000 voting members of the Recording Academy “almost put a blindfold on” when they listen to the nominated albums. Adele did not seem convinced in her acceptance speech on Sunday night when she said: “I can’t possibly accept this award,” before addressing Beyoncé directly. “You are our light. And the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering.”

Sufjan Stevens didn’t seem convinced when he wrote that that the “urban contemporary album” category in which Lemonade won is “where the white man puts the incomparable pregnant black woman because he is so threatened by her talent, power, persuasion and potential”. St Vincent did not seem convinced by the snub when she agreed with him. Solange – Beyoncé’s sister and a Grammy-winner in her own right – did not seem convinced when she hastily tweeted then deleted: “Create your own committees, build your own institutions, give your friends awards, award yourself, and be the gold you wanna hold, my Gs.” Frank Ocean did not seem convinced when he addressed the Grammy producers on Tumblr: “You know what’s really not ‘great TV’ guys? 1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp a Butterfly … If you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it.”

One year, one overlooked album – that might not be a problem. The issue for the Grammys is that in an era when R&B and hip-hop have been going through a period of massive creativity – matched by huge commercial success – the album of the year prize at the Grammys has been going to white artists. The last black winnner was Herbie Hancock, for River: The Joni Letters in 2008. Since then, Taylor Swift has won twice (for Fearless in 2010 and 1989 in 2016), as has Adele (for 21 in 2012 and 25 this year). Meanwhile, black artists have been shortlisted, but lost out: Beyoncé alone has been in the final five three times since 2010 without winning. Kendrick Lamar has had two shortlisted albums without winning. Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, Pharrell Williams have all been shortlisted without winning. Kanye West has not even been shortlisted since Graduation in 2008, and Drake has been shortlisted just once, for Views, this year.

It is not as if these are marginal acts being passed over for something more mainstream; that list of names contains many of the main drivers of popular culture. They are hit artists, the most-talked about artists of the moment. Are they really not as good as Mumford & Sons (2013 winners), Arcade Fire (2011 winners), Beck (2015 winner) or Robert Plant & Alison Krauss (2009 winners)?

But there is nothing new here. The Grammys have always had a problem with the album of the year award. Looking down a list of winners often has you wondering what on earth the voters were thinking, even when the winner was black (was Natalie Cole’s Unforgettable … With Love really the best album of 1992?). There was a period in the mid-70s when album of the year was, more or less, the Stevie Wonder award, as he won it three years out of four between 1974 and 1977, but equally there have been years when the winning album (and the entire shortlist) have ignored not just black music, but a whole load of other great music, too. So, in recognition of the fact that the Grammys have long been both #grammyssowhite and #grammyssocrap, here are some of the least memorable years for the album of the year winner in Grammy history.

1970

Winner: Blood, Sweat & Tears by Blood, Sweat & Tears

The album of the year prize ignored rock, soul and R&B until 1968, when Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band won. It was back to the soft pop of Glen Campbell the following year, and then in 1970 Blood, Sweat & Tears won. It is not that their second album is bad; it was a huge critical and commercial success, and their fusion of classical, rock and jazz styles was groundbreaking. It is more that when you look back at what else was happening, you would be hard picked to call this an album that defined the previous year.

Black artists who were overlooked …

• The Temptations: Cloud Nine

The soul harmony quintet were at their psychedelic soul peak with Cloud Nine, whose opening side – Cloud Nine, into I Heard It Through the Grapevine into Runaway Child, Running Wild – is one of the great achievements of Motown.

• Sly and the Family Stone: Stand!

A huge hit album that contained three of the Family Stone’s greatest pop hits – the title track, I Want to Take You Higher and Everyday People – as well as the discombobulating Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey, was passsed over for the shortlist for album of the year.

• Isaac Hayes – Hot Buttered Soul

A US No 8 hit, Hot Buttered Soul set a template for soul as the 70s dawned: lubricious, ambitious and luxurious. Hayes stretched out on epic versions of Walk on By and By the Time I Get to Phoenix, and created the soul loverman. A landmark in soul. Hayes did get an album of the year nomination in 1972 for Shaft.

1973

Winner: The Concert for Bangladesh by George Harrison and Friends



Pop’s capacity for backslapping on the rare occasions it manages to do A Good Thing manifested itself in this live recording of Harrison’s charity show winning the album of the year prize. This is rarely an album dug out when one fancies hearing a former Beatle.

Black artists who were overlooked …



• The O’Jays: Back Stabbers

Two brilliant, massive singles – the title track and Love Train – and a top 10 album were not enough to draw the attention of the Recording Academy, even if Back Stabbers was the pinnacle of the Philly soul sound.

• Aretha Franklin: Young, Gifted and Black

Aretha Franklin has won the Grammy for best female R&B vocal performance 11 times, but has never even been nominated for album of the year. That’s despite the fact that in the late 60s and early 70s, on Atlantic, she produced arguably the greatest run of soul albums ever: this is one without a single track you would skip.

• Curtis Mayfield: Super Fly

A film soundtrack that overshadowed its parent film, Super Fly was a huge creative breakthrough for Mayfield, and a critical and commercial smash: a soul concept album that stood up in its own right, with impassioned commentary on the state of black America.

1980

Winner: 52nd Street by Billy Joel



There’s nothing wrong with 52nd Street – it’s got My Life on it, and who doesn’t like My Life? – but when you look at what was missed out that year, you realise that this was the Grammys at their very safest.

• Chic: Risqué

The year being rewarded, 1979, had been the Chic Organisation’s annus mirabilis. The third Chic album opened with Good Times, the song that to this day defines the sound of disco, but that was only the start of Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers’s achievements that year …

• Sister Sledge: We Are Family

Chic also took the reins of the soul trio, producing what Rodgers believes to be “our best album, hands down”. And who is to argue, given it contained He’s the Greatest Dancer and Lost in Music, as well as the title track?

• Michael Jackson: Off the Wall

As if missing the previous two was not bad enough, the Grammys also ignored what was, arguably, Michael Jackson’s greatest album (Thriller would win in 1984). The only disco record to get an album of the year nomination in this, the genre’s golden year, was Donna Summer’s Bad Girls. Though there was room on the shortlist for both Minute by Minute by the Doobie Brothers and The Gambler by Kenny Rogers. Just not Off the Wall. Or Risqué. Or We Are Family. For shame.

The Grammys also missed …

The Clash: London Calling, Neil Young: Rust Never Sleeps. Abba: Voulez Vous

1981

Winner: Christopher Cross by Christopher Cross



As the aftershocks of punk echoed through music, as hard rock enjoyed a massive resurgence, as disco started to give way to hip-hop, the Recording Academy decided that the best album of 1980 had been a soft rock record of unimpeachable craftsmanship (if you count John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s Double Fantasy as soft rock, we are in the midst of a four-year run of soft rock winners).

Black artists who were overlooked …

• Diana Ross: Diana

The Chic Organisation were back, this time steering Diana Ross to make what was probably her best solo album, led by a pair of hits – Upside Down and I’m Coming Out – that were as good as anything she ever recorded.

• Teddy Prendergrass: TP

The leading male R&B singer of his era had been passed over the previous year for Teddy, and the pattern was repeated with TP. Never mind that it was a platinum album, that Prendergrass was at the peak of his powers, and that Love TKO was one of the great Philly singles.

• The Jacksons: Triumph

Well, if you’re going to disregard Off the Wall, you may as well disregard what was to all intents and purposes its successor, too. Michael Jackson, at the top of his game, did most of the lead singing and writing on Triumph, another platinum album. Incredibly, the brilliant opener Can You Feel It peaked at No 77 in the US.

The Grammys also missed

Pink Floyd: The Wall, AC/DC: Back in Black, David Bowie: Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)

1986

Winner: No Jacket Required by Phil Collins

After a two-year break for Thriller and Lionel Richie’s Can’t Slow Down, the soft rock supremacy returned with No Jacket Required. It’s not a bad album – none of these winners is – but there were some issues with what was missed.

Black artists who were overlooked …

• Prince: Around the World in a Day

Prince’s 1999 had been nominated for album of the year in 1985, but lost out to Can’t Slow Down. Prince was also nominated for Sign o’ the Times in 1988 but incredibly never won album of the year.

• Whitney Houston: Whitney Houston

Never mind that voice, or those three US No 1 singles: the multi-platinum debut album by a singer who redefined female pop-soul and R&B singing, and who became the biggest star of her generation, crossing race boundaries and appealing to young and old, black and white, was no match for No Jacket Required. Though nominated in three categories at the 1986 Grammys, Houston won only one, for best pop vocal performance (for Saving All My Love for You).

• Luther Vandross: The Night I Feel In Love

The mid-to-late 80s were the heyday of the smooth, sophisticated male soul star; as well as Vandross, Alexander O’Neal was an international star, and Freddie Jackson’s debut album was a monster US hit in 1985. At this point, it may not come as a surprise that none of the smooth, sophisticated male soul stars were ever nominated for album of the year.

The Grammys also missed …

Kate Bush: Hounds of Love, Tom Waits: Rain Dogs and Talking Heads: Little Creatures

1993

Winner: MTV Unplugged by Eric Clapton

There is a case for saying that no awards ceremony that preaches diversity should ever reward Eric Clapton, who – despite being given multiple opportunities to do so – has never seen fit to apologise for or backtrack from his notorious onstage pronouncement in 1976 that “Enoch was right”. Yet he was rewarded for an album of acoustic rerecordings of old tracks in one of hip-hop’s great years.

Black artists who were overlooked …

• Michael Jackson: Dangerous

It dealt with the kind of platitudinous big themes that often get rewarded (Black or White, Heal the World), it took Jackson into new jack swing, it sold a bazillion copies, but Dangerous did not even get a nomination. Bad had been nominated, in 1988, but Thriller was to be the only album of the year award Jackson ever won.

• Arrested Development: 3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of …

A landmark in conscious hip-hop that managed to be infectiously enjoyable, intriguingly weird and joyously danceable – as well as being one of the first statements that southern hip-hop was about to eclipse its coastal counterparts.

• Mary J Blige: What’s the 411?

Blige’s first album was the big hit that the Grammys require before granting one of the big awards. It was also, like the album above, a portent of something new, in this case the melding of hip-hop and soul into something that managed to be simultaneously tougher than leather, but washed down with tears.

Beastie Boys: Check Your Head, Tori Amos: Little Earthquakes and U2: Achtung Baby

1995

Winner: MTV Unplugged by Tony Bennett

One sure way of getting Grammy success was to be a great recontextualising your music: hence Clapton, and in 2000 Santana’s Supernatural album, pairing him with younger artists. Tony Bennett revisiting his back catalogue fell slap-bang in the middle of that period. It is hard to begrudge an evidently decent man, and a great singer, but once again, look at what was passed over.

Nas: Illmatic

One of the great hip-hop albums, one of the great debut albums, and a hit to boot – it peaked in the US chart at No 12. This was a landmark hip-hop album, yet it would be another nine years before OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below became the first hip-hop record to win the album of the year award.

Warren G: Regulate … G Funk Era

Warren G actually got two nominations in the 1995 Grammys – for best rap solo performance and best rap performance by a duo or a group – but the album of the year category that year rewarded safety: alongside Bennett, the nominees were the Three Tenors, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and Seal.

The Notorious BIG: Ready to Die

One of the greatest rappers ever, and someone who helped revitalise east coast hip-hop, Biggie Smalls never got an album of the year nomination. In what was already a depressingly familiar pattern, he was instead confined to genre categories, with Big Poppa getting a best rap solo performance nomination the following year.

Written by Robert Funke and Matt Lutsky based on a spec script they wrote, On Becoming A God is a darkly comedic story about the cult of free enterprise and one woman’s relentless pursuit of the American Dream in the early ’90s. Recently widowed and left with nothing, minimum-wage Orlando water park employee Krystal Gill (Dunst) lies, schemes and cons her way up the ranks of Founders American Merchandise — the cultish, flag-waving, multibillion-dollar pyramid scheme that drove her to ruin in the first place.

Funke, Lutsky, Dunst and Lanthimos executive produce alongside Oscar winners Clooney and Heslov (Argo) through Smokehouse. The project, in early development, will be overseen by Sarah Shepard for Smokehouse.

The two leaders held a joint news conference, where the US president reiterated America’s commitment to Japan’s security. Trump and Abe were to fly to Palm Beach, Florida, later the same day for a weekend stay at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resortEmmanuel Macron, France’s rebellious former economy minister, has launched an outsider bid for the presidency, promising to lead a people’s “democratic revolution” against a “vacuous” political system.



The former investment banker, 38, was unknown to the French public until two years ago, is not a member of a political party and has never run for elected office. However, he has promised to blow apart the inadequacies of a governing system that he says has failed the people.

“I have seen from the inside the vacuity of the political system,” Macron thundered in a speech in Bobigny, north of Paris, on Wednesday, referring to his two years as François Hollande’s economy minister during which he criticised complacent career politicians for letting ordinary people fall by the wayside. “Our political system is blocked,” he said.

The notion that a non-politician running independently – with no constituency or political party and no electoral experience – could be a serious contender for the presidency would have been unthinkable only five years ago.

Could Nicolas Sarkozy's legal woes scupper his presidential ambitions? Read more

But Macron’s aim to capitalise on France’s deep-rooted distrust of the governing class is seen as timely in a country that has lost respect for the creaking political party apparatus, and where voters are ground down by decades of mass unemployment, inequality, the threat of terrorism and fears that the globalised market system has left people vulnerable and forgotten.

Donald Trump’s election to US president last week strengthened Macron’s conviction that there is currently space for “anti-system” presidential candidates.

But, in stark contrast to Trump’s appeal for an uprising against the elite, Macron, who does not deny he is part of that elite, styles himself as the respectable face of political insurgency. He presents himself as an honest, safe pair of hands with government experience.

Macron said in Bobigny he wanted to reconcile the people to a more “responsible” governing class and respond to what he called “the divorce between the people and those in charge”.

“The system has ceased to protect those it should protect,” he said, denouncing a political apparatus “that lives for itself, more interested in its own survival than in the interests of the country”.

Macron, who comes from the left, said he wanted to unite people from all backgrounds, and would run on a ticket that was neither left nor right.

The Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, has dismissed him as “populism light”. Macron says he is simply promoting democracy, interested only in listening to the people and moving beyond the self-interest of careerist politicians and parties. He is one of France’s most popular politicians and as such has presented himself as a bulwark against the rise of Marine Le Pen’s far-right Front National.

In his campaign launch, he attacked the far-right without naming them, warning against forces “turning in on themselves, towards civil war”, people who “insult and exclude”.

Macron, the son of two doctors raised in the Picardy town of Amiens, studied at France’s elite postgraduate civil service school. He is an intellectual who studied philosophy, which is reflected in his speeches. He is said to have earned about €2m (£1.7m) as an investment banker before Hollande appointed him as a senior presidential adviser then later catapulting him to economy minister in 2014.

Macron resigned this summer to prepare a surprise presidential bid. The left of the Socialist party has fiercely denounced his pro-business approach.

Marine Le Pen says Trump's victory marks 'great movement across world' Read more

Macron’s decision to announce his bid at a training centre in Bobigny, an old Communist bastion in the northern Paris banlieue, was highly significant. He wanted to show he would target places where the left has lost its traditional working-class electorate. It was also an attempt to embarrass the Socialists by criticising the discrimination and inequality that still defines France’s high-rise suburban housing estates, more than 10 years on from the riots of 2005.

Macron is economically liberal and a pro-business reformist, but he is firmly on the left on social issues, including on the freedom to practise religion in a neutral state, equality and immigration.

He describes himself as an idealist, keen to open up business while protecting France’s wide-reaching social safety net. Early proposals have included loosening the 35-hour limit on the working week for young people while letting older people work less.

He wants more freedom for school governance and for the retirement system. He has suggested checks on the competence of government ministers, more proportional representation, and that the president should be held to account by a citizens’ jury.

The timing of Macron’s announcement was key. His current support in the polls comes mainly from older and professional rightwing voters. He is competing for the same centre ground as Alain Juppé, the former prime minister who is favourite to win the first round of the French right’s primary race to chose its presidential candidate this weekend. Macron entering the ring could weaken the turnout for Juppé and throw the right’s primary race wide open.

Macron is also likely to further fragment the already divided French left amid speculation that Valls could stand for president if the deeply unpopular Hollande cannot attempt a bid for re-election.

Alain Juppé calls for UK border to move from Calais to Kent Read more

Although Macron is a popular personality, his chances of winning the presidency are hard to evaluate because the contest is still open, with two primaries to be fought on right and left. But 38% of respondents in a poll published on Tuesday said Macron would make a good president. This ranks him joint second, behind Juppé and equal with François Fillon, the rightwing former prime minister who polls show could make a breakthrough in the primary race.

The challenge for Macron, who has no party apparatus behind him, is to bring in the funding and support from elected politicians. His movement, En Marche (Forward), has more than 96,000 non-paying members and has received €2.7m to date.

His private life has already been fodder for the gossip press. His parents sent him to Paris to finish high school in an attempt to break up his relationship with his French teacher, Brigitte Trogneux, 24 years his senior. Macron and Trogneux stayed together and have been married for nine years.

The two-round presidential election will be held on 23 April and 7 May.The White House has been forced to deny that a draft memo suggesting it considered mobilising 100,000 national guard troops to round up and deport unauthorised immigrants, including millions living nowhere near the Mexico border, is current administration policy.



An 11-page draft memo obtained by the Associated Press calls for the unprecedented militarisation of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana.

Governors in the 11 states named would have a choice regarding whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, which was written by the US homeland security secretary, John Kelly, a retired four-star marine general.

US immigrant communities scramble to make sense of raids: 'People are terrified' Read more

As Democrats condemned the proposal, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told journalists: “That is 100% not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.”

Using the present tense, he added: “There is no effort at all to round up, to utilise the national guard to round up illegal immigrants.”

The Department for Homeland Security echoed this language. “The Department is not considering mobilising the national guard,” said the department’s acting press secretary, Gillian Christensen, in an email.

But Spicer would not categorically state that such a roundup was never a subject of discussion at some level in the Trump administration. “I don’t know what could potentially be out there, but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested,” he said.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, as Trump headed to a Boeing plant in South Carolina, Spicer added: “It is not a White House document.” The AP’s document states that it is from Kelly and so would have originated from the Department of Homeland Security, not the White House.

Later, the deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted that Kelly did not personally write the memo. “I don’t specifically know who put pen to paper but I know that it was not Secretary Kelly and it wasn’t at his direction,” she told reporters.

Asked if the memo was written during the transition, Sanders added: “I’m not aware on the exact timeline on when it happened but what I do know is that this White House and this president has had no plans in any capacity to use the national guard to round up.”



During last year’s presidential election campaign, Trump pledged to create a “deportation force” to deport the more than 11 million people living in the US illegally.



While national guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the US-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly or as far north.

The four states that border Mexico are included in the proposal – California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas – but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four: Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.

Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, called the possibility of the roundups “despicable”.



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Senator Chuck Schumer: ‘The fact that it might even be considered is appalling.’ Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP

“That would be one of the most un-American things that would happen in the last century and I just hope that it’s not true,” Schumer told reporters. “The fact that it might even be considered is appalling.”

Democratic senator Kamala Harris of California added that the prospect of national guard members going door to door to check people’s documents was “deeply disturbing”, noting that the guard’s main responsibility was to help people in distress after natural disasters.



“Deploying them for any other purpose is a severe mismanagement of resources, an abuse of executive power, and conjures images of Japanese internment camps and mass deportations of Mexican immigrants under President Eisenhower. I challenge Republicans and Democrats, whether they are members of Congress or governors, to condemn this plan and ensure it never sees the light of day.”

The memo is addressed to the then acting heads of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and US Customs and Border Protection. It would have served as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that Trump signed on 25 January. Such memos are routinely issued to supplement executive orders.

The draft document has circulated among DHS staff over the last two weeks. As recently as last Friday, staffers in several offices reported discussions were under way.

If implemented, the impact could be significant. Nearly half of the 11.1 million people residing in the US without authorisation live in the 11 states, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on 2014 census data.

Also on Friday Trump toured a Boeing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, where the company unveiled its new Dreamliner aircraft. “What an amazing piece of art, what an amazing piece of work,” said the president, who has previously clashed with Boeing over the costs of a new Air Force One. He was accompanied on the tour by his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president.

Trump slipped back into campaign mode as he told workers he had come to “celebrate jobs” and the return of manufacturing plants, a core message that was seen as crucial to his election victory. “All of a sudden they’re coming back, and they’re going to be very happy about it, believe me. As your president I’m going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and put our great people back to work. This is our mantra: buy American and hire American.”

Trump repeated his threat that any company that lays off American workers to move to abroad will face a “substantial penalty” when trying to sell their products in the US. “We are going to fight for every last American job,” he added.

Companies were bringing jobs back “because the business climate has already changed”, he argued. “When there is a level playing field, American workers will always, always win. But we don’t have a level playing field. Very shortly you will have a level playing field again. Because when Americans workers win, America as a country wins big league.”

He added: “From now on, it’s going to be America first.”

The tour came a day after Trump’s first solo press conference as president, a wild 77 minutes littered with grievances and falsehoods and caused jaws to drop around the world. But not for the first time, while mainstream media were critical, some conservative outlets hailed it as a bravura performance.



“Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy!”

Limbaugh is a rightwing talkshow host fond of conspiracy theories who questioned whether Barack Obama was born in the US and eligible to be president. He said after the press conference: “Just what the doctor ordered. This is Donald Trump going over the head of the media right now to the American people. Advancing his domestic agenda and being totally transparent with these people.”

Trump also tweeted about his search for a national security adviser to replace retired general Michael Flynn, forced to quit after 24 days because he misled officials over his discussion of sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the US.

In yet another setback, it emerged that Trump’s next choice, retired vice-admiral Robert Harward, had turned down the offer. Harward, a senior executive at Lockheed Martin, cited family and financial reasons for not taking the job, Reuters reported.

Trump made no reference to this as he tweeted: “General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA – as are three others.”

Meanwhile it was reported on Friday that Trump has appointed Mike Dubke, founder of Crossroads Media, a conservative firm that specialises in political advertising, as White House communications director. Spicer had previously been doing the job in addition to being press secretary. Many see the post as unenviable in light of Trump’s freewheeling style and rapid-fire tweets.

The Associated Press contributed to this reportThe maintenance worker found the woman just before 2pm. She had made her way inside the parking garage in downtown Portland, Oregon, and now stood in the corner of the second floor, mumbling something the worker could not understand. The temperature was about 18F (-7C) with a wind chill. The woman started to remove her pants, a common reaction to severe hypothermia.

He ran to get help from a parking attendant, but by the time they returned, Karen Batts was lying on her back, naked from the waist down and unconscious.

At 2.16pm, medics called Portland police to notify them that Batts, 52, was dead. Within days it would emerge that, months earlier, she had been evicted from her apartment, in part because she had been unable to pay $338 in rent.

The death of Batts on 7 January has shaken Portland like few other events in recent memory.

The city’s image of itself as a bastion of liberal values and affable quirkiness is increasingly undermined by the plight of its homeless residents. Amid unusually brutal weather, Batts was among four homeless Portlanders who died of exposure in the first 10 days of 2017.

In the same period, a homeless woman was found holding a dead infant at a bus shelter; the medical examiner ruled it a stillbirth.

The toll on the city streets is rising with each passing year, up from 47 in 2011 to 88 in 2015. Of the recent deaths, Batts’s appears to have resonated the most. And while her death made headlines, a deeper investigation of her story raises difficult questions about whether Portland is failing its neediest citizens.

About five miles from where Batts was found, there is a white craftsman cottage in the middle-class, rapidly gentrifying Hollywood neighborhood. The mantelpiece in the living room is laden with family photos, including one of Batts, a studio portrait taken almost a decade ago at JC Penney. Her smile is broad and unforced. Her hair, in long ringlets, is just beginning to gray at the temples.



The cottage is home to Batts’s mother, Elizabeth, 77, and her brother, Alan, 53. The family knew that Batts’s health was declining. The last time Alan saw her, “she had her fingers in her ears to keep out the voices in her head”, he said. “I asked her if she wanted me to hug her and she said she didn’t want me to touch her.”

But it seemed impossible to do anything. “I was trying to help her,” he said, “but I just kept getting resistance.”

Batts was born in 1964 in the German town of Heidelberg, while their father was serving in the US army. They returned to Portland when she was six years old, a mixed-race child in a town where African Americans were just 6% of the population.



At Grant high school she was a vivacious, outgoing cheerleader. She loved to dance. Even then, there were signs of what lay ahead. Her mother would find “little jars of spit-up” around the house. Later the family realized that she had an eating disorder, but at the time “I didn’t know what that was,” Elizabeth recalled.

Batts graduated with honors in 1982 and enrolled at Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, for a pre-dentistry course. Although she received several small scholarships, it became unaffordable and she dropped out after her first year. She came back to Portland and took intermittent classes at Portland State but was unable to finish the degree.

From then on, Batts drifted between short-term jobs and unstable housing arrangements. The family found it hard to keep track. “She lived in maybe 20 places” from the early 1990s onwards, her brother said. A comment that Batts once made to her mother revealed her mental disarray: “Don’t say too much in the apartment, they can hear me over the sprinkler system.”

In 1995, she went missing altogether, leaving her brother to put up flyers all over the city. When she returned after a few months, she telephoned and acted as though nothing had happened. The family suspects that she was homeless between 2000 and 2002.

Batts’s illness came to a head in December 2003, when she was found unconscious on a Portland street with alcohol poisoning. She was committed to Oregon State Hospital for a year.In 2004, having recovered sufficiently, she moved into a suburban halfway house.

She would never hold down another paying job and survived on disability benefits. At some point she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Still, taking her medication and attending addiction meetings, it seemed like Batts had regained a measure of control over her life.

Batts spent most of her last decade in a downtown building for seniors and people with disabilities, owned by a nonprofit called Northwest Housing Alternatives, or NHA. For most of her time there she was stable – well enough, even, to join a family vacation to Hawaii in 2009.

Yet years later something tipped her off balance. Her brother theorizes it was when she stopped taking her medication.

Martha McLennan, the executive director of NHA, said that Batts started displaying serious behavioral problems in early 2016. She caused “damage, disruptions and hazards of different types”, such as entertaining rowdy guests, and was apparently consuming wood alcohol. Police records indicate that Batts was the victim of an assault.

As she racked up lease violations, on-site staff tried to connect her with mental health services, but Batts declined to engage with them. McLennan said there was nothing else they could do. “We’re a housing organization, not a mental-health organization,” she said.

Alan also pushed to get help for his sister, but she often refused visitors, including him. He called various county authorities and services, but each time found himself stymied. Police spoke to her through the door and did not consider her a danger to herself.

In September of last year, Batts received an eviction notice over her erratic behavior and failure on two consecutive months to pay rent.

Batts did not attend her eviction hearing, and on her last day, 27 October, the sheriff’s department was called to provide an escort off the property.

McLennan said that such evictions on NHA properties are rare and usually prevented. “She was evaluated for a mental health hold a number of times,” McLennan said, but “the standard required is a really high bar.”

Batts fell into an impossible middle ground, according to McLennan: healthy enough to refuse help, but perhaps too sick to recognize that she needed it.

“She didn’t really have the capacity to make positive choices, but the system says she has the right to make bad choices.”

It is not entirely clear how Batts spent her final months. But it appears she drifted into Portland’s homeless population, only occasionally attracting attention from law enforcement.

In early November, police found Batts in the middle of the street in a run-down part of downtown. She wasn’t wearing a jacket, shoes or pants.

As they got closer, they realized that she had been consuming hand sanitizer. “She was drinking it to keep her mouth clean,” according to a police report of the incident. “She had several bottles on her person.”

The police took Batts to the hospital, where she was placed on psychiatric hold. But soon, for reasons that are not fully clear, she was let back out onto the streets.

The following month, she received a ticket for sleeping on the train. The month after that, she would find her way to the parking garage where she died.

A Multnomah County investigation is under way into Batts’s death, involving what it calls a “full system analysis”.

McLennan said her organization has done some “soul-searching” since Batts’s death. “If things fall apart again, what systems are there to provide resilience? If someone doesn’t have strong systems, what is going to catch them?”

She also said she regrets the eviction. “But given the same set of circumstances, would it have the same result? You know, there’s a point at which we have to look after the interests of the neighbors and the property.”

Instead of laying individual blame, onlookers condemn a fragmented web of social services that prevents even the most well-intentioned from averting tragedy. “I am angry all the time, justifiably so,” said Benji Bao Vuong, a Portland activist. “There is no holistic, integrated treatment for the houseless person.”

A spokesperson for Portland’s new mayor, Ted Wheeler, defended his record, noting that the city opened 750 additional beds during the severe weather and that nobody who sought shelter was turned away.

Housing and homelessness were already hot-button topics in the city, but since the deaths there is a sense of greater urgency. Wheeler has co-sponsored an ordinance that will compel landlords to assist with relocation costs for tenants subject to no-cause evictions.

Back at the Batts family home in the Hollywood district, Alan, who spent 11 years in the air force and is a calm and steady man, struggled to control his emotions as he remembered his inability to help his sister. He recalled the last time he saw her alive, about a year before she died. They were walking together to a local train station.

“She asked me for a cup of hot water,” he said. “She didn’t drink tea or coffee, she just wanted to warm her hands.”

The video site has cancelled the second season of PewDiePie’s reality show, Scare PewDiePie, and removed his channel from a premium advertising programme following the revelations.

It has also removed advertising from the controversial videos, including one in which he paid two Indian men to pose with a sign that said “death to all Jews”.

But on Monday night he was dropped by his business partner, Disney-owned Maker Studios, after an investigation by the Wall Street Journal tallied nine videos featuring antisemitism or Nazi imagery.

The videos did not directly promote Nazi ideology, instead using the imagery and phrasing of fascism for its shock value alone. Kjellberg says that the video with the banner, for instance, was created to show “how crazy the modern world is”: he had paid the two men to make the sign and video using the freelance marketplace Fiverr.

• Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is released on 18 NovemberEver since his epic 19-second-long handshake with a visibly bewildered Shinzo Abe of Japan, Donald Trump’s unusual handshake style has been under the microscope. The strange, jerky movement he deploys to dominate his counterparts has become something of a talking point. But the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, the latest world leader to meet the US president, has managed to neutralise the Trumpshake with a clever combination of timing, balance and controlKen Loach has launched an uncompromising attack on the UK government at the 70th British Academy Film Awards.

Speaking as he picked up his award for outstanding British film for I, Daniel Blake, which is conceived as a critique of the current state of the benefits system, Loach touched on accusations by some that his film failed to reflect reality.

Loach thanked his cast and crew, the people of Newcastle and the academy for “endorsing the truth of what this film says, which is that hundreds of thousands of people – the vulnerable and the poorest people – are treated by the this government with a callousness and brutality that is disgraceful.”

Loach continued by making reference to the Tory government’s apparent U-turn on its promise to accept thousands of unaccompanied children fleeing danger in Syria and elsewhere.

“It’s a brutality,” he said, “that extends to keeping out refugee children we promised to help.”

“In the real world,” added Loach, “it’s getting darker. And in the struggle that’s coming between the rich and the powerful, the corporations and the politicians that speak for them, and the rest of us on the other side, the film-makers know which side they’re on.”

Speaking at the press conference afterwards, Loach went further, saying that the government “have to be removed”. He hoped that voters would see his film, but there was little point politicians doing so as “the people actually implementing these decisions know what they’re doing. It’s conscious.”

Their welfare policies, he said, harked back to the Victorian workhouse ethos of telling people that poverty was their fault. “They know they’re doing. We have to change them; they have to be removed.”

His words were echoed by screenwriter Paul Laverty, who sought to draw attention to the UN’s ruling on the UK’s treatment of the disabled. “They found systematic and gross violations,” he said, before saying the Tories had “denied, spun and tried to discredit” the findings.

“They don’t give a toss,” said Laverty, that “scurvy and rickets” had returned to the country, or that “16,000 people were admitted to hospital last year with malnutrition. We have a moral obligation to do one thing, and that’s get rid of them.”

Meanwhile producer Rebecca O’Brien spoke up for those employees of the Ritzy cinema not being paid the living wage. “We think that’s completely wrong in this day and age.”

Dave Johns, who stars in the film, added he felt I, Daniel Blake “gives the working class a voice back.

Clapper made the comments on Thursday during a public defense of his analyst’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the US presidential election. Committee chairman John McCain preceded by stating, ‘every American should be concerned by Russia’s attack on our nation’ during his opening statementGermany’s telecommunications watchdog has ordered parents to destroy or disable a “smart doll” because the toy can be used to illegally spy on children.

The My Friend Cayla doll, which is manufactured by the US company Genesis Toys and distributed in Europe by Guildford-based Vivid Toy Group, allows children to access the internet via speech recognition software, and to control the toy via an app.

But Germany’s Federal Network Agency announced this week that it classified Cayla as an “illegal espionage apparatus”. As a result, retailers and owners could face fines if they continue to stock it or fail to permanently disable the doll’s wireless connection.

Under German law it is illegal to manufacture, sell or possess surveillance devices disguised as another object. According to some media reports, breaching that law can result in a jail term of up to two years.

The ruling comes after Stefan Hessel, a student at Saarbrücken University, raised concerns about the device, which was voted one of the top 10 toys of the year in 2014 by the German toy trade association.

“Access to the doll is completely unsecured,” Hessel told Saarbrücker Zeitung. “There is no password to protect the connection.”

The student said hackers could access the doll via its bluetooth connection from a distance of up to 15 meters, listening in on conversations as well as speaking directly to the child playing with it.

The German ruling could potentially have EU-wide consequences for toymakers. The EU’s commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, Vera Jourová, said: “I’m worried about the impact of connected dolls on children’s privacy and safety.”

While the monitoring and the enforcement of the data protection rules are the responsibility of the national data protection authorities, the national consumer authorities work together under the Consumer Protection Cooperation network.

The commission is organising a workshop bringing together the consumer authorities and the data protection authorities in March to further discuss the problem with smart toys and appliances.

Vivid Toy Group has not responded to a request for a comment on the German ruling. Previously the company has said examples of hacking were isolated and carried out by specialists, but it was looking into upgrading the app used along with the doll.If you want to know where Republicans find ideas to reform Obamacare, look no further than the private insurance companies.

As Republicans struggle to unify around a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, and at the same time attempt to keep insurance companies in state marketplaces, health insurance executives appear to have found a friendly ear for their demands for change.

The most striking inclusion of industry ideas in policy appeared this week, when the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a draft rule that could dramatically affect individuals who buy insurance on state marketplaces.

Proposed changes would shorten the window to enroll in coverage from three months to six weeks, increase out-of-pocket costs to consumers and give regulatory authority for health plans to states – all proposals that insurance companies have called for since Donald Trump’s inauguration.

What an Obamacare replacement could look like under Tom Price Read more

The public has just 20 days to comment on the draft rule change – rather than the usual 30. That is despite HHS officials’ findings that the proposed changes “could reduce the value of coverage for consumers, which could lead to more consumers facing increases in out-of-pocket expenses, thus increasing their exposure to financial risks associated with high medical costs”.

Benefits to consumers, the rule argued, would come through stabilized premiums and would prompt insurance companies to remain in the market despite the current uncertainty surrounding Republicans’ plans for the system.

“I don’t believe that for a minute,” said Linda Blumberg, an insurance policy expert at the Urban Institute, of the supposed benefits to consumers. “The ways it can hurt consumers are multiple.”

Blumberg and other experts have argued the rule does little to stabilize the insurance market, which she and others said could best be done by recruiting more healthy people to join.

“These are very much directed toward segmenting the risk pool, segmenting the cost of the healthy from the cost of the sick,” said Blumberg. “This has always been the way insurers most profit. They will make much more money doing that than they will by managing the medical care of a broad diverse population.”

The new rule comes amid Republican disagreement over how to move forward with repealing the Affordable Care Act, a seven-year campaign promise from conservatives. Many Republican plans to replace the ACA exist, but none have found a way to stitch together the conservative and moderate members of the party.

This is not a rule that puts consumers first – this is just giving insurers a wishlist of what they want Lydia Mitts, Families USA

On Thursday, House Republican leaders discussed broad outlines for a replacement for Barack Obama’s signature health policy, which led to 20 million people gaining health coverage. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said that after Congress’s forthcoming weeklong recess, “we intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare”, without giving further details.

Republicans Rand Paul and Mark Sanford have proposed legislation that would completely repeal the Affordable Care Act and expand savings accounts that come with tax benefits intended for emergency use. But it is unclear which of their ideas might end up in an eventual GOP bill.



Trump himself claimed at an eccentric press conference on Thursday: “We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.”

Without a unifying plan from Republicans looking to avoid political blame for sowing chaos, the insurance industry has offered ideas to stabilize the markets under threat of pulling out altogether.

“Their advertised objective here is to stabilize the market,” said Marc Goldwein, vice-president of policy at the conservative Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. “One way to keep insurance companies selling insurance is to give them some of the things they’re asking for.

“Whether those are things that hurt the consumer, or benefit the consumer, or are neutral to the consumer, will depend,” said Goldwein.

The proposed rule was released just nine days after executives of Blue Cross Blue Shield met administration officials, when a list of “actions” needed to “stabilize the private health insurance market” was distributed. Many of those same actions appeared in a Blue Cross Blue Shield policy document from 30 January, titled “Moving forward: a health insurance market for 2017 and beyond”.

The proposed rule, if approved by the department now headed by the vehement Obamacare critic Tom Price, would have a tangible impact on when individuals can buy health insurance, and what they get when they do.

“The biggest issue, and what’s most important for people to know, is this rule does nothing to help people get coverage or afford care,” said Lydia Mitts, associate director at Families USA, a left-leaning patient advocacy group. “This is not a rule that puts consumers first – this is just giving insurers a wishlist of what they want, making it harder for people to get the coverage they need.”

First, the period to sign up for health insurance would shorten. Last year, 11.3 million people signed up for health insurance through exchanges between 1 November and 1 January. The proposed rule would shorten that period to six weeks, from 1 November to 15 December.

Next, insurers could require more verification paperwork from consumers looking to take part in so-called “special enrollment periods”. These are special opportunities to sign up for healthcare offered to people who may have lost a job or become pregnant.

Third, if a customer’s insurance policy were canceled because the customer did not pay, insurance companies could require full repayment before allowing customers to sign up for a new plan. This proposal, the rule argues, would encourage people to “maintain continuous coverage”.

Because the ACA required insurers to offer a set of benefits, the new rule would also allow insurance companies to offer less valuable plans, meaning that out-of-pocket costs would increase, and subsidies could go down. The rule would also lower requirements for the number of some types of doctors insurers are required to have in plans.

“I’m not privy to what is going on in the administration, but these are things that I think are coming from the insurance industry more than they are from policymakers,” said Blumberg.

“There seems to be a lot of consistency between the big insurers and the policies that are being promoted by critics of the ACA.”My classmate had received a new princess-cut purity ring from her parents on Valentine’s Day.

“Where do you, like, put yours during practice?” she whispered from behind her open gym locker. We were freshmen on the basketball team at Living Christian high school in Wisconsin; besides this and our rings, we didn’t have much in common.

“On the hook,” I answered. By 1993, I’d worn my purity ring – a blue topaz birthstone ring – for more than two years. As the first of my friends to receive such a gift, they came to me for tips on taking care of the first precious piece of jewelry many of us had been entrusted to protect. Losing one’s purity ring was tantamount to losing the real thing – at least according to the rumors that spread via prayer circles.

She looked apprehensive. The concern over leaving her ruby ring just hanging there on a hook was apparent.

“Wrap it in a tissue, then, and wedge it in the crack of your math book”. I slammed my locker, forgetting to take off my own ring.

•••

On my 13th birthday, my parents escorted me to a candlelight dinner and presented me with the finest ring I had yet had the privilege to call mine. Accepting it meant I promised to stay a virgin until my wedding night – to keep my mind innocent, my body untouched, my soul blameless – so that I could one day present my husband with the ultimate gift.

Protecting my purity was a daily topic in my devout Christian household, located a few rusty miles outside of Milwaukee.

In 1991, my family was early to join the crusade to protest America’s promiscuity with public purity pledges. In our born-again circles, word spread through church newsletters arguing that Christians could no longer be complacent over the epidemic of premarital sex. Well-known evangelist Jimmy Hestler circulated tracts reporting that while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated half of all American teens professed to having intercourse by age 17, a study of evangelical teenagers revealed that 43% confessed to fornicating by 18. About 65% admitted to “some kind” of sexual contact.

This was a moral crisis the religious right had to confront.

The slogan “true love waits” was eventually coined and then stamped onto silver rings and widely distributed for $9.95 at youth revivals, Christian rock concerts, purity balls and evangelical bookstores in the mall.

These rings sealed the deal when in the mid-1990s, an estimated 2.5 million American teenagers publicly pledged to pastors, parents, friends and future spouses that they would not engage in premarital sex. Early espousers, like my family, marked this rite of non-passage with gemstones or diamond rings; some passed down heirlooms. My parents were proud to give me a special ring, as opposed to what my mom called “Jesus junk”. By which, I imagined, she meant those cheap silver rings.

•••

Mid-drill, my team-mate hurled a chest-pass at me with such force that the stone of my purity ring popped out and skittered across the court. I dropped to all fours.

Coach blew her whistle.

“Sorry!” I cried. “I broke my purity ring.”

Our point guard, Mary, who took her namesake seriously, fell to the floor to help me scour the court.

“It’s a blue heart,” I described. When my dad gave me the ring, he said it represented my commitment to guard my heart, as instructed in Proverbs 4:23.

“What if you lost it?” Mary murmured, swiping her finger through a water droplet.

I shook my head against the encroaching fear that she could be right.

“Wait! There!” Mary cried, and I crawled out of bounds to retrieve my displaced heart. My ring’s band was bashed, but I was relieved to see my two diamond chips were still intact. They represented “mommy and daddy standing next to me to help me stay strong”, my mom had explained with hope in her voice.

“Hurry and put it away,” my coach shouted. I ran past to the locker room.

Pinching the loose gem, I dug through my backpack for something to hold my heart. I came across a light-day pad. Beneath the protective tape, I secured my stone to the sticky underside. Yet when I went to pull off the ring band, I halted at the sight of it. The gaping hole formed by the empty prongs resembled what I imagined my insides might look like if I ever gave into sin, or what repentant teenagers at my church called “slipping sexually”.

I imagined my hymen to resemble one of those paper-covered doorways that cheerleaders taped up for the boy’s basketball team to tear through on their way into spirit rallies (as did my boyfriend, which was why he accepted handjobs but, for fear of breaking me, never reciprocated). Later, I would learn that hymens were shaped more like the doorframe itself, a smaller enclosure within a larger entity, that formed when the internal and external organs fused together during development.

But at the time, such basic information about my reproductive system would have been viewed as encouraging sexual activity.

•••

Technically, the 1990s purity culture was nothing new; it was ancient. In Virgin: The Untouched History, historian Hanne Blank examined how cultural esteem of virginity has shaped societies for millennia. My experience differed only by name and by those who assumed power to define what was pure or impure.

The foundation of the true love waits movement had been laid during the “just say no” Reagan years. In 1981 The Adolescent Family Life Act, nicknamed The Chastity Act, passed, empowering the government for the first time in US history to fund abstinence-only advocacy programs – ostensibly to stop the spike in unintended pregnancies as well as to curb the spread of HIV/Aids.

George HW Bush dismissed the American Civil Liberties Union’s case that abstinence ideology violated the constitutional separation of church and state. He ratcheted up funding for purity promotion, begetting the health policy oxymoron “abstinence-only sexual education”.

For three decades, virginity pledges were tallied by the Government Accountability Office as proof of efficacy. Success was loosely measured in ring receipts and course completions, irrespective of the person’s actual behavior.

•••

I continued to wear the empty band, fearing what others might think or say if I took it off – especially my boyfriend, Jamie, when he picked me up for our Friday night date. We met at a youth group mixer at our Baptist church and had been inseparable since. By the time my parents permitted us to really go out, Jamie could drive. He was a baseball stud, in the kind of small town where everyone from the postman to the Candy Shoppe owner knew the score.

In the beginning, we actually did go out to all sorts of places; but as of late, we mostly sped to the darkest spot we could find in parking lots.

“I’ve wanted this all week,” he said, pulling me toward the backbench of his mom’s baby blue minivan.

“Me too.”

As Christians, we believed what our pastors and parents told us about premarital sex being an abomination. We were on the honor roll, athletes and preppy. We had state championships, college degrees, a honeymoon (hopefully together) and homeownership in our future. As my dad suggested, we were two souls drawn toward the same transcendent, heavenly goal. Our pursuit not only drew us closer together, but also made us special, praiseworthy and more civilized than ancient barbarians, dogs or, say, the French, whose language I was studying as an elective.

Going all the way was so out of bounds; it wasn’t even on our playing field.

“You OK tonight?” Jamie asked. “You seem, I don’t know, bummed.”

“I just wish we could be closer,” I said, kissing him. “I love you so much.”

Jamie cupped my cheeks, pulled me in for a kiss that increased in fervor, until he gently nudged downward, and I bowed my head.

I closed my eyes, trying to focus on the belief that I was helping us stay pure, that I was being good – everyone knew there was really only one line that couldn’t be crossed before marriage, and I was helping us protect it. His palms tightened on the back of my head. I prayed away the feeling that I wanted him to reciprocate. My frustration became palpable, but I had to content myself with thinking his gratitude was all there was to get.

The pressure to have sex was supposed to come from the outside world, not within. Christian girls weren’t supposed to want it, or to, God forbid, instigate it. Yet, as I kneeled on the crumby minivan carpeting, I realized I wasn’t sure that I wanted to wait, or that I truly had a choice in the matter. Choice required options. My singular option was to uphold the promise of my purity ring or else deserve eternal damnation. My virginity vow no longer felt empowering. Instead, it felt as though someone else was calling the shots over my body, mind, and life.

The overwhelming desire for something more overcame me. I was astounded with myself but couldn’t stop. I crawled up off the floor and straddled him. Jamie was startled by my aggression but responded instantly. My thighs squeezed his waist.

An incredible feeling radiated through me, but before we could go any further Jamie shouted: “Stop! I can’t!”

He pushed me away with more force than either of us expected. My head hit the side window. I was startled, then disgusted, then terrified. His discharge began to seep between my legs and soak my cotton briefs. I peeled out of my underwear. Jamie’s mouth dropped open in shock, then curiosity, then desire.

“Get it off before I get pregnant!”

Stunned, Jamie took a moment to come to his senses but then leapt, with his boxers still around his knees, over the middle minivan seat and dove headfirst into the glove compartment. He dug for the napkins his mom kept there in case of spills. Jamie kept on repeating, “We’re going to be OK. Right?”

He was in a better position to know. His public high school required some semblance of sexual education starting in 10th grade. The bare-bone lessons were tempered by his religious family and conservative storybook town, but at least teachers distributed worksheets and held office hours, and coaches freely handed out condoms. I knew enough from my mom’s long-ago explanation of how babies were made to know that his stuff didn’t just slime down my thighs. It could swim.

“Holy crap!” Jamie stopped dabbing my bare legs and grabbed my hand. “We broke your ring.”

“It was like that,” I said, starting to cry.

He offered the wad of damp tissues, apologetically.

Tears of fear and shame and dissatisfaction seeped out. “We have to stop, Jamie!”

“Stop what?”

“This!” All of this.

“Well, it’s kinda your fault. Grabbing me like that.”

“Just take me home,” I said, righting my twisted, empty ring.

•••

Born into different circumstances, Jamie and I might’ve learned to develop our physical relationship in tandem with our emotional and intellectual connection. I’d like to think that if we had the discipline to stop, we could’ve managed birth control. That said, we were under the impression that only “sluts” prepared to have sex and “frickin’ fags” wore condoms.

We were fortunate that while we groped around in the dark, we only swapped misconceptions about male and female desires and anatomy and were spared from the sexually transmitted diseases and infections that could also spread through unprotected contact.

In After the Promise: The STD Consequences of Adolescent Virginity Pledges, research scholars Hannah Brückner of Yale and Peter Bearman of Columbia reported in the Journal of Adolescent Heath that 88% of purity pledgers had premarital intercourse. This 2001 study was a followup to their earlier report on surveys they conducted throughout 1994 and 1996, at the height of the purity pledge movement.

Responses revealed that while pledges did delay sexual initiation in younger teens by 34%, once they did engage, they were one-third less likely to use protection. That was to be expected, the researchers remarked, “for it is hard to imagine how one could both pledge to be a virgin until marriage and carry a condom while unmarried”.

Consequently, there was no significant difference in infection rates between pledgers and non-pledgers. The 12% who reported keeping their vows into adulthood professed to doing so in order to intimately intertwine their religious beliefs, sexual activity, and matrimonial commitment. The public nature of these personal pledges, similar to wedding vows, created a visible community with which to identify and to express their evolving sense of selves. The allegiance of a minority – an us-against-the-world mentality – was a core appeal of the pledge, as a counter-culture identity.

For centuries, Christians followed God’s call to set themselves apart. Physically marking the body with an outward sign to announce an internal commitment was foundational to a born-again Christian’s identity. For believers, who desired to first and foremost love God, the pledge and ring was holy PDA.

Growing up, I respected the commitments my boyfriend and friends made to abstain. There was nothing weak-willed about those who waited until their wedding nights – on average women were 22; men, 24. Yet, the convictions of a few were touted as being universal and becoming the policy for all.

In 1996, Bill Clinton’s Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, nicknamed the Workfare Act, passed with the rider, Title V, Section 510(b) attached, making the ethereal status of virginity the standard for American teenagers. Over the next five years, $437.5m in federal and state funding supported organizations willing to promote eight ideological tenets, including: “(4) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity”.

When George W Bush assumed office, he upped the ante to $237m in the first year alone. Virginity culture bloomed into cherry-flavored lollipops, declaring, “Don’t be a sucker. Save sex for marriage,” Wait Wear panties, Britney Spears, abstinence-only education, and father-daughter Purityball portraits.

The next morning, my mom and I went to get my ring repaired after our perm appointments. I assumed we were headed toward the gilded, old-timey storefront, when at the last minute she veered toward the wide swath of automatic doors to Walmart.

“Here?” I asked, shocked. Mom didn’t even buy wrapping paper from Walmart because she said it looked cheap.

“Never know where you might find a treasure,” she said. “I just couldn’t pass up how perfectly it fit our message, with the heart for you, the two diamonds for me and Daddy.”

RINGS $69! $89! $109! Giant yellow smiley faces on signs announced over a fractured rainbow of gemstones. Mom couldn’t pass up the symbolism? Or the price? Of course, I told myself, it was the meaning that counted, not the expense. My gaze followed row after row of semi-precious stones that appeared garden-variety beneath the fingerprinted display case.

A clerk in a blue vest, who appeared as though she’d rather be smoking, listened to my mom as she explained that she had purchased a ring from them a couple of years ago and that I had accidentally broken it. The clerk looked down at either my bashed band or me, and either way didn’t seem surprised.

“Yeah, naw. We’re not gonna be able to fix that,” she said after a glance. She pursed her lips and shook her curly mullet. “That one is discontinued, but you could get a replacement.” She waved her hand over a puddle of blue topaz rings.

“Thank you,” my mom said, not looking down. “But this one is very special.”

“It’s my purity ring.”

The clerk’s penciled-in eyebrows squiggled together. Her come-again expression probably wasn’t seeking clarification, but I gave it to her anyways, as I’d grown accustomed to doing.

“Purity ring,” I enunciated. “It means I’m gonna stay a virgin till I’m married.” I nodded at her enthusiastically, trying to convince her, and frankly, myself, after my behavior the night before.

Her chin recoiled into her gullet, apparently appalled that I was talking to a complete stranger about such things at Walmart. Was nothing private?

Outside our Christian circles, my parents’ intentions behind this ring were often misunderstood. My dad and mom were against premarital sex for potentially the same reasons as the stranger shopping one aisle over in the purse department. They were concerned about infection, pregnancy, abuse and psychosexual harm. But beyond these universals, they also believed that if done right, intercourse could be transcendent and include the Divine, literally The Holy Spirit. They wanted me to have a positive experience, to esteem me, and to guide me toward what they believed would be the best sex of my life.

I was lightheaded. Perhaps it was the disappointment I felt over discovering my most prized possession had come from Walmart. Was this the best I could expect? My purity ring wasn’t the same as an engagement ring or even a promise ring. It was a placeholder. It sealed the deal.

I wanted a better deal.

“Let’s go,” my mom said, gathering up her faded receipt and indignation. She stormed out of the store without a second glance at the specials. Mom slammed her car door and stomped on the accelerator. She turned left out of the parking lot instead of taking a right toward home.

“Where are we going now?”

“We’ll see.”

Finally, Barack Obama stanched government spending after nearly $2bn had been blown on purity promotion but still threw a $5m bone to a virginity watchdog to get Obamacare passed. Nonetheless, throughout his terms, his administration gave millions to initiatives that provided age-appropriate programs informing youth of preventative measures that were proven to decrease STD/STI transmission and lower unexpected pregnancy rates. He proposed to fully defund abstinence-only programs in the 2017 budget. In an impoverished state of willful ignorance, where only 19 states required sexual education to be medically accurate, this was a hopeful pledge to ending the virginity racket in America.

Then Donald Trump won. On the campaign trail, his running mate, Mike Pence, affirmed his commitment to funding abstinence-only organizations, adding to the cumulative $4.5m he had recently awarded in Indiana contracts as governor. His advocacy for abstinence-only policies represented a commitment to restricting women of all ages from gaining everything from knowledge to healthcare. Purity rings rippled to impact us all, aborting the ownership of our own bodies, minds – and ultimately our lives.

Mom pulled into the parking lot for the fancy mall across town.



“Come on, we’re gonna try something else.”

The sign for Zales appeared on my horizon, and the jewelry store seemed to glow like a setting sun. The plush champagne-colored carpet instantly elevated us to luxury status and merely being inside The Diamond Store felt promising. A woman in heels approached us. She was stunning. If Hollywood were to cast this midwestern sales clerk, the movie director would’ve called Heather Locklear.

“May I help you?”

Mom nodded, hopefully. “We didn’t purchase it here–”

“No, certainly not,” Heather agreed, eyeing my mom’s outfit and my crappy ring.

“But I would be thrilled,” she persisted, “to pay a jeweler if he could fix it.”

Heather pursed her lips without committing one way or another. She lifted her lotioned, polished pointer finger to her glossy lips. “One moment, please.” She returned trailed by a squat, perspiring man with a comb-over.

“Give this man your ring,” my mom instructed as she slid over the heart stone she’d been carrying, in a folded corner of an envelope, for safekeeping.

I obeyed and then went back to ogling the engagement rings. Now those are rings to hold out for! I thought, peering over the spotless cabinet frame, trying not to breathe on the glass.

“Ah yes,” the Zales jeweler said with gravitas. “The heart-shaped setting is inherently loose.” He raised an eyebrow at me. “With only three prongs, the stone will always be wobbly.” Unlike the princess-cut setting that my team-mate wore, which secured her ruby with eight prongs, my setting only had two hooks for the top rounded mounds and one sharp clasp for the point.

“I’ll do my best to anchor your stone, but,” he warned, “be on the lookout. Your heart could fall out at any moment.”

“You can do that,” my mom said. “Can’t you?”

The name of the author’s high school, as well as her former boyfriend, were changedTrump security adviser Flynn resigns after leaks suggest he tried to cover up Russia talks Read more

Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser because of his contacts with the Russian ambassador to Washington and his subsequent attempts to cover up the true nature of those contacts.

But his resignation is unlikely to mark the end of the Trump administration’s crisis of legitimacy over its relationship with Moscow. The manner of this matter suggests that this is only the beginning.



Flynn is the third Trump acolyte forced out over the question of links to the Russian government of Vladimir Putin. Paul Manafort, the former campaign manager, and Carter Page, a businessman Trump described as an adviser, both left last summer after reports surfaced about their contacts with the Kremlin.

The question of the true nature of the relationship between the president and Putin – who Trump once claimed to have met and later denied knowing – hung over his campaign and now looms over his presidency.

Many administrations have rocky starts, but there has never been a case of a national security adviser being forced to leave in less than a month. It has broken through the aura of impunity around the Trump White House and emboldened critics in their demands to know what the president knew and when he knew it.



“Trump may think Flynn is the sacrificial lamb, but the reality is that he is the first domino. To the extent the administration believes Flynn’s resignation will make the Russia story go away, they are mistaken,” said Susan Hennessey, a former NSA lawyer.



“Flynn’s resignation validates the suspicions of many in Washington that something is seriously amiss with regard to President Trump’s ties to Russia. This is the third member of Trump’s circle to be pushed out over Russia-linked scandals,” she said.

“This is only going to increase pressure from both the public and Congress demanding a full accounting of the nature of Trump’s connections to Russia both now and during the campaign.”

Donald Trump had 'full confidence' in Mike Flynn – hours later he was gone Read more

Trump clearly fought to keep his national security adviser in place, confident in his control of the executive branch and the grip of Republican loyalists on Congress.

The Washington Post reported on Monday that former acting attorney general Sally Yates informed him last month that Flynn’s misleading statements to Vice-President Mike Pence and other officials could leave him open to Russian blackmail. But it was Yates who was sacked, over her refusal to defend Trump’s travel ban, not Flynn.

The US intelligence agencies struck back, however, through an ever greater flow of leaks to the press, until Flynn’s position was untenable. The same leaks also suggest that the foundations of the whole administration are shaky.

Intelligence officials were quoted as saying that Flynn’s communications with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak, dated back to before the election, adding to the pile of unanswered questions about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and an operation, run by Vladimir Putin himself according to US intelligence agencies, to steer the US presidential election in Trump’s favour.

Flynn fell because he appears to have talked to Kislyak about measures the Obama administration was about to impose on Moscow at the end of December, including the expulsion of FSB intelligence officers, in retaliation for the interference in the election. According to the reports, he gave the impression that the sanctions would not last long, with the Trump administration less than three weeks from office.

Putin’s muted response took the Obama White House by surprise. He did not carry out tit-for-tat expulsions, but made a point of inviting the children of US diplomats in Moscow to the Kremlin for Christmas parties. Trump showed his approval in a 30 December tweet saying: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!”

Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, said: “This tweet does kind of make one wonder if the president-elect knew about the contents of Flynn conversation on sanctions with Kislyak.”

Numerous reports suggest that Trump did indeed intend to lift sanctions on Moscow and that executive orders were drafted to that effect in his first week in the White House, only to be deferred after protests from congressional Republicans, who have since started work on legislation that would take control over such sanctions out of the president’s hands. Theresa May also signaled her government’s determination that the sanctions should stay when she visited Washington.

But despite such concerted resistance from natural allies, Trump has persevered in defending Putin. When ultra-conservative talkshow host Bill O’Reilly suggested to Trump that Putin was “a killer”, the president replied: “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”

Trump’s refusal to criticise Putin and his hurry to lift sanctions on Russia have still not been explained. In a leak to CNN on Friday, intelligence officials indicated that they have confirmed at least some of the allegations contained in a set of reports given to the FBI by a former MI6 officer, Christopher Steele, last year.

They said could not corroborate the suggestion in the Steele reports that Russian intelligence had personally compromising material on Trump from his behaviour on trips to Russia, but that they had independent evidence of contacts between individuals in Trump’s entourage and Russian officials.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court is reported to have granted a wiretap warrant in mid-October to allow the justice department’s national security division to look into contacts between two Russian banks and Trump associates.

Those investigations appear to be continuing but within the hostile environment of an executive controlled from the Trump White House. However, intelligence officials have now signalled that they are prepared to leak aggressively if they feel they are being muzzled.

Ultimately, the fundamental questions about Trump’s links with Russia may only be answered in Congress. The Senate intelligence, armed services and foreign relations committees, as well as the House intelligence committee, have all voiced intentions to look into the allegations, and subpoena top officials if necessary. But so far those enquiries have not properly got off the ground in the face of Republican reluctance to maim an executive that is fast-tracking much of the party’s social, economic and fiscal agenda.

If the leaks continue at their present rate, however, it is possible than congressional Republicans will flip, and decide that Trump is more of a liability than an asset. That moment has not been reached yet, but the fall of Flynn has brought it closer.‘If you’re not angry, you’re not paying attention,” goes an old slogan that made numerous appearances at recent protests against the presidency of the Bottomless Pit Of Need. I take the point, I suppose, but it’s always struck me as wrongheaded. More and more, these days, getting enraged about politics feels like a substitute for action: an addictive emotional experience that tricks you into thinking it might be effective, but mainly just serves as a distraction. The problem’s even worse on social media, which serves up an overwhelming quantity of stuff worth getting angry about, then seductively implies that firing off a zinger – or repeatedly stabbing the favourite button on other people’s zingers – is somehow a useful response.

It rarely is. The more likely result is “learned helplessness”, coined by the psychologist Martin Seligman, based on experiments he conducted in the 1960s, in which dogs were given electric shocks. Some had the option of stopping the shocks by pressing a lever. The others, which didn’t, soon learned that nothing they did made any difference – and they kept behaving helplessly even when, in the second stage of the experiment, they did have the chance to escape from the shocks. When getting angry leads to nothing much, over and over, defeatism sets in. Which is rather convenient, from the viewpoint of the politicians generating all those anger-inducing headlines.

“If you try to maintain this fever pitch of anguish and fear and outrage, your brain, to protect you, will just turn down the volume on the outrage and adapt,” Mirah Curzer, a lawyer and writer, argued on Medium the other day, making a related point. It’s tempting to imagine that the way to resist the “normalisation” of terrible things is to remain constantly, blisteringly angry about them. You can’t sink into complacency – the logic goes – if you’re spitting mad. The hitch, as Curzer notes, is that emotions get normalised, too. (Yes, it’s our old friend the “hedonic treadmill”, which explains why thrilling new luxuries eventually become mundane, and horrifying circumstances eventually lose their sting.) That’s why it’s no indulgence, perhaps even a positive duty, to step away regularly from the awfulness and get on with your life, especially the pleasurable parts. Call it “self-care”, if you like that dreadful phrase – but it’s also a way to prevent the dulling of your perceptions.

Why are we so hostile to others? | Oliver Burkeman Read more

It’s strange to think of “anguish and fear and outrage” as addictive: we usually reserve that concept for experiences that are enjoyable, at least initially. But as Buddhists have always pointed out, aversion and craving are two sides of the same coin; whether you’re obsessed with yearning or hatred for something (or someone), you’re still obsessed.

You’ll be far more effective, as a campaigner, if you practise stepping away, instead of getting swept into a futile whirlpool of rage, which only serves the other side. It’s like strengthening a muscle. You might call it resistance training.

This week we found that even the lanyard set are impressed by the fact that protests and direct action are constraining Donald Trump’s capacity to act.

In the wake of these successes, some on the right are offering the left advice about how to comport themselves at these events – but do we want it? Having put Iran “on notice”, the administration is risking the ire of erstwhile supporters, amid questions about how the US has conducted recent wars under less chaotic regimes. And we’re getting more opportunities to consider the batshit curriculum that people such as Steve Bannon have imbibed on their way to the administration of a superpower.

Publication: Curtis Yarvin, AKA Mencius Moldbug

Author: Yarvin is a key thinker in the so-called “neoreactionary” movement. From around 2007, Yarvin, a computer scientist, started producing a body of work which rejected liberal precepts of equality, progress and democratic government. His elitist prescriptions found favor with other Silicon Valley weirdos, notably sea-steading blood enthusiast Peter Thiel, who has financially backed Yarvin’s startup.

Why you should read it: Last week, Politico published a list of thinkers who have allegedly influenced Steve Bannon, and Yarvin’s work was described as “laying the theoretical groundwork for Trumpism”. In this (admittedly long and dense) blogpost, Yarvin/Moldbug dismisses a belief in democratic suffrage as a quaint superstition, and implicitly promotes the idea of oligarchy in the name of efficiency. If, as Politico suggests, he really does have an indirect line to the White House chief strategist, we should know that it’s likely that Bannon sees democracy primarily as an obstacle.

Extract: “And, if our goal is really just the faithful execution of a trust, why assume that electoral suffrage of any sort is the most effective way to constitute it? Surely the shareholders of Google have entrusted its management with a tremendous trust – $170 billion worth, last time I checked. Surely this is worth as much as Georgia, or at least Georgia in the 1870s. How does Google just skate along without any suffrage at all, whereas Georgia needs elections? And which trust would you guess is more effectively exercised?”

Publication: Joe Rogan Experience (podcast)

Host: Joe Rogan has one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world. He began it in 2009 after stints in standup and TV comedy and, later, as a UFC announcer. Last week he brought in Austin’s own doyen of multimedia conspiracy culture and, latterly, Trumpism, for episode #911 of his show. He and Alex Jones are longtime friends, so you could say it was an inside job.

Why you should listen: “Answer not a fool according to his folly,” it says in Proverbs, “lest thou also be like unto him.” Jones’s appearance on Rogan’s show is a cautionary tale. Rogan tries to push back on Jones’s talk of “psychic vampires” and “globalist combines” for a while, but the idea that everything is connected turns out to be virulently contagious.

Extract: Go to 6:35 in the YouTube snippet of the podcast, and listen to Rogan’s initial scepticism about elite paedophile rings collapse under Jones’s of torrent of half-truths and arrant nonsense.

Publication: The Atlantic

Author: As I explained last week, David Frum coined “Axis of Evil” as a George W Bush speechwriter, supported the invasion of Iraq, recanted (sort of) but later seemed to suggest that he was right all along. Nevertheless, he has for some time occupied a perch as a moderate conservative at the Atlantic.

Why you should read it: There is a lot of debate on the left at the moment about what the appropriate tactics and targets are for protesting against the Trump administration. Frum offers some advice: make over protests with patriotic iconography, limit demands and don’t neglect what Weber called the “strong and slow boring of hard boards” outside protests. “The more conservative protests are, the more radical they are,” he argues.

The idea is that to build a mass movement in America, you mustn’t alienate what Frum sees as core American values. For better or worse, few on the left will be persuaded by these recommendations, from this source. But as a spectacle, this column is instructive. Perhaps the most striking thing about Trumpism is that it has so thoroughly rehabilitated some of the people whose adventurism started us down the road to this mess. Strange days.

Extract: “Midlife brings strange changes to us all. After a lifetime of viewing demonstrations from the other side of the barricades, I was one of the many who admired the orderly commitment and resolution of the women’s march on Washington the day after President Trump’s inauguration. Yet my admiration is mixed with worry. As I step through the police lines, I bring a message with me: Your demonstrations are engineered to fail. They didn’t stop the Iraq war. They won’t stop Donald Trump.”

Publication: The American Conservative

Author: Pat Buchanan started in politics as a Nixon opposition researcher and then as Reagan’s director of communications. Later, he ran as a proto-Trump “paleoconservative” Republican in 1992 (when he made a few early inroads in primaries) and 1996. In 2000, he headed the Reform party ticket. He never got on with movement conservatives – they charged him with antisemitism, he accused them of betraying “America first” conservatism. He later started the American Conservative, and there (and in his role as a media commentator) he has been a reliable Trump booster. Until now.

Why you should read it: Eventually, Trump plays everyone. Buchanan’s support was premised on the idea that Trump, like him, was some kind of isolationist. There’s a hint of panic in this piece that tries to make sense of Michael Flynn’s saber-rattling at the Islamic republic. Trump’s nihilistic slipperiness on every matter of principle may have gained him supporters during the campaign. But in office it seems to be exacting a cost. The question is whether this comeuppance is happening too late to avert disaster.

Extract: “Is the United States making new demands on Iran not written into the nuclear treaty or international law – to provoke a confrontation? Did Flynn coordinate with our allies about this warning of possible military action against Iran? Is NATO obligated to join any action we might take? Or are we going to carry out any retaliation alone, as our NATO allies observe, while the Israelis, Gulf Arabs, Saudis and the Beltway War Party, which wishes to be rid of Trump, cheer him on?”

Publication: Military Times

Author: Shawn Snow and Andrew DeGrandpre are reporters and editors at the military “trade” outlet Military Times. Snow is a Marine Corps veteran.

Why you should read/listen: Trump is having his laugh-a-minute press sec, Sean Spicer, oscillate between lying to the press corps and berating them. Washington stories may become wholly dependent on leaks. The big scoops of Trump’s years in power may emerge in unusual venues that progressives aren’t used to reading, and from reporters whose skills are geared to a specialist audience. The Military Times’s primary audience are those currently serving in the US military or veterans – people with a reputation for conservative politics. But this remarkable story suggests that the US military has been undercounting the number of airstrikes on foreign nations, perhaps as far back as 2001. We have been fighting a hot war in the Middle East for a generation. If the story is true, then put simply, we have no real idea what has been done in our name.

Extract: “Most alarming is the prospect this data has been incomplete since the war on terrorism began in October 2001. If that is the case, it would fundamentally undermine confidence in much of what the Pentagon has disclosed about its prosecution of these wars, prompt critics to call into question whether the military sought to mislead the American public, and cast doubt on the competency with which other vital data collection is being performed and publicized. Those other key metrics include American combat casualties, taxpayer expense and the military’s overall progress in degrading enemy capabilities.”Luke Bryan opened the show in Houston on Sunday.

Kim Jong-nam: jovial half-brother with sword of Damocles over his head Read more

A female suspect identified from CCTV footage at the airport and a Malaysian man thought by police to be her boyfriend were arrested on Thursday.

The Malaysian inspector general said the female suspect had been identified as Siti Aishah, an Indonesian national. Her birthday was given as 11 February 1992, and place of birth as Serang, Indonesia. Indonesian diplomats confirmed she is a citizen after meeting with her, news agencies reported.

The Malaysian man was named as Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin, 26. He is believed to be the boyfriend of the Indonesian suspect.

On Wednesday police arrested a 28-year-old woman, whose Vietnamese passport bore the name Doan Thi Huong, although it was not clear if the document is genuine.

She too had been positively identified from CCTV footage and was alone at the time of her arrest, the inspector general said. Still photos from the video, confirmed as authentic by police, showed a woman in a skirt and long-sleeved white T-shirt with “LOL” emblazoned on it.

Malaysian police have reportedly been granted permission to remand both women in custody for seven days.

Kim Jong-nam killing: what we know Read more

Kim died after apparently being killed with a fast-acting poison as he prepared to board a flight to his home in Macau on Monday morning. The attack on Kim, who suddenly fell ill at the airport and died on the way to hospital, was over in seconds, Malaysian newspaper the New Strait Times (NST) reported on Thursday.

Citing CCTV footage, the paper said Kim was standing in a small crowd near a self check-in counter when one of the alleged attackers stood in front of him to distract him, while another locked him in a chokehold and administered the substance that appears to have killed him.

According to the paper, CCTV appeared to show the suspect who poisoned Kim walking briskly towards a taxi stand wearing a dark-coloured glove on her left hand. When footage picked her up again at the stand, the glove had gone.

Kim was taken to an airport clinic after seeking help for a headache at an information counter, nurses at the airport said. Footage showed Kim with his eyes shut, grimacing in pain at the clinic, NST said.

An autopsy was completed late on Wednesday, but the results have not been released.

Police said they were seeking “a few” other suspects in connection with the killing, but declined to say how many were being sought, or their nationalities.

The death has set off a torrent of speculation over whether Kim Jong-un dispatched a hit squad to kill his estranged older sibling, possibly as retribution for criticisms his elder brother made against his leadership in interviews with the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi in 2012.

It has also focused attention on the apparent lengths to which North Korea will go to ensure the regime’s stability.

According to Malaysian media reports, North Korean officials spent hours trying to persuade Malaysia not to conduct an autopsy and for Kim’s body to be handed over to Pyongyang.



Malaysia refused the request, since North Korea did not submit a formal protest, according to Abdul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official. Authorities did however confirm that the body was that of Kim Jong-nam and would be taken to North Korea after the autopsy.

While Pyongyang has made no official comment on Kim’s death, it has not attempted to conceal its interest in his fate. On Wednesday, it sent a black Jaguar car with diplomatic number plates and flags to the mortuary at the Kuala Lumpur hospital where the autopsy was conducted.

Kim Jong-un’s five-year rule of North Korea has been marked by purges and executions of people perceived as a threat to his leadership.

The highest-profile victim was his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who was executed on treason charges in late 2013. Jang, once considered his nephew’s most trusted adviser, was also believed to have been close to Kim Jong-nam, whom he had helped raise.

Kim Jong-nam attempted to lead an unremarkable life with his family in Macau, according to exchanges with Gomi.

“Because I was educated in the west, I was able to enjoy freedom from an early age and I still love being free,” he told Gomi, whose book on Kim was published in 2012. “The reason I visit Macau so often is because it’s the most free and liberal place near China, where my family lives.”

Kim Byung-kee, a South Korean MP, said intelligence services had told him Kim Jong-un professed to “hate” his half-brother, whom he feared could one day play a role in overthrowing his regime.

The spy agency has also made unverified claims that North Korea had spent five years attempting to kill Kim Jong-nam.

It cited an attempt in 2012 after Kim Jong-nam described his sibling as “just a nominal figure”, and lambasted the country’s hereditary transfer of power as a “joke to the outside world”.

“The Kim Jong-un regime will not last long,” he told Gomi. “Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse.”

He is reported to have written to Kim Jong-un after the 2012 assassination attempt in which he pleaded with his brother to assure his safety and that of his family.

The letter said: “I hope you cancel the order for the punishment of me and my family. We have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide, and we know that the only way to escape is committing suicide.”

Kim Jong-nam may have succeeded his father, Kim Jong-il, had he not embarrassed the regime in May 2001 with an attempt to enter Japan on a faked Dominican Republic passport.

Kim, accompanied by his wife, another woman believed to be a nanny, and his four-year-old son, were attempting to visit Tokyo Disneyland. They were sent back to North Korea via Beijing, but the incident appeared to end any hopes Kim had of succeeding his father.

Saturday Night Live: Melissa McCarthy takes on Sean Spicer once more Read more

In the return of Last Week Tonight to HBO, the British comic used the episode to investigate the problem that Trump appears to have with the truth. “Since taking office around 412 years ago, Trump has made it clear that reality is not important to him,” he said.

He showed footage of Trump claiming that his inauguration was rain-free, thanks to God’s intervention, and compared it to actual video from the day. “We have a president capable of standing in the rain and saying it was a sunny day,” he said.

Oliver went on to explain that this worryingly comfortable relationship with deception could wreak havoc on the country. “Trump’s relationship with the truth is going to be of profound importance going forward because any policy discussion has to begin with a shared sense of reality and Trump’s reality can change within a single sentence,” he said.

He called him a “pathological liar” with “a well-documented 40-year history of bullshit”.

He also looked back on commentators, including Peter Thiel, who talked about his more extreme promises during the election and claimed that these weren’t actual policies.

“It was worth taking him seriously,” he said. “Trump was telling the truth about the solutions to the problems he was lying about and he is now making real policy based on fake facts.”

Oliver examined the source of Trump’s information and compared his choice of language in tweets with similar terminology used on Fox News.

“You would hope that as president, he would now be getting information from primary sources and briefings but Trump still watches a phenomenal amount of cable news,” he said. “His tweets frequently echo things that just aired on TV.”



He played footage from the president on Air Force One as commercials played loudly in the background. “Trump just made the interior of Air Force One sound like the living room of an old person who died three days ago and who nobody’s found yet,” he said.

But his favorite news organization appears to be the far-right site Breitbart, which Oliver said contained “the kind of headlines you see your old high school friend share on Facebook and think, ‘Oh that’s a shame, I guess Greg sucks now’”.

He also discussed Alex Jones, the controversial head of Infowars who believes that water turns people gay and that Sandy Hook was staged. “If the government had actually hired actors, there is no way that their stage parents would have stopped talking about it,” he said.

Oliver went on: “There is a pattern here: Trump sees something that jibes with his worldview, doesn’t check it, half-remembers it and then passes it on, at which point it takes on a life of its own and appears to validate itself.”

He explained the troubling effect of this: “If you get your news from similar sources to him, as many, many, many people do, he doesn’t look like a crank, he looks like the first president to ever tell you the real truth.”

When confronted by the president’s many falsehoods, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, frequently explains that Trump believes it to be true and that’s what matters.

“This isn’t about belief,” he said. “It can’t be. Incidence of voter fraud is a verifiable fact and faith and facts aren’t like Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton. When you confuse them, it actually matters. Real people get hurt when you make policy based on false information. Billions will get spent on a wall that won’t work to prevent a crimewave that isn’t happening while refugees sit in dangerous situations to prevent Bowling Green-style massacres that never took place.”

Oliver then came up with a solution. If Trump gets his information from cable news then that’s how to reach him. Oliver then detailed a plan to air commercials that actually educate the president on important issues, such as explaining the nuclear triad, how to use appetizer forks and what his other daughter is called.The departing head of US intelligence has publicly defended his analysts against attacks by Donald Trump following their conclusion that Russia interfered in the November election, as the unprecedented dispute between the president-elect and the intelligence services he will soon control broke into the open.

“There’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement,” James Clapper told a hearing into foreign cyber-threats to the US held by the Senate armed services committee, adding that US intelligence analysts “stand more resolutely” than ever behind their conclusion of “Russian interference in our electoral process”.

The testimony was delivered the day before Clapper and the heads of the CIA, NSA and FBI are expected to present their findings on Russian election interference to Trump.

It is likely to be a highly charged meeting. The president elect has publicly derided the agencies on the issue, and this week cited a denial by Julian Assange of WikiLeaks that his source for Democratic party emails released during the election was the Russian government or “a state party”.

US intelligence agencies have suggested that Russia passed the hacked material to WikiLeaks through intermediaries.

Both Clapper and Admiral Michael Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, expressed concerns about intelligence analysts’ morale after Trump’s perceived disparagement of their work, with Rogers suggesting some may quit.

Clapper said that Russia “has clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture,” and described the cyber-assault on the 2016 election as “multifaceted”.

“Hacking was only one part of it,” he said. “It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation and fake news.”

Yet neither Clapper nor Rogers offered new evidence for their October conclusion of Russian interference. Clapper promised to release an unclassified report early next week, prepared by the NSA, CIA and FBI, providing additional information for the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia deliberately hacked the Democratic National Committee in order to aid Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

“We stand more resolutely on that statement than we did on the seventh of October,” Clapper said. Next week’s report will ascribe what Clapper called “more than one motive” to Russian president Vladimir Putin for the assessed electoral interference.

Clapper, who has in the past signaled his discomfort with public intelligence testimony – and who has apologized for previous false statements to the Senate on the scope of domestic NSA surveillance – said he intends to “push the envelope as much as I can on the unclassified version” of the report “because I think the public should know as much of this as possible”.



“They did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort,” Clapper said of the Russians. He demurred from considering their intrusion an “act of war” while under questioning from committee chairman John McCain, saying that would be a “very heavy policy call” not an intelligence judgment, particularly since the US also penetrates foreign digital networks.

“Every American should be alarmed by Russia’s attacks on our nation,” McCain said in his opening remarks. “There is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference.”

Trump’s confidence in WikiLeaks has shocked and angered intelligence analysts, who consider Assange at the least a hostile actor, and at most a tool of Putin. Clapper and Rogers testified they believe Assange has no credibility. “I don’t think those of us in the intelligence community have a whole lot of respect for him,” said Clapper.

On Thursday morning, Trump denied he was “in agreement” with Assange, tweeting: “I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth.”

He claimed the media “lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!”

Asked about morale within the intelligence agencies in the wake of Trump’s comments, Clapper said: “I haven’t done a climate survey, but I hardly think it helps it.” Rogers said the “confidence of our leaders” helps motivate intelligence officers, “and without that confidence, I just don’t want a situation where our workforce decides to walk, because that’s not a good place for us to be”.

The Trump transition team has sought to weaken the impact of the intelligence findings on Russia meddling in the election by highlighting the US intelligence community’s failures over Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. Clapper claimed that US intelligence collection and analysis had vastly improved since then.

“We do make mistakes, but we try to learn from them and makes changes,” he said, insisting that the contrast between US intelligence then and now was “the difference of night and day”.

Amid the background of distrust is a plan Trump is reportedly considering to reorganize the US intelligence apparatus. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the proposal, Trump is considering diminishing the director of national intelligence and returning the CIA directorship, under Trump’s pick Mike Pompeo, to its prime role within the intelligence community. Trump’s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer called the report “100% false”.

Since Trump’s election, some career US intelligence officials have told the Guardian they fear retaliation for their assessment of Russian electoral interference. A leading figure behind the reported reorganization is said to be Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Flynn, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief whom Clapper fired in 2014. Clapper said the current intelligence leadership has not been consulted on the plan.

While Clapper’s fate is certain, Rogers’ is not. Last month, Barack Obama backed cleaving the NSA from its military twin, the US Cyber Command, which is responsible for defending military data networks and waging online attack. It is unclear whether Trump will take up this initiative, particularly since it would leave Rogers without a job, as the NSA would be led by a civilian. A congressional outcry followed leaks of the potential change in November.



McCain, who has a frosty relationship with Trump, denied the purpose of the hearing was to diminish Trump’s electoral victory.

McCain notably praised the “dedicated” US intelligence analysts and contextualized Russian interference in the election within what he said was a “provocative” US inability to create a deterrent to digital assault.

In a potential preview of partisan responses to the forthcoming report, practically no Republican defended Trump against Clapper’s and Rogers’ assessment.

The exception was Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who suggested that the president-elect’s pledges to expand defense spending and modernize the US nuclear weapons arsenal meant that, contrary to received wisdom, “perhaps Donald Trump is not the best candidate for Russia”.

His fellow Republican Thom Tillis did not go as far as Cotton, but sought to minimise the significance of Russia’s actions, referring to a Carnegie Mellon University study that said the US had interfered in 81 foreign elections since the second world war, while the Soviet Union or Russia had interfered in 36.

Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator who was former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s running mate during the election, compared Russian interference to the Watergate break-in and implored Congress to “stand in a bipartisan way” against electoral subversion. The GOP congressional leadership is opposing a Democratic push for a special committee to investigate the hack.

McCain ally Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, urged Trump to issue a forceful response to Russia and said: “When one political party is compromised, we all are.”Katy Perry sparkled, Lady Gaga showed a lot of skin with Metallica and Solange Knowles shimmered on the Grammys red carpet, but singer Joy Villa trumped them all in a dress that featured the words ‘Make America Great Again!’ on the front and ‘Trump’ on the train.Eric the robot wowed the crowds. He stood and bowed and answered questions as blue sparks shot from his metallic teeth. The British creation was such a hit he went on tour around the world.

Robots 'could replace 250,000 UK public sector workers' Read more

The curators at London’s Science Museum hope for a less extreme reaction when they open Robots, their latest exhibition, on Wednesday. The collection of more than 100 objects is a treasure trove of delights: a miniature iron man with moving joints; a robotic swan that enthralled Mark Twain; a tiny metal woman with a wager cup who is propelled by a mechanism hidden up her skirt.



The pieces are striking and must have dazzled in their day. Ben Russell, the lead curator, points out that most people would not have seen a clock when they first clapped eyes on one exhibit, a 16th century automaton of a monk, who trundled along, moved his lips, and beat his chest in contrition. It was surely mesmerising to the audiences of 1560. “Arthur C Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” Russell says. “Well, this is where it all started.”



In every chapter of the 500-year story, robots have held a mirror to human society. Some of the earliest devices brought the Bible to life. One model of Christ on the cross rolls his head and oozes wooden blood from his side as four figures reach up. The mechanisation of faith must have drawn the congregations as much as any sermon.

But faith was not the only focus. Through clockwork animals and human figurines, model makers explored whether humans were simply conscious machines. They brought order to the universe with orreries and astrolabes. The machines became more lighthearted in the enlightened 18th century, when automatons of a flute player, a writer, and a defecating duck all made an appearance. A century later, the style was downright rowdy, with drunken aristocrats, preening dandies and the disturbing life of a sausage from farm to mouth all being recreated as automata.

For all the praise the machines received, the rise of the robots made people uneasy. Automated looms and spinning machines had already replaced skilled craftsmen and women when Maria, the first blockbuster humanoid in Fritz Lang’s 1927 film, Metropolis, questioned the place of humans in a world overrun by machines. “If you create a mechanised economy, what is the position of workers in that? You become slaves to the machines,” Russell says. “You work all round the clock just to keep them running.”

The first tinplate toy robots hit the shelves in the 1930s and helped shape people’s expectations of the world to come. While many were pitched as helpers or friendly space travellers, others carried guns and lasers. On the box, Atomic Man Robot wanders the remains of a city beneath a nuclear mushroom cloud. The adults had their own toys, of course. Though Eric the robot went AWOL – presumed dismantled – after his dicey world tour, the Science Museum built a replica for the exhibition. He goes on display with his younger brother, George (“the man without a soul”) and the giant Cygan, an Italian metal showman who shared a magazine cover with Brigitte Bardot and posed with performers from the risqué Windmill Theatre in London.



The original tin men resembled humans on the outside, but not on the inside. They moved thanks to cables, gears, weights and pulleys. But in the 1990s, engineers began work on “anthropomimetic” robots with plastic skeletons, kite line tendons and bungee cord muscles. The movements are uncannily human, as are some of the downsides. Over time, robots with human-inspired skeletons became prone to familiar ailments, such as worn out joints and twisted spines.

It is not only their bodies that have been made more human. Leaps in computing mean modern robots can converse with people in a meaningful way, provide information, and entertain more than they ever have done. And it is here that the exhibition raises the most pressing questions. It is hard to object to RoboThespian, who recites Hamlet in Klingon, or to Harry, the small, trumpet-playing robot. But are we happy for Pepper, a robot that responds to human emotions, to look after our elderly? Or for Nao, an intentionally endearing robot, to teach children? The pasty, stunted telepresence robot, Telenoid, allows absent parents to call their children. It moves its mouth as they speak and mimics their head movements. Will the technology bring us closer together or drive us apart? Is it deceptive to build robots that look like humans before they match our intelligence? “We want to get people thinking,” Russell says. “And if we can do that, we’ve done our job.”

The curators call the exhibition “the greatest collection of humanoid robots anyone has ever put together”. But what if they revolt and take on their human masters? “I’m not too worried about that,” says Russell. “If they do rise up, their batteries will soon run down.”



The Robots exhibition opens at the Science Museum on 8 February 2017 and runs until 3 September 2017.Ruth Davidson’s remarks about whether US can be considered reliable ally under Trump contrast with official UK policy

Britain is beginning to reassess how reliable an ally the US is, the Scottish Conservative party leader, Ruth Davidson, has said, in comments that contrast starkly with the official policy of the UK government.

During an interview at the Women in the World summit in Washington, Davidson said: “At the moment, from the UK, we have always seen America as being a very strong, a reliable ally, and now, even after only 26 days or however long [Donald Trump’s] tenure has been so far in Pennsylvania Avenue, we are beginning to reassess how reliable an ally the United States is.

“And that’s a huge change in Europe. That’s a massive, massive shock. We are going to want to make sure any deals that are done [Trump] is going to honour. We have to be sure of that.”

Theresa May was the first world leader to visit Trump after he became president and she has been clear that the relationship between the UK and the US will remain strong, despite the controversies surrounding the Trump administration. On the eve of her visit to the Oval Office in January, May told journalists that “opposites attract”.

Speaking before a press conference on Thursday in which Trump attacked the media, Davidson said the trend for politicians to demonise the media should “worry us all”.

“We have to be very careful about popular nationalists, populist strongmen, part-demagogues, using a lot of their political capital at the beginning of their journey to delegitimise public scrutiny, which is what demonising the media does,” she said.

“And I think that if we learn our lessons from history, there is a very strategic reason why you’d do that and I think that should worry us all.”

Davidson said it was only lazy members of the media who thought she was not “what you would expect a Conservative necessarily to be”.

“The idea that I’m something completely other is wrong because I worked for 10 years as a journalist for the BBC, and for others, and was interviewing politicians every day, so I wasn’t completely foreign to the world,” she said.

“It wasn’t like a bunch of one-step-away-from-white-supremacist bloggers that are living just up the street,” she added, taking a swipe at Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and the co-founder of far-right website Breitbart News. “And it turns out they’re completely chaotic.”

Davidson expressed reservations about the decision to invite Trump on a state visit to the UK. “The whole point of state visits is that it’s about having people who share your philosophy – your friends and all the rest of it. That’s the difference from a bilateral summit or whatever,” she said.

“And the thing that I had a problem with is that that could go on while there are members of my own country being banned from [the US], people with joint passports.”

But she concluded: “I will extend, and I’m sure the government of the United Kingdom will extend, every courtesy to the president of the United States when he arrives, as you should with any world leader, but we’re going to want to make sure that any deal we do he’s going to honour. We have to be sure of that.”

It is not the first time the Scottish Tory leader has been critical of Trump. Before he was elected, Davidson was reported by the Herald newspaper as saying the billionaire’s “impetuosity could be dangerous not just for America but for the world”.

A source at the Foreign Office said the official position on the UK-US relationship was well known and had not changed.

Speaking in the Commons last month, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said the UK’s alliance with the US was vital. “On defence, intelligence and security, we work together more closely than any other two countries in the world. That relationship is overwhelmingly to our benefit,” he said.

“The prime minister’s highly successful visit to the White House last week underlined the strength of that transatlantic alliance. Where we have differences with the Unites States, we will not quail from expressing them.”After everything else – after Flynn, after the failure to replace him, after the Ice raids and the impromptu strategy session at Mar-a-Lago, and after yesterday’s bizarre press conference – who does Trump have left on his side?

Burst your bubble: five conservative articles to read as protests stymie Trump Read more

There’s the shrinking minority of Americans who believe he’s doing a good job. There’s Breitbart, the “alt-right” Pepe brigade on Twitter and presumably some within the thinning ranks of his already meager executive branch. And then there’s an increasingly beleaguered band of conservative writers.

This week, Trump lost people on the right who had been warming to him, and forced others to explain themselves to their readers. Some were driven to speculate anew on his mental state, and one of the writers on the right who was one of Trump’s staunchest defenders is now too busy to respond – he has a new job in the White House.

Publication: National Review

Author: “The Editors”, who still speak on behalf of Movement Conservatism, even though Trump has shown that there may be little correspondence between this and actual conservative movements.

Why you should read it: National Review has gone back and forth on Trump. Memorably, during the primary, they dedicated a print issue to tearing him down, and one of their writers flirted with running against him. Later, during and after the general election, a few of them came around to the view that if the left hated him so much, he couldn’t be all bad. Now, an organ forged during the mid-century anticommunist mania has drawn a line at Russia ties. They try to finesse it, and to make it sound reasonable, but there’s an unmistakable whiff of panic in this piece. They want Congress, where they still have friends, to rein Trump in.

Best paragraph: “Following the Times’s story, some on the left are eager to draw up impeachment articles. Meanwhile, some on the right are eager to chalk up any criticisms of the president to ‘fake news’. Both are wrong. The questions facing the Trump administration are still just questions, but they warrant sober, fair-minded examination. This is not a job for the media and its anonymous sources; it’s a job for Congress.

Publication: The Claremont Review

Author: Here, Michael Anton is writing under the pseudonym Publius Decius Mus Anton. He was just made deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications on the United States National Security Council. He has long experience puffing up inarticulate ultraconservatives – he used to write speeches for Rudy Giuliani. During the election he and some collaborators caused a stir by trying to bootstrap an “intellectual Trumpism” into being.

Why you should read it: Anton is the only one of the deeply weird rightwingers surrounding Trump who has written anything like a manifesto. It’s worth revisiting this effort to get a feel for the mental atmosphere of Trumpland. The pseudonym and the clumsy classical allusions give you a whiff of the crusty Euro-trad dreamworld these guys live in. The hope he has for Trump is, more or less, that he will either restore white supremacy, or blow everything up.

Best paragraph: “Oh, right – there’s that other issue. The sacredness of mass immigration is the mystic chord that unites America’s ruling and intellectual classes. Their reasons vary somewhat. The Left and the Democrats seek ringers to form a permanent electoral majority. They, or many of them, also believe the academic-intellectual lie that America’s inherently racist and evil nature can be expiated only through ever greater ‘diversity.’ The junta of course craves cheaper and more docile labor. It also seeks to legitimize, and deflect unwanted attention from its wealth and power by pretending that its open borders stance is a form of noblesse oblige. The Republicans and the ‘conservatives’? Both of course desperately want absolution from the charge of ‘racism’. For the latter, this at least makes some sense. No Washington General can take the court – much less cash his check – with that epithet dancing over his head like some Satanic Spirit. But for the former, this priestly grace comes at the direct expense of their worldly interests.”

Publication: Christian Post

Author: Eric Sapp is an evangelical Christian political consultant. Yes, he has mostly worked with Democrats, but he’s not alone in making the judgment that Trump’s policies are an affront to the teaching of the Gospel.

Why you should read: Even in the campaign, there were Christian Right-ers saying that Trump was not worthy of their support. By and large, they were not heeded, and Trump won on the strength of the evangelical vote. But over time, more and more believers have publicly come to this assessment. Sapp flirts with apocalyptic rhetoric on the way to the conclusion that Trump recognizes no power higher than his own ego.

Best paragraph: “It’s not because he was born the night of a blood moon or has more connections to 666 than he does to Kevin Bacon. It’s because his is a spirit of fear and emptiness, that seeks only to fill his bottomless insecurity with worldly affirmations and idols, instead of humbling himself before the only One who can make him whole. And it is that antichristian spirit that is both leading so many Christians astray and gathering such evil human forces around him in his alt-right and Russian enforcers.”

Publication:The Week

Author: Damon Linker literally wrote the book about the “theocons” who wanted to weld traditionalist Catholicism to other forms of conservative religiosity in order to bolster American political conservatism.

Why you should read: Here, Linker distinguishes Bush-era traditionalist “theocons” from the gloomier “trads” around Trump – principally Steve Bannon. Bannon differs from other trad Catholics in his relish for the prospect of war between Islam and “Christendom”, and his view of “religious affiliation wholly as a function of ethno-national identity” cross the line into something much darker. We need to be careful here – whitewashing Bush-era conservatism has become a national growth industry. But when even the right are calling Trump’s people fascists, we owe them a hearing.

Best paragraph: “Although Bannon enjoys much greater proximity to power than the original theocons ever attained, the mood of his political and religious pronouncements is much closer to the existential gloom (and political extremism) that has (so far) gripped First Things only at its bleakest, most unhinged moments. It’s the same gloom that once permeated the Catholic Church, back in the late 19th century, when it considered itself under siege by and locked in a death-struggle with democracy, liberalism, and modernity.”

Publication: The American Conservative

Author: Freelance defense reporter Kelley Vlahos offers another timely piece of analysis at the American Conservative.

Why you should read: At the next presidential election in 2020, there will be voters who were born after the US first invaded Afghanistan in 2001. Vlahos shows why there is little prospect that Trump will extract us from this mess, and why, in her judgment, it is almost inevitable that Trump will double down. In the chaos of Trump’s first month, few noticed that Gen John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, told the Senate that more troops were needed to break the “stalemate” there. Trump’s defense secretary seems to be on the same page. Trump flirted with isolationism in his campaign rhetoric, but in office he is falling in line with the long-term policy of endless war.

Best paragraph: “According to Nicholson, Afghanistan is ‘a stalemate,’ with no fewer than 20 different terror groups operating there now. In addition to the well-known Taliban and al-Qaeda, there is also an Islamic State franchise, IS in Khorasan Province (ISKP), which has taken responsibility for a recent spate of ruthless suicide bombings in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Without a trace of irony, the general said that after 15 years of war in Afghanistan, the country now ‘has the greatest concentration of terrorist organizations in the world.’”Spain’s Princess Cristina, the sister of King Felipe VI, has been cleared of helping her husband evade taxes after a year-long trial that has further tarnished the image of the royal family and done little to allay public concern over the apparent ubiquity of corruption at the highest levels of Spanish society.

Her husband, Iñaki Urdangarin, was sentenced to six years and three months in prison and fined more than €500,000 after being found guilty of charges including embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion.

Cristina, 51, was the first royal to face criminal charges since the restoration of the Spanish monarchy in 1975 and could have gone to prison for eight years if she had been found guilty. Despite the acquittal, she was ordered to pay a €265,000 fine for “civil responsibility” for benefitting, albeit indirectly and unknowingly, from her husband’s activities.

The princess and her husband were among 18 co-defendants facing a total of 89 charges ranging from fraud and money laundering to trafficking of influences.

Urdangarin, a 49-year-old businessman and former Olympic handball player, was accused of taking advantage of his royal connections to win inflated public contracts to stage sporting and other events and then siphoning off the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle.



The case was heard in Palma de Mallorca, the regional capital of Spain’s Balearic Islands, because many of Urdangarin’s business deals under investigation related to the islands.

Neither Cristina nor her husband were in court for Friday’s verdict.

Urdangarin and his former business partner Diego Torres were accused of embezzling about €6m (£4.6m) in public money that was paid to their non-profit organisation, the Nóos Institute, to organise events. Torres was given an eight-year prison term.

One of the companies that allegedly benefited from Nóos was Aizoon, a real estate firm that Urdangarin owned with his wife. Aizoon was labelled a “front company” in court documents.



The princess was accused of making personal use of Aizoon funds to pay for clothes and dance lessons for the couple’s children, as well as for work on their Barcelona mansion, lowering the firm’s taxable income.

The prosecution claimed Cristina could not have been unaware of her husband’s activities. Questioned in court in February 2014 before she or her husband had been charged, she said she took her husband at his word. During six hours of questioning, she replied “I don’t know” 188 times and “I don’t remember” on 55 occasions.

The princess ended up in court after the far-right pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands) brought a tax evasion case against her using legal provision that allows private groups to start criminal proceedings.

However, the group’s own credibility suffered after its leader was detained for alleged extortion and other charges, and was accused of asking the princess’s lawyers for money in exchange for dropping its accusations against her.

Miquel Roca, a lawyer for the princess, said his client was “satisfied with the acknowledgement of her innocence” but added she remained convinced that her husband was not guilty.

“If we believed in the judicial system when the princess was made to sit in the dock, I think citizens can trust in it when she’s absolved,” Roca told reporters in Barcelona.

A spokesman for the royal family told Spanish media that it respected the court’s decision.

King Felipe has endeavoured to improve his family’s public image since ascending to the throne after the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos, in 2014.

Details of the so-called Nóos case emerged in 2011, and another major turning point in the Spanish public’s view of their royal family occurred a year later when, at the height of the country’s economic crisis, Juan Carlos was pictured on an expensive hunting trip to Botswana.

Cristina and Urdangarin married in 1997 in a lavish ceremony in Barcelona and were bestowed the titles of Duke and Duchess of Palma by Juan Carlos.

The couple’s multimillion-euro mansion has been impounded by the courts and Cristina was notably absent from ceremonies marking Felipe’s ascension to the throne in June 2014.

Felipe removed Cristina and her sister Elena from royal duties when he became king and stripped Cristina of her title of Duchess of Palma a year later as she prepared to face trial.For many people the start of the year is a chance to recover from Christmas excess.

Pep Guardiola vowed to “pray” for Gabriel Jesus’s swift recovery after the Brazilian striker suffered a foot injury in the victory at Bournemouth as Manchester City rose to second in the table and to within eight points of the leaders, Chelsea.

Jesus, a £27m signing from Palmeiras last month, has made an eye-catching start to his career in the Premier League but lasted only 15 minutes here after landing awkwardly and calling for treatment. The 19-year-old duly hobbled down the touchline to be replaced by Sergio Agüero, who would go on to force home the visitors’ second goal off Tyrone Mings, just after the hour to secure City a fourth successive win in all competitions.

City’s medical staff will examine Jesus on Tuesday to ascertain the extent of the damage sustained. “We will know exactly what is wrong in the morning,” said Guardiola. “Hopefully, and I will pray tonight, it will not be a big issue. But I’m so happy for Sergio, for how he played, how he tried, and I thought he had scored. He hadn’t played the last few games because these three guys – Gabriel Jesus, Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling – were amazing but Sergio was important for us before this game and he is still important for us now.”

Sergio Agüero makes his point in Manchester City’s win at Bournemouth Read more

The win hoisted City to second in the table, though Guardiola remains painfully realistic about their chances of reeling in Chelsea. “It’s so difficult,” he said. “They’d have to lose three games and we have to win all our games, and you know how difficult that is in the Premier League. So we have to go game by game, narrow the gap as we go. I watched Chelsea’s game at Burnley on Sunday and that was an amazing performance from Burnley, but still Chelsea played really well. So all we can do is look to continue to improve.

“I was so, so happy with this result. We made a real performance and, in the last 10 to 15 minutes, we did things the right way to make the result certain with a thousand million passes. David Silva passed and passed with Kevin [de Bruyne] and Fernandinho, and that’s the best way to control the counterattacks.

“It’s the first time this year we’ve done that, controlling the game against a side who are difficult if you let them run at you. We did it well at the beginning of the season but, after that, we lost something. I know why. Our game has been more stable since the Arsenal and Tottenham games. But we are improving. Now we have to keep this good momentum.”

Bournemouth have yet to win a game this calendar year but took heart from their display against a resurgent City. Yet their manager, Eddie Howe, was still left to curse injuries sustained by his captain, Simon Francis, and his loanee from Arsenal, Jack Wilshere, which will have to be assessed this week. “Jack is just feeling his ankle,” he said. “I don’t think there’s a major injury there. He just felt he couldn’t move as freely as he wanted to and had a pain in his ankle, so we took him off. Simon is feeling his hamstring again.But we needed a positive response to the Everton game [lost 6-3 last weekend], and we got that. The attitude and motivation to the team was a very good level. Looking to the future, those are important characteristics to the team.

“We need to get our bounce back and that will only come from a win. But that was a positive step forward.”The combination of artistry and emotional directness in this film is overwhelming. Barry Jenkins writes and directs, having adapted Tarell Alvin McCraney’s unproduced play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. Moonlight is about a young African American man and his coming of age, presented as three stages in his life, like the panels of a triptych. The film has power and generosity, giving such full access to his thoughts and feelings that it’s as if you are getting them delivered intravenously. It is the kind of film that leaves you feeling somehow mentally smarter and physically lighter.

Love, sex, survival, mothers and father figures are its themes, the last one foregrounded by the poignant absence of the fathers themselves. Moonlight put me in mind of John Singleton, Terrence Malick and Charles Burnett, but also Edmund White’s A Boy’s Own Story; the structure even had me thinking about Tolstoy’s trilogy: Childhood, Boyhood and Youth. There is an array of visually ravishing dream sequences, epiphanic surges, hallucinatory closeups, lush swathes of music. Jenkins is not shy of breaking out Mozart’s Laudate Dominum over a woozy, wordless scene of kids playing.

The protagonist comes to be named Black: macho, gym-built, with gold teeth; a man of few words. He got out of jail to start a new life far from his Miami home town, ending up in Atlanta, Georgia, “trapping” – that is, dealing on street corners. But Black has a secret: something he keeps hidden from other people, and maybe even himself. He is gay. How did he get here?

‘It’s impossible to be vulnerable’: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US Read more

Jenkins takes us through the scenes of his life: as a kid he is called Little (Alex Hibbert), always getting picked on, worried about his drug-addicted mom, Paula (Naomie Harris). As a teen, he is known by his given name Chiron. Now he is played by Ashton Sanders, and he is recognisably the same kid, only a bit older, slight, spindly, gawky, with a watchful silence that is a symptom of and a defensive strategy against the vicious bullying he endures from Terrel (Patrick Decile), a guy who has a malicious sixth sense for Chiron’s growing relationship with classmate Kevin (played by Jaden Piner as a kid and Jharrel Jerome as a teen). Finally, as a result of rage, self-hate and jail time, Chiron bulks up, grows new layers of muscle and becomes unrecognisable in his last evolutionary stage of development: reinventing himself as Black (Trevante Rhodes). Then he gets a phone call from his past: Kevin (André Holland), is now out of prison himself, an absent father, working as a chef.

The narrative arc is both initiated and held together by a wonderfully charismatic performance from an actor who appears only in the first act: it is Mahershala Ali, playing Juan, the Miami drug-baron with a kindly, fatherly side who protects Little when he sees him getting chased by other kids. Juan lets Little stay at his place occasionally, looks out for him; he gives him a swimming lesson which becomes a kind of baptism. Juan provides food, comfort, support, but also drugs. He is a very questionable caregiver and role model, with an inexpressibly painful and ironic relationship with Little and his mom, and Jenkins shows how Black’s own conflicted destiny follows the example laid down long ago by Juan.

The casting of three different actors is a visible part of the film’s theatrical inheritance: a formally stylised effect, with each new incarnation a jolt, and obviously different from the incremental, almost geological changes achieved in Richard Linklater’s real-time movie Boyhood. But it is not there to distance you. Interestingly, Naomie Harris’s performance is spread out over the movie’s running time and the changes in her character’s appearance are subtler and more naturalistic: she deteriorates with drug use but then achieves a kind of stability and dignity as an older woman. It is a great performance.

Moonlight is moving and mysterious: a dance to the music of time, in its way. But it also shows that the three stages can be considered in parallel, as well as in sequence: Little/Chiron/Black is a palimpsest of identities. Moonlight is a film about masculinity, the wounds and crises of which are the same for all sexualities, but conditioned by the background weather of race and class. “I cry so much sometimes I might turn to drops,” confesses Chiron to Kevin, and, as for so many men, growing up for him is the search for ways to cauterise sadness, to anaesthetise it with rage. Moonlight finds a way to convert it into happiness.A gunman wearing a makeshift suicide vest screamed "Allahu Akbar" as he opened fire in a Spanish supermarket.

The attacker, reportedly carrying gasoline and gunpowder in his pockets, walked into the Mercadona shop, in the As Lagoas district of Ourense, before firing shots into the air.

GREEK OFFICIALS LINK GUN FIRED AT POLICE WITH FAR LEFTISTS

Several shoppers were inside the supermarket when the man entered and fired several shots into the air – alerting emergency services to the attack.

Armed police then reportedly led the gunman out of the shop, telling passers-by to stand back.

The incident, which happened at around 2pm, did not result in any injuries but left shoppers extremely shaken.

According to Spanish media outlet La Region, police officer Carlos Perez, 38, revealed the gunman fired at him and he had to wait for backup.

He and his colleagues were able to detain him after he ran out of ammunition.

This story first appeared in The Sun.Mo Farah has stepped up his criticism of Donald Trump’s attempt to impose a travel ban on people from mainly Muslim countries, calling it “crazy and unfair”, and still has concerns about how he will be treated when he returns home to the United States.

The double 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic champion, who was born in Somalia – one of the seven countries named in the president’s executive order last month – also revealed he had been scared when he heard about Trump’s plans while at his training base in Ethiopia and felt it was important to keep raising the issue on behalf of innocent people whose voices were not being heard.

“It was crazy and unfair,” Farah said. “That’s why I stood up and spoke out. They have made changes for people like me but the hard part was living in the US for six years and going to a training camp and hearing the news I can’t go back and see my kids. That was scary and it was important for me to speak out as there are a lot of innocent people out there who couldn’t say anything.”

The executive order was blocked by the courts but Trump’s threat to push through a revised version as early as next week has Farah concerned. “I’m not a politician and as an athlete you don’t like to get involved in politics but sometimes when it affects you – it affected me and my family – you have to speak up,” he said. “And a lot of people got behind me.”

Farah, who will compete in the 5,000m at the Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham on Saturday, also said he had worries over whether he would be stopped and interrogated by border guards when he returned to his home in Portland, Oregon. “Yes, I’ve had issues before,” he said. “Hopefully it will be fine, and I always try to look on the bright side of life. But I go back in March and see my family and at that point we will see.”

Farah nodded when the 110m world record holder, the American Aries Merritt, who is also competing in Birmingham on Saturday, gave an eloquent condemnation of Trump’s behaviour as president. “The way his administration has been running is not normal,” Merritt said. “We have seen a lot of deceit, a lot of lies and slander and it’s not something that makes me proud to be an American at this point. But hopefully Congress and the Senate will keep him in check as best as they can.”

For now Farah’s primary focus is on his first race since finishing a sluggish seventh at the Edinburgh International XCountry last month. He believes he will be more like his old self following four weeks of hard grind in Ethiopia when he faces a field who include the Scot Andrew Butchart, who was sixth over 5,000m at the Rio Olympics.

“Edinburgh was not what I wanted,” Farah said. “It was a wake-up call to get back into full training. Sometimes you have to be honest with yourself, rewind and refocus. I had a little bit of break after Rio and spent time with my kids and family but I needed to be back training and pushing myself. At Edinburgh I wasn’t quite ready.

“There are a lot of athletes out there who are training hard and want to beat you so you’ve got to go back to basics and training camp. The last four weeks have been hard work and I’ve been cranking up the miles, so it will be nice to see where I am, but I’m definitely in better shape.”

Farah could find himself eclipsed by Laura Muir, who has her eye on a world record when she competes over the little-run 1,000m distance. The 23-year-old from Scotland has set a British 5,000m and a European 3,000m record indoors on the track this winter and is targeting Kelly Holmes’ British best of 2:32.55 set in 1997, as well as Maria Mutola’s world mark of 2:30.94.

“It will be a great opportunity and I can’t believe I’m at the standard that it can be a possibility,” Muir said. “I’m really looking forward to the weekend and seeing what I can go out there and do.”

The British 100m and 200m record holder, Dina Asher-Smith, who fractured her foot in training on Thursday, will not compete. She is another high-profile absentee after Katarina Johnson-Thompson withdrew and had been expected to take on the Olympic 100m and 200m champion, Elaine Thompson, and the world indoor 60m champion, Barbara Pierre.

Asher-Smith tweeted: “Last session before the grand prix, last reactive jump, and I land awkwardly on my foot and fracture it. What are the odds? Gutted!”Though it was ostensibly called to announce his new nominee for the Department of Labor, Donald Trump’s 77-minute freewheeling press conference on Thursday spent little time on the matter.

Instead, speaking to a room of reporters who repeatedly sought to clarify when and if Trump staffers had had contact with Russians, he recast the event as a referendum on reporters everywhere.

This press conference is proof Donald Trump will never be presidential | Ben Jacobs Read more

The president claimed that the media served not the people but “special interests”, reaping profits from a rigged system, and he sought to tar the press as universally untrustworthy. “The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. The press are out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control,” he said.

He launched aggressive broadsides at individual journalists, as when Trump asked black journalist April Ryan if she would schedule a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus for him. “Are they friends of yours?” he said.

And Trump referred to the media as an entrenched “power structure” and vowed to go around it entirely. “We’re not going to let it happen. I’m here again to take my message straight to the people,” he said.

Every president fights with the press at some point. But the hostile dynamic Trump has established with his own press corps is without historical precedent, say political science scholars and journalists.

“This level of public vitriol directed at the news media by the president is unprecedented in American history,” said Mark Feldstein, a former CNN correspondent and professor of journalism at the University of Maryland.

“No president has ever declared war and given such loud voice to that unhappiness in his very first week. Actually, his very first day,” said George Condon, a former president of the White House Correspondents Association who spent a career covering presidents.

Trump’s White House has been off to a rocky start. Less than a month into his tenure, during what is traditionally a honeymoon period, Trump has the lowest approval ratings of any recent president at this point. His former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is the shortest-serving in history after being forced out following an inappropriate discussion with the Russian ambassador. And Trump’s cabinet is one of the slowest to be filled in history.

Trump is blaming the media for these failings as the bearer of bad news, not its creator, said Frank Sesno, a veteran former journalist who runs the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University.

“It is not the media that made the call to the Russians. It is not the media that apparently lied to the vice-president. It is not the media that prompted six Republicans to tank the labor secretary nominee. It’s not the media that ruled against the immigration ban,” Sesno said. “Instead, he’s isolating, accusing, distracting, demonizing and blaming others.”

“The media is the messenger and what we saw … is he’s willing to try to discredit them by any means necessary,” said the Dartmouth political science professor Brendan Nyhan, who studies the interaction of politics and the media.

The American fourth estate has endured through difficult moments.

Sedition acts passed under presidents John Adams in the late 18th century and Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th made it a criminal offense to criticize the government.

But these situations – the instability of the nascent American government and world war, respectively – are without parallel in modern times. And neither president ever stooped to publicly attacking the press the way Trump does, Feldstein said. “They did not seem obsessed with the issue. They viewed these as emergency measures that were necessary to protect national security.”

Feldstein, who wrote the book on Richard Nixon’s toxic relationship with the press, said Trump should see a warning in Nixon, who similarly treated the press with contempt. “That gained him some mileage when running for office and appealed to the Republican party at the time,” said Feldstein. “But ultimately he was impaled on that kind of paranoid bunker mentality and I think Trump risks the same happening to him.”

Trump’s hostility toward the press did not start with his inauguration. As a candidate, he held the media in pens during his rallies, urged supporters to boo reporters, threatened to “open up” libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists,

and regularly banned entire outlets from his events on a whim.

But the “pivot” pundits predicted when Trump became president has yet to materialize , even after he took the oath of office last month.

Trump’s media obsession is often dismissed as a sign of his poor temperament. But it’s also a political strategy that allows him to change the subject of debate from one of substance to matters of tribal allegiance, according to Nyhan.

“This is the conversation Trump wants to have,” said Nyhan. “There is a method to his madness.”

Trump’s re-election campaign even fundraised using the press conference, telling supporters in an email that they were the “last line of defense” against the media.

People tell pollsters that they hate Congress but keep re-electing their individual representatives, and the same can be said of journalism. People hate “the media ”, but are loyal to individual outlets and reporters.

By taking on the media as a whole, Nyhan note d, Trump has a built-in advantage – an individual versus a unpopular institution.

“It’s a massive problem that I don’t think we’re really grasping with as an institution,” said a White House reporter who declined to be named out of fear of retribution from Trump officials.

So how can journalists respond?

According to Sesno, the former CNN anchor turned academic, journalists need to do a better job of explaining their value and process.

For instance, Trump has painted leakers as vile and unpatriotic. But the press should also defend them as whistleblowers who help hold government accountable. “How do we explain that leaks are part of the process of both journalism and democracy?” he said.

It also means stepping back and admitting some of journalism’s problems, Sesno said, such as elitism and a lack of connection with, for instance, rural white working-class voters.

Feldstein thought there was reason for Trump to reconsider his strategy, too. To explain, he cited the old adage : “Never pick a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel.”

“Ultimately the media does have the last word,” Feldstein said, “including literally writing his obituary when he dies. So there are long-term costs he will face for his approach.”Last week Melissa McCarthy’s take on White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live became an instant sensation, prompting much delight in President Trump’s reported unhappiness with seeing his press secretary portrayed by a woman and spawning an internet campaign to have Trump’s long-term foe Rosie O’Donnell play his advisor Steve Bannon on the show.

There was no sign of O’Donnell, but it was a no-brainer for the show to bring back McCarthy for a real cold open this time, to wild cheers from the audience.

McCarthy’s portrayal remains an incredible political spoof – active and visual in a broad comedic way, while also jam-packed with knowing references to Spicer’s ineptitude behind the podium.

Initially claiming that this “new Spicey” was now calmer, he immediately stumbled over a list of central Asian names before explaining the travel ban using dolls “so you dumb babies can understand it”. His list of “unreported terrorist attacks” included the slaughter at Fraggle Rock and The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down; shilling for Ivanka’s accessories included a Rockette-esque kick to show off a patterned pump.



The formula for these sketches became unavoidable when Spicer pulled out a leaf blower to disrupt a reporter’s question, a direct echo of last week’s Super Soaker gag. And again, when asked if he was OK, Spicer thrust his podium into the press in fury, this time on a motorized stand that allowed him to do loops through the crowd. It was a solid and necessary cold open, but it’s probably the last time we need to see this sketch for a bit – until the real-life Spicer’s routine changes, there won’t be quite enough new for SNL to play with.

Everything else:

Alec Baldwin hosted for a record 17th time, but his monologue left a lot to be desired. Bantering with 23-year-old cast member Pete Davidson about ageing, it was stilted but still studded with a few good lines – “At what point when you get older does your head, like, expand?” asked Davidson.

A pre-tape chocolate commercial about an ill-fated attempt to blend Valentine’s Day and Black History month had a good shock factor, when two African American girlfriends – Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones – opened up their heart-shaped boxes to find the faces of prominent African Americans carved into miniature chocolates, given to them by their white boyfriends, Alex Moffat and Baldwin. The best jokes came from the thematically appropriate candy flavors – Dr Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Cream” – paired with the disgust of the women and the cluelessness of the men.

The most controversial sketch of the night returned to the fruitful relationship between CNN’s Jake Tapper and White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway in another movie-inspired pre-tape. SNL is clearly less sympathetic to Conway in the new year, this time having her go full Fatal Attraction after Tapper refused to have her on his show.

“We can’t have you on TV if you’re just gonna keep lying,” Tapper says to the lingerie-wearing Conway.

“It’s just a little ethics violation,” she pouts. “Think of the clicks!”

It only got darker from there, hinting ominously at the depths Conway will go to keep her face on our screens.

Weekend Update this week was a solid offering, though the flaw of having several political sketches plus Weekend Update starts become clear when the same obvious areas for mockery – this week, the Nordstrom controversy – get over-played. Referring to the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as the “new confederate general”, Colin Jost poked Sessions for losing out on an 80s judgeship for his problematic racial views: “If there’s one thing that usually makes racists better, it’s age”.

Michael Che challenged Trump on his seemingly endless life of enemies: “Donald, is this really how you want to spend the last two years of your life?” Kate McKinnon swung by as an answer-seeking Elizabeth Warren, challenging Jost and Che on their claim as full cast members before conceding that she never seems to stop: “My Fitbit says check engine.” The strong showing was filled out by Alex Moffat as a rambling douchebag who just bought a boat, and Jones and Mikey Day as a couple who recently tried S&M with violent results.

Having had some time to do his full hair and makeup during the musical performance and Update, Baldwin’s Trump finally emerged, this time to defend his travel ban in Judge Judy’s People’s Court. The sketch had a few good jokes – Trump thinking a female judge is called a flight attendant, Vladimir Putin arriving to defend Trump in court – but the biggest reaction came from Judge Judy (Cecily Strong) yelling at the president, “I want one day without a CNN alert that scares the hell out of me!” to a cheer from the audience.

The final two sketches were more clever than hysterical. Former cast member Tracy Morgan returned to play one of Beyonce’s in-utero twins alongside Kenan Thompson. Then in a pre-tape, Leslie Jones fought for the right to play Trump in a meta-reference to an online movement to have only female actors playing Trump and his whole cabinet. The Beyonce sketch was odd but lacked the brilliant madness of the best late-show sketches, while the Leslie pre-tape was slick, but couldn’t stick the landing.OKC may lag behind Golden State since Kevin Durant’s defection – but Saturday’s bad-tempered clash showed there’s plenty of needle between the two teams

Do Steven Adams and Russell Westbrook haunt the Warriors’ dreams? If you watched Saturday’s game, the first between the two teams since Kevin Durant defected to the Warriors, without paying attention to the score, the question would seem absurd.

James Dolan's feud with Charles Oakley: what was the Knicks owner thinking? Read more

The boisterous crowd made Saturday’s clash feel much bigger than a normal regular-season NBA game – but it wasn’t actually competitive. It was the Thunder’s third loss to the Warriors this season, and for the third time in a row the final score was noticeably lopsided. Looking just at the numbers, there was no question that Durant’s return to Chesapeake Energy Arena, one of the most anticipated games of the year, ended up being a terrible anticlimax.

What Saturday’s game lacked in drama, however, it made up for in atmosphere. No matter how far behind the Thunder trailed, the fans never stopped taunting Durant and his new team. Draymond Green also got into it, with a fan who may have been deploying racist language.

Tempers flared on court, as well. Durant and Westbrook, his former mate, were particularly heated. At one point Durant answered Westbrook’s shouts of “I’m coming” with a dismissive: “You’re losing, though.” In the third quarter, Durant confronted the Thunder’s Andre Roberson after the latter committed a particularly hard foul, an event that earned them both technicals. It was a chippy game all night, as pride remained on the line long after the result was decided.

Durant scored 34 points in the game, which would normally be enough to quiet down the opposing team’s crowd, but that wasn’t quite possible this time. No matter how far behind the home team were, the fans in Oklahoma simply refused to let him off the hook.

For many, the gap in quality between the two teams remains far too wide for a genuine rivalry to emerge. Westbrook might share that belief. When asked if he thought the two teams were rivals, Westbrook said no, but he didn’t offer anything more than: “Because I don’t.”

Last season was different. There’s no question that the Thunder had a rivalry with the Warriors, something which became especially obvious when they pushed the Warriors to seven games in their epic Western Conference finals, nearly coming up with the all-time upset that the Cleveland Cavaliers eventually pulled off.

Things are very different this season – for a very obvious reason. Losing one of the best players in the league to the Warriors, the team that had just eliminated them the previous postseason, was the kind of devastating blow that very few teams have ever experienced. With one transaction, the Thunder went from one of the top teams in the West to one that was going to have to fight for one of the lower playoff seeds. Last year, there was a gap between these two teams. Now it’s an abyss.

And yet, the question persists: do two teams need to be in the same weight class to have a rivalry? Saturday’s game provides a strong argument that it’s not necessarily the case. Which brings us to the cupcakes.

See, back in July, after Durant left, Westbrook posted on Instagram a seemingly harmless picture of a cupcake stand. It wasn’t until a little later, that its true meaning came to light: the cakes represented a subtle swing at Durant for being “soft” – and taking the easiest path to a ring by joining the best team in the NBA.

So, for Durant’s return, Thunder fans took the cupcake theme and ran with it: cupcake signs, cupcake chants, cupcake shirt, even people dressed up in cupcake costumes.

All of this was incredibly corny: there was an unmistakable mom-just-discovered-Facebook-memes vibe to the whole affair. But what made it so amusing was the punchline. When the Warriors talked to the media after their win, they did so while wearing the same cupcake shirts that the Thunder fans wore during the game.

That fans would needle the opposing team isn’t necessarily a sign of true rivalry, but it’s telling that the team should take the time to troll them back. Would they have responded in such a way to the Utah Jazz or Portland Trail Blazers?

Saturday’s game was the perfect example of how rivalries aren’t fully dependent on how competitive the teams happen to be. It was a game where fans treated a regular season double-digit loss like it was a tied game in the playoffs. The stakes were high on Saturday – and they’ll likely remain high for as long as Durant remains with the Warriors.The Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, has denounced what he calls a “coordinated, cruel and almost evil smear campaign” that he claims has been run against him by people questioning his connection to the Hillsborough football tragedy.

Nuttall, who became leader last year, refused to answer questions from reporters asking him to prove he had been at Hillsborough as he took to the stage at Ukip’s spring conference in Bolton on Friday.

But he was supported by the party’s former leader Nigel Farage, who said he’d known since 2005 that Nuttall had been present at the 1989 football disaster. He blamed the Labour party for insinuations that Nuttall was not at the fateful match.

During a 16-minute speech at the Macron stadium, Nuttall said he had endured a tough week, having been forced to admit that claims on his website that he had lost close friends at Hillsborough were not true. A party press officer took the blame but Nuttall would not accept her resignation.



He said: “I take the blame for the fact that I failed to check what had been put up on my website. That is my fault and I apologise. But I do not apologise for what is a coordinated, cruel and almost evil smear campaign that has been directed at me.

“It is based in lies from sources who have not been named. It has been a tough week for me but I will not allow it to break me and I will not allow them to break Ukip.”

The 40-year-old Liverpudlian, who is trying to unseat Labour in the Stoke Central byelection, received a warm welcome from 300-400 delegates. “I was also asked by two journalists yesterday if I still had the support of my party,” he said, to cries of “yes!”, extended applause and a standing ovation. He looked surprised and took off his glasses, apparently wiping away tears.



Nuttall suggested he was being targeted because of next Thursday’s byelection. “We all know why this has happened and we all know why this has happened now. It is because of a byelection and the fact that we have the Labour party on the run,” he said.

Leaving the stage flanked by bouncers, he again refused to answer questions from the waiting media, saying simply: “I’ve said absolutely everything I want to say on the matter.”

One of Nuttall’s former teachers, a Roman Catholic priest, has told the Guardian that the school believed it had been aware of the identities of every boy who had been at Hillsborough in order to help them through a difficult period, and that Nuttall was not among them. A fellow pupil at the school who says he has been a friend of Nuttall for decades said the Ukip leader had never mentioned being there.

But speaking before his own conference speech on Friday, former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Nuttall did not have further questions to answer about Hillsborough.

Farage also piled the pressure on Nuttall to win Stoke. “I don’t think anybody can underplay for one moment how important, how fundamental, that byelection is for the futures of the Labour party and indeed Ukip,” he said in his speech. “It matters hugely.

“I think the Labour party, questioning the fact he [Nuttall] was there, have questions to answer.”

Nuttall first mentioned to him that he had been at Hillsborough “when he [Nuttall] was about 26”, Farage said.

When the Guardian pointed out that at 26 Nuttall stood for the Conservatives as a candidate in Sefton and did not join Ukip until 2004, when he would have been 27 or 28, Farage conceded that he might have “been out by a couple of years” and said they first met in 2005.

After joining Ukip Nuttall moved to Brussels to work for one of its MEPs, John Whittaker, and lodged in Towler’s basement in the city.

Farage said Nuttall should not be blamed for not checking his own website: “I’ve never checked mine. Never. And I tell you what, I bet there is hardly anyone in frontline politics that checks everything that’s put out in his name.”

Last year Nuttall blamed a Ukip press officer for misleading statements on his website that said he had once been a professional footballer with Tranmere Rovers, when in fact he had only played for the club’s youth side. He also disowned his profile page on the LinkedIn social networking site, which implied he had a PhD even though he never completed his doctoral studies.

Suzanne Evans, Ukip’s health spokeswoman – who was beaten to the party leadership by Nuttall last year, said she believed Nuttall and that the “close personal friend” claim was forgivable: “It was clearly a mistake. Paul’s not the sort of person who tells fibs. There was clearly a mistake made, the person responsible for it admitted it, Paul’s been very magnanimous about that. Job done.”

Asked if she thought it curious that Nuttall’s schoolfriend had insisted he had never mentioned being at Hillsborough during his school days, Evans said: “No. Paul is in a catch-22 position. If he mentions it, he is exploiting it, if he doesn’t mention it, there’s something suspicious going on.”Iwould love to feast the night away at one of Taipei’s many food markets. Freshly made dumplings, bowls of hot noodles, fried chicken, sticky rice, Chinese tea eggs, oyster omelette, fermented tofu, mochi balls… I’d be the one arriving very early and leaving very late. But I recently experienced the next best thing when my friend Garry Bar-Chang (whose mum is Taiwanese) cooked a bunch of chilli-, ginger- and garlic-heavy Taiwanese dishes for the Ottolenghi team. We were all expecting steamed buns, but instead we got a beef soup with an unbelievably deep flavour and three lip-smacking (and burning) stir-fries. He shared his kitchen secrets with me; get frying.

Quick sea bass with ginger and garlic

Have everything prepped before you start cooking, because it all happens very quickly once you do. Serves four with some steamed rice.

2 tsp rice-wine vinegar

6cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thin julienne strips, plus 1 tsp finely grated ginger

8 garlic cloves, peeled: 6 finely sliced, 2 finely grated

2 tbsp sunflower oil

4 skin-on sea bass fillets

1½ red chillies, cut in half lengthways, deseeded and cut into julienne strips

4 spring onions, trimmed and cut on an angle into 3mm-thick slices

2½ tbsp light soy sauce (Kikkoman is my go-to brand for this)

Mix the vinegar, grated ginger and grated garlic, and set aside.

Put the oil in a large saute pan on a high heat. Once hot, lay in two fish fillets skin side down, cook for a minute, then flip and cook for 30 seconds more. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining fish (you should have enough oil left in the pan). Once cooked, transfer to the plate and leave the pan on the heat. Fry the julienned ginger for 30 seconds, stirring continuously, then add the sliced garlic and chilli, and stir-fry for another minute, until golden. Add the spring onion, stir-fry for a minute, then stir in the rice vinegar mixture, soy sauce and 75ml cold water. Return the fish to the pan, just to warm through, and serve.

Beef noodle soup

Beef noodle soup is ubiquitous in Taiwan. Everyone has their own version and everyone thinks theirs in the best; Garry’s is based on the recipe he learned from his mum, Mei-Hui Li. A pressure cooker will cut the cooking time dramatically: add the spring onion before you close the lid, then, once the cooker is hissing, steam for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and leave to stand for 30 minutes, until the pressure drops and it’s safe to open. Serves six.



8 star anise

5g dried liquorice sticks (if you can’t get hold of any, up the star anise to 12)

2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns

½ tsp fennel seeds

50ml sunflower oil

1.2kg beef shin, boned, cut into 5cm chunks and patted dry

6cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 2mm slices

10 large garlic cloves, peeled and roughly crushed with the flat of a knife

2 red chillies, cut in half lengthways and deseeded

200ml Chinese rice wine

60ml premium dark soy sauce

150ml light soy sauce (again, Kikkoman for preference)

3 tbsp demerara sugar

2.8 litres boiling water

6 spring onions, trimmed and cut in half widthways

250g dry udon noodles

Put the first four ingredients in muslin and tie into a bundle.

In a 30cm-wide and very deep pot for which you have a lid, heat the oil on a high flame. Once it’s very hot, add the beef (take care, because the oil will spit) and saute for about three minutes, stirring frequently, until the meat is browned (depending on the size of your pan, it may be better to do this in two batches). Add the ginger and stir-fry for three minutes, then add the garlic, chilli and muslin bundle, and stir-fry for six minutes more. Don’t worry if things start sticking to the base of the pan, because it will be deglazed later by the liquids.

Add the rice wine, both soy sauces, the sugar and boiling water, and stir to combine. (If your pan struggles to accommodate all that in one go, hold back some of the water and add it later, once some of the liquid in the pan has evaporated.) Bring to a boil, cover, turn the heat to medium and leave to cook for 90 minutes. After this time, add the spring onions, cover and cook for another hour.

When the soup is nearly ready, cook the noodles as per the packet instructions, then divide between six bowls, top with the soup (discard the muslin bundle) and serve.

Stir-fried cabbage with garlic and chilli

You can buy Japanese-style flat cabbages in Chinese and Middle Eastern supermarkets. They are much sweeter than normal white cabbage and cook far more quickly, too. You could use regular cabbage here, but you’ll need to cook it for a bit longer and it won’t go quite as crisp. This is a lovely accompaniment to stir-fried pork and sticky rice. Serves four as a side dish.

3 tbsp sunflower oil

6 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly sliced

2 red chillies, deseeded, and cut widthways into 2cm pieces

5 spring onions, trimmed and cut on an angle into 3cm pieces

½ Japanese-style flat white cabbage (see introduction), leaves separated and roughly torn in half)

¾ tsp salt

Heat the oil in a large saute pan on a high flame. Once hot, stir-fry the garlic and chilli for a minute, until golden, then add the spring onions and stir-fry for two minutes. Add the cabbage in stages (it will wilt and shrink down as it cooks), and the salt and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the cabbage is cooked and soft, but still retains some bite. Leave to rest for five minutes before serving.

Pork and preserved vegetable stir-fry

The inspiration for this dish came from Garry’s love of the savoury, crunchy preserved vegetable topping that’s sprinkled on top of noodle soup. He’s essentially converted that topping into the star turn of a main course dish. These preserved vegetables are not the easiest ingredient to find, granted, but that’s a perfect excuse for a trip to Chinatown (or for an online shop). I used the Fish Well brand’s preserved mustard greens; feel free to experiment with other preserved vegetables. You can buy sprouted mung beans from healthfood shops and some supermarkets, but they’re also very easy to sprout at home: soak about 100g mung beans in water overnight, drain, then leave for two days in a bowl covered with a clean tea towel. Rinse them once or twice a day, adding a little water, and they’ll sprout before too long. Make more than you need for this, because they’re lovely sprinkled over all kinds of salads. Serves four with some sticky rice.

20g cornflour

2 tsp premium dark soy sauce

40ml light soy sauce (Kikkoman, ideally)

500g pork loin fillet, cut into 3-4mm-thick slices

320g Chinese preserved mustard greens or other preserved vegetables (see introduction)

75ml sunflower oil

2 red chillies, deseeded, cut in half lengthways and then into 2cm pieces

6 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced

6 spring onions, cut into 2cm pieces

200g sprouting mung beans

In a medium bowl, combine the cornflour, dark soy sauce and two teaspoons of the light soy sauce, to make a thin paste. Toss the pork in the paste, making sure it’s covered all over, then leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes. (After marinating, separate the pork slices, because they may have clumped together.)

Wash the preserved vegetables in cold water, drain and set aside.

Heat two tablespoons of oil in a wok or large frying pan on a high flame. Once the oil is very hot, add the pork, spreading out the pieces so they don’t overlap, and leave to fry for 30 seconds. Turn over the pork, again making sure the slices don’t overlap, and fry for another 30 seconds, until golden-brown. Transfer the pork to a plate, wipe clean the pan and return to a high heat.

Heat another three tablespoons of oil in the pan and, once very hot, stir-fry the chilli and garlic for 30 seconds. Add the spring onions, stir-fry for a minute, then add the preserved vegetables and stir-fry for another two minutes. Return the pork to the pan, add the final two tablespoons of light soy sauce, and stir-fry for three minutes. Take off the heat, stir in the sprouting beans and serve at once.

• Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi and Nopi in London.Some are calling it Nintendo’s last chance. At least at manufacturing a games console. The creator of smash-hit machines since the original Nintendo Entertainment System in 1983 suffered an ignoble commercial failure with Wii U. Announced last year and revealed in full on Friday, the new Nintendo Switch machine has a lot to prove.

Why I am confident enough to pre-order a Nintendo Switch Read more

It’s a typically idiosyncratic creation. Described as a hybrid system, it works as a traditional home console, plugging into your TV, but it can also be slid out of its dock and played on the go, via a built in screen. The concept is fascinating, merging the portable and home experiences into one product, but what about the practice?

On Friday afternoon, Nintendo held hands-on events in several cities around the world. Outside the Hammersmith Apollo in London, a long queue of lucky fans, media types and industry insiders waited patiently, many bleary-eyed from having stayed up until 4am watching Nintendo’s Switch console livestream from Tokyo. All were eager to get inside, away from the cold and towards Nintendo’s future. Here’s what we discovered.

Hands-on with the machine

Immediate first impressions. It’s small. The central tablet-shaped unit is smaller than a Wii U GamePad and has the same size screen - 6.2 inches, which is smaller than an iPad Mini. The dock through which you connect the device to your television is just a little bulkier. The Joy-Con controllers, which can be connected to the sides of the Switch to turn it into a handheld console, are tiny. Wrap your fingers around them, perhaps for a motion-controlled game of boxing, and they almost feel like they could disappear. You might want to actually wear your wrist strap for these, and don’t let your children run off with them or you’ll never find them again.

Still, with their curved edges and soft finish the Joy-Con are surprisingly comfortable in every possible configuration. The grip that turns a pair of Joy-Con into something that resembles a standard controller might look a bit silly - and canine - but it nestles snugly in the hand. It was difficult, however, to get a proper feel for the weight of both the grip and the handheld mode with Joy-Con attached to either side of the screen, because they were all attached to their stands with thick security cables.

Because of the security measures, it wasn’t possible to try much of the actual switching that gives the console its name, with one exception. When playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, attendees could switch from television to handheld mode by removing the Switch from its dock, which proved to be almost instant, and back again, which took a second longer. Placing the Switch in its dock didn’t seem to quite have the satisfactory click expected, but that might again be blamed on the thick cable throwing off the balance.

Attendees weren’t allowed to try attaching the Joy-Con to the grip or the Switch itself, but the different games around the room were set up to be played in different ways. In handheld mode, games were displayed at 60fps and 720p, which looks pretty good on a screen that small. Some games were set up with the Switch as the display and the controllers detached, and for those it was common to see players leaning in to see more closely. It works, but is best saved for when you can’t use a television.

Importantly, while it wasn’t usually possible to test physical switching from one mode to another, moving between games set up to be played in different ways felt natural. Those with experience with the likes of analog sticks and triggers should have no problems adapting to the feel of the different control methods.



Hands-on with the games

Here are the titles we got a chance to play.

Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

Given the popularity of this long-running adventure series, it’s unsurprising that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the only game with a substantial queue. Many of the attendees had already played this demo at E3, but on a Wii U. The Switch version is largely similar, right down to the existence of Link’s Sheikah Slate, which was obviously meant to reflect the second-screen experience provided by the Wii U GamePad – an experience you can’t have on Switch because when it’s docked, the screen is not visible. You can of course undock your Switch and explore that beautiful world – 720p but still lovely – on the go, if only for up to three hours at a time.

1-2 Switch (Nintendo; launch title)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest 1-2 Switch. Photograph: Nintendo

The game that best showed off what the Joy-Con can do was 1-2-Switch, a collection of mini games designed to get players looking away from the screen and at each other. Each mini game on show was one-on-one competitive multiplayer, each player using a single Joy-Con to perform some action mimicking real life.

Quick Draw and Samurai Training use the accelerometer and gyro-sensors inside the controllers to test your reaction times, by respectively asking you to shoot your opponent or catch the sword they swing through your open hands. The latter also demonstrates the sturdiness of the Joy-Con, since you catch the sword by clapping the controller in your hand.

Ball Count and Safe Crack demonstrate the “HD rumble” technology in the devices that can make it feel like there are little balls rolling around inside the controller. Nintendo claimed that the rumble tech is so intricate it can even make the Joy-Con feel like a tumbler full of ice cubes. It’s cool, but unlikely to be used to its full extent in many games.

But the 1-2-Switch mini game everyone was talking about was Milk, for which you hold the Joy-Con vertically, wrap your fingers around it, and move it up and down while applying rhythmic pressure to the top and bottom in turn. You know, to milk a cow. In the background, the screen shows a stylised view of a cow’s teats delivering the ... product. Unsurprisingly, footage has already been a hit on social media.

These mini games are great the first time you try them, and would probably go down well at parties, just like the original Wii games did a decade ago, but the collection lacks the lasting appeal required to justify a purchase. It’s a shame Nintendo hasn’t chosen to bundle it in with the console, especially given the popularity of Wii Sports.

Snipperclips (Nintendo; March 2017)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Snipperclips. Photograph: Nintendo

Another game that caused a lot of buzz on the showroom floor was a cooperative 2D puzzle game that involves two shapes with feet and faces cutting chunks out of each other in order to create new shapes and solve challenges. Played in pairs with a Joy-Con each, Snipperclips fits well with the tendency players have to lean in when using the Switch on its kickstand as the display. Its unique mechanic feels very refreshing, and appropriate for a Nintendo console, but Snipperclips might not be as new as it seems. A very similar game called Friendshapes, from brothers Tom and Adam of SFB Games, was playable at EGX’s Leftfield Collection back in 2015.

Arms (Nintendo; March 2017)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Arms. Photograph: Nintendo

Arms is reminiscent of the boxing game in Wii Sports, albeit with characters whose arms extend on springs and end in a variety of weapons. Hold two Joy-Con vertically and turned so that the buttons face inwards – which is still comfortable but makes you grateful for the wrist strap – and punch. You can also tilt the controllers to move, turn them inwards to shield, punch both at once to grab, press L and R to dash and jump, and press ZL or ZR to use a character’s special move - heal while shielding, hover, teleport and so on. There’s plenty of strategy here, but just as boxing was the lesser played of the Wii Sports games because it required each player to have a nunchuck, Arms is likely to suffer from its need for two Joy-Con each, especially given their listed price of £75 a pair.

Splatoon 2 (Nintendo; summer 2017)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Splatoon 2. Photograph: Nintendo

Despite promises of a full sequel, Splatoon 2 feels very similar to the original, which will probably be just fine for those who racked up dozens or hundreds of hours and just want more of the same, or those who skipped the Wii U altogether and will experience it for the first time on Switch. The demo did include one new weapon, Splat Dualies, which let your squid shoot their coloured ink from both hands at once. Using motion controls – in this case in handheld mode – still feels gimmicky, fun at first but not ideal for fast-paced competitive play.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo; 28 April)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Photograph: Nintendo

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe isn’t pretending to be anything more than an upgraded version of Mario Kart 8, which will suit both those who want to bring that experience with them when they upgrade from Wii U to Switch, and those who’ve never played the game before. Changes include the introduction of a battle mode, some new characters including ones from Splatoon, and an optional smart steering feature that keeps players on the track.

But the biggest Switch-specific feature, of course, is the ability to play in many different ways. At the event, attendees could play eight-player local multiplayer in handheld mode, with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller in television mode, or with the Switch on its kickstand and two players each using one Joy-Con in a tiny steering wheel. Any way you play it, Mario Kart 8 is still great.

Fast RMX (Shin’en; March 2017)

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fast RMX. Photograph: Nintendo

This colourful futuristic racer looked great in 1080p and 60fps on the television mode, but it would have been good to test out how it plays in handheld mode, whether you can still play two-player splitscreen and if that causes the frame-rate to drop. Still, with little more to worry about than staying on the track and switching your anti-gravity vehicle’s colour in time to catch boost strips, Fast RMX is good simple fun.

And the rest

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sonic Mania. Photograph: Sega

Sonic Mania (Sega; Spring 2017) was described as a homage to Sonic. It’s neither a new game nor strictly a reboot. The demo was the first level of the original Sonic but with added Tails and dash ability, and a different boss encounter at the end.

Skylanders Imaginators (Toys for Bob; Activision; 3 March) was demonstrated the NFC, with players bringing Skylanders into the game by tapping them against the right Joy-Con. It works well, but feels less magical than placing them on a solid pedestal.

Super Bomberman R (Konami; 3 March) was also played with two players with a Joy-Con each, leaning into the Switch on its kickstand. This setup seems to work well for retro-type games, and we’ll probably see more come to Switch.



Just Dance 2017 (Ubisoft; 3 March) also worked well with each player holding just one Joy-Con, their small size and light weight an advantage for those who want to forget they’re holding a controller at all.

Our verdict

As its name suggests, the main selling point of the Switch is the ability to play it in all sorts of different configurations. Though it was disappointing not to be allowed to try many of these actions at the event, most of the configurations were available and proved viable even if they sacrificed some resolution or power or – in the case of leaning in to better see the Switch on its kickstand – comfort. The question is whether people will see these options as reason enough to buy.

If we’re going to question the necessity of certain features, when will we see why the Switch needed a capacitive touch screen? What games will make the HD rumble worth whatever extra cost it added to the expensive Joy-Con controllers? Without having 1-2-Switch bundled in with every console, will players care about the motion controls and will developers bother to create more games that use them? Will there be enough online content to justify paying a monthly subscription after the free introductory period ends?

Of course, you could just see these features as a bonus to a console that looks and feels great, but then the selling point has to be the games. As far as launch titles go the Switch is lacking, but then the hardcore fans who’ll buy the console on day one will likely be satisfied with just the huge open-world Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And for those who wait for Christmas there’ll be lots more to choose from, supposedly including a new open-world Mario game in Super Mario Odyssey.

As for third-party developers, word on the show floor was that the Switch is far easier to develop for than the Wii U, which could translate to better third-party support. Given the architecture is apparently similar to the latest Sony and Microsoft machines, it should at least be easier for developers to port across their PS4 and Xbox One games to bulk out the Switch library. Whether they do this or not will depend on whether the console shows signs of success. Low initial sales can quickly cause a vicious cycle in which publishers withdraw support and further lower a console’s chances.

This was a fun event, filled with familiar Nintendo experiences, but doubts remain. Given what happened with the Wii U, here’s hoping Nintendo can switch things up.Donald Trump’s face made it official. As his presidential victory was declared, the upper 32 stories of the Empire State Building, which for election night had been turned into a giant news screen, flickered, wept light, and revealed his portrait. “The 45th president,” it said.

The exterior of the building – the part that reflected Trump’s face – is mainly limestone. The skeleton is steel. Half of the metal was delivered in the early 1930s by a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel, a company that not only shaped the Manhattan skyline but built some of America’s greatest bridges and its most formidable warships.

Eighty miles west of Manhattan, on the night of Trump’s election, the blast furnaces at Bethlehem Steel sat silent, as they have for 20 years. But on 8 November, the community whose generations tended Bethlehem’s fires helped to build something bigger than the mill ever had. They helped to put Donald Trump, and not Hillary Clinton, in the White House.



Northampton County, Pennsylvania, where the remains of the old Bethlehem Steel plant sits, had voted twice for Barack Obama for president, but local Democrats saw early on that 2016 might be tricky. The Clinton camp seemed confident though, and most forecasters believed that the long tradition of Democratic politics in the region, historically reinforced by labor unions in the mills, mines and manufacturing plants, would carry the day.

“The intellectual Democrats who were running the show, which included Hillary, all thought they were smarter than people like me,” Frank Behum, a Bethlehem steelworker for 32 years, told the Guardian last week. “‘What do they know?’ But you know what, people like me, even though I voted for Hillary, were smart enough to know that the crap that we went through – we didn’t want any more of it.”

Trump won Northampton County by four points on his way to becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to win Pennsylvania since Ronald Reagan. And in two days, he will take the oath of office.

Former steelworkers alone did not account for Trump’s victory in Northampton. Nor is the county’s vote readable as a result, simply, of long-term economic decline. Unlike the Pennsylvania coal country to the north, which also flipped from Obama to Trump, Northampton has been adding residents in recent years instead of bleeding them, while incomes and home values have crept upward. Businesses have been moving in.

Northampton’s vote for Trump was not only an act of frustration. As too many of Trump’s opponents may have taken too long to realize, it was also an act of hope.

Buying the promise

Nearly 63 million Americans voted for Trump for president. That is three million fewer than voted for Clinton. The defeat, for many Democrats and others around the world, feels like something much worse, as if a trapdoor in history had clumsily sprung open and the country fallen through.

Trump supporters don’t feel that way. For many of them, his election feels like a rebirth. A country that had grown unfamiliar suddenly resembles itself again. They see needless restraints on the basic functions of commerce and civic life loosening, and a needless sheepishness that had crept into public life dissipating.

The two realities – Trump joy and Trump angst – keep close company in many towns and cities across the country. Yet places like Northampton are rare. Out of more than 3,100 US counties, there are only 209 that, like Northampton, voted twice for Barack Obama and then fell for Trump in 2016. The basic electoral narrative in many of those places was similar: some Democrats stayed home, some new voters excited about Trump came out, and some Democrats crossed party lines to vote for a promise Trump made over and over, that he would make America great again.

What does that promise mean for those who voted for it? And will Trump deliver, in the eyes of his supporters? For a new series, the Guardian has been spending time in Northampton County, talking with voters who have embraced Trump’s promise, and those who doubt it. We’ll continue to do so as the Trump presidency progresses, to find out how Trump has risen or fallen in the estimation of voters who confounded the pollsters and shocked the political classes by making him president.

Demographically, Northampton fits the description of favorable Trump territory. It has a larger white population than the national average (88% versus 77%), slightly more senior citizens (18% versus 15%) and a slightly lower rate of college graduations (27% versus 30%). But the county’s unusually large footprint of heavy industry, a proliferation of colleges and universities, the influence of two extensive healthcare networks, a growing commuter class and other factors complicate the picture.

Initial conversations with area Trump supporters reveal great expectations that the new president will take decisive action in the arenas of trade and manufacturing jobs especially; that he will get rid of what business owners describe as the suffocating costs of Obama’s healthcare law; and that he will police illegal immigration more thoroughly. Apart from the issues, voters expect Trump to keep up what they describe as his straight talk and to stick with the old way of doing things, which among other things does not involve an explicit embrace of religious and cultural pluralism.

“This is going to sound really silly to you, but this is the Christmas City,” said Bruce Haines, the managing owner of the Historic Hotel Bethlehem. “Bethlehem is the Christmas City. And this year, when I went out on the street or wherever it was, people coming into the hotel, it was ‘Merry Christmas’. For the first time, and people were sort of proud of it. Saying ‘Merry Christmas’. And before it was ‘Happy Holidays’.

It’s almost like I left the country for eight years, and now it’s back. Like the country I grew up in is now returning Bruce Haines

“We’ve always marketed ourselves as the Christmas City. But over the years, people got a little anxious about saying that. So now it’s like, it’s almost like I left the country for eight years, and now it’s back. Like the country that I grew up in is now returning.

“Now, whether all that will happen or not, who knows.”

The county that built 20th-century America

It is difficult to arrive overland to New York City without passing across one edge of Northampton County. Bounded at top and bottom by interstates 80 and 78, the county occupies an anvil-shaped stamp of land on the banks of the Delaware river. The river is the boundary protecting Pennsylvania from the attitude, taxes and traffic of New Jersey. Northampton’s relative lack of any of those three, in addition to its singing highways, make it a transportation and distribution hub, and account for its dual nature as a bedroom community and an industrial center.

The area was settled 35 years before the American revolution by members of the Moravian church, a Protestant missionary sect with roots in the present-day Czech Republic. The Moravians’ communal lifestyle and knack for building with stone are largely responsible for the ample charm of present-day downtown Bethlehem, which boasts a 270-year-old bookstore – the nation’s oldest, they claim, though the merchandise these days runs more to souvenirs – and a national historic landmark district.

The Moravians were also talented engineers, devising the country’s first municipal water pumping system – the waterworks still stands – on Monocacy creek, which feeds the Lehigh river at precisely the place where, a century later, an ironworks was established that would grow into the second-largest steel producer in the US.

Early in the 20th century, the Bethlehem mill devised a unique, wide-flange beam that enabled the modern skyscraper, and inscribed the regional destiny. The mill fabricated steel for the Golden Gate Bridge, the Chrysler building, 30 Rock, the Waldorf-Astoria, and war munitions and ships. At its peak in 1945, it occupied a 4.5-mile-long campus and employed 33,000 local employees. Whatever American greatness means, that might have been it. But the rise of versatile mini-mills and cheap foreign imports, and the loss of big contracts such as the World Trade Center, fed the plant’s demise. It rolled its last beam in 1997.

“The people took pride in their work. There were generations that worked in the mill,” said Behum, the author of 30 Years Under the Beam, an oral history of Bethlehem Steel. “We were fat, dumb and happy. Then the bomb came over the top of the hill and went off.”

The old Bethlehem campus now hosts a mix of historic and cultural sites, condos, packed industrial parks, and one remaining heavy forge operation with 165 employees. The most visible – and lucrative – business at the old mill site, however, is a more recent arrival. In 2007, Sheldon Adelson, the Republican mega-donor, agreed to preserve four rusting blast furnaces as part of a development deal to establish the Sands Bethlehem casino, which opened for business in 2009 on the former grounds of an immense ore yard. It grossed $534m in the past fiscal year. Everyone in town says only out-of-towners go there.

‘Trump was pointing to the change’

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Larry Hallett in his Trolley Shops restaurant with his wife, Joan, in East Bangor. On Trump’s appeal, Hallett said: ‘I think it was his ordinary man’s conversation. It wasn’t rehearsed. He said it like he felt it was. They all identified with the guy.’ Photograph: Mark Makela for the Guardian

Larry Hallett is 81. He has 11 stents from 12 heart operations. He owns a construction and paving company, and a restaurant. He teaches prophecy classes out of an ice-cream stand attached to the restaurant. He also paints oil landscapes and builds classic cars from scratch. He no longer skin-dives. Every Saturday in summer, people come from across the region for car shows he hosts in the restaurant parking lot.

The restaurant business is year-round. Tables fill with regulars for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every day at about 10am, Larry is there with his wife, Joan. For morning coffee, not for breakfast, which they eat around 6am. The couple has been married 61 years.

“We have several tables. A lot of old guys. They’ve been Democrats all their life,” Hallett said last week. “A few years back, I’d say 80% of them voted for Obama. And I don’t think they’re going to change. But this time, voting-wise, they had to vote for Trump.

“With the majority of them, I think it was his ordinary man’s conversation. It wasn’t rehearsed. He said it like he felt it was. They all identified with the guy.

“A lot of them are retired. Some of them have businesses. Some of them work. They look forward to something better happening, all of them. They’ve got a better attitude.”

Hallett’s establishment, the Trolley Shops restaurant, is in the town of East Bangor, in the far north-eastern corner of Northampton County. The drive from Bethlehem, 25 miles to the south, takes about 45 minutes. As you head north, stoplights disperse and grain silos appear. The drive goes through Nazareth, another historic Moravian settlement, whose collection of businesses indicates a diverse economy with significant green shoots: an old cement plant, a new Amazon warehouse, a BMW parts distribution center and the Martin Guitar factory, local since 1854.

Farther north, around Bangor, the green shoots are less apparent. While the Bethlehem area in the south once thrived on steel, the north of the county once thrived on slate, which was sold worldwide for roofing tiles, chalkboards and gravestones. The north also boasted a robust apparel industry. The slate trade fell apart in the 1920s. The apparel industry breathed what seemed a final gasp in 2007, when Majestic Athletic Ltd, which had an exclusive license to supply uniforms for Major League Baseball, relocated hundreds of union jobs to the south of the county. Now even those jobs are in doubt: last month, Majestic lost its baseball contract to Under Armour.

For 70 years, visitors to the so-called slate belt have been stopping by Jewell’s, a combination bar and ammunition sales shop where Jon Jewell, 42, is now the third-generation owner. The two enterprises have separate entrances, but share a wall with a door through which Jewell can move from tending bar to selling bullets and back. One day last week at sunset, there was a lively pool game and friendly talk among Jewell and five patrons. The locals call the place Gas, Guns and Beer. There used to be gas pumps out front, too, Jewell explained.

Jewell said the area economy had struggled for decades, and people now were commuting “much further than they ever thought they would” for work. Things had improved “ever so slightly” in the past year, he said – “maybe”.

“Maybe people are holding on to jobs they had, as opposed to finding jobs,” he said.

Jewell said he had voted in November for candidates from both parties in down-ballot races but sat out the presidential race, unable to get inspired by either contender. He declined to speculate whom his neighbors had supported for president. But one thing was certain: turnout was huge.

“More people came out for that election around here than any other election ever,” Jewell said. “People who were 60 years old and never voted in their life. When I went at noon to get my number, they gave me 198. Usually they would get to 130 at the end of the day.”

None needed wonder whom Hallett was for. He passed out stickers by the hundreds and put up Trump signs outside the restaurant, “right in the blacktop”.

“We had one man who was here every day,” Hallett said. “Two, three meals a day. It made him mad because so many people were taking bumper stickers. He’s just enough of a Democrat not to think about who it is, it just had to be a Democrat. And he’s never come back.

“Two people is all [that left], that I know of. But I had so many more people coming in, shaking hands.”

Hallett echoed Jewell’s judgment of the local turnout.

“In Washington township, at the municipal building at 8 o’clock at night – and it had been all day – was a line all the way around the building and clean out across the parking lot. I don’t think they got done taking votes till 11 o’clock,” he said. “Records every place you went here. There’s not even any comparison. It was fascinating. An absolute fabulous turnout, it really was.”

Glenn Geissinger, a Republican county council member, said he witnessed that kind of pro-Trump enthusiasm during his unsuccessful run for the Republican primary nomination for the local US congressional seat.

Months before the election, he said, everywhere he went, voters skipped over his campaign pitch to ask the only question that mattered: whom did he support for president?

“There were people who, from the time he started getting traction, who said: ‘I haven’t voted for 20 years. I’m going to vote for Donald Trump,’” said Geissinger.

County executive John Brown, a Republican, said he saw the same thing in his run last year for state auditor.

“I spent a good portion of the year canvassing the entire state of Pennsylvania,” Brown said. “For those that we met who were disenchanted employees, I think they just gravitated directly to Trump. There was nothing that they could articulate or share that Hillary Clinton was talking about that was new or different. What was her campaign even about?

“After eight years, I think people were just going to go: ‘Hey, no more of that.’ I think Trump was pointing to the change.”

‘He hit a home run with these folks’

A vote for Trump in Northampton County was in many cases more than a catchall vote for change. Trump supporters interviewed by the Guardian also talked about specific issues including taxes, Obama’s healthcare law, trade policy, manufacturing jobs, immigration and social issues such as same-sex marriage. For those voters, on issue after issue, Trump was the plain answer.

The Historic Hotel Bethlehem is the centerpiece of a resurgent downtown business district in the town that steel built. Bethlehem titans established the hotel in 1922 to accommodate visiting dignitaries, who have included Sir Winston Churchill, John F Kennedy and Muhammad Ali. But as the regional economy slid off, the hotel went under, and when Bruce Haines and his partners bought it in 1999, there were boards on the windows and talk of turning it into a nursing home.

The boards are gone and, judging by two visits in two weeks, business is back. Guests eat dinner on the original hotel terrace, overlooking the Moravian settlement. A bar and grill gridded with pictures of famous visitors – this year saw the addition of both vice-presidential contenders – hosts a bustling lunch crowd. A large Nativity scene overhangs the front entrance, in a nod to Bethlehem’s designation, for marketing purposes at least, as the Christmas City. The hotel staff includes 80 full-time employees, Haines said.

Haines, a lifelong Republican, said the feeling in town was good since Trump had been elected. “Obviously a large portion of people are distraught about what happened,” he said. “But there’s a large portion of us who are very happy about what happened.”

Atop Haines’s to-do list for Trump are a renegotiation of trade deals, tax reform and an overhaul of Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which Haines said had threatened his hotel with hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties.

It’s called the lean-in vote. He won’t say it out loud, but he’ll lean up close to you and say: ‘I’m going for Trump’ Gregg Potter

“We provide healthcare for our full-time employees, always have,” Haines said. “And we pay a good portion of that, 80% of the cost. But they redefined full-time as somebody who works 30 hours, not 40 hours. We always defined full-time as 40 hours.”

Penalties built into the healthcare law were supposed to encourage businesses to expand coverage. But with part-time employees essential to the hotel’s seasonal flux and banquet-and-weddings business, Haines said, the only realistic solution was to cap part-time employees at 30 hours.

“I’m sure they expected us to pay some kind of penalty,” Haines said. “But we’re not going to be paying that penalty. Because we cut back our employees to less than 30 hours. They assumed, probably, that the 40 employees that I had that were working less than 40 hours, that we would just pay their healthcare. Well, that isn’t the way business works. It might be the way government works. But it isn’t the way business works.

“The unintended consequence for employees was, they lost hours.”

Haines, himself a former steel executive, said that Trump’s messaging on trade – in short, that bad trade deals were hurting American manufacturers – was also right on target, in a region whose economy had decades earlier been sunk, in part, by foreign goods dumped for less than what they cost to make.

“Hopefully we’re going to bring some manufacturing jobs back,” Haines said. “That hit home.”

In the former capital of steel, Trump’s trade talk found a receptive audience not only with Republican executives such as Haines, but with a lot of erstwhile residents of the opposite end of the political spectrum: union members.

Gregg Potter is president of the Lehigh Valley Labor Council, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, the country’s largest federation of trade unions. Potter’s group counts 47,000 members, plus a significant number of retirees, in Northampton County and neighboring Lehigh County. A third of those are registered Republicans. Potter himself was a Clinton supporter. But more than half of his members, he said, voted for Trump.

“He hit a home run with these folks,” Potter said. “He hit their issues head-on.”

Potter described talking with members who admitted that, against the recommendation of union leadership and their own Democratic identities, they backed Trump.

“He would give you that look like he’s going to tell an off-color joke,” Potter said. “Look around, make sure no one’s there. He looks both ways and says: ‘Yeah, I’m going to vote for Trump.’ It’s called the lean-in vote. He won’t say it out loud, but he’ll lean up close to you and say: ‘I’m going for Trump.’

“We focus so much on the free trade, and our members learn about this. So when Trump came out there first and says ‘Bullshit on these trade agreements,’ they were right with him. And Hillary Clinton did not have even a lukewarm message, let alone a strong one.”

Ken Kraft is the business agent for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, which counts about 100 members in Bethlehem and thousands regionally. “There are obviously tons of Democrats who voted for Trump,” he said.

Kraft did not feel good about it. He said some union members he spoke with seemed caught up in the momentum of the Trump candidacy, which he said was fueled by the “bullshit press”, and he described his frustration at trying to explain to members why Trump did not have their best interests at heart.

“I was in union meetings saying: ‘You know, these are the facts, guys. Listen to what he said. You’re a union member. He wants to make everybody right-to-work.’ They just look at me. Just nod.

“Trump just built up momentum because he’s a clown show. And he got billions of dollars of free advertising because every news show had to follow him. Everything he said, everything he did was reported on every news channel around the country.

Go ask people how they voted, they want to run away from you. Very few will come up and say: ‘I voted for Donald Trump' Frank Behum

“So they made him. They built him into what he is with their nonsense.”

Former steelworkers voted for Trump, too. Larry Neff, who worked at the Bethlehem plant for 25 years, did not, but he said family members had, and that Trump’s promise to bring back jobs had found purchase.

“I think what swayed a lot of people to vote for him in this area was his pushing, pushing, pushing that he’s going to bring jobs back to this country,” said Neff, whose essential memoir of life in the mill is called Rigger. “I’m hoping that America isn’t that stupid. If you looked at it logically, what he talked about was bringing jobs back, but he never did that before. He always had foreign workers. It was almost like PT Barnum running for president.”

Behum, the oral historian, did not vote for Trump – but he could see how someone might.

“Seeing companies making landslide profits because they moved overseas, and then they get tax breaks on top of it? Give me a break,” Behum said. “That’s some of the stuff Trump said that I agree with. He may be a jerk, but he said a lot of stuff in the business sense, related to working people, that made a lot of sense. But whether he follows through with it is another thing.”

Kraft has low expectations.

“I don’t think this president would defend the worker if his life depended on it,” Kraft said. “That’s all bullshit. He’s not going to defend us at all. He’s a millionaire, billionaire. He’s made his fortune by not paying people like us who work for a living.”

Trump supporters in all three groups – union Democrats, former steelworkers and Republican business owners – had one more thing in common, according to interviews: they didn’t want to talk about backing Trump.

“On the night of the election, there wasn’t a businessman that I know of that wasn’t rooting for Trump,” said Haines. “But they didn’t necessarily want to talk about it. Because they were considered ‘deplorables’, or some of their employees maybe were Clinton supporters. But when I talked to the business people one-on-one, everybody was cheering him on, everybody was saying: ‘I’m voting for Trump, but I better not say it.’ That was why the pollsters were all screwed up.”

Behum recalled Reagan’s upset victory in the region in the 1980s, against decades of union-driven, Democratic party dominance.

“That was the most amazing thing that ever happened, in my lifetime,” Behum said. “And I always used to say to people in the plant – which is more or less like a holding company for the Democratic party – I said to everybody: ‘How the hell did this guy get elected if nobody voted for him?’ Well, people would actually turn away and walk away. You knew automatically they voted for Reagan.”

Trump inspires a similar reticence, Behum said.

“Go ask people how they voted, they want to run away from you,” he said. “Very few of them will come up [and say]: ‘Well, I voted for Donald Trump.’ You won’t find anybody in this town like that.”

What happens next?

How did Trump win Northampton County? Clinton actually won slightly more votes in the county than Obama did in 2012 – 66,272 for her, 65,014 for him – indicating that loyal Democratic turnout was fine. But Trump appears to have won some crossovers, activated some dormant Democrats and inspired Republicans to vote near the top of their party potential.

“It’s not a gigantic shift, in terms of numbers,” said Christopher Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in neighboring Allentown. “Obama won narrowly, Trump won fairly narrowly. And so, where did the change come? Not only in the rural areas of the county, but especially a lot of the older towns that had gone for Obama in the past, like Nazareth or Hellertown, those places that really are the bastions of working-class whites in Northampton County. I look at those places.”

If people are hanging their hat on anything, it’s that he will actually create change John Brown

The Guardian will be following up with those voters in the weeks and months ahead, to gauge whether Trump has delivered on his promise to supporters. Nobody (at least no one we’ve spoken to or heard of) expects the great blast furnaces to fire again. Many Trump supporters expect a renaissance of some kind, however – while skeptics foresee the opposite.

For Brown, the Republican county executive, the perception that Trump is a man of action was the single strongest driver of his support.

“The other thing I’ve heard that people have echoed is that he will actually do it,” said Brown. “That he will actually create change and not just talk about it. If people are hanging their hat on anything, it’s that he will actually do it.”

But Kraft, of the painters’ union, and the former steelworker Behum are much less optimistic.

“People are going to have buyer’s remorse awfully quick,” said Kraft. “I really think they’re going to have buyer’s remorse.”

“There are still Trump signs up all over the place,” said Behum. “They’re people that are proud that he won. I wonder how proud they’re going to be when the shit hits the fan.”More than 100 Uber minicabs drive at walking pace down Edgware Road and Park Lane towards Westminster in central London in an effort to put pressure on the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to insist the company pays the minimum wage.

Rising towards the bridge from the downward slope of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, they continue to rise again beyond. Looking back from the rear of theroom, the structure resembles a ship in a dry dock, its gigantic raised prow facing east. From down here the view of the upper level (where all the action is) is extremely limited. The best views are from the bridge and along the level 1 walkway, commanding a view of the deck below.



But it’s not a deck – more a garden or allotment. Cruzvillegas’s work is absorbing and frustrating in equal measure. Absorbing because of its wealth of details, frustrating because it is difficult to see all of them with any clarity. Wherever you are (and however sharp-eyed), much of it is hard to make out. Distances are too far; the light is often against you. There’s too much going on. This is how it is in a crowded market, or any large public space.

You want to walk on the artist’s floating floor and examine the briccollaged lamps he has cobbled together from junk he found in the local area around the gallery, but you can’t. Angled over some of the 240 raised, triangular planters that form a pleasing geometric pattern across the floor, Cruzvillegas’s lamps are a kind of precarious sculpture.

Nor can you get down and dirty in the earth, transplanted from 36 sites all over London – the gardens of Buckingham Palace and Brockwell Park, city farms and the Lea Valley, the famous gardens at Kew and Wisley. The soil is as various in colour and texture as the places it comes from. There’s a way of identifying its origins but I doubt many will try (apart from avid gardeners) – though examining soil types is one way of reading the work. You can take pleasure in their muted colours.

Another is to botanise. Nothing has been planted but there are seeds and seedlings, bulbs, bugs and who knows what else already in the earth. The artist expects guerrilla gardening, the chucking of seed-bombs and other furtive infiltrations. Weeds have already begun to sprout here and there, the odd tuft of grass, emerging funghi. Someone has already thrown an apple into one of the little triangular plots, but I doubt the seeds will get a chance to germinate before the commission comes down next spring. Do not expect a flourishing of verdant and colourful plants. It is an empty lot. The small planters look like so many untended graves.

The optical pattern is nice. Wandering the area below is like a visit to a health-and-safety conscious building site, all the towers of scaffolding enclosed in mesh-lined wooden structures. There is no public access up the staircases built into some of them.

The weakening winter daylight, and the Mexican artist’s own arrangement of little lights, is augmented by powerful lamps on poles around the perimeter of the garden. The whole thing has the air of a compound in a displacement camp. Like any local allotment, there’s a lot of make-do and human disorder.



The raised floor with the gloomy lower level brings to mind the second Turbine Hall commission, the late Juan Muñoz’s 2001 Double Bind, recently re-installed in the HangarBicocca in Milan. When we met by chance last week, Cruzvillegas told me he was unaware of this work. He also insisted that the lower level of Empty Lot is part of the work, not a plinth. If it is more than a support structure, it exists to acknowledge all the building work taking place around London. Mostly, it just makes you aware of the scaffolder’s skills. In many countries, including Mexico, scaffolding is more ad-hoc, using reclaimed timber and bamboo rather than prefabricated lengths of steel tube, engineered couplers, clamps, props and standardised planks. Cruzvillegas has avoided the exotic.

What goes on up-top among the lozenge-like grid is more homely, though the overall effect resembles Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic structures (as well as the artist’s memories of the roof of the Mexico market where his parents had a shop when he was a child). Now with new sponsor Hyundai, the Turbine Hall commissions invariably rely on spectacle or theatre. It is tough to do something entirely new. For all its scale and tons of materials, Empty Lot manages to be both grand and modest. There is an amiable balance of the determined and the improvisatory, and the possibility that nature itself will change it over the coming months. Inviting chance to play a part in the work’s development – acknowledging the work of John Cage and Daniel Spoerri – Cruzvillegas doesn’t know quite what will happen. But this is less a greening of the Turbine Hall than a romantic evocation of the persistence of nature. Like French artist Pierre Huyghe (who laid out a mysterious garden at the last Documenta, and is building an underwater playground for jellyfish in the Marmara Sea in Turkey), Cruzvillegas is inviting nature in as a creative agent. We wait, and hope.Donald Trump held his first solo press conference as president at the White House on Thursday, which he initially used to announce the appointment of Alexander Acosta as his new pick for labor secretary. But the conference turned into a bitter critique of the mediaIn the journalistic race to get to the bottom of one of the most closely guarded secrets in Washington – the investigation into the Trump team’s contacts with Moscow – one of the biggest scoops came from an unexpected source: the British former MP and novelist Louise Mensch.



Mensch has lived in New York since resigning as the Conservative MP for Corby in 2012 so that she could spend more time with her children and her American husband, Peter, the manager of the heavy metal band Metallica.

Now 45, the woman born Louise Bagshawe in London who once dominated the chick-lit bestseller lists in the UK has reinvented herself once more: working as an executive for Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp by day, and probing Donald Trump’s Moscow connections by night.

Deutsche Bank examined Trump's account for Russia links Read more

On the eve of the November election, Mensch published a sensational story reporting that a special intelligence court in Washington had granted a warrant to allow the FBI to conduct surveillance of “US persons” in an investigation of possible contacts between Russian banks and the Trump organisation.



At the time, the story did not cause much of a ripple. It was published on Heat Street, a libertarian-leaning website run by News Corp, and an unknown quantity in journalism. So was Mensch, whose recent public profile consisted mainly of a string of angry Twitter spats.

Meanwhile, the combined investigative forces of the US media had spent months seeking to prove a secret connection between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin and had come up with very little.

The online magazine Slate had published an article at the end of October about mysterious pings that had been detected between a Russian bank, Alfa, and a server connected to the Trump organisation, but the New York Times quoted FBI officials as saying they had looked into it and decided there “there could be an innocuous explanation” for the computer contacts.

Flynn's resignation likely the beginning of Trump's Russia woes – not the end | Julian Borger Read more

Two months later, however, the BBC put out a story echoing Mensch’s original report about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court warrant issued in October to allow the justice department to look into transfers and communications between the Russian banks and Trump associate – and that US intelligence agencies were investigating the link.

The Guardian separately confirmed the original request for a Fisa warrant, which had been turned down earlier in the summer, and former officials said they believed that the Mensch and BBC account of the Fisa warrants was correct.

In mid-January, the McClatchy news agency said one of its sources had also confirmed the report, and the New York Times’ public editor, Liz Spayd, published an assessment of its coverage of the Trump-Moscow link on 20 January, arguing that it had been “too timid”. The Times, Spayd argued, “knew several critical facts: the FBI had a sophisticated investigation under way on Trump’s organization, possibly including Fisa warrants”.

The full facts about the connections between the Trump camp and the Kremlin are not yet known. Trump now has authority over all the intelligence agencies that were investigating the Russian connection. Investigations have been officially launched in the Senate, but there too, Republicans are in command, and only a handful of senators seem ready to break party ranks to inquire further.

However, it seems increasingly clear that Mensch landed an extraordinary scoop that had eluded the best investigative journalists in the US. Her explanation is that her vocal advocacy on behalf of UK and US intelligence agencies since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance led her sources to trust her.

“They gave me one of the most closely guarded secrets in intelligence,” she said in a telephone interview. “People are speculating why someone trusted me with that. Nobody met me in a darkened alley in a fedora, but they saw me as someone who has political experience and is their friend. I am a pro-national security partisan. I don’t have divided loyalties.”

Mensch said she gained her reputation among intelligence professionals on both sides of the Atlantic as a result of her furious criticism of the Guardian’s handling of the NSA files leaked by Snowden when he walked out of his NSA job in Hawaii and fled to Hong Kong.

The files included large amounts of information about the UK electronic surveillance agency, GCHQ, and Mensch argued that moving the files around the world constituted trafficking in stolen state secrets that put the lives of British intelligence officials at risk.

The Guardian has maintained that the revelation of the extent of mass surveillance in the UK and the US was in the public interest, that the data was shared responsibly and securely among journalists, and that nothing was put in the public domain that would be a threat to the lives of GCHQ workers.

Mensch presented herself as an advocate for intelligence professionals, who were unable to defend themselves because of the secret nature of their work. She frequently uses the hashtag #TeamBond. “I am a patriot in the service of the intelligence community,” she said.

A few weeks after her Fisa scoop, Mensch was moved from her job running Heat Street, but she said she had asked for the job as she was keen to develop new digital projects for News Corp.

Mensch continues to investigate the Trump administration’s links with the Russian government, but now in her own time, publishing her theories in tweets and a blog. She has lately been tracking the flights of private planes linked to Russian oligarchs and Trump associates. She insisted that she had not come under any pressure to stop from Murdoch or senior management of the largely pro-Trump News Corp. She says she prefers the free hand self-publishing provides.

“I didn’t want to be subject to an editing process,”she said. “Editors would ask: who are your sources? And I can’t tell them.”



In her tweets Mensch is unsparing when it comes to making allegations, and she has repeatedly denounced some figures in the Trump circle as traitors. She insists she has no fear of being sued for libel. “I’ve never been sued because I’ve never been wrong,” she said.Donald Trump is facing mounting pressure to explain his ties with Russia after it emerged that he knew weeks ago his national security adviser had misled officials about secret communications with Russian officials but did not fire him.

The retired general Michael Flynn was forced to quit on Monday night after reports that he could be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow.

Democrats demanded an independent investigation into Flynn’s phone calls with the Russian ambassador, what Trump knew about them and when. A senior Republican promised to examine the matter “exhaustively”, but others in the party were reluctant.

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters how the resignation had happened: “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable incidents is what led the president to ask Gen Flynn for his resignation.”

He added: “There’s nothing that the general did that was a violation of any sort. What this came down to was a matter of trust.”

Flynn stepped down after just 24 days when it emerged that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office, then misled vice-president Mike Pence and others about the conversations. FBI agents interviewed Flynn soon after the inauguration, the New York Times reported.

White House officials were reeling from the scandal less than a month after Trump became president amid reports of disarray and dysfunction. They also faced questions over why they had not acted more than two weeks ago when first warned by the Department of Justice that the retired general might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.

Spicer claimed that Trump was first made aware that Flynn had potentially misled the vice-president on 26 January and that the White House legal counsel, Donald McGahn, had been investigating the situation since in what Spicer called “a very deliberative process”, determining within several days that Flynn had not broken the law. Until 13 February, Flynn continued to have access to top-level information.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, called for an investigation into the “potential criminal violations” surrounding the communications between Flynn and Russia. “The White House knew for weeks that Gen Flynn misled the vice-president and that his discussion about sanctions with the Russian government could potentially compromise our national security because he was subject to blackmail,” Schumer said at a press conference on Tuesday.

“And yet they let him stay on for weeks present at – and participating in – the highest level of national security discussions until those reports were made public.”

Spicer flatly denied that Trump had asked Flynn to bring up the issue of sanctions in his conversations with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Asked whether the president had been aware that Flynn might have planned to discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, the press secretary replied: “No, absolutely not.”

Spicer, in contradiction to statements made by the senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway earlier on Tuesday, insisted that Trump had asked for Flynn’s resignation and that it was not the national security adviser’s decision. “The level of trust between the president and Gen Flynn had eroded that it had to make a change.”



In contrast, Conway said on NBC’s Today show on Tuesday morning: “Mike Flynn had decided it was best to resign. He knew he had become a lightning rod and he made that decision.”

Intelligence agencies concluded that Russian computer hackers interfered in last year’s presidential election with the intention of hurting Hillary Clinton, and therefore helping Trump. The US president has repeatedly declined to criticise the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

Spicer insisted that Trump had been “incredibly tough” on Russia. However, he only pointed to comments made by the UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, to back up that assertion. The press secretary, as well as the newly confirmed treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did not go into detail about whether the sanctions discussed by Flynn, which were imposed after Russia was determined to have hacked during the 2016 election, would be lifted. “The existing policies are in place,” said Mnuchin.

Spicer declined to say whether the White House would cooperate with a congressional inquiry. Earlier Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, had called for a wide-ranging investigation. “The truth and consequences of the Russia connection: the American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia’s financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security,” she said.

“Flynn’s resignation is a reflection of the poor judgment of President Trump and demands answers to the grave questions over the president’s involvement. By what authority did Flynn act and to whom did he report?”

The Democratic demand for an inquiry threw down the gauntlet to Republicans, who control the House and Senate but have an often difficult relationship with Trump.

Roy Blunt, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, pledged to investigate the Flynn issue “exhaustively”.



“I think everybody needs that investigation to happen,” Blunt, a senator from Missouri, said on Tuesday in a local radio interview. “And the Senate intelligence committee … has been given the principal responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn’t reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions.”

Blunt suggested his committee would soon call upon Flynn to testify before Congress. “I would think that we should talk to Gen Flynn very soon and that should answer a lot of questions,” he said.

“What did he know? What did he do? And is there any reason to believe that anybody knew that and didn’t take the kind of action they should have taken?”

Donald Trump had 'full confidence' in Mike Flynn – hours later he was gone Read more

Fellow Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, described it as a “troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus” in a complex global environment.

McCain added: “Gen Flynn’s resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration’s intentions toward Putin’s Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our Nato allies, and attempted interference in American elections.”

The party was split, however, with some playing the allegations down. Paul Ryan, the House speaker and most senior Republican on Capitol Hill, said that Trump had “made the right decision” in seeking Flynn’s resignation.

“You cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice-president and others,” Ryan said at a press conference.

“As soon as this person lost the president’s trust, the president asked for his resignation … It was the right thing to do.”

Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House oversight committee, said he would not pursue an investigation into Flynn’s contacts with Russia. “That situation is taking care of itself,” Chaffetz told reporters on Capitol Hill. “I know that the [House intelligence committee] was looking into the hacking issue previously, so I think he did the right thing by stepping out.”



The Republican-led House oversight committee did, however, investigate Hillary Clinton’s handling of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack even as the Senate and House intelligence committees conducted their own inquiries.

Devin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee and a longtime ally of Flynn, said he had no plans to investigate his communications with Russia, adding he was more concerned with the leaks surrounding the former national security adviser.

Flynn’s departure deepened concerns over a chaotic start for the Trump White House and the national security council (NSC) in particular, as well as allegations of ties with Russia that continue to haunt the president.



The Democratic congressmen John Conyers Jr of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking members of the judiciary and oversight committees, called for a classified briefing for Congress regarding Flynn’s actions.

“We were shocked and dismayed to learn this evening of reports that three weeks ago, US law enforcement officials warned the White House counsel that Gen Flynn had provided false information to the public about his communications with the Russian government, but that the Trump administration apparently did nothing about it,” the two said in a statement.

Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Barack Obama, drew attention to the resignation last year of Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who also had links to Russia. He tweeted: “When campaign chairman and NSA both resign over Russia ties there is more. Manafort and Flynn had nothing in common except Russia and Trump.”



Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, described Russia’s election meddling as “a political Pearl Harbor” and said he had filed a bill to set up a 9/11-style commission to investigate it.





Trump named retired Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as the acting national security adviser. Kellogg had previously been appointed the NSC chief of staff and advised Trump during the campaign. Trump is also reportedly considering the former CIA director David Petraeus and Vice Adm Robert Harward, a navy Seal, for the post.



The Kremlin had confirmed that Flynn was in contact with Kislyak but denied that they talked about lifting sanctions. On Tuesday, Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, said in a post on Facebook that firing a national security adviser for his contacts with Russia is “not just paranoia but something even worse”.

Kosachev also expressed frustration at the Trump administration: “Either Trump hasn’t found the necessary independence and he’s been driven into a corner … or Russophobia has permeated the new administration from top to bottom.”

The president broke his silence with a tweet that attempted to deflect attention: “The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?”

Flynn was often an angry, outspoken warmup act for Trump at his election campaign rallies.

His song “Every Day I Write the Book” chants that endless circadian repetition: “every day, every day, every day, every day I write the book”. Yet as desperate and maddening as writing can be, it never seems laborious. I’m wary of trying to explain my writing day as I simply don’t see it as a daily routine. I find too much pleasure in it when it’s going well. And the innocuous comment, “You must be disciplined” sounds more like a command than a question. I always say that if it were merely a matter of discipline I’d get someone else to do it. I love the artist Dan Flavin’s retort to being asked about his working procedure: “Work? Work? ... I hate work.” But there surely is some toil to be done. It’s just hard to explain without it sounding like a cover story for time wasted. Because sometimes it just doesn’t work. Every day, every day, every day, every day it might just not happen.

So I fear the sack every day from the best job I’ve ever had: my first and only foray into white-collar employment with its strange creative bureaucracy. I spend much time making notes in longhand. For me there is no better technology than pen on paper – it’s the quickest and most flexible way of making thoughts tangible, palpable. And there is a sensual pleasure in the scribble of letters, each little character crawling and sprawling. I’m working through the raw ideas. For me fiction is an attempt to recover a false memory, to reconstruct the details of events that never happened, to somehow pretend that one remembers them. A strange sort of reverse engineering of something that has yet to become a story. It begins with fragments, vague snatches of dialogue. I talk to myself a lot and waste a lot of paper making repetitive and barely articulate notes. This is usually the morning’s work. I spend time searching for some missing page with words I imagine to be important scrawled on it. I start to collect all these dead leaves, to shuffle them into some sort of sequence.

Fiction is an attempt to reconstruct the details of events that never happened, to pretend that one remembers them

Having assembled something that might form the guide for a scene or even a whole chapter, I then have to put my thoughts in order. And the only way to do this is to go for a walk. I follow Nietzsche’s dictum that “only ideas won by walking have any value” and need to perambulate to really get my mind working. It might be the rhythm of it, the conscious and unconscious intent beating out a measure, and the sense of travel, of transportation in time as well as space. And for my latest novel it became a form of deep research. The Fatal Tree is set in 18th-century London and I was lucky enough to be working close to where most of the action is set and could explore its labyrinthine topography. I would follow the banks of the River Fleet, its underground course flowing down Ray Street into Farringdon Road. This was the main sewer that John Gay dubbed Cloacina, the goddess of the gutter, and it now runs beneath the new cycle lane that runs along that street down to Blackfriars. Or I might plod above it, over the crossing at Holborn viaduct to St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Here the procession to Tyburn for the condemned began, a gruesome narrative of its own with hidden detours like the alleyway of Little Turnstile where the thief Jack Sheppard planned to make his final escape from the noose. As well as providing necessary mental exercise, these peregrinations became essential to the imagining of the book.

Then I come back and start to tap it all out on to a screen. My notes are like sketches for a bigger picture, or a mosaic that I piece together. I start to see it now as pages of text that I can read back to myself and continually revise. I’m always rereading, rewriting.

After lunch I’ll have a siesta. An hour of complete relaxation that might drift into light sleep. Those instilled with the northern work ethic might balk at this Mediterranean practice but I’m convinced it actually increases productivity. You just work a little later and in a better state. Lying on your back for a while is the best thing you can do for your body. And it’s wonderful for the mind, too. So I find inspiration on my feet or supine, then I’m ready to sit at my desk and put it all down.

But this is a good day. It’s not every day. Some days it just doesn’t come. But it’s the quality not the quantity that counts and the thinking that might bear fruit later. When taunted that he might have only written one word in an entire day, Truman Capote responded: “Yes, but it was the right word.” And with that thought one beats a retreat and waits for tomorrow. For he who writes and runs away, lives to write another day.Dear Sacha,

Firstly, you’re pretty amazing. You won’t believe that for a long time but trust me, you really are.

Right now, you’re 18 and you’ve already been through so much. You’re living in supported housing with a drug addict that leaves the house in a state and steals your things. Before this, you were homeless after being kicked out for the second time aged 16, so you lived in a hostel, even during your GCSEs. Yet you still go to work every day developing your people skills as a receptionist at a property company and pay your bills even though you’re left with no money afterwards.

Letter to my younger self: you will have to put friendships aside Read more

People expect you to be happy and grateful you’re alive, but why should you be? You should be living life, not struggling to survive. Why did you even bother getting those As at school? Well, the GCSEs won’t matter soon but I’m still glad you did and discovered your talent for writing and music.

By 21, you’ll be in a decent job working for a FTSE 100 company and for over six years you work really hard and get a couple of promotions along the way.

A few years later, the most amazing thing happens, your daughter Jaya. You’ll finally have a purpose and Jaya will literally save you. You go back to work when she is 10 months old, the same time you become a single mum. Three months later, you buy your very own four bedroom house. You’ll start feeling really positive, ready for a fresh start but then a month later, you’re made redundant. You nearly lose the house and you’re back to having days with no money for food, but even when you don’t, you always make sure Jaya has enough to eat.

Don’t worry though, you finally find another job. At first it’s great, but sadly you soon realise this is the worst employer you’ve ever had, and after a poor relationship with management, you leave after a year.

You find another job quickly but unfortunately, or fortunately as it will transpire, the company declines your request for flexible hours. So, again, you do the brave thing and resign, with no job to go to. Yes it’s probably a little bit crazy but Jaya needs you.

After a month of looking for a flexible role and finding nothing, you focus that frustration on what you can do about it as opposed to the usual self doubt. You decide it would be a good idea to create a recruitment agency specifically for parents to help them find good jobs that don’t force them to choose between family and a career, while also helping employers to improve their workplace diversity in an effective and ethical way.

After six months of planning, raising £400 of crowdfunding for a market testing event, securing a mentor through the Prince’s Trust, generating lots of PR and a £10,000 business loan via Virgin Loan – all while unemployed and, yep you guessed it, completely broke again – you launch Premier Parents Recruitment in April 2015. You become a director of your very own business at 30 and, like everything, you do it all by yourself.

Letter to my younger self: I envy you and your innocence Read more

It’s hard and you’re constantly frustrated with the resistance you face from employers that have so much ridiculous stigma about working parents, that you’ll want to give up lots of times, but you never do. Slowly but surely, you start to develop the brand and establish yourself as a well-known entrepreneur in the local and online business community and you’ll secure partnerships with major brands such as Bella Italia, Central College Nottingham and Metropolitan Housing.

You move a couple of long-term unemployed people into work, you deliver the courses you designed helping isolated lone parents develop confidence and employability skills. It takes a while, but you start to realise the power behind your story and all that you have overcome and how sharing it can inspire others.

So, you see, everything you’re going through right now is preparing you for something bigger and better. You wouldn’t have been able to set up Premier Parents without your resilience and you certainly wouldn’t be able to influence and inspire people if you hadn’t lived your life.

Today, your daughter is happy, so clever and she loves you. We’re not rich yet but give me a few years as the business goes from strength to strength.

I’m still a work in progress but a strong woman, great mum and becoming a great leader. I’m proud of you and lots of people agree. Keep going Sacha, the best is yet to come.

Sacha

Sacha Atherton is the founder and director of Premier Parents Recruitment

Yorke said he was prevented from entering the country due to an Iranian stamp on his passport having represented the ‘World Stars’ in a charity match against ‘Iranian Stars’ in Tehran in 2015.

The 45-year-old enjoyed widespread success in English football, playing for Aston Villa, United, Blackburn, Birmingham and Sunderland before retiring in 2009. Yorke has enjoyed a varied career since then and, having this week worked for beIN Sports, was due to travel from Doha, Qatar to Trinidad and Tobago, via Miami, on personal business on Friday.

“I couldn’t quite believe what was happening” Yorke told the Sun. “I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America. I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal.

“I had bought my ticket and checked in and was about to get on the flight when I was stopped by two officials. I thought, ‘What is happening here?’ They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport. I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn’t even stay overnight.

“The two officials told me if I got on the flight I would simply be deported back to Qatar once I arrived in the States. I tried to explain I didn’t even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.”

Last month the US president, Donald Trump, signed an executive order temporarily barring those from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen entering the country. On Thursday Trump’s administration said in court documents that it does not want a larger appeals panel to review a ruling keeping its travel ban on hold and will instead replace the ban.

The Somalia-born British Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah called the travel ban “deeply troubling” and has fears over his return to America. Farah lives and trains in Portland, Oregon, and is currently in Birmingham for the Indoor Grand Prix.

Asked if he had concerns when he returns to the US, he said: “Yes, I’ve had issues before. But hopefully it will be fine, I always try and look on the bright side of life. I’m not going back yet. I’m competing here and then on Sunday back to another training camp as I have to do a bit more training but I do have to go back in March and see my family and at that point we will see.”Name: The Facebook manifesto.

Age: One day old.

Appearance: A 5,700-word Facebook post.

What does it say? You can read it for yourself – Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, posted it for all to see.

Are you kidding? Didn’t you just say it was 5,700 words long? OK, here’s the gist of it: “Progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.”

What is this global community of which he speaks? He means Facebook.

So he’s saying he runs Facebook, and Facebook should run the world. No. He’s saying: “In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.”

A global community of cute cats and fake news? He spoke out against the latter, if not the former. “Social media is a short-form medium where resonant messages get amplified many times,” he wrote. “This rewards simplicity and discourages nuance.”

If he’s admitting that Facebook makes you stupid, he’ll get no argument from me. He has also noticed that “people share stories based on sensational headlines without ever reading the story”.

Mark Zuckerberg pens major Facebook manifesto on how to burst the bubble Read more

That’s about as good a definition of Facebook as I’ve heard. And he has taken on board the alarming tendency for Facebook users to live in “filter bubbles” where they are only exposed to opinions they concur with.

Tell me about it. If my second cousin’s husband wasn’t a racist moron, I’d never hear the other side of the story. Don’t worry – he’s gonna fix all that. Ultimately, Zuckerberg just wants people to become better informed and more civically engaged.

He sounds like a politician. All that’s missing is a stirring quote from Abe Lincoln. There was even one of those: “The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, act anew.”

Is Zuckerberg planning to run for president or something? He says no, but there have been rumours, and he has recently indulged in other candidate-like behaviour – hiring political operatives, touring the US and suddenly speaking up for religion.

A weird billionaire businessman for president – what next? Indeed.

Do say: “OMG – Mark for P! :)”

Don’t say: “tl;dr.”After each Olympics, golfers, tennis players and footballers return to their usual schedules, performing in front of vast and adoring crowds and often earning handsome sums. Swimmers, meanwhile, return to relative, or actual, obscurity after a few weeks among the world’s most scrutinised athletes – unless their personal problems or indiscretions become public knowledge, that is.

Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, struggled with alcohol and went into rehab after two DUI arrests. Ryan Lochte’s 2016 went from a gold in the pool in Rio to a gas-station “robbery” scandal to a 10-month suspension to elimination in week eight of Dancing With The Stars. Ian Thorpe wrote a 2012 autobiography detailing his struggles with depression, while other Australian swimmers have ended up in prison or become mixed up in drugs. Whether this is due to the rigors of swimming is a moot point, but how much of a toll does the sport take on its athletes?

“The pressure is incredible,” says Matt Grevers, standing poolside at a meet in Austin last month. “It’s not like a basketball game where you have time to warm up, or you miss a shot you have the next one. Swimming? You miss your start, you have a bad breakout, even a couple of bad breaths or a bad turn, whatever it is, one mistake and you’re out of luck. You have to be so perfect and that can get to you. That’s the focus that can add a lot of pressure.”

Not that the heat was on the four-time Olympic gold medallist during the Arena Pro Swim Series event in Texas. There were perhaps a couple of dozen paying spectators in the stand at the University of Texas’s arena, suggesting the presence of more competitors than fans. This in a sports-crazed environment: a quarter-mile away across campus, the football stadium can seat more than 100,000.

But the absence of mainstream interest, in a way, helped enhance the 31-year-old’s point. Only 13 months earlier, Grevers set a world record in the 100m backstroke. The 6ft 8in American has six Olympic medals and plenty more prizes from world championships. In other words, he is a star. But the world only notices every four years.

Ian Thorpe: 'I was surrounded by people but had this intense loneliness' Read more

And last summer, Grevers missed out on a trip to the Rio Games when he finished third in the US trials with a time that would have captured the silver medal in the 100m backstroke at London 2012. That hurt.

“You have to be at your best for that 52 seconds out of four years, otherwise you’re kind of out of luck, you don’t make the spot,” he said in Austin. “That one race every four years, you have to be perfect. Yeah, it adds a lot of pressure.”

Not only do elite swimmers face the mental challenge of having to peak for Olympic trials and finals every four years then cope with the drop-off, they have chosen perhaps the loneliest sport of all, doing grueling laps in the solitude of their lane, trapped in their thoughts as they perform rote actions for hours.

“I definitely think you have to be at peace with your own mind. If you have inner demons, swimming’s probably not the sport for you,” Grevers said.

“You have a lot of time to think about things. You’re obviously thinking about your stroke and that occupies a large part of your mental processing but there is a lot of time to think about life and what you’re doing outside. Swimmers have to have a good relationship with themselves, I think, to really perform well. You don’t really get to talk things through or distract yourself by talking to others. Even in the ready room usually it’s silence so even right before the race you’re not talking to someone.”

In 2008, the Independent reported that British researchers found aspiring Olympic swimmers as young as 11 were expected to spend up to 27 hours a week in the pool – five times as much training as children in other sports such as football. “A lot of people try to blame the burnout, or people dropping out of the sport early even though they have a great future, on the time consumption that it has. Swimming’s a low-impact sport so you can kind of punish your body more than other sports,” said Grevers. “I really think it’s more just being the mental side of things, not having as many social interactions. People get bored but I don’t, because I like my solitude in the water, it’s a meditative place for me.”

Eloquent, thoughtful and approachable, and a new dad, at least Grevers seems well-equipped to handle the pressures of swimming? “I don’t know I do deal with it that great,” he said. “I’d say this Olympic trials, 2016, my whole family said I was definitely acting a little different under that sort of pressure. It’s hard because at the professional level your livelihood, your family security, is now at stake. It’s not just accomplishing your goals, it’s supporting your family. There’s more and more pressure every year.”

Contrast that with the fact that swimmers’ sacrifices often go unnoticed. At the age of 19, Katie Ledecky is already one of the greatest athletes ever to dip a toe in the water. But, crude measure of celebrity and cultural penetration though it may be, her Twitter account has a relatively meagre 147,000 followers – about half as many as track the Brentford midfielder Josh McEachran. Last August, though, she was one of the most famous people on the planet.

“It is a bit weird. Me personally, I’m not a big fame guy, I don’t really want that. So the level you can attain if you’re not Michael Phelps in this sport is pretty acceptable to me,” said Josh Prenot, a 23-year-old American who won silver in the 200m breaststroke in Rio.

“I think that’s kind of a cool thing about our sport. Any other sport you’ve got like a big championship every year, the Super Bowl, World Series, what have you, so to have something every four that subjectively matters more but is still the same thing is kind of a unique aspect which I really appreciate.”

After the glare of the global spotlight and the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, it would only be human to experience some sort of post-Olympic lull. “It was a little hard for me because going into the Olympics, that’s just your ultimate long term goal is to be there. I’ve just been so hungry for that for so long and just pursuing every day, every workout, with the mentality of ‘I have to do this’. And then after achieving your goal, if you want to keep being hungry you have to reset your goal. And I did not do that for a long time,” Prenot said.

So he took a “six-month break not really from swimming, but from trying to get better at swimming – that’s given me the hunger again and made me realize how much I appreciate the process, the grind. It’s certainly not easy but it’s a fantastic job to have.”

Cullen Jones stepped away from the pool for six months after failing to reach his third Olympic Games. The 32-year-old New York native won a gold in the 4x100m freestyle in Beijing and another in the 4x100m medley in London four years later, along with two silver medals.

“After a couple of days, or weeks or months, [attention] does kind of drop off,” he said, speaking on a chilly morning at an open-air pool near Austin after giving a class to promote participation and safety among the African-American community.

“I think it’s a task for any governing body, for track, for swimming, to kind of keep us relevant, not only just for the sake of keeping the sport going, getting more people to continue the sport, but just to keep the fanbase and have people interested in it,” he said. “I think as long as social media’s out there we’re going to be OK.”

Jones keeps busy by teaching, studying and giving speeches, and stays motivated using psychological techniques: “I make things real for myself. In 2012, 50 freestyle, I wasn’t doing well going into that year, I wasn’t looked at as being even in contention to do that. But I put up pictures of some of the other swimmers around my house and whenever I didn’t feel like I wanted to practice or whenever I didn’t feel like giving it my all I’d either open up my locker or wake up and look at my ceiling and there was a picture of someone I’m gonna have to race against. And there they are in their proud moment, and it made it real for me – get up, do what you have to do, focus.”

He goes to the gym and took up boxing as a means of staying in shape without succumbing to the monotony of training – the 20-30 plus hours in the pool each week, typically early in the morning. “The mundane going back and forth staring at the black line was getting to me,” he said.

But Grevers believes that swimming’s special challenges make for a superior sense of achievement. “There’s such an individual accomplishment there, that you know you were responsible for that outcome. It wasn’t someone else’s abilities or plays or talents, it was yourself and you worked super hard for that,” he said. “I absolutely think there’s a higher high in swimming, or those individual type sports where you know you deserved it and you did all the work to make it happen and that goal you set four, eight, ten, 16 years ago, whatever it is, is finally accomplished. I can’t imagine anything else feeling as good as that.”Tareck El Aissami joins long list of politicians and public figures subjected to US sanctions over links to the drug trade

The allegations against Venezuela’s vice-president could not have been more serious. Announcing sanctions against Tareck El Aissami this week, the US Treasury Department described him as a “prominent drug trafficker” who had overseen and even partially owned narcotics shipments from Venezuela to the US.

US accuses Venezuelan vice-president of role in global drug trafficking Read more

As governor of Aragua state and minister of the interior, he allegedly oversaw or partially owned drug shipments of more than one tonne from Venezuela, and dealt directly with Mexico’s Zetas cartel and Colombian narco-boss Daniel El Loco Barrera. In January he was promoted to vice-president.



But as bad as that sounds, El Aissami is only the latest – if the most highly placed – in a long list of Venezuelan officials or people close to power who have been tied to drug trafficking.

In August last year, US federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against retired generals Néstor Reverol and Edilberto José Molina of receiving bribes in exchange for notifying traffickers of upcoming police operations.

According to the indictment, they did so while they respectively held the positions of director and deputy director of Venezuela’s national counter-narcotics office between 2008 and 2010. Shortly after the indictment was announced, Venezuela’s presindent, Nicolás Maduro, appointed Reverol as minister of the interior.

In 2008, the US treasury sanctioned Hugo Armando Carvajal, a retired military officer and former head of military intelligence, who in 2012 served as president of the National Office Against Organised Crime. He was then named consul in Aruba.

Carvajal was accused along with Ramón Rodríguez Chacín, former interior minister under the late president Hugo Chávez, and Henry Rangel Silva, former defence minister and head of operations of the armed forces.

Venezuelan 'narconephews' bad at drug smuggling, defense and prosecution say Read more

And in November, two nephews of Maduro’s wife were convicted of conspiring to import nearly a tonne of cocaine into the US after they were arrested in Haiti and extradited to the US.

President Maduro, who succeeded Venezuela’sfirebrand leader Hugo Chávez after he died from cancer in 2013, rejected the sanctions “as part of a systematic attack by the international right against the Bolivarian Revolution”.

He said that since 2005, when the office of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was pushed out of Venezuela, “the state increased its efficiency in the fight against drug trafficking by 60%”.

However, according to the US State Department, a quarter of the cocaine produced in Colombia travels through Venezuela: about 110 tonnes per year, which places it in one of the 22 countries with the highest traffic of drugs in the world.

During El Aissami’s time as minister of the interior and justice, Venezuelan organised crime has grown rapidly, said Jeremy McDermott, director of InSight Crime, a thinktank that studies organised crime in Latin America.

“There is no more money to rob from state coffers, so the wheels of corruption may need to turn to other sources of income, like drug trafficking,” he said.

Alejandro Rebolledo, a Venezuelan criminal lawyer specialising in organised crime, said: “In Venezuela there are a lot of laws but there is no political will to enforce them.”

Rebolledo added that prosecutors lack autonomy to pursue in-depth investigation when drug traffickers are arrested. “There is a voluntary blindness [towards] organised crime,” he said.

Venezuela on the brink: a journey through a country in crisis Read more

Luis Cedeño, sociologist and executive director of Paz Activa, a group that runs an organised crime observatory, said Venezuela has already gone beyond a narco-state. “It’s a mafia state where everything is handled like the Cosa Nostra,” he said, noting that other criminal economies have become entrenched, such as gasoline smuggling and contraband in basic goods.

Shortages of food and medicines, as well as inflation and a shrinking economy had led Venezuela’s opposition coalition, known as MUD, to press for a recall referendum to force Maduro from office.

Had the vote been held by the first weeks of this year, it would have meant calling new elections. But the actions of the US Treasury this week mean that the opposition now has much less reason to push for a referendum: since the deadline passed, a successful recall of Maduro would see El Aissami take over as Venezuela’s president.Adolf Hitler’s personal telephone, which the Führer used to dictate many of his commands in the last two years of the second world war, will be put up for sale this weekend, a US auction house has said.



Originally a black Bakelite phone that was later painted crimson and engraved with Hitler’s name, it was found in the Nazi leader’s Berlin bunker in 1945 following the regime’s defeat.

Auction house Alexander Historical Auctions estimates its worth at between $200,000 (£161,000) and $300,000.

Photo mystery of Jewish assassin used by Nazis to justify Kristallnacht Read more

On Sunday, the company in Maryland will auction more than a thousand items – including the Siemens rotary telephone embossed with a swastika and eagle symbolic of the Third Reich.

Alexander House said the phone – which Hitler received from the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany’s armed forces – was “arguably the most destructive ‘weapon’ of all time, which sent millions to their deaths”.

Russian officers gave the device to British Brigadier Sir Ralph Rayner during a tour of the bunker shortly after Germany’s surrender. Rayner’s son inherited the phone and is selling it, its paint now peeling to reveal its original synthetic black resin surface.

“It would be impossible to find a more impactful relic than the primary tool used by the most evil man in history,” the auction house said in a statement.One July afternoon last year in Beaumont-sur-Oise, a small town north of Paris, Adama Traoré was out with his older brother, Bagui, planning how to celebrate his 24th birthday that evening when police drove by looking for Bagui in connection with a case. But Adama didn’t have his ID on him and tried to run. Hours later, he was dead in police custody.

The unexplained circumstances of Adama’s death, the allegations of a state cover-up and his family’s fight for justice has made this one of France’s most high-profile cases of alleged police brutality.

The shadow of Traoré’s death has hung over the protests and riots this week on high-rise estates around Paris after another case pushed alleged police violence into the spotlight ahead of this spring’s French presidential election campaign. Amid fury over a violent arrest in Aulnay-sous-Bois in which a police officer was charged with raping a young man, Theo, with a baton, clashes and rioting broke out on estates around Paris leading to over 250 arrests.

Both cases reflect how officers are regularly accused of using excessive force in poorer neighbourhoods, particularly against black and minority ethnic young men.

The president, François Hollande, silent in the Traoré case, appeared at the hospital bedside of the man known as Theo after he had emergency surgery for serious injuries. He hoped to calm unrest, but sporadic clashes have continued on other estates. The far-right Front National’s presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, who is expected to make it to the final presidential runoff in May, has large electoral support among police and said her principle was to “support the police” unless the justice system proved a crime had taken place.

Benoît Hamon, the Socialist presidential candidate said it could no longer be tolerated that “families fear for their children’s safety if they are stopped by police”.

On 19 July last year, when Adama Traoré’s family heard he had been arrested, they grew increasingly worried. His mother went to the police station and was given conflicting stories. One officer told her that he was in hospital, another said that he was fine and promised to give him the sandwiches that she had prepared for him. Eventually she was told that visiting hours were over and that she had to return the next day.

His mother stood outside the police station with one of her younger sons, Yacouba, crying in the dark. It was 10pm and no one had heard from Adama in over five hours. They watched the flashing lights of police cars drive past them in and out of the station until Yacouba had had enough and put his foot out to hold open the gate.

A police officer told him to move but he refused, demanding news about his brother. The police relented and took them both inside. “If we tell you what has happened, we want you to stay calm,” the police officer told them. “But Adama is dead.”

Yacouba lashed out and had to be restrained. He and his mother were teargassed by the police. Mrs Traoré was told that her son had died of a heart attack and a serious blood infection. They said that he had been drinking and smoking cannabis. “The doctor came and sat next to me and said: ‘Madame, you can’t see your son’,” she told the Guardian. “’He has bled from his nose and mouth, it’s not something you need to see.’”

The next day, as the media started relaying the official version of the story – that a young man had died of a heart attack in police custody – Traoré’s family and friends staged a peaceful protest outside the police station where he had been taken. They didn’t believe that he had died of a heart attack and were looking for answers. Police used teargas to disperse them.

The family’s suspicions grew when the authorities told them: “As you’re Muslim, and we know you like to bury your bodies quickly, we’ve taken the liberty of phoning Roissy [airport] and Air France and the body can be repatriated to Mali tomorrow.” They even offered to arrange passports for any family members who didn’t have them, relatives said. But they weren’t leaving: Adama was not known to have been ill and they wanted a second autopsy.

The authorities again insisted on trying to deliver the body to the family, but the family knew if they accepted it, they wouldn’t be allowed another autopsy. “When the body arrived, in a gesture that felt really violent for us, we refused it,” Traoré’s older sister, Assa, told the Guardian.

The second autopsy revealed Traoré had died of asphyxiation. Toxicology reports for cannabis and alcohol came back negative. The family insisted that someone, somewhere, had lied about what happened that night.

A senior firefighter later told the gendarmerie inquiry that when he arrived to resuscitate Traoré, he found he had not been placed in the recovery position but was lying face-down on the ground in handcuffs, with no one helping him – a statement that contradicted the gendarmes’ accounts. One of the gendarmes said Traoré had told the police he couldn’t breathe, but officers told the firefighter they thought he was faking it. The gendarmes at first refused to un-cuff him saying that he was violent.

Asked about the case in parliament last year, the then interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said only that he supported the police’s work and “couldn’t accept the constant blaming” of officers.

An investigation into the events surrounding Traoré’s death is ongoing. But he was not the first person to die in police custody in France. No official figures are kept on the number of people killed or injured by police or gendarmes, but Amnesty International has warned of what it called “a pattern of de facto impunity” with regard to law enforcement officials in France. Campaign groups and media estimates suggest there are between 10 and 15 deaths a year linked to the police in France.

For decades, riots and social unrest on France’s high-rise suburban estates have been linked to the deteriorating relationship between young people and the deeply distrusted police.

In 2005, two teenagers, Bouna Traoré, 15, and Zyed Benna, 17, were electrocuted after running away from police in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005, triggering the worst rioting in France for 40 years. They had been walking home from a football match when they crossed paths with a police van. An inquiry found they had committed no crime, but had instinctively begun to flee when they saw the police. The police chased them until they hid in a power transformer where they were electrocuted and died. It took 10 years, and much legal wrangling, for the case to come to court. The two French officers accused of failing to help the boys were cleared.

Not every example of alleged police brutality in France makes the news, but Adama Traoré’s case has become symbolic after years of alleged brutality and little or no action by the state.

Assa Traoré, Adama’s 31-year-old older sister, a teacher with three children, has led the campaign and quickly become a figurehead. In November she said in an interview on French television that the centre-right mayor of Beaumont-sur-Oise, Nathalie Groux had “chosen her side” and that was “the side of the police, that is to say, that of police brutality”. Groux threatened to sue Assa for €30,000 (£25,000) in damages for defamation.

“I decided with my brothers and other people from Beaumont to go to the local council meeting,” Assa told the Guardian. “When we arrived we were greeted by around 50 police officers,” she said. Dozens of supporters turned up and were refused entry to the meeting, which is usually open to the public. Police used teargas to push people back and Assa announced that they would return to the next council meeting with even more people.

When the family returned to their neighbourhood, there were dozens of armed police waiting for them. Videos showed non-lethal weapons being used and scuffles between locals and the police.

Six days later, on the day of the second council meeting, police came to arrest Assa’s brothers Bagui and Youssouf for allegedly verbally and physically assaulting the police when they had tried to gain access to the council meeting the week before. They were refused bail and went on trial three weeks later.

The eight police officers testifying sat together in the courtroom and the 11 witnesses for the defence waited in a separate room. French newspaper Le Monde reported that the defence had “highlighted contradictions in the testimonies of the forces of order”, but both brothers were found guilty. Youssouf was given a suspended sentence of three months and Bagui was sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from living in Beaumont for two years. They were fined a total of €7,000.

Earlier this month, the family and campaigners hosted a sold-out “Justice for Adama” concert in Paris with the help of several well-known French musicians including Youssoupha and Sofiane. That same night, the 22-year-old Theo was arrested in Aulnay-sous-Bois and an officer charged with his rape.

This week a group of artists, sports stars, academics and celebrities signed an open letter in the newspaper Libération for justice in the Adama Traoré case. They wrote: “We refuse to accept that a growing part of the French population is abandoned by the republic, and we demand the strictest impartiality of the state when forces of order go beyond the law.”

California regulators ordered Uber to remove its self-driving vehicles from the road on the same day that the company’s vehicles were caught running red lights – violations the company immediately blamed on “human error”.

“It is essential that Uber takes appropriate measures to ensure safety of the public,” the California department of motor vehicles (DMV) wrote to Uber on Wednesday after it defied government officials and began piloting the cars in San Francisco without permits. “If Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action.”

An Uber spokesperson said two red-light violations were due to mistakes by the people required to sit behind the steering wheel and said the company has suspended the drivers.

A video posted by Charles Rotter, an operations manager at Luxor, a traditional cab company, shows one of Uber’s computer-controlled cars plowing through a pedestrian crosswalk in downtown about four seconds after the light turned red. Elsewhere, a photo from a San Francisco writer showed one of the Uber vehicles entering an intersection against a red light.

“People could die,” Rotter said in an interview later. “This is obviously not ready for primetime.”

People could die. This is obviously not ready for primetime Charles Rotter

The traffic violations and threat of legal action are a significant blow to Uber in its home town, where the California department of motor vehicles has said that Uber requires permits to test the technology on its roads.

Despite that stated mandate from a government agency, Uber declared in a blogpost that it did not believe it needed a “testing permit” to launch self-driving vehicles in San Francisco, arguing that the rules don’t apply since the cars have people in them monitoring movements.

“Most states see the potential benefits, especially when it comes to road safety,” wrote Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber’s advanced technology group. His post announcing the Wednesday launch noted the Volvo XC90s’ “core safety capabilities”.

In his letter to Levandowski, the DMV’s deputy director, Brian Soublet, noted that 20 companies have already been approved to test self-driving vehicles in California.

“They are obeying the law and are responsibly testing and advancing their technology,” he said, adding, “This technology holds the promise of true safety benefits on our roadways, but must be tested responsibly.”

The self-driving vehicles of the popular car-sharing company were first unveiled in Pittsburgh in September. The vehicles have technology that allows them to navigate on their own, though licensed drivers sit behind the wheel and can take control as necessary.

Annie Gaus, a San Francisco writer and producer, said she was riding to work on Wednesday in a Lyft, Uber’s biggest competitor, when she saw one of the Uber self-driving vehicles nearly crash into her.

Annie Gaus (@AnnieGaus) Just passed a 'self-driving' Uber that lurched into the intersection on Van Ness, on a red, nearly hitting my Lyft.

She tweeted a photo of the car in the intersection after it ran the red light.

“The Uber car sort of jutted out into the intersection,” she told the Guardian by phone, noting that she and her Lyft driver were both taken aback. “It was close enough that we were both kind of like, ‘Woah.’ It’s close enough that you kind of react and are sort of rattled.”

Gaus, who has written about technology and has contributed to the Guardian, said the red-light violations on day one of the pilot seem to highlight how the implementation of the technology in a place like San Francisco may be premature.

“I don’t think anybody has a good understanding of how this works in a city context.”

An Uber spokesperson said both cars running red lights were not part of the pilot and were not carrying customers.

“These incidents were due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers,” the statement said. “The drivers involved have been suspended while we continue to investigate.”

The company did not immediately respond to questions about the state’s order to remove the cars from the road.

It’s unclear how law enforcement may address these kinds of violations.

Asked how the San Francisco police department would respond to a self-driving Uber running a red light, officer Giselle Talkoff said: “I don’t even know. I guess we could pull them over.”

After the Guardian sent Talkoff footage of the Uber violation, first reported by the San Francisco Examiner, she said the police were not investigating the specific incident. But she noted officers would follow up in cases in which there was an injury or if they witnessed a violation in person – though she said she wasn’t sure if the “secondary driver” or the company would be held accountable.

“There was a person that was walking very closely,” she said of the footage, pointing out that a pedestrian was entering the street when the Uber car ran the red.

Talkoff further noted that there aren’t state or federal laws governing self-driving cars.

“First comes technology, then comes policy. It’s going to be a matter of setting some precedents,” she said, adding, “The companies that are putting these vehicles on the road should have their vehicles operate with due regard to the rules of the road.”

A sergeant with the police traffic division said his department was not even aware that Uber had started using autonomous cars in San Francisco.

Rotter argued that the technology company should be held responsible for sending the vehicles out on the road despite government objections.

“What this company has done is start operating illegally and push for permission later.”

Mel BrooksJürgen Klopp suspected the worst was over after Liverpool’s midweek display against a Chelsea team cruising towards the title. He was wrong. Great first half, dreadful second: Liverpool are threatening to take the template for their entire Premier League campaign from last season’s Europa League final.

It is one win in 10 matches for Klopp’s team after Hull City, revitalised by astute management and January recruits, deepened the worry lines on the Liverpool manager and, in the process, improved what were once slim chances of avoiding relegation. Marco Silva has taken seven points from his four Premier League games and new signings Alfred N’Diaye, Andrea Ranocchia, Kamil Grosicki and Oumar Niasse all influenced a fourth consecutive home victory at the KCom Stadium. Midfielder N’Diaye opened the scoring as Liverpool faulted at a set-piece. The visitors’ other recurring flaw, defending against a counterattack, also featured, as Niasse broke clear to wrap up victory late on. It was the first time the Senegal striker has made Evertonians happy since his £13.5m move to Goodison Park 13 months ago.

“When I first arrived the atmosphere was not the best,” said Silva. “The squad was in the last position in the table and many people did not believe. The first match I don’t see our supporters in our stadium. Today, I saw them everywhere, and a fantastic atmosphere. If I believe, I want my players, my supporters, to believe as well. If I believed on the first day then why I don’t believe now? But the truth is we only won three points today, nothing more.”

But this was not merely three points dropped by Liverpool. Klopp was deflated instead of angry after the final whistle, searching for answers to a performance that will trouble him more than any other since the turn of the year. One of the few he could muster was that Liverpool’s spirits have nose-dived, along with their form, due to Chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the title race. “This week we had a really good performance but we didn’t build on it,” said Klopp. “We have to take all the criticism we receive from everywhere.”

The Liverpool manager was particularly aggrieved at a slow, careless start from players who had delivered the polar opposite against Antonio Conte’s team at Anfield. Hull’s breakthrough was a fitting tribute to a scrappy first half and another entry into the Liverpool catalogue of weak defending at set-pieces. Two careless touches from Emre Can gifted Hull a corner. Poland international Grosicki crossed from the right, Harry Maguire headed into the six-yard area and Simon Mignolet, under pressure from Abel Hernández, could only palm the ball down at the feet of N’Diaye, who made no mistake from close range.

Questions will be rightly asked of an unconvincing intervention from the Liverpool goalkeeper, but Mignolet was not the only player culpable. Hernández and N’Diaye reacted quicker than anyone in red when Maguire won the initial header, and were unmarked as Mignolet attempted to claim possession while Jordan Henderson, Lucas Leiva and Nathaniel Clyne were caught static.

Both the Liverpool and Hull defences had been reorganised late in the day, but neither was seriously examined until N’Diaye’s first goal for his new club. Lucas was drafted in at centre-back by Klopp, with Dejan Lovren absent because of a knee problem, while Silva lost his captain, Michael Dawson, to a calf injury during the warm-up. Italian Ranocchia was summonsed from the bench to make his first start since arriving on loan from Internazionale and was one of three full debutants in the Hull team, alongside Grosicki and the goalscorer. All three made assured starts, although it was the Premier League experience of Tom Huddlestone that shone in the centre of Hull’s performance. His quick-thinking and quicker feet helped Hull turn defence into counterattack throughout the first half, but this was not another of those contests that have seen Liverpool toil against deep-lying opposition of late. The visitors were subdued and aimless until finally upping the tempo and threat levels after the restart.

The second half initially reflected a game between a team with designs on the Champions League and another hoping to avoid the Championship. Klopp’s team restarted brightly, stretching Hull repeatedly and forcing a desperate rearguard action. Yet again, however, an end product was absent.

Sadio Mané forced a fine save from the backpeddling Jakupovic when he rose above Andy Robertson to head Adam Lallana’s cross goalwards. The keeper also made a routine save from Can’s diving header before Coutinho missed Liverpool’s clearest opportunity when James Milner’s effort deflected into his path off Maguire. The Brazil international had time and space at the back post, but sliced his shot so badly that it sailed across goal and out.

Almost inevitably, Klopp’s team were punished on the counterattack. Hull’s second goal stemmed from Mané losing possession under a challenge from Maguire. Referee Lee Mason ignored his appeals for a free-kick and Ranocchia played a first-time clearance over the Liverpool defence for Niasse to chase. The Senegal international sprinted through to beat Mignolet with a cool, low finish and Silva’s rescue mission gathered fresh momentum.Adama Traoré died in police custody last year.

The US defence secretary, James Mattis, has reassured European allies nervous about Donald Trump’s presidency that the US will defend any member of Nato that comes under attack from Russia.

On the campaign trail last year, Trump said he would not feel bound by Nato’s article five, under which an attack on any one of the 28 members is treated as an attack on all. Trump singled out the Baltic states, complaining that some of them were not contributing a fair share to Nato defence spending.

But Mattis, in contrast to Trump, told the Munich security conference on Friday: “Article five is a bedrock commitment.” US security, he added, was “permanently tied” to that of Europe.

The conference, which is being attended by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other world leaders as well as 47 foreign ministers and 30 defence ministers, is the first chance most of them have had to meet members of the Trump administration and try to gain clarity about Trump’s foreign policy goals.

Russia denies it's 'disappointed with’ Trump and US relations Read more

But the conference is also a chance for the Trump team – including Mattis, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and the homeland security secretary, John Kelly – to confront European anxieties about their boss.

Those anxieties, which were exacerbated by Trump’s extraordinary 77-minute press conference on Thursday, were on full display as the German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, delivered a robust response to Trump that contrasted with the softer approach of the British government.

Speaking before Mattis, Von der Leyen said negative remarks from Washington about the European Union, including support for Brexit, were not helpful.

“Our American friends know well that their tone on Europe and Nato has a direct influence on the cohesion of our continent,” she said, warning that such remarks could prove damaging to the future cohesion of the EU. “A stable European Union is just as much in the American interest as a united Nato.”

She said the world needed a responsible US government and that there was a need to protect values, such as total opposition to torture. Trump has said torture can be useful.



Von der Leyen also said Nato should establish a better relationship with Russia, and that this should be done collectively, not by Trump going over people’s heads direct to Moscow.

She said Germany accepted it could not continue to rely on the US whenever the going got tough and that it had to increase defence spending: “We must also carry our share of the burden.”

John McCain, the chairman of the US senate armed services committee, said the generation that founded the Munich conference 53 years ago would be alarmed by recent developments such as “the hardening resentment we see toward immigrants, and refugees, and minority groups, especially Muslims”.

He added: “What would alarm them most, I think, is a sense that many of our peoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the west.”

In Brussels this week, Mattis called on Nato members, including Germany, who have not met the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence to increase expenditure.

But Von der Leyen said Germany had committed two years ago to reach the 2% target over a 10-year period.

Mattis also spoke of common US and European values inherited from the Enlightenment and warned that this democratic heritage was facing an unprecedented level of attacks.

“We all see our community of nations under threat on multiple fronts as the arc of instability builds on Nato’s periphery and beyond,” he said, adding: “American security is permanently tied to the security of Europe.”

In spite of warning midweek that the US might begin to scale back its Nato commitments if other countries did not increase defence spending, Mattis confirmed that US troop deployments to the Baltics, Poland and elsewhere in eastern Europe started under Barack Obama would continue as planned.

The UK defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the conference, warned Russia against becoming involved in Libya as it had done in Syria.



Asked if he was concerned that Russia might open a new front in Libya by supporting an alternative leader in the divided country, Fallon said: “We certainly don’t need Russia, the Bear, sticking its paws in.”



The Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, on Thursday put forward a detailed plan to Nato asking for military help. He has the support of the US, the UK, other European leaders and the United Nations.



Russia has been courting the military commander in eastern Libya, Khalifa Haftar, who is opposed to Serraj. Haftar was given a tour of a Russian aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean last month and spoke by video conferencing on the carrier with the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu.

Fallon described the visit to the carrier as symbolic. “It is not interference … yet,” he said. “Putin is testing the west. He is testing the alliance. At any point he sees weakness, he pushes home.”José Mourinho rebuked his Manchester United players for lacking concentration and being too “relaxed and funny” in the dressing room before St-Étienne were beaten 3-0 in the Europa League last-32 first leg .

The manager was delighted with the result, which was due to a Zlatan Ibrahimovic hat-trick that took him to 23 goals, the most in a season for United since Robin van Persie scored 30 in the club’s last title-winning campaign, 2012-13. But Mourinho was particularly unhappy with his side’s attitude beforehand and felt he had to change it during the half-time interval.

He said: “I am delighted, especially because the first half we played so bad and managed to finish the first half winning 1-0 when we didn’t deserve to, so I was pretty confident the second half we had to improve. It was down to lack of concentration, I had a feeling immediately in the dressing room – too noisy, too funny, too relaxed.

“My assistants had the feeling in the warm-up with some of the guys not really focused, not the right adrenaline in their bodies. The game started and the first thing we did was a back pass [by Eric Bailly] to the striker and one-to-one with Sergio [Romero]. When you don’t have concentration it’s hard to recover it. Even on the touchline I felt the communication was difficult so we needed half-time. The second half was a different story, a different result.”

Mourinho did not accept that playing in Europe’s second-tier club competition was an explanation. “I know the Champions League is a competition that everyone wants to play and win,” he added. “But we don’t play Champions League, we play Europa League. We had a group phase a little like this – when we needed to win we did it.

“When the focus is there we answer. Tonight, the first half was too relaxed. St-Étienne had the right intensity and created problems. If the first half had ended 1-1 the game may have been different. If we progress and we beat St-Étienne and go into the last 16 then people will have the right attitude. So let’s do next Wednesday [in the return leg], [get] the right result and go for the next draw.

“To score three goals, not concede at home, it’s a good result. It’s not over but it’s a good result. [Ander] Herrera is suspended [after being booked]. I always respect football, it can be nasty with you. I don’t want my team to be punished so I will go with a strong team.”

Ibrahimovic’s hat-trick was the 17th in his career and also took him to 17 career goals against the French club. “Every time I’ve played against St-Étienne, with hard work there has been a couple of goals,” he said. “We’re winning but in a short time everything can change. It’s important to keep getting the wins we need. Everything can change but we’re happy at the moment. This is the decisive moment for the season. We are still in all four competitions. The fifth we already won [the Community Shield].”In the dramatic magnificence of Tasmania’s Liffey Valley at the property he donated to Bush Heritage Australia, former Greens leader Bob Brown shares the joy of retirement, of renewed vigour for environmental activism, and the wisdom of choosing hope and compassion – even when it all seems hopeless

The NFL hinted last week that “discriminatory” proposals could affect where football’s biggest game ended up – but that seemed to incense Abbott, who launched a tirade on conservative radio host Glenn Beck’s show about how the NFL should behave.

The 59-year-old Republican, who succeeded Rick Perry two years ago, told Beck that the NFL should “get the heck out of politics” and desist from issuing such threats.

Abbott said: “The NFL needs to concentrate on playing football and get the heck out of politics. For some low-level NFL adviser to come out and say that they are going to micromanage and try to dictate to the state of Texas what types of policies we’re going to pass in our state, that’s unacceptable. We don’t care what the NFL thinks and certainly what their political policies are – because they are not a political arm of the state of Texas or the United States of America.”

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy had upset Abbott by saying last week: “The NFL embraces inclusiveness. If a proposal that is discriminatory or inconsistent with our values were to become law there, that would certainly be a factor considered when thinking about awarding future events.”

More than half of NFL players booked for Israel PR trip withdraw Read more

The governor was also offended by Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem last year. “He needs to be standing up in respect for the men and women who died fighting in the United States military so he had the freedom to go out and play a game and get paid $100m,” Abbott said.

The comments on Beck’s show marked Abbott’s second response in three days to McCarthy’s statement following a tweet on Saturday that invoked the NFL’s handling of the Deflategate scandal to cast the league in a negative light.

The NFL has selected future Super Bowl sites through 2021, none of which are in Texas. Dallas hosted the game in 2011, and three Super Bowls have been played in Texas since 2004 – which is second only to Florida.



Under the Texas bill, people would be required to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. It’s similar to a North Carolina law that prompted the NCAA to pull seven championship events from that state last year and is backed by Republican lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, a powerful figure in the state who had cited the Houston Super Bowl as proof that big events will stick around.

Abbott had previously been quieter on the proposal and, noticeably, never mentioned bathrooms while laying out his legislative agenda last month.

Following the NFL statement, Patrick’s office said it was committed to “making sure that every Texan is welcomed” at sporting events.

“Despite persistent misinformation in the media, under Senate Bill 6, all Texas teams will be able to set their own policies at the stadiums and arenas where they play and hold their events. There is no conflict with the NFL’s statement today and our bill,” Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said.

Spokespeople for the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans did not immediately return emails seeking comment.The US vice-president has delivered the most uncompromising message yet from the Trump administration to Nato allies that they have to step up financial contributions towards defence spending.

On his first visit to Europe since taking office, Mike Pence said “some of our largest allies do not have a credible path” towards paying their share of Nato’s financial burden. Although he did not name individual countries, his targets included Germany, France and Italy. “The time has come to do more,” he said.

US defence secretary calms European nerves over Nato Read more

This section of his speech to the Munich security conference, which is being attended by 500 delegates including government leaders and defence and foreign ministers from around the world, was greeted with lukewarm applause.



He was speaking immediately after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made it clear she would not be bullied by the US over defence spending. She said Germany had made a promise to increase defence over the next decade and would fulfil that commitment rather than be forced into the faster rises that Trump is looking for.

Merkel said the focus on defence spending could be misleading. Even if Germany was to spend more, there was not the military capacity available to invest in. She added that Germany saw spending on development in countries in Africa and elsewhere as vital to security as military spending.

The conference marks the first major meeting between the Trump administration and leaders from across Europe since Trump took office.

Pence went further than the US defence secretary, James Mattis, at Nato headquarters on Wednesday in warning Nato allies to stump up more. He said: “As of this moment, the US and only four other Nato members meet that basic standard.”

Those four countries are the UK, Estonia, Greece and Poland. The other 23 Nato members do not meet the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.

In a thinly veiled warning, Pence said that while the US was bound by Nato’s article five– an attack on one member would be an attack on all – he also reminded the audience that article three contained a commitment to sharing the financial burden, echoing Trump’s warning last year that he did not feel bound to come to the defence of countries that did not pay their share.

Pence peppered his speech with regular references to Trump, stressing that he was delivering messages from the president. He softened his criticism of allies with assurances that the president, in spite of rhetoric about isolationism, valued Nato “The US strongly supports Nato and will be unwavering in our support of this transatlantic alliance,” he said.

Pence also attempted to square the contradictory comments made by Trump towards Russia. While the US wanted a new relationship with Russia, he said that the US expected Russia to honour the 2015 Minsk peace agreement aimed at ending violence in Ukraine.

“Know this: the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which, as you know, President Trump believes can be found.”

After the meeting, Pence was scheduled to hold bilateral talks with Merkel and also with the leaders of Ukraine and the Baltic states.



Merkel made the case for more multilateralism rather than a retreat into “parochialism” because of the dangers posed by “no fixed world order”.

With Pence in the room, she avoided direct references to Trump even though many of her comments during her speech and in a question-and-answer session afterwards were aimed at him.

Asked about attacks on the media, Merkel said: “Freedom of the press is a pillar of democracy.”In his 2015 film Youth, Italian film-maker Paolo Sorrentino used Harvey Keitel’s character Mick as a mouthpiece, delivering a diatribe about the war between film and TV through the ageing director’s dialogue. “This is cinema, and that’s just television!” he tells his muse. “Television is shit!” Her ominous response? “Television is the future, Mick.”

Smash cut to the beginning of 2017 and Sorrentino’s unveiling The Young Pope, perhaps his most opulent vision to date – in 10 parts on HBO. He’s just one of the many artists making a mass exodus from the cinema to TV, lured by the promises of handsome budgets, greater creative control, and the wider canvas of extended run times. Danish enfant terrible Nicolas Winding Refn announced just last week that he would write and direct the 10-episode crime saga Too Old to Die Young for Amazon Prime. Guillermo del Toro premiered his animated series Trollhunters exclusively on Netflix shortly before Christmas. The Lobster director Yorgos Lanthimos plans to follow up his next feature with a typically bizarre series starring Kirsten Dunst on FX, bearing the magnificent title On Becoming a God in Central Florida. Even such elder statesmen as Woody Allen have, reluctantly, taken this migration.

Film-makers squeezing their work on to the small screen is hardly a recent innovation; Rainer Werner Fassbinder wowed Germany from their couches with his 14-part epic Berlin Alexanderplatz in 1980, and Krzysztof Kieslowski’s 1989 Polish miniseries The Dekalog may be the crowning achievement of the medium. But the numbers have grown drastically over the past few years, and what’s more, the attitude toward the medium has shifted as well.

Moving to TV used to be an admission of failure for film-makers, a last resort when work got scarce and paychecks stopped flowing. Steven Soderbergh, for instance, brought his Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra to HBO only after spending years searching in vain for a studio buyer. Scarcely a year later, however, Soderbergh returned to TV as the in-house director of Cinemax’s The Knick. He had come onboard to serve the vision of creators Jack Amiel and Michael Begler, but even so, the narrative of his involvement was one of triumph, not defeat. If the suits in Hollywood couldn’t appreciate his distinctive visual style, then he figured he’d take his talents elsewhere.

TV has given auteurs an accommodating home at a time when movie budgets are either ballooning or shrinking. Netflix’s business strategy often equates to selecting a worthy, proven talent and giving them enough money to follow their creative impulses wherever they may lead. The Wachowski sisters could afford to shoot their mind-bending Sense8 on location in eight countries spread across five continents, and more importantly, they didn’t have executives stopping them from staging a surreal singalong to What’s Up by 4 Non-Blondes. Having the latitude to pursue every indulgence has resulted in some highly distinguished work – in all its shameless opulence, The Young Pope plays like it’s on an entirely different plane than the rest of television.

But granting bold directors carte blanche freedom still constitutes a major risk, and while that method can yield True Detective-season-one-sized rewards, it also precipitates some True Detective-season-two-sized failures. Allen’s Amazon series Crisis in Six Scenes reflected all of its creator’s kids-these-days crankiness and precious little of his humor, ranking among the worst in his filmography. Martin Scorsese didn’t personally oversee the full production of Vinyl, stepping in as executive producer and the pilot’s director, and the series came out like an over-the-top parody of his most crowd-pleasing films. Baz Luhrmann took the distinction of Netflix’s most expensive program when he debuted The Get Down last summer (he’s since been dethroned by The Crown), and though his flashy chronicle of hip-hop’s early days had some ardent fans, the Netflix brass regarded it as a costly misfire. To hire a big name is to go all-in, inviting a masterwork or, just as easily, a disaster.

This phenomenon will only grow more common in the years to come – Netflix landed Spike Lee for a She’s Gotta Have It series, Amazon purchased two eight-episode seasons’ worth of David O Russell’s time, and the Coen brothers will join him on the streaming platform with the Old West-set series The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Whether this trend is cause for celebration or concern is something of a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty situation. A viewer can choose to be grateful that film-makers are still being provided with the parameters they need to make the work they want, or lament the slow death of big-screen grandeur and spectacle in moving to the humbler platform of TV. What’s certain is that the influx of new blood has made the TV landscape a far more unpredictable place to be, where the hits reach higher highs and the misses usually have the confidence to stumble with style. From the shores of Cannes and the peaks of Sundance, right to your living room.Psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers have signed an open letter warning Donald Trump’s mental state “makes him incapable of serving safely as president”.

The 35 mental health professionals said Mr Trump’s “words and behaviour suggest a profound inability to empathise”.

The President’s tendency to “distort reality” to fit his “personal myth of greatness” and attack those who challenge him with facts was likely to increase in a position of power, they added.

It is usually frowned upon among psychiatrists to give a professional opinion of the mental state of a public figure they have not examined in person, as dictated by a passage in the American Psychiatric Association’s code of ethics known as the Goldwater rule.

But in a letter to the New York Times, the doctors said they had decided it was necessary to break their silence on the matter because they feared “too much is at stake”.

“This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time,” they wrote. “We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer.”

Andrew Sullivan: Journalists need to question Trump's mental health

The letter continued: “Mr Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behaviour suggest a profound inability to empathise.

“Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them [journalists, scientists].

“In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.”

Among the letter’s signatories were Lance Dodes, a retired Harvard Medical School assistant clinical professor of psychiatry, and Joseph Schachter, who has held a senior position in the International Psychoanalytic Association.

A growing number of mental health professionals and Senators of both parties have expressed concern over Mr Trump’s psychological state.

Conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan said the media should be seriously discussing the President’s mental health.

“To have such an unstable figure, incapable of accepting reality, at the centre of the world, is an extremely dangerous thing,” he told CNN.

“I know we're not supposed to bring this up — but it is staring us brutally in the face.”

Mr Sullivan, who recently penned an article entitled 'The Madness of King Donald' in New York Magazine, justified his comments by citing the President’s incorrect claims of “thousands” of illegal voters and inaccurate crime statistics.

Republican colleagues of Donald Trump have also expressed concern about his mental health, a Democratic senator told Associated Press.

Minnesota senator Al Franken said there is concern among “a few” Republicans “that we all have this suspicion” that “he lies a lot”. He added: “He says things that aren't true. That's the same as lying, I guess.”Theresa May has made an impassioned defence of her decision to seek close links with Donald Trump, telling prime minister’s questions that while Labour wanted to “lead a protest” against the US president, she was protecting British interests.

The prime minister gave her strongest condemnation yet of Trump’s temporary ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries entering the US, calling it “divisive and wrong”.

But questioned repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn about her slowness and caution in condemning the policy, May insisted Trump’s planned state visit to the UK should go ahead.



At times May was openly taunted by the Labour leader, who referred to a letter she had sent him by saying: “I hold in my hand her piece of paper”, a reference to Neville Chamberlain’s disastrous 1938 appeasement of Hitler. But May defended her trip to see Trump last week.

“The right honourable gentleman’s foreign policy is to object to and insult the democratically elected head of state of our most important ally,” she told Corbyn. “Let’s just see what he would have achieved last week.”

May asked rhetorically if Corbyn would have achieved an exemption for UK citizens from Trump’s travel order, or seen him commit to Nato and to the idea of a trade deal with the UK, bringing mass replies of “No!” from her MPs.

She said: “That’s what Labour has to offer this country: less protection for British citizens, less prosperous, less safe. He can lead a protest. I’m leading a country.”



Corbyn devoted his entire allocation of questions to Trump and US relations, beginning: “At last week’s prime minister’s question time, the prime minister told the house: ‘I’m not afraid to speak frankly to the president of the United States.’ What happened?”

May replied: “I was able to build on the relationship that we have with our most important ally, and to get some very significant commitments from President Trump.”

Asked whether she had prior notice of the travel ban, which has prompted protests and condemnation, May said she had not, adding her strongest personal criticism yet of the plan.

“On the policy that President Trump has introduced, this government is clear that that policy is wrong,” the prime minister said. “We wouldn’t do it. In six years as home secretary I never introduced such a policy. We believe it is divisive and wrong.”



Praising the UK’s record on settling refugees, she added: “The question is how you respond. The job of government is not to chase the headlines. The job of government is not to take to the streets in protest. The job of government is to protect the interests of British citizens. And that’s exactly what we did.”



Corbyn asked the prime minister whether access to the NHS for US healthcare firms had been offered up as a “bargaining chip” for a new trade deal. May replied, to cheers from her MPs: “The NHS is not for sale and it never will be.”

The Labour leader ended by noting Trump’s travel ban, his stated intention to quit climate change deals, his defence of torture and dubious record on women’s rights.

He asked, referring to a petition against the state visit: “Just what more does President Trump have to do before the prime minister will listen to the 1.8 million people who have already called for his state visit invitation to be withdrawn?”

New York Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis faces five pending charges, including two counts of aggravated assault, after allegedly being involved in a fight with two men last weekend.

According to a Pittsburgh police statement and a court document, the 31-year-old Revis also is facing charges of robbery, terroristic threats, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault after the incident on Sunday at 2.43am.

Revis’ attorney, Blaine Jones, said in a statement on Thursday that Revis was “physically assaulted while at that location by a group of at least five people.” He adds that the Jets cornerback “feared for his safety” and sought medical attention.

Jones told The Associated Press once a warrant is issued, he will arrange for Revis to turn himself in. “One of the other guys initiated physical contact,” Jones said. “Darrelle was walking away. He was in fear for his life and fear for his safety.”

Police say the alleged fight started when a 22-year-old man from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, not identified in the statement, spotted Revis walking along East Carson Street. After Revis confirmed he was the NFL player, the man started recording the interaction. Revis grabbed the phone and tried to delete the video. Another 21-year-old man from Ross Township tried to help the other man, but Revis tossed the phone into the road, the statement says.

An argument ensued, ending with another man helping Revis, according to the police statement. Police say the 22-year-old man and the 21-year-old man claimed they were punched and knocked out. According to police, the two men regained consciousness and spoke to authorities.

Witnesses told police that the two men were unconscious for about 10 minutes. The responding officers viewed the video on the phone and confirmed that the person was Revis.

In his statement, Jones said that Revis, an Aliquippa native, was in the Pittsburgh area to visit family and friends last weekend. During the time of the incident, Jones said Revis “went by a location in the Southside that he is in the process of developing.” That is when, according to Jones, Revis was assaulted.

The Jets said in a statement that the team is aware of the incident and has spoken to Revis, but issued no further comment.

Revis was a star at the University of Pittsburgh and was drafted No14 overall by the Jets in 2007. He quickly established himself as one of the top players at his position — and in franchise history — while also earning the nickname, “Revis Island” for his penchant for routinely shutting down opposing teams’ top receivers.

His second tenure with New York, after stints with Tampa Bay and New England, might be over after two seasons. Revis is scheduled to make $15m, including a $2m roster bonus due on 11 March, next season — but that would be a lofty salary for an aging player who admittedly had a subpar year that he attributed to age and injuries.

The Jets would still owe him $6m if they cut him as part of the $39m in guarantees in the five-year, $70m deal he signed with New York in 2015. Revis, who could perhaps agree to a pay cut, has also entertained the idea of making a position change to safety.Tracking the 45th president of the United States, one day at a time The first 100 days of trumpCanadian university professor Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan has found what is believed to be the first, and possibly only, footage of French writer Marcel Proust.

Zhang Yimou’s new film is a laborious fantasy spectacular crossed with a CGI monster movie, set in the days of Imperial China, in a military garrison on the Great Wall. Here, it is revealed that the wall’s purpose is to keep out hordes of Tao Tei – terrifying creatures with T rex heads and great spiny teeth. There is, however, no way of making the Tao Tei actually pay for the wall.

The film credits a host of writers including Tony Gilroy, Max Brooks, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, whose opening credits cheekily claim that their story is based on one of the legends of the wall, while outrageously borrowing a key plot point from Jaws.

Matt Damon plays William, a mercenary adventurer who has come to China hoping to steal some of their explosive “black powder”. His weird accent suggests that Williams, like Russell Crowe’s Robin Hood, hails from that part of Tipperary that shares a border with County Durham. He is with his Spanish friend Tovar (Pedro Pascal) when they are captured by the Chinese: commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing) and strategist Wang (Andy Lau), who have a sneaking respect for the way these westerners handle themselves with the monsters. Will our heroes use the beasts’ uproar as cover to steal the black powder, or do the decent thing and help the Chinese battle these hideous creatures? The Tao Teis’ death agonies are as nothing to those of the film itself.When Stefano Boeri imagines the future of urban China he sees green, and lots of it. Office blocks, homes and hotels decked from top to toe in a verdant blaze of shrubbery and plant life; a breath of fresh air for metropolises that are choking on a toxic diet of fumes and dust.

Last week, the Italian architect, famed for his tree-clad Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest) skyscraper complex in Milan, unveiled plans for a similar project in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing.

The Chinese equivalent – Boeri’s first in Asia – will be composed of two neighbouring towers coated with 23 species of tree and more than 2,500 cascading shrubs. The structures will reportedly house offices, a 247-room luxury hotel, a museum and even a green architecture school, and are currently under construction, set for completion next year.

But Boeri now has even bolder plans for China: to create entire “forest cities” in a country that has become synonymous with environmental degradation and smog.

“We have been asked to design an entire city where you don’t only have one tall building but you have 100 or 200 buildings of different sizes, all with trees and plants on the facades,” Boeri told the Guardian. “We are working very seriously on designing all the different buildings. I think they will start to build at the end of this year. By 2020 we could imagine having the first forest city in China.”

Boeri described his “vertical forest” concept as the architectural equivalent of a skin graft, a targeted intervention designed to bring new life to a small corner of China’s polluted urban sprawl. His Milan-based practice claimed the buildings would suck 25 tons of carbon dioxide from Nanjing’s air each year and produce about 60 kg of oxygen every day.

“It is positive because the presence of such a large number of plants, trees and shrubs is contributing to the cleaning of the air, contributing to absorbing CO2 and producing oxygen,’ the architect said. “And what is so important is that this large presence of plants is an amazing contribution in terms of absorbing the dust produced by urban traffic.”

Boeri said, though, that it would take more than a pair of tree-covered skyscrapers to solve China’s notorious pollution crisis.

“Two towers in a huge urban environment [such as Nanjing] is so, so small a contribution – but it is an example. We hope that this model of green architecture can be repeated and copied and replicated.”

If the Nanjing project is a skin graft, Boeri’s blueprints for “forest cities” are more like an organ transplant. The Milan-born architect said his idea was to create a series of sustainable mini-cities that could provide a green roadmap for the future of urban China.

The first such settlement will be located in Luizhou, a mid-sized Chinese city of about 1.5 million residents in the mountainous southern province of Guangxi. More improbably, a second project is being conceived around Shijiazhuang, an industrial hub in northern China that is consistently among the country’s 10 most polluted cities.

Compared with the vertical forests, these blueprints represent “something more serious in terms of a contribution to changing the environmental urban conditions in China,” Boeri said.

Boeri, 60, first came to China in 1979. Five years ago he opened an office in Shanghai, where he leads a research program at the city’s Tongji University.

The architect said believed Chinese officials were finally understanding that they needed to embrace a new, more sustainable model of urban planning that involved not “huge megalopolises” but settlements of 100,000 people or fewer that were entirely constructed of “green architecture”.

“What they have done until now is simply to continue to add new peripheral environments to their cities,” he said. “They have created these nightmares – immense metropolitan environments. They have to imagine a new model of city that is not about extending and expanding but a system of small, green cities.”

Boeri described the idea behind his shrub-shrouded structures as simple, not spectacular: “What is spectacular is the nature, the idea of having a building that changes colour with each season. The plants and trees are growing and they are completely changing.”

“We think – and we hope – that this idea of vertical forests can be replicated everywhere. I absolutely have no problem if there are people who are copying or replicating. I hope that what we have done can be useful for other kinds of experiments.”

The award-winning director of The Pianist and Chinatown, who has been a fugitive from the US for almost 40 years, claims he has reached a plea deal in the case that would keep him out of prison, his attorney Harland Braun said.

Braun has written to Los Angeles county superior court judge Scott Gordon to unseal a secret transcript of the testimony of the prosecutor in the case, which he believes will confirm the deal.

The Franco-Polish director was accused of drugging Samantha Gailey – who now uses the surname Geimer – before raping her at film star Jack Nicholson’s house in Los Angeles in 1977.

Polanski, who is now 83, admitted having unlawful sex with a minor, or statutory rape, and spent 42 days in Chino state prison before being released.

But in 1978, convinced a judge was going to scrap the plea deal and hand him a hefty prison sentence, he fled for France.

Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 on a US extradition request and spent 10 months under house arrest before the Swiss authorities rejected the US order.

The US then asked Poland to extradite Polanski in January 2015, but the country’s supreme court ruled in December 2016 that he had served his time under the plea deal.

Braun believes the secret testimony of prosecutor Roger Gunson collected in 2010 in the US supports Polanski’s claim that he had an agreement to serve just 48 days and that – taken with the Polish decision – it should convince the US authorities his client has served his time.



“After we confirm the contents, we will urge the court to recognise the Polish decision resulting from a litigation initiated by the (district attorney) and in which the DA participated,” Braun told AFP.

“If the court accepts the principle of comity, Roman can come to Los Angeles and to court without fear of custody.”

Polanski’s French legal team said the filmmaker was not intending to be present at a hearing scheduled for next week in Los Angeles to consider a request.

Polanski told the private news channel TVN24 after the Polish court had ruled in his favor that he was “happy this business is over once and for all”.

“I only regret that I had to wait so long. I’ll finally be able to feel safe in my own country.”

Polanski, who lives in France and had been avoiding Poland because of the case, said he planned to visit his father’s grave in the southern city of Krakow.

The filmmaker has been engaged in a decades-long cat-and-mouse game with US officials seeking his extradition for trial, before a global audience split between continuing outrage and forgiveness for his acts.

Born in Paris in 1933 to Polish Jewish parents who later brought the family back to their native country, he saw his parents arrested by the Nazis in Krakow’s Jewish ghetto and sent to concentration camps.

He began his career in the film industry and was lured to Hollywood in 1968, where he shot his first big international hit, Rosemary’s Baby, starring Mia Farrow as an expecting mother carrying the devil’s spawn.



But tragedy struck the following year when his heavily-pregnant wife, the model and actress Sharon Tate, and four friends were brutally slaughtered in the director’s mansion by cult leader Charles Manson and his followers.

Polanski wants to visit Tate’s grave in Los Angeles, the celebrity news website TMZ has reported. He has also not been able to visit his daughter in London, it said.Keep it in the ground



Join us in urging the world’s two biggest charitable funds to move their money out of fossil fuels

To Bill and Melinda Gates, founders of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Jeremy Farrar and Sir William Castell, director and chair of the Wellcome Trust:

Your organisations have made a huge contribution to human progress and equality by supporting scientific research and development projects. Yet your investments in fossil fuels are putting this progress at great risk, by undermining your long term ambitions.

Climate change poses a real threat to all of us, and it is morally and financially misguided to invest in companies dedicated to finding and burning more oil, gas and coal. Many philanthropic organisations are divesting their endowments from fossil fuels. We ask you to do the same: to commit now to divesting from the top 200 fossil fuel companies within five years and to immediately freeze any new investments in those companies.

The argument for a campaign to divest from the world’s most polluting companies is becoming an overwhelming one, on both moral and financial grounds. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu puts it: “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change”.

Note from Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief

Divestment serves to delegitimise the business models of companies that are using investors’ money to search for yet more coal, oil and gas that can’t safely be burned. It is a small but crucial step in the economic transition away from a global economy run on fossil fuels.

The usual rule of newspaper campaigns is that you don’t start one unless you know you’re going to win it. This one will almost certainly be won in time: the physics is unarguable. But we are launching our campaign today in the firm belief that it will force the issue now into the boardrooms and inboxes of people who have billions of dollars at their disposal.

What they say

We’re not going to be able to burn it all”

Barack Obama

Frequently asked questions

What is fossil fuel divestment?

Divestment is the opposite of investment – it is the removal of your investment capital from stocks, bonds or funds. The global movement for fossil fuel divestment (sometimes also called disinvestment) is asking institutions to move their money out of oil, coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons. These institutions include universities, religious institutions, pension funds, local authorities and charitable foundations.

Evidence shows that proven fossil fuel reserves are more than three times higher than we can afford to burn in order to stay below the generally agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Fossil fuel companies are currently banking on extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. By supporting these companies, investors not only continue to fund unsustainable business models that are bound to make climate change worse, but they also risk their financial assets becoming worthless if international agreements on climate change are met.
