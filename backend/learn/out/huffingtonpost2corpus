KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Malaysian police said on Saturday they had arrested a North Korean man in connection with the murder of the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as a diplomatic spat over his body escalated.

Kim Jong Nam died this week after being assaulted at Kuala Lumpur International Airport with what was thought to be a fast-acting poison. South Korean and U.S. officials have said he was assassinated by North Korean agents.

Malaysian police said the latest arrest connected with the murder was made on Friday night, and the suspect was identified as Ri Jong Chol, born on May 6, 1970. He was in possession of a Malaysian i-Kad, which is an identification card given to foreign workers, they added.

“He is suspected to be involved in the death of a North Korean male,” read a statement.

The police chief for Selangor state, Abdul Samah Mat, said the suspect had been remanded in police custody.

Two female suspects, one an Indonesian and the other carrying Vietnamese travel documents, have already been arrested, while a Malaysian man has been detained. At least three more suspects are at large, government sources have said.

Kim Jong Nam, the eldest son of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, had spoken out publicly against his family’s dynastic control of isolated, nuclear-armed North Korea.

South Korea’s intelligence agency told lawmakers in Seoul that Kim had been living with his second wife in the Chinese territory of Macau, under China’s protection.

He had been at the Kuala Lumpur airport to catch a flight to Macau when he was killed. An autopsy is being performed at a hospital in the capital city.

Selangor state police chief Abdul Samah told Reuters that the autopsy report was not complete yet. He dismissed media reports that a second autopsy would have to be conducted.

DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION

North Korea said in the early hours of Saturday that it would categorically reject Malaysia’s autopsy report on the death of Kim Jong Nam, and accused Malaysia of “colluding with outside forces,” in a veiled reference to rival nation South Korea.

Malaysia hit back by saying the country’s rules must be followed. The foreign ministry has yet to make any comment.

Health minister Dr S.Subramaniam told state news agency Bernama that Malaysia was waiting for the toxicology report to complete the autopsy.

He said the autopsy report would hopefully be released “within this week.”

The case threatens to weaken North Korea’s ties with Malaysia, one of the few countries that has maintained good diplomatic relations with Pyongyang.

North Korea’s nuclear arms and weapons programs have alarmed the West, most recently its test of a ballistic missile earlier this month in its first direct challenge to the international community since Donald Trump became U.S. president.

Pyongyang’s main ally and trading partner is China, which is irritated by its repeated aggressive actions but rejects suggestions from the United States and others that it could be doing more to rein in its neighbor.

On Saturday, China said it had further tightened trade restrictions with North Korea by suspending all imports of coal starting Feb. 19, although it did not say why. Coal exports to China are a vital source of revenues for Pyongyang.

ROW OVER AUTOPSY

Kim Jong Nam was assaulted at the low cost terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday with what is believed to be fast acting poison before he could board a flight to Macau. He sought help but died on the way to the hospital.

North Korea demanded on Friday night that Kim Jong Nam’s body be released immediately. It had earlier tried to persuade Malaysian authorities not to carry out an autopsy.

“The Malaysian side forced the post-mortem without our permission and witnessing,” the North Korean ambassador Kang Chol told reporters outside the hospital where the body of Kim Jong Nam is being kept.

“We will categorically reject the result of the post mortem ... “

He said Kim Jong Nam had a diplomatic passport and was under the consular protection of North Korea.Samantha Cameron has revealed how the death of her young son, Ivan, “overshadows everything”.

The fashion entrepreneur said his premature death in 2009, the year before David Cameron entered No 10, was of such magnitude that it made everything else “irrelevant” and “meaningless”, reports the Press Association.

Their first child, Ivan was born with a severe form of epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died shortly before his seventh birthday.

John Giles/PA Archive Samantha and David Cameron with Ivan in 2008.

In an emotional interview for The Times she described how they had to cope with regular “life or death situations” throughout the youngster’s life, yet it came as a “huge shock”.

Mrs Cameron said she sought strength from her faith and found hosting charity events at Downing Street cathartic, although she would often be brought to tears when meeting children and parents in similar situations.

Meanwhile the experience coloured her husband’s politics, she told the newspaper.

“It’s the biggest thing in my life. Being the prime minister’s wife was just a role,” she said.

“Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant. It just overshadows everything. What goes on in the outside world becomes meaningless.

“Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice.”

Mrs Cameron said the couple relied on routine so they did not “fall apart completely” and they still visit Ivan’s grave “very often”.

When Mr Cameron announced his resignation after losing the referendum in June he appeared on the steps of Downing Street flanked by his wife and Ivan’s siblings, Nancy, Florence and Arthur, who had grown up the flat above No 11.

In a way their brother’s death had helped her prepare for the “parallel universe” of life in Westminster, Mrs Cameron explained.

“I think it changed Dave’s politics. It made him understanding, although he couldn’t be too subjective,” she said.

The family now spend their time between homes in Notting Hill, west London, and Oxfordshire, where Mr Cameron served as MP for Witney for 15 years.

Mrs Cameron, who worked for British leather brand Smythson while he was PM, has now launched her own women’s wear label, Ceffin.（１９８１年８月１９日撮影）記念撮影をする金正日労働党総書記（前列左）と長男の金正男氏（前列右）、後列は左から、正男氏の伯母の成恵琅氏、その娘の李南玉氏、息子の李韓永氏（北朝鮮・平壌） 撮影日：1981年08月19日

Des milliers de Mexicains ont formé vendredi un "mur humain" le long de la frontière avec les États-Unis pour protester contre le projet de mur frontalier du président américain Donald Trump.

La manifestation, organisée par les autorités locales et des associations civiles, a réuni de nombreux étudiants à Ciudad Juárez (nord), ainsi que des politiques et leaders sociaux locaux.

"Le voici ton mur!", scandait Cristian Ramirez, un étudiant de 15 ans, venu une fleur à la main comme beaucoup de ses compagnons. "Qu'est-ce que tu en penses si nous le faisons comme ça (ton mur) au lieu de mettre du béton et fer?" criait-il.

Sous les regards d'une patrouille frontalière américaine, les manifestants ont formé une chaîne humaine d'environ 1,5 km, se tenant par les bras, certains drapés dans des drapeaux mexicains ou vêtus de blanc.

"Ciudad Juárez et El Paso sommes une seule et même ville, nous ne serons jamais séparés" a lancé aux manifestants Oscar Leeser, le maire né au Mexique de El Paso, la ville frontalière américaine située en face de Ciudad Juárez.

L'élu a appelé à lutter pour cette unité qui caractérise les zones frontalières.

"Le mur est l'une des pires idées qui soit, cela ne va rien empêcher, ni les drogues, ni les migrants, c'est uniquement un symbole de la haine de Donald Trump, du racisme du président" commentait à l'AFP Ana Carolina Solis, 31 ans, étudiante en sciences sociales.

"Beaucoup d'entre nous ont de la famille à El Paso, ou vont étudier là-bas, beaucoup de gens traversent quotidiennement, car ils travaillent là-bas" expliquait Leo Alvarez, un travailleur social de 34 ans.

"Trump provoque la peur chez nos concitoyens aux États-Unis, nous devons nous montrer solidaires avec eux et leur afficher notre soutien. Si on les expulse, nous les accueillerons à bras ouverts" a déclaré le maire de Ciudad Juárez, Armando Cabada, également présent à la manifestation.

A 1.200 kilomètres de là, sur la côte Pacifique, une cinquantaine de personnes se sont retrouvées en fin de journée à la frontière entre la ville mexicaine de Tijuana et sa voisine américaine de San Diego, pour dénoncer elles aussi le projet de mur.

Ces manifestations se déroulent près d'un mois après la prise de fonction de Donald Trump qui a signé un décret lançant la construction du mur à la frontière et affiché sa volonté d'accélérer l'expulsion des immigrants illégaux.

The RSPCA has launched an investigation after officers were called to a sea of one-day-old chicks who were dumped in Crowland, near Peterborough.

Members of the public alerted the animal welfare charity to the shocking sight.

RSPCA The RSPCA is investigating after 1,000 one-day-old chicks were dumped in a Cambridgeshire field.

RSPCA inspector Justin Stubbs said: “I have never seen anything like it, it was just a sea of yellow. And the noise was unbelievable.

“The chicks are only about a day old and are really tiny and quite delicate. Some of the birds were dead or dying when we arrived so some, sadly, had to be humanely put to sleep.

“Thankfully, most of the chicks did not appear to be suffering.”

RSPCA It is believed the chicks came from a commercial chick producer nearby.

The producer is cooperating and assisting the RSPCA with their investigations, the animal welfare organisation said.

“The breeder came to the scene to collect the surviving birds and take them back to their unit,” Stubbs added.

“These tiny birds wouldn’t have survived long out on their own at such a young age and in such unpredictable weather conditions.

“For someone to dump these vulnerable chicks is unbelievable.

“But I’d like to thank all the members of the public who teamed together to help us round up all the birds and confine them in boxes where they could huddle together for warmth.”

CHENNAI -- Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy on Saturday lashed out at former state chief minister O. Paneerselvam, saying that the latter worked against late J. Jayalalithaa's government.

"Everybody watched how rival faction (OPS camp) worked against Amma's government. This day brought forward real Amma supporters," said Palanisamy while addressing the media in Chennai.

Meanwhile, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) headed by party's working president M.K. Stalin staged protest at Chennai's Marina Beach, following which Stalin and other protesting MLAs were detained by police.

Earlier, Stalin had also met Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao post the floor test result to apprise him of the situation.

Amid the uproar in the Tami Nadu Assembly during Saturday's much-anticipated floor test, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy won the vote of confidence with 122 MLAs supporting him.

The floor test took place in Block Two of the Tamil Nadu assembly.

Earlier, the Congress staged a walk out from the assembly, while Speaker P. Dhanapal ordered the assembly police to evict the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MLAs from the house as soon as the assembly resumed functioning after getting adjourned following an uproar over the secret ballot process.

"You tore my shirt and insulted me. I am doing my work abiding by the law," Speaker Dhanapal was quoted, as saying to the MLAs.

However, DMK working president M.K. Stalin alleged that his shirt was torn off when the assembly police forcefully evicted his party MLAs and the Speaker tore of his shirt himself and blamed the MLAs of the DMK for it.

"We were told that assembly will reconvene at 3 p.m., but at 2 p.m. police came and tried to forcefully evict us. My shirt was also torn," Stalin said.

The assembly was adjourned twice on Saturday, once at 1 p.m. and again at 3 p.m.

The assembly was facing its first floor test in 30 years, and there was a debate over the ballot, with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League expressing mixed views about the confidence vote.

Ahead of the crucial ' floor test', Panneerselvam appealed to AIADMK MLAs to vote against Palanisamy. "MLAs should be given time to hear the views of their constituency people. Time should be given till then," he said, during the assembly session.

Palanisamy took oath as Tamil Nadu's 13th Chief Minister on Thursday. A total of 31 other All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MLAs were also sworn in.

Also on HuffPost India:Bill Maher went all in against Republicans on Friday.

The “Real Time” host asked why they were so willing to give their politicians ― or at least the ones with the “magic” capital R after their names ― such an easy ride.

“Because if you have one of those [the capital R], you can get away with pretty much anything when it comes to selling out, cursing out or compromising your own country,” said Maher.

In just four weeks of office, Maher said Republicans had allowed GOP President Donald Trump to get away with things they would never have tolerated from former Democratic President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

“I gotta say to all you flag-waving right-wingers who always say, ‘I’m not just gonna stand here and let you run down America’ ― you’re standing there and letting Trump run down America,” he said.El presidente Donald Trump pinta a los refugiados como “tipos malos” con “malas intenciones”. En realidad, los refugiados son en su amplia mayoría mujeres, niños y familias que huyen de situaciones desesperadas en su país de origen.

Una nueva exposición, titulada Refuge, pone de manifiesto esta extraña yuxtaposición mostrando el rostro de niños refugiados que llevan las de perder con la mayoría de las políticas de Trump.

La artista visual Claire Salvo conceptualizó el proyecto el pasado otoño como una forma de despolitizar el debate sobre la acogida de refugiados. En particular, quería destacar el hecho de que más de la mitad de los refugiados del mundo son niños y muchos de ellos sólo han conocido la vida dentro de un campo de refugiados.

“Quería quitar el aspecto político y simplemente hacerlo humano”, explica Salvo a la edición estadounidense de The Huffington Post. “Hay algo en los niños con lo que todo el mundo puede familiarizarse. Nadie puede negar que el niño no ha elegido —en realidad nadie elige— ser un refugiado. Ellos no tienen ni voz ni voto en esta cuestión”.

Salvo trabajó con la rama local de Church World Service (CWS), una organización de ayuda a los refugiados, para localizar a familias que pudieran estar interesadas en participar. En Lancaster, Pennsylvania (Estados Unidos), donde vive la artista, no fue difícil.

Lancaster se conoce como “la capital americana de los refugiados”. La ciudad acoge casi 20 veces más refugiados por cápita que cualquier otra ciudad de Estados Unidos. En 2016, Church World Service Lancaster colaboró en la acogida de más de 400 refugiados, casi la mitad de los cuales eran menores de 18 años.

“Esta es la gente a la que el presidente Trump quiere cerrar nuestras puertas. Se encuentran entre las personas más vulnerables del mundo”, cuenta al HuffPost Stephanie Gromek, coordinadora de recursos de la comunidad para Church World Service Lancaster.

La organización puso en contacto a Salvo con tres familias interesadas en participar, y la artista se ha pasado los últimos tres meses fotografiando, entrevistando y dibujando a quince niños de las familias. Salvo hizo las fotos con un iPhone y los retratos con carboncillo. Subastará las obras a partir de mayo y una parte de los ingresos será donada a las familias participantes, explica la artista.

Esta es la gente a la que el presidente Trump quiere cerrar nuestras puertas.

Las tres familias sólo hablaban su lengua materna cuando llegaron a Estados Unidos, “con poco más que su ropa a las espaldas”, señala Gromek.

Una de las familias es musulmana, procede de Somalia —uno de los países incluidos en el primer veto migratorio de Trump— y llegó el pasado mes de diciembre a Estados Unidos. Las otras dos, emparentadas entre sí, viven bajo el mismo techo. Proceden de Etiopía y pertenecen a la tribu Anuak, una minoría étnica perseguida.





This is nine-year-old Uwen, named after the @unitednations. She was born to Ethiopian parents in the Kenyan refugee camp where they lived for eleven years. She and her family resettled in Lancaster two years ago. While in Kenya, Uwen and her immediate family were separated from their cousins. Three months ago, at the request of Uwen's father and with the help of @cwslancaster, they were reunited. Now they live - all thirteen of them - under one roof in Lancaster City. Uwen wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up. Her favorite food is pizza. Before I snapped this photo, we had an eye-crossing contest. She won 😉 #REFUGEexhibit Una foto publicada por REFUGE (@refugeexhibit) el 18 de Ene de 2017 a la(s) 11:36 PST

“Esta es Uwen, de 9 años, llamada así por las Naciones Unidas. Sus padres son etíopes y ella nació en un campo de refugiados de Kenia, donde vivieron durante 11 años. La niña y su familia llegaron a Lancaster hace dos años. Cuando estaban en Kenia, Uwen y su familia inmediata fueron separados de sus primos. Hace tres meses, por la solicitud del padre de Uwen y con la ayuda de @cwslancaster, pudieron reunirse. Ahora viven los 13 bajo el mismo techo en Lancaster City. Uwen quiere ser veterinaria cuando sea mayor. Su comida favorita es la pizza. Antes de hacer esta foto, jugamos a ver quién se ponía más bizca. Ganó ella”.

El proceso de reasentamiento es arduo. Los refugiados que la ONU recomienda que vayan a Estados Unidos se someten a un riguroso proceso de examen que dura dos años e incluye aspectos como la orientación cultural; además, se requieren varios certificados de seguridad y salud.

Cuando obtuvieron el permiso, los refugiados compraron los billetes de viaje a través de la Organización Internacional para la Migración, que les concedió un préstamo sin intereses.

“Es su primer crédito cuando llegan a Estados Unidos y se espera que lo paguen”, especifica Gromek. “Es una forma de que se establezcan”. No obstante, según la coordinadora, muchos refugiados necesitan años y años para poder pagar el crédito, especialmente si su familia es amplia.

“Los refugiados son unas de las personas más trabajadoras que conozco”, afirma Salvo. “Muchos sacan adelante a familias de diez miembros con un salario mínimo y están muy agradecidos por estar aquí”.

Karacharo, age 2. The road to citizenship for her brothers, sisters and parents will be long, but for Karacharo, it's done. She was born in the United States just months after her family moved here from a Kenyan refugee camp. In Anuak, her name means "American." #REFUGEexhibit Una foto publicada por REFUGE (@refugeexhibit) el 25 de Ene de 2017 a la(s) 9:50 PST

“Karacharo, 2 años. Para sus hermanos y sus padres, el camino hacia la ciudadanía será largo, pero Karacharo ya ha llegado a la meta. Ella nació en Estados Unidos meses después de que su familia se mudara allí desde un campo de refugiados de Kenia. En el idioma Anuak, su nombre significa ‘Americana”.

Durante sus entrevistas con las familias, Salvo les preguntó “cuál es tu mayor esperanza ahora que vives en Estados Unidos”. La barrera lingüística les complicó bastante todo el proceso. Pero una de las madres, Faduma, se las arregló para comunicar que lo que más quería era una lavadora y una secadora, recuerda Salvo.



Un día, cuando Salvo salía de su casa vio que un vecino había dejado una lavadora al lado de los contenedores de basura. La fotógrafa dice que llamó a un amigo para que la ayudara a subir la lavadora a su coche y así la llevó a las oficinas de CWS con una nota de que era para Faduma.

“Las cosas que quieren los refugiados son muy básicas”, asegura Salvo, “y son cosas que damos por sentado, como no tener que andar casi dos kilómetros para ir hasta la lavandería”.

Los niños refugiados tienen sus propias tareas cuando llegan a Estados Unidos, afirma Gromek. Entre ellas se incluyen aprender inglés, recibir varias vacunas e inscribirse en la escuela. Al cabo de un mes, la mayoría ya ha empezado las clases.



“Los niños tienen una resiliencia propia y los niños refugiados, aún más. Creo que por todo lo que han vivido”, reflexiona Gromek. “Al final, salen adelante”.

Caos en los aeropuertos tras las nuevas medidas de Donald Trump:



Ve a nuestra portada Facebook Twitter Instagram PinterestViele Fans des TV-Stars Verona Pooth rätseln schon seit Jahren darüber, warum die 48-Jährige noch immer so jung aussieht. Dabei genügt schon ein Blick auf ihr Instagram-Profil, um zu sehen, dass Verona Pooth ganz einfach viel Sport macht.

Sie setze zudem auf Lebensmittel wie Fisch, Fleisch und viel Gemüse, verriet sie der Nachrichtenagentur "Spot on News". Mindestens zwei Mal die Woche mache sie außerdem für 20 Minuten Sport. "Crash-Diäten mache ich nicht", sagte der TV-Star. "Bei mir wird nicht gehungert."

Das klingt doch wenigstens mal nach einem gesunden Lebensstil. Ihr Geheimnis, auch jetzt noch so jung auszusehen, könnte aber tatsächlich an etwas ganz anderem liegen, wie ihr im Video oben seht.

BBc Danny Dyer

“Danny is on a short break from EastEnders. This was not enforced by bosses nor has he quit the show,” the statement read.

Now cast and crew on the soap are worried that Danny is on the verge of quitting his role as Queen Vic landlord, Mick Carter.

A source told The Sun: “Danny has been the main conversation on set all week.

The 39-year-old actor, who is paid £400,000 a year, is contracted to stay with the soap until November.

Only last month, the Mick Carter actor hinted that he might leave Albert Square.

“Four years is a long time,” he said. “It’s been really rewarding but there’s other stuff out there.

“I’d love to show other sides to me, I loved theatre and all that.”

Danny’s off-screen antics have made headlines in the past. Last year, he ended up with a black eye after getting caught up in a fight at V Festival with friends of former ‘TOWIE’ star Mark Wright.

And in 2014, he got a bit too close for comfort to ‘Bake Off’ queen Mary Berry during a very sweary appearance on stage at the TV Choice Awards.

BBCWhen one of our favourite emerging designers - Matty Bovan - worked with one of our favourite models - Winnie Harlow - only one thing was going to happen.

This amazing awesomeness at London Fashion Week.

Last year, Bovan was feted after being hand-picked by Fashion East as the sole newcomer to their London Fashion Week catwalk. Since graduating from Central Saint Martins last year, the 26-year-old designer has worked with Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu; he has also been mentored by the one and only Katie Grand.

Bovan has always been a champion of model diversity, and this year’s show which featured the most divine layering of prints, colours and textures isn’t any different.

Here’s a quick peek at some of the ladies backstage:

NOUVEAU! SURLIGNE ET PARTAGE

TECHNO - Trouver des lieux de sortie accessibles aux personnes handicapées: c'est l'objectif de cette nouvelle application mobile. Grâce à la géolocalisation, "Exacto" doit permettre aux usagers de fauteuils roulants, mais aussi aux non-entendants et aux non-voyants, de localiser les endroits les plus adaptés pour se retrouver. Les utilisateurs pourront ensuite partager leurs recommandations via un système de notation collaboratif, comme le montre la vidéo au-dessus de l'article.

Selon Patricia Landeta, qui mène le projet, "Exacto" s'adressera dans un premier temps aux utilisateurs mexicains, mais la fondatrice l'assure, plusieurs pays ont déjà montré leur intérêt pour cette application, notamment l'Inde, Dubaï ou encore la Colombie. De quoi nourrir l'espoir de sa créatrice, celui de voir se développer, partout dans le monde, des services et produits destinés aux personnes handicapées.

Nous est-il possible d'avoir de la peine pour quelqu'un ou dans ce cas-ci, pour un groupe, sans tomber dans l'autoflagellation, le déni de soi et l'aplaventrisme.

Depuis un siècle, nous accueillons l'immigration d'où qu'elle vienne. Europe, Asie, Afrique, Amérique et Océanie. De toutes religions confondues, bouddhistes, brahmanes, orthodoxes, judaïsâtes, musulmans, témoins de Jehova et j'en passe. Nous avons même la scientologie et les raëliens. Dites-moi que nous ne sommes pas accommodants.

Mais, le dimanche 29 janvier 2017, un jeune exalté peut être aveuglé par une xénophobie dévorante, on ne le sait pas encore, en est venu à tuer six personnes et à en blesser quatre autres. Je sais, c'est révoltant, barbare, cruel et inutile. Il n'y a pas de mots pouvant décrire une telle horreur.

Maintenant que c'est dit. À partir du lundi 30 janvier, tous les membres des différents gouvernements sont venus se flageller publiquement à quelques reprises et ceci en notre nom. Même, un député fédéral de dire: «Pardonnez-nous de ne pas en avoir assez fait». Puis, le maire d'annoncer une première somme de 50 000$ comme assistance aux victimes. Puis, le premier ministre Couillard en remet une couche lors d'une émission télé. Nous aurons des lois anti islamophobes. Pourquoi? Je ne savais pas que je me trouvais en pleine Allemagne Nazi, entouré de xénophobes prêts à en découdre avec une minorité devenue visible.

En moins de quatre jours, quatre dangereux terroristes ont été arrêtés. Un a lancé des œufs, l'autre un pétard, un autre a fait des menaces aux maires qu'on a cachés pendant un temps, un dernier ayant incité à la haine. Sur neuf millions d'habitants, quatre épais ont décidé d'exprimer un trop-plein de frustrations. Alors, le mot est lâché... «De l'islamophobie systémique». Il y a quelques semaines, c'était la culture du viol, les Québécois étaient des violeurs potentiels. Quels tarés nous sommes!

Le 29 janvier journée nationale du souvenir de la lutte contre l'islamophobie.

Municipal: Attribution d'effectifs supplémentaires pour les crimes haineux.

Provincial: Création d'une direction générale contre le racisme.

Fédéral: Voter la motion pour éliminer le racisme systémique et la discrimination religieuse.

Maintenant, les groupes musulmans font des demandes aux gouvernements:

Nous en sommes à la mi-février, l'autoflagellation n'a pas cessé, il en faut plus. Montréal deviendra un sanctuaire, le gouvernement du Québec tente avec beaucoup d'ardeur, de sabrer dans Bouchard Taylor. Taylor lui-même se dissocie de ses recommandations.

Est-il possible que collectivement nous trainions encore avec nous ce bagage judéo-chrétien qui nous pousse à prendre sur nos épaules les actes d'un seul homme contre une communauté.

«Les Canadiens» bien moins racistes que nous s'en sont donné à cœur joie. Les Québécois devenus xénophobes, racistes et islamophobes. Eux qui emploient des mots comme frog, niggers, wops, faggets et qui font régulièrement du Québec Bashing comme sport national.

Sans vouloir être méchant, lors des attentats de St-Jean et d'Ottawa, je n'ai pas vu de mouvement de foule, ni d'autoflagellation de la part d'imams musulmans ou de chefs de cette communauté. Pas plus que pour la majorité canadienne dans l'affaire du Métropolis, ou un homme est mort par erreur sous les balles d'un anglophone envahi par la même haine.

C'est à qui serait le plus désolé, qui fera quelque chose de plus, qui dira le meilleur mot.

Citations Blogue

J'ai beaucoup de peine pour tout ce qui arrive, des pères, des frères, des maris sont morts et cela doit nous attrister. Mais là ou j'arrête, c'est cette manière de faire qui nous rend coupables par association. Le pire, ce ne sont pas les victimes qui le font, mais bien nos élus, nos édiles. C'est à qui serait le plus désolé, qui fera quelque chose de plus, qui dira le meilleur mot.

Le ministre Blais disant qu'il va regarder comment aider cette pauvre mère devenue veuve avec ses enfants. Pendant ce temps, d'autres femmes tout aussi miséreuses demandent de l'aide, sans même recevoir un accusé de réception. «Nous construirons un cimetière musulman.» Tiens donc! C'est donc à nos dirigeants à faire ce travail.

J'écoutais il y a un temps déjà, un reportage sur Charlie Hebdo. Le monde entier avait trouvé triste cette tuerie. Pourtant, tous les «islamistes modérés» ont répété qu'ils avaient insulté Allah et le prophète. Je n'ai pas vu d'autoflagellation ni de grande compassion. Ici, il arrive que quelques imams prêchent la violence contre les impies, mais les autorités se gardent une petite gêne. Mieux, à Québec, on reporte une conférence de Mme Benhabib pour ne pas choquer la communauté musulmane de Québec. Plus crêpe que ça...

Je ne sais pas pour vous, mais je commence à sentir une certaine tension. Il me semble que le deux poids deux mesures et l'électoralisme cousu de fils blancs, sautent aux yeux de la population. En voulant en faire trop et recherchant des votes, nos dirigeants se couvrent et nous couvrent de ridicule.

Ne pas porter de signes qui se veulent religieux pour la fonction publique, c'est ça la laïcité. Pour le reste, le vivre ensemble c'est ce que nous préconisons depuis plus de cent ans.

But no matter how hard he tries to pump himself up as a big man, there is one place he can’t do it: A new subreddit page called “Tiny Trumps.”

As the name suggests, Tiny Trumps features photoshopped pics of the president where not only his hands are small, but every other body part.

The photos make the president look even more childish than his behavior already suggests.

Con lei ci sono i sei figli che l'hanno accompagnata ad Angkor per la presentazione del suo nuovo film. Una pellicola che racconta una pagina tragica della storia cambogiana: i crimini commessi dai Khmer rossi durante il loro breve ma sanguinoso regime tra il 1975 e il 1979.

All'anteprima dell'opera - il cui titolo è "Prima hanno ucciso mio padre" - hanno assistito il re cambogiano Norodom Sihamoni e centinaia di sopravvissuti al regime. Il film è l'adattamento di un libro eponimo scritto dalla militante dei diritti umani loung ung, nel quale vengono ricordati gli orrori del regime di pol pot.

Che arrivano da Siem Reap, Cambogia. L'attrice sorride, il suo volto è disteso, sembra serena, circondata dai suoi sei bambini. Per la 41enne è la prima apparizione pubblica dopo la richiesta di divorzio da Brad Pitt, datata settembre 2016.

Loung ung aveva cinque anni quando i Khmer Rossi presero Phnom Penh e poté osservare il dramma della sua famiglia, prima di fuggire negli stati uniti.

Sotto il dominio di Pol Pot due milioni di cambogiani, un quarto della popolazione, perse la vita per le torture, la fame, le esecuzioni. Migliaia di fosse comuni sono state scoperte dopo la loro caduta, vittime di un'interpretazione atrocemente utopica del marxismo.

Durante una conferenza stampa a Siem Reap, Angelina Jolie ha affermato che la Cambogia è la sua "seconda patria" e ha detto di aver scelto di adattare il libro di Loung Ung perché voleva raccontare il periodo dei Khmer rossi "con gli occhi di un bambino". Ha inoltre rivelato che il film le ha permesso di sentirsi più vicina al figlio adottivo, che ha visitato con lei i meravigliosi templi patrimonio mondiale dell'umanità.

I sei figli della diva, tre dei quali adottivi, erano al fianco della madre durante la visita e anche all'udienza che re Norodom ha concesso all'attrice e regista. "Ho voluto mettere l'accento non solo sulla guerra, ma anche sull'amore della famiglia e sulla bellezza del paese, e ho voluto in realtà capire cosa i genitori biologici di mio figlio possano aver passato. Volevo conoscerli meglio, conoscere meglio il loro paese".

Questo è il secondo film diretto da Agelina jolie, dopo "nella terra del sangue e del miele", la storia di un amore distrutto dalla guerra in Bosnia. Jolie ha ottenuto la cittadinanza cambogiana. Nel 2002 ha adottato il suo primo figlio, Maddox, che si trovava in un orfanotrofio della provincia di Battambag, nella parte occidentale della Cambogia. La star ha spiegato che il figlio l'ha spinta a girare questo film.ADVERTISEMENT

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with US President Donald Trump was overshadowed by dramatic and unsettling events that preceded and followed their perfectly bizarre press conference.

The week began with the forced resignation of White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and revelations of extensive communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian intelligence—revealing a White House in disarray, operating under a dark cloud of suspicion. The day after the Trump/Netanyahu joint press event was dominated by reactions to Trump’s solo press conference—an unprecedented incoherent and, at times, paranoid affair that left many commentators questioning the President’s stability.

As a result of growing concerns with Trump’s Russian connections and his out-of-control behavior when challenged by reporters or other American institutions (intelligence services, judiciary, or political opponents), the Netanyahu visit became a one day news story and the content of the Trump/Netanyahu press event escaped needed scrutiny.

Their press conference was, as expected, a love fest. During Netanyahu’s time as Prime Minister, he has had to deal with Democratic Presidents (Clinton and Obama) who have pressed him (albeit, ever so gently) to make concessions in order to advance peace with the Palestinians. Now he has a Republican President who he has every reason to believe sees eye to eye with him on most issues. For his part, Trump, who made opposition to what he characterized as Obama’s “weak” policies toward Israel, Iran, and Islam major issues in his campaign’s foreign policy agenda, sees Netanyahu as a “soul mate.”

The press event featured an excess of embarrassing fawning. US leaders often heap praise on Israel, committing themselves to an “unbreakable,” “unshakable” bond. Trump upped the ante referring to Israel as: “a cherished ally,” “an open democracy” that has “advanced the causes of human freedom, dignity, and peace” and claimed that the US and Israel are “two nations that cherish the value of human life.”

Netanyahu repaid the unwarranted compliments with undeserved tributes. He praised Trump’s dealing with “Islamic extremism” saying “you’ve shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head on”. And, in response to a question about the extent to which Trump’s presidential campaign was supported by and gave a platform to anti-Semitic elements, Netanyahu absolved the US President saying that “there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish State than President Donald Trump”.

After this shameless exercise in “log-rolling,” the two settled down to presenting their views of the future of peace in the region—a discussion that included equal doses of hallucination, fantasy, and anti-Palestinian incitement.

Trump insisted that he wants to make a “great deal” that will bring peace to the region. He was initially vague about what that would entail, but after being coaxed by Netanyahu it became clear that both leaders believe that they can convert the Arab World’s concern with Iran and ISIS into an alliance that would create a regional peace agreement. Both suggested that some Arab States are already working covertly with Israel to confront both threats. This being the case, they posited that this shared interest can be transformed into an open alliance that would make peace with Israel, on Israel’s terms.

This is sheer fantasy. While it is true that Arabs are concerned with both threats—hatred or fear of Iran or ISIS does not translate into an overt alliance with Israel over the backs of the Palestinian people. Such an arrangement has long been an Israeli dream, but it ignores, as former Secretary of State John Kerry has noted, deeply felt Arab attachment to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

As my polling clearly demonstrates, Israeli behavior toward the Palestinians has not only increased Arab antipathy toward Israel, it has also significantly eroded the Arab people’s support for the Arab Peace Initiative. Given this, it is more likely that Arab cooperation with Israel, that is perceived to undercut Palestinian rights, would more likely play into the hands of Iran and extremist movements who would use it to inflame passions against such an arrangement.

Much was made of President Trump’s statement that he didn’t care whether peace involved two-states or one state, not enough attention was given to why it was said and what it would ultimately mean. Netanyahu has no interest in seeing the creation of an independent Palestinian State. He has ambitions for a Greater Israel—but wants to proceed gradually by taking more land, building more settlements, and discrediting and weakening moderate Palestinian leadership in order to make annexation an eventual “fact.” While he has succeeded, to some extent, in these efforts, the Palestinian people’s aspirations for justice, freedom, and self-determination have not been extinguished. Nor has Arab support for the Palestinians been diminished.

Netanyahu has so empowered the Israeli right, that he has become its captive. As much as he resented Obama’s pressure, he was able to use it to tame the more extreme impulses of his far right coalition partners. With the election of Trump, Israel’s right feels that the pressure is off. Calls for immediate annexation are now heard. And the Knesset recently passed a bill “legalizing” the theft of Palestinian owned land. Before leaving to the US, Netanyahu’s coalition partners warned him that should he publicly commit to two states he would face a rebellion at home. In ducking the two state formula, Trump was saving Netanyahu from his domestic foes.

For his part, Netanyahu maintained the fiction that he could accept two states but on two conditions: that Palestinians accept Israel as a “Jewish State” and that would give Israel permanent security control of the land to the west of the Jordan River. The first of these two conditions would permanently disenfranchise Palestinians inside Israel. The second would leave Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem living under Israeli military rule with no freedom or access and egress to the outside world. Both are obviously non-starters. This is not a two-state solution, rather it is an outcome that would merely formalize the apartheid system that currently exists.

To justify his intransigence, Netanyahu used his time at the podium to accuse the Palestinians of incitement and violence using language that was, itself, a shameless act of incitement. However, because this narrative has become so accepted in the US, no questions were raised about whether the charges are true or how whatever the Palestinians say or do compares with Israel’s incitement against Palestinians, documented instances of Israeli violence against innocent Palestinians, and the daily humiliation, brutality, and violence of the occupation.

With all of the questions that should have been raised, it was disturbing that the only real discussion that followed the visit focused on warnings that a one state solution would produce a state with an Arab majority compromising Israel’s Jewish character—with no attention paid to the issues of justice or the rights of the Palestinian people.

In any case, at the trip’s end, Netanyahu returned home to new revelations of corruption charges being leveled against him and new challenges from his far right “partners”. Back in Washington, Trump faced challenges of his own: more signs of a White House in disarray and more self-inflicted wounds of an out of control President. As a result, whatever expectations might have been created by the visit were left unmet. This exercise in fawning, fantasy, and incitement was for naught. Peace was not advanced, nor was the understanding of what real peace would require and how what Trump and Netanyahu would contribute to that goal.ADVERTISEMENT

LUCKNOW, Uttar Pradesh -- Following months of speculation over her role in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra today addressed her first election rally in Rae Bareli, which is also the parliamentary seat of her mother Sonia Gandhi and before that her grandmother, Indira Gandhi.

Packing her first punch, Vadra asked, "Does U.P. need an adopted son," referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who hails from Gujarat but swept UP in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, winning the parliamentary seat from Varanasi.

Vadra, who spearheaded the negotiations to forge the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, shared the stage with her brother and Congress Party vice president Rahul Gandhi. The alliance however is not without its troubles and Rae Bareli has been a source of aggressive haggling over candidates between the two parties. The district with five Assembly constituencies will vote on 23 February.

On Friday, both Vadra and Gandhi ripped into Modi and the polices of the Centre, but they steered clear of attacking Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, the other major player in the UP polls.

Picking up on Modi's earlier remarks that he was the adopted son of UP, Vadra sought to cast him as an outsider. "Lord Krishna was born in UP and made Gujarat his 'karam bhoomi'. I was born in Gujarat and UP has adopted me...," Modi said at a rally in Hardoi on Thursday.

In a brief yet vehement speech, Vadra countered, "The prime minister has said that 'Varanasi adopted me'. It came to my mind, does UP need to adopt someone from outside. Are there no young men in UP who can take the state forward? There are two young men, Rahul ji and Akhilesh ji, who are in front of you."

"Every young man in the state can become a leader and work for the development of UP," she continued, urging the crowd to ignore those "who have lied to you and broken their promises" and to vote for the alliance.

In the long-drawn campaign for India's most populous and electorally significant state, Vadra has mostly worked in the background despite speculation over her assuming a larger role in public. She was instrumental in clinching the alliance with the SP. So far, however, she continues to played a limited role, with her campaigning program confined to the Gandhi family strongholds of Rae Bareli and Amethi.

The Congress in fact is facing a rather embarrassing situation in Rae Bareli and Amethi, where it is contesting all 10 seats, but sitting SP lawmakers, who refused to withdraw their candidatures, are still standing from a few of the same spots. This odd scenario is the reason widely attributed to Vadra's delay in campaigning which was scheduled to kick off on 14 February.

Earlier this week, BJP leader and Union Minister Smriti Irani goaded Vadra by saying that her absence from Amethi was actually fear of facing the people. Irani, who had stood against Gandhi in his stronghold and given him cause for worry in the Lok Sabha polls, said, "Priyanka wants to avoid people's questions."

Earlier in the rally on Friday, Vadra looked on as Gandhi criticized Modi over letting down farmers by not waiving of their loans and failing to keep the promises he made after winning from Varanasi. "The note ban has hurt small businessmen, shopkeepers and farmers," he said.

Mocking Modi, Gandhi said, "You know what Modi said when I asked him about waiving off farmer loans?" Then, he gave a long pause and said, "Nothing."

Auf der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz ist offenbar ein Waffenstillstand in der Ost-Ukraine ausgehandelt worden | dpa

Russland und Ukraine unterstützen einen neuen Anlauf für eine Waffenruhe in der Ostukraine ab Montag

Eine am Mittwoch verkündete Waffenruhe war zunächst gescheitert

Die Außenminister Russlands und der Ukraine unterstützen einen neuen Anlauf für eine Waffenruhe von kommenden Montag an in der Ostukraine. Das sagte Bundesaußenminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) am Samstag in München nach einem Treffen der sogenannten Normandie-Gruppe, in der Deutschland und Frankreich die Vermittler sind.

Zuerst hatte der Bayerische Rundfunk darüber berichtet.

"Alle Parteien werden ihren Einfluss nutzen"

Am Mittwoch hatte die OSZE die neue Waffenruhe zwischen der ukrainischen Regierung und den prorussischen Separatisten verkündet. Danach war es aber weiter zu Kämpfen mit Toten gekommen.

"Alle Parteien werden ihren Einfluss nutzen, um die Verabredung aus der Kontaktgruppe (...) umzusetzen", sagte Gabriel. An dem Treffen am Rande der Sicherheitskonferenz nahmen neben ihm der russische Außenminister Sergej Lawrow und seine Kollegen aus der Ukraine und Frankreich, Pawel Klimkin und Jean-Marc Ayrault teil.American talkshow host Bill Maher lambasted Republicans on Friday night in an impassioned speech condemning right-wing politicians for letting Donald Trump “get away with pretty much anything” just because he is a Republican.

The Real Time host questioned why Republicans were so willing to give those with the “magic” capital R after their name such an easy ride.

The presenter said that, had a member of the Democrat party made such derogatory comments about the US, the Republicans would have been highly critical of them.

Maher said:

“I’ve got to say to all you flag waving right-wingers who are always say ‘I’m not just gonna stand her and let you run down America’, you’re standing there and letting Trump run down America.”

“When Trump said ‘I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t loose voters, he wasn’t making a joke. He’s never made a joke unless his entire life is some sort of Andy Coffman-style performance, in which case stop it. No, he was simply stating an actual fact for once, which is if you have the magic ‘R’ after your name you can drive a hummer through a daycare centre and Fox News will say the babies were asking for it.”

“America is the Republican party’s bitch and they can criticise and betray her but you can’t.”

“Why do Republicans get away with this? Why do they have patriotic immunity? America is like a dysfunctional family where the Democrats are the older, mature son who works hard and does everything right, but somehow is never good enough. And the Republicans are the young asshole son who’s a fuck up no matter how many times he crashes the Camaro, daddy buys him a new one.”

La police malaisienne a annoncé samedi l'arrestation d'un Nord-Coréen dans le cadre de l'enquête sur le meurtre du demi-frère du dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-Un, dont le corps est au centre d'une bataille entre Pyongyang et Kuala Lumpur.

L'homme arrêté vendredi soir était en possession de documents fournis aux travailleurs étrangers qui ont permis de l'identifier comme étant Ri Jong Chol, un Nord-Coréen de 46 ans, a précisé la police dans un communiqué.

Cette arrestation porte à quatre le nombre de personnes détenues depuis l'assassinat spectaculaire lundi de Kim Jong-Nam, imputé par Séoul à des agents oeuvrant pour la Corée du Nord.

Des experts malaisiens ont effectué vendredi des analyses d'échantillons du défunt, afin de déterminer la substance toxique qui a apparemment été aspergée sur son visage au moment où il s'apprêtait à prendre un avion à l'aéroport de Kuala Lumpur.

Mais samedi, le ministre de la Santé a prévenu que cette analyse pourrait prendre jusqu'à deux semaines, et qu'aucune information ne serait communiquée "tant que nous n'aurons pas trouvé quelque chose de sûr".

Dans la soirée, l'ambassadeur nord-coréen en Malaisie est monté au créneau lors d'une déclaration à la presse faite devant la morgue de Kuala Lumpur où se trouve le corps de Kim Jong-Nam depuis mercredi.

Kang Chol a affirmé que son pays rejetterait les résultats de l'autopsie, car "la Malaisie l'a imposée, sans notre autorisation et sans que nous y participions". Il a ajouté qu'il avait "fermement" demandé la restitution du corps au chef de la police malaisienne mais que ce dernier avait refusé.

Il s'agit de la première réaction officielle nord-coréenne depuis l'assassinat, mais l'ambassadeur s'est gardé d'identifier Kim Jung-Nam ou d'évoquer les circonstances de sa mort.

Échantillons ADN

Kuala Lumpur a prévenu que le corps ne serait pas remis à Pyongyang tant que les procédures ne seraient pas achevées.

"Jusqu'ici, aucun membre de la famille ou proche n'est venu identifier ou réclamer le corps. Nous avons besoin d'échantillons ADN d'un membre de la famille pour établir le profil de la personne décédée", a déclaré à l'AFP Abdul Samah Mat, chef de la police de l'Etat de Selangor, où est situé l'aéroport.

"La Corée du Nord a adressé une demande pour la restitution du corps, mais avant de le remettre, nous avons besoin d'identifier le corps", a-t-il ajouté.

"Ils sont de mèche avec des forces qui nous sont hostiles", a répliqué l'ambassade nord-coréenne, en insinuant qu'il s'agirait d'une tentative de la Corée du Sud pour porter atteinte à son voisin du nord.

Les relations entre Pyongyang et Kuala Lumpur étaient jusqu'à présent cordiales, et les visiteurs des deux pays sont exemptés de visa, un cas rare pour les ressortissants nord-coréens.

La police interrogeait deux suspectes, l'une détentrice d'un passeport vietnamien, l'autre d'un passeport indonésien, ainsi que le petit ami de cette dernière, un Malaisien.

Kim Jong-Nam, 45 ans, avait été attaqué lundi par deux femmes qui lui auraient jeté un liquide au visage à l'aéroport, où il devait embarquer pour Macao.

L'homme s'est ensuite plaint de maux de tête et hurlait de douleur avant de succomber pendant son transfert à l'hôpital.

La Corée du Sud a pointé du doigt son voisin du Nord, citant un "ordre permanent" du dictateur Kim Jong-Un pour éliminer son demi-frère, et une tentative d'assassinat manquée en 2012, après que Kim Jong-Nam avait critiqué le régime le plus fermé au monde.

Des correspondants de l'AFP à Pyongyang ont constaté que les célébrations jeudi pour l'anniversaire de la naissance de Kim Jong-Il, le défunt père des deux Kim, s'étaient déroulées sans allusion à l'assassinat.

Jeu télévisé

La police malaisienne a arrêté mercredi une femme de 28 ans détentrice d'un passeport vietnamien sous l'identité de Doan Thi Huong.

Des enquêteurs ont ensuite interpellé Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin, un Malaisien de 26 ans. Celui-ci a permis à la police d'appréhender sa petite amie, Siti Aishah, une Indonésienne de 25 ans.

D'après Tito Karnavian, chef de la police indonésienne, des inconnus auraient fait croire à la jeune femme qu'elle participait à un jeu télévisé du style "caméra cachée" dont le but était d'asperger le visage de la victime d'un liquide inoffensif.

"Elle ne s'est pas rendu compte qu'il s'agissait d'une tentative d'assassinat", a déclaré M. Karnavian à des médias indonésiens.

Kim Jong-Nam, un temps pressenti pour être l'héritier du régime, était tombé en disgrâce après avoir été arrêté en 2001 à l'aéroport de Tokyo avec un passeport falsifié de la République dominicaine.

Kim Jong-Nam avait ensuite vécu de fait en exil avec sa famille, à Macao, Singapour ou en Chine.

D'après le journaliste japonais Yoji Gomi qui lui a consacré un livre, Kim voulait introduire des "réformes et des mesures de libéralisation comme l'avait fait la Chine".

Les annonces de purges, d'exécutions et de disparitions - certaines confirmées, d'autres non - sont fréquentes depuis l'arrivée au pouvoir de Kim Jong-Un fin 2011.

John McCain was hustling down the hallway in the Russell Senate Office Building with the purpose of an Aaron Sorkin character. It was not yet two weeks into Donald Trump’s presidency, and McCain had already become the fiercest Republican critic of the new administration. While party leaders like Paul Ryan were contorting themselves to defend even Trump’s most ill-conceived executive orders, McCain had been, for a member of the president’s party, on fire: He had criticized Trump for banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, for his failed first mission in Yemen, for his suggestion that he might lift sanctions against Russia; he even took diplomacy into his own hands, reaching out to Australia to assure the country of our continued friendship after Trump had bizarrely confronted its prime minister in their introductory phone call. By many measures, there is no one better positioned to challenge Trump from within his own party. The so-called maverick was just reelected to the Senate by a 13-point margin; at 80 years old, he has both significant stature and nothing to lose. Still, for McCain, opposing Trump is not a simple matter. For one thing, it’s tricky to challenge a vengeful president who has taken to Twitter to accuse McCain of “emboldening the enemy” and “trying to start WWIII.” For another, McCain is not a Republican in Name Only; he is a true believer, an elder of the tribe. He does not exactly relish being deemed the loyal opposition.

“What? What!” McCain barked as he ran into a throng of reporters.

“Some people are saying you’re Trump’s No. 1 nemesis,” a reporter said. “Is that the role you’re trying to stake out?”

McCain shook his head. “It’s very convenient for the media to say that,” he grumbled. “If interpreters who worked for us in Iraq are not allowed into the United States, then I’m going to speak up. If that makes me a nemesis of the president of the United States, then you can label me as such.”

“They want a scenario of, quote, ‘confrontation,’ ” McCain told me as we stepped into the elevator. McCain was on his way to lunch in the Senate Dining Room with his friend Lindsey Graham, the other Republican Trump critic in the Senate whom many Democrats look to with hope. He found Graham at a corner table in the back.

“A group of ’em stopped me and said, ‘Are you Trump’s nemesis?’ ” McCain recounted. “I said, ‘That’s such a convenient thing.’ ”

“It’s actually boring,” Graham said. “There are a lot of sins in life, but the one that’s intolerable is being boring. I hate boring.”

McCain shook his head at the notion that just because he had the temerity to criticize the president, congressional Democrats thought they could recruit him to their cause. “These are the same Democrats that shredded me in 2008,” he said. “I get along with the Democrats, but please, I’m not their hero. They’re trying to use us. We will work with them, but have no doubt, their agenda is not our agenda.”

Yes, lest anyone forget, McCain and Graham, like many of their Republican brethren, came into this administration almost giddy with the possibility of what could be enacted with both chambers of Congress and the White House under GOP control. McCain said he was enthusiastic about Trump’s plans to slash regulations and increase military spending, and he is a fan of Defense Secretary James Mattis, with whom he said he’d spoken nearly a dozen times that week. He is also gleeful about Trump’s conservative Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, who stopped by the table with Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican senator (and Trump critic) from New Hampshire, who is helping Gorsuch through his confirmation process.

“Judge! How are ya?” McCain said, bolting up to shake Gorsuch’s hand.

Graham called across the table: “Anybody who wants to poison the water and adulterate the food is a good man for me!”

Gorsuch and Ayotte gave Graham panicked looks.

“Didn’t you hear what Nancy Pelosi said?” Graham asked, referring to the House minority leader’s comment that Gorsuch should be considered a lousy pick by anyone who breathes air or drinks water. “She said if you eat it or drink it, he’s bad!”

Gorsuch forced a relieved smile, getting the joke.

“The Democrats are just off the reservation. They’re crazy the way they’re behaving,” McCain said to Gorsuch. “As for hearings, I’ve never seen anything like this. Just keep your flak jacket on. Steady as she goes.”

No one knew it at the time, but this congenial lunch was perhaps John McCain’s last sanguine moment about the Trump administration. In the two weeks since, he has watched as allegations about Russian involvement in the election — and possibly in American foreign policy — picked up steam, and as Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national-security adviser after revelations that he improperly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador (and then lied to the vice-president about it). To McCain, these are red-line issues. No matter how much he likes the prospect of deregulation, the compromising of America’s sovereignty was pushing him closer to the barricades.

“The severity of this issue, the gravity of it, is so consequential because if you succeed in corrupting an election, then you’ve destroyed the foundation of democracy,” he told me later. “So I view it with the utmost seriousness. I view it more seriously than a physical attack. I view it more seriously than Orlando, or San Bernardino. As tragic as that was, the far-reaching consequences of an election hack are certainly far in excess of a single terrorist attack.”

Now McCain is renewing his calls for a bipartisan select committee to look into Trump’s ties to Russia, which could ultimately put pressure on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor — a probe that could get perilous for the president. While he is meeting with resistance from party leaders so far, McCain plans to use his role as chair of the Armed Services Committee and ex officio member of the Intelligence Committee to push for answers. The Trump administration’s viability rests on the support of a Republican Congress, and what John McCain is doing, carefully but with growing fervor, could shake its foundations.

The story of McCain’s captivity in Vietnam has been told so many times it can now be rendered in shorthand: 1967, a bombing raid over Hanoi, his plane shot down, both arms and a knee broken, capture, torture, the prospect of early release refused on principle, an ordeal that lasts for more than five years, much of it spent in solitary confinement, during a war that most of the country had already given up on. It’s the story that made McCain’s political career, that’s been trotted out in six Senate campaigns and two presidential bids. But it also undeniably shaped McCain’s view of the world and America’s place in it. “I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else’s,” he said during his nomination acceptance speech at the 2008 Republican convention. “I loved it for its decency, for its faith in the wisdom, justice, and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again; I wasn’t my own man anymore; I was my country’s.”

McCain believes in the idea of American exceptionalism, that the United States has a responsibility to be a force for good in the world and to confront repressive regimes. The Trump doctrine — to the extent that one exists — is quite different: American foreign policy should be dictated by nationalist self-interest at almost any cost. During the 2016 campaign, Trump advocated for reintroducing torture as a means of extracting information, killing terrorists’ families, and seizing Iraq’s oil. He derided international institutions such as NATO and the U.N. and cheered when Britain voted to pull out of the European Union. He praised brutal strongmen from Saddam Hussein to Vladimir Putin, whom he’s called a more impressive leader than Barack Obama.

McCain has been arguing for years that Putin’s Russia is a global menace that must be confronted. “Russia’s leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power,” McCain said during his 2008 RNC speech. “They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world’s oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire.” He sees Russia as a bully with designs on rolling back the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe and controlling the Middle East with Iran, fundamentally threatening America’s place in the world. “Putin won’t stop until the cost of going forward is too high,” McCain told me.

The senator has challenged presidents of both parties when their foreign-policy directives ran counter to his own. In his first term in Congress, he criticized Ronald Reagan’s decision to station peacekeeping Marines in Beirut with minimal defenses, which resulted in the deaths of 241 service personnel when a suicide bomber drove straight into the barracks. His battles with George W. Bush over tax cuts, torture, and U.S. strategy in Iraq became the stuff of Washington lore. And during the Obama years, McCain was one of the president’s fiercest foreign-policy critics, finding fault with his decision to pull troops from Iraq and his refusal to enforce his “red line” on Syria after Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people.

And yet it would be grossly inaccurate to characterize McCain as a man of pure principle. He’s too complicated for that. What makes him inspiring — and infuriating — to people on both sides of the aisle is that, more than most politicians, his political acts span a particularly wide distance between courage and expediency. He is capable of true heroism and conspicuous political cowardice. Over the years, he’s flip-flopped on some of his signature issues, from unfunded tax cuts to immigration reform to upholding Roe v. Wade. He’s often on the phone, dialing up friends and advisers to gauge their opinions and weigh the risks and rewards of various courses of action.

I get along with the Democrats, but please, I’m not their hero. They’re trying to use us. We will work with them, but have no doubt, their agenda is not our agenda.

This is how it came to be that the same McCain who cares so deeply about America’s standing in the world also cynically named as his ’08 running mate Sarah Palin, thus arguably ushering in the era of Trumpism that he now finds so troubling. He still defends the choice. “The media went after her like I’ve never seen,” he told me. “They said she said, ‘Oh, I can see Russia from here.’ Well, Russia is not that far from Alaska! They destroyed her in a way I will never forgive them.” In private, he has been more candid. “I regret running a small campaign,” he told a friend.

Still, according to his advisers, McCain’s reaction to Trump is mostly from the point of view of his better angels. To an extent far greater than McCain himself will say, they describe McCain as finding Trump to be a true threat to the republic. McCain speechwriter Mark Salter said the Trump administration presents a challenge to the senator’s core values. “McCain has always had empathy and compassion for oppressed people. It affects his views on torture and the way we should conduct ourselves in the world. It’s anathema to the Trump-Bannon-Sessions worldview. That’s not really Realpolitik — it’s fanatical. It’s bleak. Take their oil? Kill their families? It’s like a cartoon villain and is against everything John McCain stands for.”

The antipathy between the two started during the campaign when McCain criticized Trump for calling Mexicans “rapists,” attacking an Indiana-born judge of Mexican descent, and denigrating the Muslim parents of a slain Iraq War soldier. Trump said McCain wasn’t a “war hero” because he’d been captured by the North Vietnamese and so couldn’t fight (“I like people that weren’t captured,” said Trump). Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s media arm, Breitbart, has gone after McCain repeatedly, even claiming he created isis. “Bannon, who I don’t know, was clearly doing the stories,” McCain told me. On top of that, Trump’s financial backers, Robert and Rebekah Mercer, donated heavily to a PAC backing McCain’s pro-Trump primary challenger.

Though many expected McCain to take a firm stand against Trump the candidate, he refused to join the Never Trump movement led by Mitt Romney. “Romney was pissing on Trump in a way that almost made you feel bad for Trump,” one McCain adviser told me. Some McCain associates said he was worried about reelection; others that it was party loyalty that kept him from publicly opposing Trump. Whatever the case, it wasn’t until the Access Hollywood tape leaked in October that McCain announced he wasn’t voting for Trump. Like most of the political Establishment, he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. “We had several discussions prior to the election about his hope he would be able to work well with Hillary Clinton,” said McCain’s friend Grant Woods, an Arizona lawyer.

When Trump won instead, McCain decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. It’s hard to imagine, but McCain saw something of himself in the new outsider president, according to Woods. McCain had been reviled by the party’s base much as Trump had been rejected by the GOP Establishment. “Only eight years ago, John was the nominee of the GOP and wasn’t the first choice of a lot of the party diehards,” said Woods. “He and his allies made the point that he won the nomination fair and square. That’s a complicating factor in his mind.”

McCain wanted to work with Trump. During the transition, Trump called McCain and asked for recommendations for Defense secretary. McCain suggested David Petraeus, Mattis, and Ayotte. (“She didn’t support me!” Trump told McCain.) McCain has supported all of Trump’s Cabinet picks — Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions, Betsy DeVos, Tom Price, and Scott Pruitt — save one, budget director Mick Mulvaney, whom he views as anti-military. “I’ve always given presidents the benefit of the doubt on their nominees,” McCain told me. “With Obama, there were a number of nominees I had concerns about that I voted for. I think elections have consequences.”

Beyond that, McCain recognizes the sway Trump has over a significant swath of the Republican electorate. “There is frustration out there that to me is understandable. There’s a lot of friends of mine who are older white males that contact me all the time and say, ‘Stick with Trump! What’s the matter with you, John?’ I said, ‘Well, we have some disagreement about trade,’ and they say, ‘You don’t care about America!’ I try to be nice, but they’re fired up.”

McCain thinks an increasingly divided nation is a bigger worry than the possibility of the Trump administration’s turning into an authoritarian regime. “I just don’t think it’s possible in our society. There’s too many checks and balances. The danger is not Trump perverting our Constitution or taking too much power; the danger is the polarization of America.”

Of course, the two dangers are not unconnected: The country’s polarization leads senators and congressmen to fear being primaried by more Trumpian candidates, and that in turn leads them to forget all about checks and balances. So far, Republicans in both houses have rallied around the new president’s appointments and policies. Even those who criticized Trump during the campaign, like Ted Cruz and Jeff Flake, are mostly falling into line. When I saw Cruz in the days after Flynn’s resignation, he stuck with the party line, saying how happy he was with Trump’s conservative Cabinet picks. And Flake, though he issued a statement against the travel ban, has been generally supportive as well: “In terms of regulations, repeal two for every one? I’m excited about a lot,” Flake told me.

For his part, McCain has wrestled with when and how to respond to Trump’s statements and policies. Recently, he told his former presidential-campaign strategist John Weaver: “I can’t be the car alarm that always goes off. If I am, I’m not effective.” Still, McCain is sounding the alarm more and more frequently. The senator issued a statement blasting Trump’s decision to abandon the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. “I just think we made a terrible mistake,” he told me. “We’ve consigned 60 percent of the world’s economy to China.” And of course there was his critical statement about the Trump-authorized Navy seal raid in Yemen that resulted in a seal’s death, some 30 Yemeni casualties including women and children, the destruction of a $75 million aircraft, and the end of U.S. ground operations there. “These are challenging times, and I have to go my own way,” McCain said. “It’s not disloyalty to the party.”

Those acts of open criticism have put McCain in Trump’s crosshairs. When McCain spoke out about the botched raid, Trump fired off a series of tweets: “Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He’s been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore.” Although McCain has 2 million Twitter followers, he rarely uses the medium to respond to Trump directly. Instead, he relies on his social-media army of campaign volunteers, which he calls Troll Team Six. “They attacked and responded to every attack,” McCain said. “To a large degree it neutered the campaigns against me.”

Even for someone who is always keenly aware of the political calculus, navigating the Trump administration is challenging. For one thing, you never know where the president is going to come down on anything. “I don’t know what he’s going to do,” said McCain. “Look at his stance on torture. Or everything. He’s been on all sides. He said intelligence groups are like Nazis, but then he said they’re the greatest in the world. So I have to judge him on what he does.”

In the meantime, McCain is feeling pressure from all sides. He took heat from friends for defending Flynn in the weeks before he resigned because of revelations that he had lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions. “What am I supposed to say? I can’t be bad-mouthing everyone over there,” McCain told an adviser. But when McCain does openly criticize Trump, he often finds himself on his own. He’s complained to friends that fellow Republicans aren’t backing him up. “I keep looking behind me, and there’s no one there,” he recently told an adviser. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch ­McConnell nixed McCain’s initial request for a select committee on Russia, McCain groused to a friend that “fucking Mitch ain’t gonna do it!” (McCain denied saying this.)

If McCain is a lone dissenter, his opposition could get less and less traction. His power rests in his ability to persuade his fellow Republicans, but remaining relevant is also personal for him. He has seen it happen before — life leaving soon after power did. The commanding wooden desk in McCain’s office belonged to his predecessor, Barry Goldwater, who barely won reelection during his final campaign. “When he left Washington, he never came back,” McCain said. Next to the desk, McCain displays a photograph of his grandfather on the deck of the USS Missouri when the Japanese surrendered during WWII. The day after returning home from the Pacific in 1945, he died.

McCain is constantly weighing his legacy, torn between doing what it takes to stay effective inside his party and choosing the right moments to go his own way. He is a deeply ambivalent maverick. Still, McCain’s friends and advisers say this fight is the one he was made for. “Whether McCain likes it or not, history has prepared him for this moment,” Weaver told me. “I talked to him just after Christmas. I said, ‘I know, John, you’ve been through a lot in your life, but the country’s never needed you more than it does now. We live in dark times.’ And he said, ‘Boy, you don’t know how dark it is.’ ”

Given the slumping poll numbers that accompanied Trump’s erratic first weeks in office, some Republicans say it’s only a matter of time until skeptics like McCain can break with Trump without political consequences and even pull other members of the party with them. “Based on my private conversations with Republicans, at first the feeling was, ‘We want to make this work.’ But after the first week it was, ‘Yikes, this isn’t going to work,’ ” said Weekly Standard editor-at-large Bill Kristol. “The calculus is: ‘We don’t want to be accused of doing him in, but we don’t want to go down with the ship either.’ ”

Trump’s bizarre appearance at CIA headquarters the day after assuming office seemed to be a major inflection point. “The inauguration speech was bad. People were rattled,” Kristol said. “But on Saturday morning, people were sort of saying, ‘Well, maybe that was the last gasp of the campaign. He’s going to the CIA this afternoon, and he’s going to make up with the intelligence community.’ But then he goes and spends 15 minutes screaming about crowd size and attacking reporters. For insiders in Washington, that CIA speech was very big.” Not incidentally, that speech may have further alienated the intelligence community, which now seems to have little reluctance to leak information to the press.

When I saw McCain two days after the CIA episode, it was one of the first things he brought up: “I mean, most observers, whether they’re supporters or opponents, believe he should have gone and praised the CIA. Instead, he wandered off into areas that are just not appropriate.”

Like Kristol, McCain thinks it will be easier to oppose Trump as his poll numbers go down. “One thing politicians look at are ratings, and his ratings are going to continue to decline,” he said. “That means members of Congress will be more likely to resist things they do not agree with rather than roll over.”

Already, a handful of other Republican senators — Graham, Roy Blunt, Bob Corker — are calling for Flynn to testify in Senate investigations on administration communications with Russia. (House Republicans remain much more circumspect.) Whether they persist in their pursuit of the truth, whatever it may be, and whether they can bring enough pressure to bear on congressional leadership to impanel an independent investigation, is undoubtedly the biggest test of the congressional check on executive power.

Proving that a foreign government helped install Trump as president would be a ­history-making feat — not to mention possibly lead to impeachment proceedings. So it is by no means McCain’s stated goal. “We’re clearly not there yet,” he told me.

“McCain is a savvy political operator,” a former adviser said. “He sees a critical mass building demanding investigations. He weighs in at the decisive moment to turn it to calls for a select committee, and ultimately he’ll be the person that tips it to calls for an independent-counsel investigation.” If that happens, who knows what will be found? Suspicions are both dire and plausible. It was, after all, an independent counsel looking into Whitewater that led to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. “If it’s found that there was collusion between senior officials in the Trump campaign and the Russian Federation, is that a criminal act? It puts us in uncharted waters,” said the adviser.

McCain has been tracking the Russia issue since shortly before Thanksgiving, when he ran into Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow, at the Halifax Security Forum, a foreign-policy conference. Wood tipped McCain off about the now-infamous dossier that claimed Putin had compiled embarrassing information on Trump that could be used for blackmail, as well as allegations that the Trump campaign coordinated with Kremlin officials. “I didn’t know what to make of it,” said McCain, “but everyone knows the Russians do use women and sex when people go to Russia. It’s an old KGB honeypot.”

When McCain returned to Washington, he received a copy of the dossier. The next day, he delivered the documents to FBI director James Comey. “I said, ‘It’s very important. You’re the person I want to give this to,’ ” McCain recalled. Comey gave McCain the impression he’d already been looking into it.

Since then, the drumbeat of news on the subject has gotten faster. On January 5, McCain held a widely attended hearing on Russian cyberoperations in which the then-director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified that Russia’s pro-Trump strategy included “hacking … classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news.” On February 8, McCain attached his name to a bipartisan bill that would require Trump to get Congress’s approval to lift Russian sanctions. On February 10, CNN reported that U.S. intelligence agencies had confirmed several pieces of information in the dossier. More damning, U.S. intelligence also found — and leaked — that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Russia’s ambassador and later lied about it to Pence. The cover-up led many to suspect Flynn had undermined the Obama administration by communicating to Russia that the soon-to-be-installed Trump administration would come to a more favorable decision on the sanctions.

“I liked Flynn,” said McCain. “But obviously this is an example of the dysfunction.” Now, he said, there are questions that need to be answered: “When did Flynn know about anything to do with Russian interference? Why was there a gap of X number of days between the president being told and no action taken? What is the extent of the relationship between Flynn and the Russians?”

I asked McCain why most of his fellow Republicans aren’t speaking up about Russia’s election interference and Trump’s potential Russian ties. “I frankly don’t know,” he said. “It’s not a chapter of Profiles in Courage.”

McCain’s call for an independent commission will only get louder. While there are numerous Senate investigations in motion or being called for, the only way to coordinate efforts and see the big picture is to impanel a select committee. McConnell fears a select committee would derail the GOP agenda. But McCain continues to push. “After 9/11, Joe Lieberman and I proposed a select commission. It took more than a year before they finally appointed it, so I’m not giving up,” McCain said. “We’re going on offense on Russia,” agreed Graham, who, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, is calling for oversight of the FBI’s investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia.

In the meantime, the world keeps spinning, and McCain worries about America’s place in it. “The national-security aspect isn’t functioning,” he said. “Nobody knows who’s making the decisions. The Iranians are testing. The Russians are testing. They’re testing this administration. Who is making the decisions when we don’t have a national-security adviser?” On February 16, McCain traveled to Germany to shore up our European alliances that have been strained by Trump’s close relationship with Putin. McCain compares Trump-Putin to Stalin’s nonaggression pact with Hitler, in which the two dictators tried to divvy up Europe between them — which worked until Hitler decided to launch an attack on Soviet positions anyway. “Some have likened it to the Molotov-Ribbentrop spheres of influence, which said you have Eastern Europe and we have this. That doesn’t work with dictators,” said McCain. “Putin is a KGB colonel who is bent on restoring the Russian empire.”

McCain takes Putin’s global bullying personally. He points at a picture of a Russian opposition politician he keeps next to his desk. “This here is Boris Nemtsov,” he said. The physicist turned liberal politician was one of Putin’s fiercest critics and had become McCain’s friend. They last saw each other two years ago. “He sat on that seat there, and I said, ‘Boris, I don’t think you should go back because they’ll try and kill you.’ And he said, ‘I have to go back. I love my country.’ ” Upon his return, Nemtsov was shot four times from behind while crossing a bridge near Red Square. “He was murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin,” McCain said.

Two days after Flynn resigned, I visited McCain again at his office. He said Flynn’s ouster had caused the momentum to shift somewhat in his direction, but he was still grouchy that more Republicans weren’t onboard. An hour before we met, McConnell had once again told McCain that he wouldn’t approve a select committee. Since Congress remains reluctant to hold Trump accountable, McCain said it’s going to be journalists’ responsibility to investigate and put pressure on Congress. What will move the needle, he thinks, is “what’s in the press,” McCain said. “There’s just too many people out there who have this information. How did this Flynn thing happen?”

Of course, relying on the press also means relying on those who leak information to the press — a position that puts McCain once again at odds with the president, who has vowed to seek out and punish “lowlife leakers.” McCain acknowledged that leaks have the potential to do damage to national security. But he made a surprisingly impassioned case for them in an era when truth is hard to come by. “In democracies, information should be provided to the American people,” McCain said. “How else are the American people going to be informed?”

*This article appears in the February 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.Ragazzi maggiorenni sarebbero stati 'adescati' da un parroco di Napoli, attraverso i social network, per partecipare a festini gay: la vicenda è stata portata al vaglio dell'arcivescovo di Napoli, il cardinale Crescenzio Sepe che, oggi, non ha voluto esprimere commenti in merito.

Un vero e proprio dossier quello giunto nella sede della Curia Arcivescovile partenopea, con i particolari di quanto accaduto: gli appuntamenti sarebbero stati presi anche attraverso una specifica chat alla quale, fa sapere uno dei giovani adescati, che ha 28 anni, molti preti si collegherebbero - a suo dire - in maniera abituale. Per le prestazioni sessuali ci sarebbe stata anche la corresponsione di denaro, 20-30 euro ad appuntamento, che però il ragazzo riferisce di avere percepito solo su insistenza del parroco.

In una intervista rilasciata al Il Mattino il giovane svela come tutto è iniziato: qualche messaggio via posta elettronica, poi la richiesta di amicizia su facebook e, alla fine, gli incontri a sfondo sessuale, anche due-tre volte al mese. Gli appuntamenti sono avvenuti, secondo quanto dice il 28enne, nell'abitazione del parroco, poi anche in altri appartamenti. Il legame con il sacerdote si sarebbe instaurato in un momento particolare della vita del giovane: dopo le prime remore, il ragazzo si sarebbe lasciato andare.

Nell'intervista definisce l'uomo di Chiesa una persona gentile, affettuosa, rassicurante. Non solo. Ce ne sarebbero anche altri, di sacerdoti, che avrebbero avuto incontri con giovani maggiorenni. Il ventottenne riferisce anche dell'esistenza di una chat, che nel corso degli anni ha pure cambiato nome, frequentata da sacerdoti e frati, dove si offrirebbe conforto, una mano contro la solitudine, e anche una particolare forma di amicizia che poi sfocerebbe in incontri di carattere sessuale.

La storia tra il ventottenne e il parroco si sarebbe interrotta quattro-cinque mesi fa, per volere del ragazzo: una decisione che il parroco non avrebbe preso bene. Prima della 'rottura' - sostiene il giovane - era diventato più insistente e questo lo infastidiva. Comunque, lui non sarebbe stato l'unico ragazzo che il parroco frequentava.

Nel dossier fatto arrivare al cardinale Sepe si farebbe riferimento anche al coinvolgimento di un altro sacerdote, un amico del parroco, conosciuto in seminario, che il ragazzo ha anche cercato di contattare, sempre via social network, ma inutilmente. "Non posso parlare, devo andare via subito". Così, dal canto suo, il cardinale di Napoli, Crescenzio Sepe, ha risposto a un giornalista che gli ha chiesto un commento sulla vicenda del sacerdote che sarebbe al centro del dossier in cui si ipotizzano festini gayLui non ci sarà. C'era oggi, all'incontro della minoranza Pd, ma non ci sarà domani all'assemblea del Pd dove si decideranno le sorti del partito.

Massimo D'Alema, fuori da teatro Vittoria, si racconta: "Se Renzi telefona per dire che lui è d'accordo con quello che gli si propone sicuramente questo apre un processo politico che porta verso il congresso nei tempi ordinari, normali. Se Renzi vuole tirare diritto per la sua strada è chiaro che noi non possiamo accettare questa prepotenza. Le cose sono chiarissime, la questione è nelle mani del segretario del partito".

Una eventuale rottura nel Pd? gli chiedono i cronisti. "Non è colpa mia" chiosa secco l'ex premier.

Two new tease-trailers have appeared for the much-anticipated new series of ‘Twin Peaks’, and keen-eyed fans will soon recognise the footage.

Both trailers have been carved from scenes from the original series, aired in 1990, which saw Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) sent to the northwestern town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of Laura Palmer.

The first trailer revisits one of the show’s most famous scenes, when Cooper smashed his head against a mirror, and saw that he had been transformed into the mysterious ‘Bob’ (this takes a huge amount of explaining, you’ll just need to revisit the original series to get across this as well as the multitudes of other bizarre happenings).

A tag line in the new trailer then tells us ‘It’s Happening Again’, before present-day Kyle steps into shot.

The second trailer similarly retraces steps to the original series, with footage of the unwrapping of Laura Palmer’s body, accompanied by the same tag-line.

The new series picks up 25 years after the inhabitants of this quaint, picturesque town were stunned when their beautiful homecoming queen was murdered.

The new series will be once again directed by David Lynch, and set to comprise 18 episodes.

Many of the original cast members are also on board - as well as Kyle MacLachlan, David Duchovny will be returning, as well as Sherilyn Fenn.

Catherine E. Coulson, who played the memorable Log Lady, died in 2015, but the Log Lady will in fact be part of the new series, as the actress had already filmed several scenes.

Angelo Badalamenti, whose haunting theme music contributed so much to the atmosphere of the piece, is also in place as the show’s music composer.

The original show, which won a catalogue of Awards, including a Grammy for its theme, has attracted a cult following ever since and been credited by TV directors ever since for its influence, for showing what was possible to achieve on the small screen.

Twin Peaks airs Monday 22 May 2am on Sky Atlantic, the same time as the US premiere and repeats Tuesday 23 May 9pm. Catch up with series 1 and 2 on Sky Box Sets and NOW TV.

ABC Photo Archives via Getty ImagesNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C., Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, scrambling to find a new top security aide after firing his first one and being spurned by another candidate, said on Friday he has four people under consideration including acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg.

Trump ousted Michael Flynn on Monday in a controversy over the retired lieutenant general’s contacts with Russia. Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward on Thursday turned down the Republican president’s offer to replace Flynn.

“General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others,” Trump said on Twitter, without naming the other candidates.

Former CIA chief David Petraeus has dropped out of consideration for the post, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Former U.S. National Security Agency head Keith Alexander and former supreme allied commander in Europe James Jones, who held the national security adviser post under former Democratic President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010, were also thought to be under consideration. Both are retired generals.

Two others also thought to be in contention were former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who holds a senior post with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command.

Two others also thought to be in contention were former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who holds a senior post with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command.

Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who is currently chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, accompanied Trump on a trip to South Carolina on Friday before heading to Florida. He stepped into the national security adviser role on an acting basis after Flynn’s firing.

Trump may meet with candidates for the post during his weekend visit to Florida, a White House official told reporters.

Petraeus held command posts in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and served as CIA director under Obama. He quit as CIA chief in 2012 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified materials relating to documents he had given his biographer, with whom he had an affair.

Harward, a senior executive at Lockheed Martin and former Navy SEAL, declined Trump’s offer in part because he wanted to bring in his own team, according to two sources familiar with Harward’s decision.

The White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News on Friday that Harward’s family “didn’t sign off” on him taking the job.

“That’s all it is,” Priebus said.

ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENT

Richard Haass, who held senior White House and State Department posts under Republican presidents and now heads the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter the new national security advisor should insist on the right to choose staff members and have unlimited access to the president.

Haass, who Trump considered for a job in his administration, also called for rescinding a directive from the president that gave Trump’s chief White House strategist, Steve Bannon, a seat on the National Security Council, a move condemned by Democrats.

Trump’s administration has been dealing with the fallout from Flynn’s departure for much of the week.

Flynn, a close adviser to Trump during his presidential campaign last year, was seen by Moscow as a leading advocate of friendlier ties with Russia.

Trump said on Thursday he fired Flynn because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office, about sanctions imposed by Obama’s administration.

Trump has defended Flynn’s actual contact with the ambassador, saying what he did “wasn’t wrong.”

The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Flynn told FBI agents last month that he had not discussed sanctions with the ambassador. Flynn’s Jan. 24 interview with the FBI could expose him to charges, since lying to the agency is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would lie with the Justice Department.ADVERTISEMENT

She doesn't believe that her mother is dead, and begins to question the events of her mother's disappearance.

WASHINGTON ― A few weeks after the 2013 government shutdown, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) compared the Republicans in the House to the preschoolers she once taught. To deal with a bunch of fractious, obstreperous 4-year-olds, she said, you need a plan.

When Murray made her comparison, she was about to sit down with Sen. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in what turned out to be the only significant successful bipartisan budget negotiation Congress has managed since the shutdown.

Four years later, the House is still roiled by a crowd of sharp-elbowed and feuding Republican lawmakers who can’t agree even on how to do the one thing they all say they want ― repeal Obamacare. But now, there’s a new alpha boy atop their playground monkey bars.

President Donald Trump outdid them all, belittling, bullying and insulting his way to the Oval Office.

Murray is familiar with the personality type.

“There is a bully in every classroom,” Murray said this week. “And the best way to teach other children in your preschool class that it’s not OK is to make it not OK.”

That is precisely what Murray and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are trying to do. Since there are only 48 senators on their side of the ledger, they lack the votes to beat back Trump and a raft of nominees that Democrats see as historically awful. What they can do is show the country and their Republican colleagues that it’s not OK. Murray is turning out to be Schumer’s deadliest weapon in that fight.

The greatest difficulty with that strategy is that Republicans don’t especially want to be shown. None have been willing to admit even that nominees might lie to them, and voted to confirm two who at the very least said things that were not true. They confirmed Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency chief Friday, even knowing that they had not reviewed thousands of emails that had just been released related to his environmental lawsuits.

Still, there have been some notable successes from the Democrats’ perspective, particularly with nominees going through the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on which Murray serves as the top Democrat.

Chief among them is the withdrawal of labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, a fast-food maven who was fond of employing scantily clad women to peddle his Carl’s Jr. burgers, and whose restaurants have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for labor and safety violations.

The salacious ads and history of labor law infractions probably were not the daggers that did in the labor nominee, however.

Ironically, his troubles started with a video created by a woman who Trump floated as a potential presidential running mate on the Reform Party ticket in 1988 ― Oprah Winfrey, via her TV show. A video from “The Oprah Winfrey Show” featured Puzder’s ex-wife dressed in disguise in 1990 to allege domestic abuse.

That she had gone on the program had been known since shortly after Puzder’s nomination, but Winfrey’s producers stonewalled media attempts to obtain the episode. The Oprah Winfrey Network’s lawyers did temporarily provide a videotape to the HELP Committee that they refused to leave behind. Murray and her staff worked with committee Chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) to make sure other senators saw it ― or at least had a chance to. Although Puzder’s former wife, Lisa Fierstein, later recanted the allegations, it had an impact. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said that she had seen the tape and wanted to make it public.

Murray has made a habit of maintaining bipartisan relationships and working across the aisle, passing things like the rewrite of the No Child Left Behind Act. A firm member of the Pantsuit Nation, and a politician who launched her Senate career as a “mom in tennis shoes,” she politely and privately wielded a stiletto against Puzder, offering trenchant insights into Puzder’s attitudes in private conversations with Republicans in hallways and on the Senate floor. One thing Puzder said in an interview was particularly disturbing to the handful of Republicans who were prepared to oppose him.

“Someone asked him why he wanted to be secretary of labor, and he said that it would be the best job he could have ‘with his clothes on,’” Murray said. “I presented that to one Republican senator who said to me, quote, he doesn’t get it, does he?”

Whether it was specifically the video that felled Puzder can be debated. Revelations that he employed an undocumented immigrant as part of his household help for years hurt him with a number of conservative Republicans, as did Puzder’s advocacy for immigration reform.

For Murray, he was a walking highlight reel of all that is wrong with Trump.

“This is a president who got elected after a video came out of him on the bus with ‘Access Hollywood.’ When that happened, that was such a defining moment for many people,” Murray said. “But the people who voted for him said that’s OK, he won’t do this going forward. And yet to me his nominee shared many of those same sexist, horrible attitudes towards women.”

“That’s what I felt really took him down, and should have taken him down,” she said.

Murray and the Democrats also scored a near miss with an especially focused strategy to question then-Education Department nominee Betsy DeVos.

The billionaire charter school advocate botched numerous questions that Murray and other Democrats on the HELP committee had prepared in advance, and then followed up on. Especially glaring was DeVos’ lack of understanding of federal disability laws, exposed when Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) asked how her own disabled child would be able to get an education in one of the publicly funded charter schools that DeVos favors. DeVos did not understand that providers of public education are supposed to provide it to all of the public. Public schools spend significant resources to ensure disabled children get an education, and while charter schools are required to as well, they often fight the requirement.

Other questions showed that she was unfamiliar with basic debates in the education community. She was also caught in a possible lie when she said she had nothing to do with her family’s foundation giving $5 million to the anti-gay religious group Focus on the Family. Devos insisted it was all her mother’s doing. Murray came back with a tax filing from the foundation that listed DeVos as a vice president. DeVos claimed it was a clerical error, but records showed she was listed in the position for 17 years.

DeVos’ terrible showing cost her two Republican votes, and for the first time in history, a vice president had to break a 50 to 50 tie in the Senate to confirm her.

None of that work to bring down those nominees was an accident, Murray said.

“I felt from the beginning, this administration ― who I think expected to win ― was putting together a cabinet without doing the critical work that one should do at the cabinet in vetting people, in knowing what issues they might have,” Murray said. “So I directed my staff to do that with Betsy DeVos, with [Health and Human Services Secretary Tom] Price. And with Puzder.”

Aides familiar with the strategy said that Murray vowed to do that vetting herself when she came back to Capitol Hill after the election. She reassigned a slew of policy staff and turned them into temporary investigators, churning out detailed memos that were then shared with other senators and their staff. No other committee appears to have done as thorough a dive into the backgrounds of the nominees coming before them.

Heading into the DeVos hearing, Murray made sure to coordinate Democratic questions, to avoid overlap and make sure effective follow ups were delivered. When, for instance, Hassan asked DeVos about her role in the Prince Foundation, and DeVos demurred, Hassan was able to pull out tax documents with her name on them.

As each new embarrassment and unflattering detail emerged, Schumer would often highlight them in his morning Senate floor speeches that the Democratic leaders then spread further in news conferences.

Since Democrats themselves changed the rules around nominations in 2013 to allow confirmations to pass on simple majority votes, there’s little they can do beyond slowing down the process and trying to give the public enough time to see exactly who is ascending to power in the reign of Trump.

And Murray said she intends to keep showing why it’s not OK.

“As I have had constituents tell me since the day of the election, Senate Democrats are the only barrier we have to fight back against things that aren’t right coming from a Republican administration, Senate and House,” Murray said. “So, we’re it. We started working from day one to be the people who take that role on.”Julien Macdonald’s FROW may have featured Dougie Poynter, Ella Eyre and Amber Le Bon, but all eyes were on his stunning AW17 show which featured Winnie Harlow and Victoria’s Secret model Leomie Anderson.

Recently we’ve seen the likes of Gigi Hadid, Chrissy Teigen and Alessandra Ambrosio wearing his dresses, and you can expect to see plenty more intricate work, cut-outs and plunging necklines in his latest collection.

We’re also very pleased to see a continuing, strong commitment so far this fashion week to having diverse catwalks.

Expect to see a lot of copy-cat designs just in time for the lead-up to party season if you can’t afford the real thing (soz Julien).

Este partido ultraderechista eligió la ciudad portuaria de Rotterdam, en el sur de Holanda, para dar comienzo a su campaña electoral, rodeado de decenas de agentes de seguridad y guardaespaldas.

Se paseó entre sus seguidores, a los que abrazaba, entregaba panfletos electorales y prometía "devolverles" Holanda si votaban por él.

El dirigente ultraderechista también aprovechó la presencia de decenas de medios de comunicación para atacar a "los partidos del sistema", a los que suele acusar de "elite" o sobre los que lamenta que "están vendidos a Bruselas".

El líder del PVV lidera las encuestas de intención de voto que se han conocido los últimos meses y se mantiene por delante del actual primer ministro holandés, el liberal Mark Rutte.

No obstante, aunque gane los comicios generales del 15 de marzo, tendrá dificultades para formar una coalición de Gobierno, ya que la mayoría de partidos ha descartado unirse al PVV debido a sus ideas xenófobas.ADVERTISEMENT

Le premier ministre Philippe Couillard participera samedi à deux colloques régionaux du Parti libéral du Québec, en Outaouais et en Montérégie, portant sur le thème "Des régions fortes, un Québec audacieux".

Il se rendra d'abord en matinée à Gatineau, puis en après-midi à Longueuil.

Les militants échangeront sur le développement régional, mais également sur les défis du 21e siècle.

Un paio di giorni fa, il Daily Mail ha pubblicato delle foto esclusive e "mai viste prima" che mostrano una splendida Marilyn Monroe "in dolce attesa". Foto scattate nel lontano 8 luglio 1960 a New York e vendute nel novembre del 2016 dalla Julien's Auctions, una casa d'aste di Los Angeles. Scatti che provenivano dalla collezione privata di Frieda Hull, una delle "Monroe Six", un gruppo di donne fan dell'attrice, che la seguiva passo passo durante i suoi soggiorni a New York. Nell'articolo viene presentata la testimonianza di Tony Michaels, l'uomo che ha comprato le foto all'asta, in cui afferma di aver saputo da Frieda, sua vicina di casa, della relazione tra l'attore Yves Montand e Marilyn, nata durante le riprese di "Facciamo l'amore", fatto già noto, e che questo l'avrebbe messa incinta. Scott Fortner, uno dei maggiori esperti e collezionisti al mondo di oggetti, autografi e tutto ciò che si possa collegare a Marilyn Monroe, però, ha dichiarato che la storia di quelle foto "è un chiaro esempio di fake news": "Impossibile che Marilyn Monroe fosse incinta all'epoca".

Never-before-seen photos of secretly pregnant Marilyn Monroe https://t.co/1QIR39svOQ pic.twitter.com/F7Ft2isTXL — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) 15 febbraio 2017

"In una delle didascalie delle foto pubblicate dal Daily Mail risalente al gennaio 1960 - spiega Fortner - "viene descritta la 'pancia piatta di Marilyn sul set di "Facciamo l'amore". Agli inizi di giugno, però, si può chiaramente vedere il pancione'. Ma in quello scatto è difficile vedere il ventre di Marilyn, in quanto è coperto dal braccio, quindi la loro prova non è valida". "Anche perché - prosegue Fortner - è risaputo che Marilyn, avesse qualche chilo in più agli inizi degli anni '60".

Fortner è più che convinto: "Marilyn non era incinta, è fuori discussione. Ogni giorno della sua vita è documentato. Se avesse aspettato un bambino nel 1960 lo sapremmo di certo. Come sappiamo, infatti, che rimase incinta tre volte. Nell'estate del '56, mentre recitava in 'Il principe e la ballerina', nell'estate del '57 e l'ultima volta nel '58, durante le riprese di 'A qualcuno piace caldo'. Ma perse il bambino nell'inverno dello stesso anno. Da quel momento, Marilyn non provò più ad avere figli".

Un'altra prova a sostegno della tesi di Fortner gliela fornisce la stessa Marilyn: "Molti, quasi tutti, sono a conoscenza di quanto la Monroe tenesse alla sua immagine e alla considerazione del pubblico. Mai e poi mai avrebbe dato il permesso a qualcuno di fotografarla se fosse stata in attesa di un bambino di Yves Montand, quando ancora sposata con Arthur Miller".

Un altro dubbio lo solleva l'attuale proprietario dei beni di Frieda Hull, amico di vecchia data di Frieda. La donna lasciò a lui tutte le foto presenti nel suo archivio e i memorabilia di Marilyn. "Frieda non fece mai parola della storia né gli fece intendere nulla - afferma Fortner - quindi perché condividere questa informazione con qualcuno con cui, tra le altre cose, ha avuto un litigio, e non altri?".

Un'altra questione riguarda l'esclusività di queste foto. "Una di queste foto 'inedite' - come sottolinea il collezionista - era già stata pubblicata, nel 1991 per la precisione, nel libro di James Haspiel, 'Marilyn: The Ultimate Look at the Legend'". Lo stesso Fortner ha avuto accesso a queste foto, avendo curato il catalogo della collezione di Frieda Hull per la Julien's Auctions proprio in vista dell'asta di novembre. 550 istantanee e 150 diapositive. Analizzate una a una. E tra queste c'erano anche le foto "esclusive". "Non c'era alcun appunto su queste foto, niente che le segnalasse come 'speciali' o altro. Nulla che facesse riferimento al fatto che Marilyn fosse incinta. Eppure in altre foto, sul retro, ci sono degli appunti scritti a mano dalla stessa Frieda in cui viene descritto quanto fotografato e perché. Se queste foto erano così importanti - conclude Fortner - perché sul loro retro non c'è scritto nulla? Ma soprattutto, perché in tutta la collezione di Frieda non è presente il minimo accenno alla presunta gravidanza di Marilyn?".On a eu chaud, mais Drake a bel et bien été au Centre Bell vendredi soir dans le cadre de sa tournée Summer Sixteen Tour, malgré sa blessure à la cheville.

UFC president Dana White says the deal is done. Georges St-Pierre says nothing official yet.

GSP's cage comeback continues to be a windy road, it seems.

Speculation has been mounting in recent days that the former UFC welterweight champion is about to end his hiatus from mixed martial arts and return to action. On Friday, White confirmed it to the Los Angeles Times.

"He's back. I'm excited," White told the newspaper. "We worked at it for a long time and finally got it done."

But St-Pierre (25-2-0) was not willing to jump back on the bandwagon quite yet.

"Nothing official yet," the Montreal fighter told The Canadian Press via text. "No opponent, no date."

St-Pierre has cited ups and downs over the last six months in negotiations with the UFC, saying he has learned from the past "to not be too excited for nothing."

Welterweight champion Tyron Woodley is due to fight Stephen (Wonderboy) Thompson in a title rematch on March 4 at UFC 209, so St-Pierre would have to wait his turn to get his 170-pound title back. White told the Times that St-Pierre had also talked about dropping down to lightweight (155 pounds), a division that now belongs to mega-star (The Notorious) Conor McGregor.

The 35-year-old St-Pierre has not fought since Nov. 16, 2013, at UFC 167 when he won a narrow decision over Johny (Bigg Rigg) Hendricks for his 12th straight victory.

A month later, he announced he was vacating his title and stepping away from the sport.

Citing the pressures of being champion and of being in a constant limelight, St-Pierre said his life has become "completely insane" and a "freaking zoo."

St-Pierre has travelled the world since, but kept training and never shut the door on a return — even when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and had to undergo surgery.

He has sparred with the UFC over drug-testing and declared himself a free agent last October, citing failed negotiations with the UFC's new ownership. In November, he was also one of the marquee names behind the Mixed Martial Arts Athletes Association, formed to protect UFC fighters and help get them their fair share of the sport's revenue.

The UFC could use St-Pierre, with McGregor awaiting the birth of his child and Ronda Rousey's future up in the air. In his heyday, St-Pierre was a pay-per-view magnet.

GSP's return would also pump life into the sport in Canada, which has seen fewer live shows in recent years.

Follow @NeilMDavidson on TwitterPOLICE - Plus de deux semaines après les faits, la colère n'est pas retombée. Plusieurs rassemblements sont organisés samedi 18 février dans toute la France en solidarité avec Théo, dont l'arrestation violente le 2 février a provoqué de nombreuses manifestations et réveillé la défiance envers les forces de l'ordre.

À Paris, un rassemblement à l'initiative du Conseil représentatif des associations noires (Cran), de la Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH), du Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l'amitié entre les peuples (Mrap), de SOS Racisme, de la CGT et de la FSU, a débuté à 15 heures place de la République. Quelque 2300 personnes étaient réunies, selon la Préfecture de police.

Des slogans se sont fait entendre: "On n'oublie pas, on pardonne pas!", "Police partout, justice nulle part", "C'est l'impunité et l'injustice, alors désarmons la police!". Une banderole barrée de l'inscription "De Zyed et Bouna à Théo et Adama, à bas le racisme et la violence d'État" a également été déployée.

Plusieurs élus ceints de leur écharpe tricolore, notamment le député écologiste Noël Mamère, ont pris part au rassemblement. Le candidat à la présidentielle Jean-Luc Mélenchon y a également participé, comme le footballeur champion du monde 1998 Lilian Thuram.

Ce rassemblement parisien a été déclaré en préfecture. La place de la République était toutefois placée sous étroite surveillance. Plusieurs dizaines de camions de CRS et gendarmes mobiles étaient postés sur les différents axes menant à la place et les personnes porteuses de sacs se voyaient fouillées, a constaté un journaliste de l'AFP.

Craignant des débordements, le préfet de police de Paris a interdit dans ce périmètre la vente à emporter et la détention de boissons alcoolisées ou conditionnées dans un contenant en verre, susceptible d'être utilisé comme projectile contre les forces de l'ordre. La station de métro République a été fermée dès le début d'après-midi.

Des face-à-face tendus entre policiers et manifestants ont eu lieu peu après 16h30. Un groupe de quelques centaines de personnes "teste les barrages des forces de l'ordre", jetant des projectiles sans entraîner de riposte, a indiqué une source policière à l'AFP peu avant 17 heures. "Flics, violeurs, assassins", pouvait-on entendre dans les rangs des manifestants, comme le montre une vidéo ci-dessous.

D'autres manifestations sont organisées dans toute la France en solidarité avec "Théo et les autres victimes" et pour dénoncer les "violences policières", comme à Angers. Quelque 350 manifestants ont défilé à Rennes avant de commencer à se disperser vers 17h15, a constaté un journaliste de l'AFP.

Théo, un jeune homme noir de 22 ans, a quitté l'hôpital jeudi, deux semaines après son viol présumé lors d'une interpellation brutale le 2 février à Aulnay-Sous-Bois, en Seine-Saint-Denis. Quatre policiers ont été mis en examen, dont un pour viol, dans cette affaire devenue hautement politique.

Dans un communiqué, la présidente du Front national Marine Le Pen avait demandé "aux autorités compétentes d'interdire ces manifestations à haut risque". "Ce serait l'occasion d'éviter que ne soient une nouvelle fois entonnés d'immondes slogans insultants pour l'ensemble de nos forces de l'ordre et insultants pour la France", explique le communiqué.

À voir également sur Le HuffPost:La vasca pompeiana che sorgeva nella camera da letto di Walter Schiavone è stata svuotata e riempita di ciclamini. "Sembrano delicati, e invece sono tra i fiori più resistenti. Un segno di rinascita". La nuova vita è quella della villa simbolo della potenza economica del clan dei Casalesi, costruita a immagine di quella di Toni Montana in "Scarface". Confiscata dallo Stato ventitré anni fa, oggi lava le macchie del proprio passato diventando un Centro Riabilitativo per la salute mentale. A memoria di quello che fu un avamposto camorrista, le foto di Mario Spada campeggiano oggi in quelle stanze insieme ad alcuni elementi architettonici rimasti come reperti dei trascorsi criminali. "C'era una volta...Hollywood" è il titolo della mostra che riunisce alcuni scatti della serie "Scarface", realizzata dal fotografo nel 2005 per il settimanale "D di Repubblica", e foto di scena tratte dalle riprese del film "Gomorra". Due anni dopo aver esplorato la reggia di Casal Di Principe come fotoreporter, infatti, Spada fu "assoldato" dal regista Matteo Garrone prima come Virgilio in terra di camorra, poi come occhio sul set: "La casa produttrice Fandango aveva trasformato il mio studio nel suo quartier generale, dove si svolgevano riunioni, casting, prove di trucco. Gli autori usavano le foto di miei lavori per ricreare le scenografie", ricorda il fotografo.

Un grande cancello rosso in ferro e un muro altissimo, almeno 3 metri, intorno alla dimora; un lungo viale fatto di sanpietrini e in fondo, "la villa semidistrutta, bruciata, vandalizzata e completamente spogliata di ogni pezzo di valore: ringhiere, infissi, lampadari, marmi": così si presentava undici anni fa casa di Walter Schiavone, fratello di "Sandokan": "Restavano i segni del lusso e del potere: le colonne, il timpano, e la vasca, come nelle case patrizie dell’Antica Pompei. Entrai dappertutto e spesso la meraviglia di quella singolare scenografia mi faceva sgranare gli occhi: immediatamente aprivo il cavalletto - racconta il fotografo - Dovevo dare il tempo alla luce di scalfire e penetrare nel nero della fuliggine per leggere i dettagli più nascosti; chiudere il diaframma al massimo per ottenere una messa fuoco nitida dell’immagine in tutta la sua profondità. La poca luce che entrava dalle finestre ostruite dalle piante infestanti mi costringeva a esposizioni di decine di minuti, e tutto quel tempo lo utilizzavo per memorizzare il luogo. Non mi bastavano le fotografie".

Anche Marco Onorato, il direttore della fotografia di Gomorra, dovette ingegnarsi per illuminare quegli antri ingoiati dall'oscurità: "Sistemò gli specchi al sole, consentendo così alla luce di rimbalzare all’interno della villa, illuminandola quel poco che bastava per “girare”, continua Spada, "e io mi ritrovavo a scattare negli stessi spazi che avevo già fotografato, ma con un’altra modalità, completamente differente, mentre Marco, l’attore, urlava: 'Vi ammazzo tutti bastardi colombiani'”. Da testimone oculare della realtà a "notaio" della finzione cinematografica, come se i ciak sulla scena fossero il preludio di un evento in corso, non di una recita: "Mi ricordai delle parole di Giovanni Allucci (amministratore delegato di Agrorinasce, il Consorzio che gestisce beni confiscati) che due anni prima mi aveva detto con gli occhi pieni di orgoglio che la villa di Walter Schiavone sarebbe diventata un centro di riabilitazione. Non avevo alcun buon presentimento che questo progetto potesse andare a buon fine. Per fortuna mi sbagliavo". La nuova vita di villa "Scarface" è cominciata il 30 gennaio scorso.Viele Fans des TV-Stars Verona Pooth rätseln schon seit Jahren darüber, warum die 48-Jährige noch immer so jung aussieht. Dabei genügt schon ein Blick auf ihr Instagram-Profil, um zu sehen, dass Verona Pooth ganz einfach viel Sport macht.

Sie setze zudem auf Lebensmittel wie Fisch, Fleisch und viel Gemüse, verriet sie der Nachrichtenagentur "Spot on News". Mindestens zwei Mal die Woche mache sie außerdem für 20 Minuten Sport. "Crash-Diäten mache ich nicht", sagte der TV-Star. "Bei mir wird nicht gehungert."

Das klingt doch wenigstens mal nach einem gesunden Lebensstil. Ihr Geheimnis, auch jetzt noch so jung auszusehen, könnte aber tatsächlich an etwas ganz anderem liegen, wie ihr im Video oben seht.

(ll)Roberto Baggio compie 50 anni e la festa è con i terremotati di Amatrice. L'ex campione di calcio, accompagnato dal presidente dell'Amatrice Calcio, Tito Capriccioli, sta incontrando i bambini del comune reatino colpito dal sisma della scorsa estate nella mensa di Campo Lazio, dove è in corso la festa del Carnevale. Baggio ha incontrato anche il sindaco Sergio Pirozzi. Una scelta maturata in sordina una settimana fa, lontano dai riflettori, che lo porta nelle zone di Amatrice e Norcia, colpite dalla sequenza sismica a partire dal 24 agosto. Il fuoriclasse di Caldogno è partito in mattinata insieme alla sua famiglia: prima tappa all'interno del piccolo container che dopo il sisma ospita l'ufficio del sindaco di Amatrice, Sergio Pirozzi.

Dopo Amatrice, Roberto Baggio sarà anche nella città terremotata di Norcia nella giornata in cui festeggia il suo 50mo compleanno. La conferma arriva da Alberto Allegrini, vicepresidente della pro loco di Norcia, dove Baggio è atteso per le 19. Qui, nella tensostruttura della Protezione civile che fino a pochi giorni fa ospitava la mensa per gli sfollati, è stata organizzata per le 21 una cerimonia per festeggiare il Pallone d'oro, con tanto di torta e candeline.

Domani Baggio dovrebbe stare di nuovo a Norcia, per una visita al centro storico della città e per dare il calcio d'inizio di una partita amichevole tra giovani calciatori del posto.Han pasado 12 años desde que se emitió el último episodio de la popular serie de humor Friends y todavía siguen apareciendo nuevas teorías sobre ella.

La última, la que desarrolla la web Digital Spy, tiene que ver con Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) y con un 'cameo', el del actor Brent Spiner, conocido por dar vida al comandante Data en la serie Star Trek.

Según esta teoría, Joey Tribbiani podría no ser un personaje de ficción sino una persona real.

Lo que leen. Y el enlace de toda esta teoría es Spiner, quien apareció en el decimocuarto episodio de la décima temporada, El de Princesa Consuela, interpretando a James Campbell, el hombre que queda en un restaurante con Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) para entrevistarla para la firma de moda Gucci. La mala suerte para Rachel es que en el mismo restaurante está su actual jefe, al que no le había comentado nada sobre dicha entrevista.

Pues bien, en Joey, el 'spin-off' de Friends dedicado a Joey Tribbiani, también aparece Spiner, pero esta vez interpretándose a sí mismo.

¿Qué puede significar esto? Según Digital Spy, si Spiner aparece interpretándose a sí mismo, eso quiere decir que, en Joey, Joey se era una persona real que interpretó a Joey Tribbiani en Friends.

Más o menos como Will Smith en El Príncipe de Bel Air.Yoda, ma anche note nostalgiche. Una sorta di operazione nostalgia quella andata in scena al teatro Vittoria per la assemblea della minoranza Pd: è cominciata sulle note di Bandiera Rossa. A presentare la manifestazione Peppino Caldarola davanti a Massimo D'Alema, Pier Luigi Bersani, Michele Emiliano, Roberto Speranza, Enrico Rossi. Sala gremita e applausi sia sulle note di Bandiera Rossa sia alle immagini di Star Wars con la celebre frase: "Devi sentire la forza intorno a te". "Quell' astronave dobbiamo tirarla fuori, e' la sinistra", chiosa Caldarola fissando Yoda sullo schermo.ADVERTISEMENT

Le célèbre acteur américain Warren Frost, qui a incarné le docteur Will Hayward dans la série télévisée "Twin Peaks", est décédé.

Selon son fils Mark Frost, qui est l'un des créateurs de "Twin Peaks", l'acteur 91 ans est mort vendredi à sa résidence de Middlebury, au Vermont, après une longue maladie.

Warren Frost avait pris une pause de sa retraite pour reprendre son rôle dans la suite de la série "Twin Peaks", qui sera présentée sur la chaîne Showtime.

"Alles frei erfunden" - die "Bild" blamiert sich mit Fake News über Falco | Getty / Screenshot / Bild

Die "Bild" hat Großes vor: Sie will "das ehrlichste Medium Deutschlands" sein. Das sei sein Anspruch, verkündete der neue Vorsitzende der "Bild"-Chefredaktionen, Julian Reichelt, kürzlich im "Tagesspiegel".

Auf diesem Weg kommt die Zeitung wirklich sehr gut voran: mit einer Reihe an falschen Informationen.

In der vergangenen Woche verbreitete die Zeitung "die Wahrheit über Falcos Tod", oder, um genau zu zitieren: "die ganze Wahrheit über Falcos Tod".

Falco, genau, das ist der Popstar aus Österreich, der seit 19 Jahren tot ist. Aber nur weil jemand seit 19 Jahren tot ist, heißt das ja nicht, dass er der "Bild" nicht trotzdem noch eine Schlagzeile liefern könnte. Falco starb, als er von einem Parkplatz auf eine Straße fuhr und ein Bus in sein Auto krachte. Die Obduktion ergab: Der Star hatte 1,5 Promille Alkohol, Kokain und Marihuana im Blut.

Es liegt nahe, da einen Zusammenhang zu sehen.

Kein Zitat aus der Dokumentation stimmt

Die Investigativ-Journalisten der "Bild" wollten der Sache aber noch einmal genauer auf den Grund gehen - gut so, so gehört sich das.

Also haben sie sich eine Dokumentation über Falco angesehen. Oh, wir wollen hier keine Fake News verbreiten: Sie haben sich keine Dokumentation über Falco angesehen, sie haben den Artikel nur so geschrieben, dass alle glaubten, sie hätten eine gesehen.

Sie schrieben also über die Kabel-1-Doku "Falco-Die ultimative Doku zum 60. Geburtstag": Hans Reinisch, Falcos Manager - die Info muss stimmen, steht auch so bei Wikipedia - sage, dass Falco "hoffnungslos verliebt" gewesen sei, und zwar in die Dorf-Schönheit Selina.

Selinas Vater, der Bürgermeister des Dorfes, habe allerdings etwas gegen die Beziehung gehabt und den Kontakt verboten. Falcos wilde Vergangenheit habe ihm nicht gefallen. Selina trennte sich - und das habe Falco das Herz gebrochen.

Tatsache ist aber: In der Dokumentation, wie dem medienkritischen Portal "Meedia" als erstes aufgefallen ist, sagt Reinisch nichts von all den Dingen, die er laut "Bild" von sich gab.

Falcos Manager: "Das ist ein Werk der Phantastik"

„Alles, was in der Bild und den anderen Medien gestanden hat, ist frei erfunden“, sagte Reinisch laut "Meedia". Dass Selinas Vater die Beziehung zu Falco wegen dessen Vergangenheit verboten habe, sei zum Beispiel "Blödsinn, der Vater war zu dem Zeitpunkt schon tot".

Auch sei Reinisch nie Falcos Manager gewesen, wie ihn die "Bild" bezeichnet. Falcos tatsächlicher Manager war Horst Bork. Dieser bezeichnet den Artikel als "ein Werk der Phantastik".

Nicht einmal das Foto in dem "Bild"- Artikel ergibt laut "Meedia" Sinn. Die "Bild" zeigt ein Foto, auf dem angeblich Selina zu sehen ist. Doch leider handelt es sich dabei laut "Meedia" lediglich um eine Schauspielerin, die Selina gespielt hat. Kann man aber auch nicht wissen, wenn man sich die Dokumentation nicht angesehen hat.

Die "Bild" entschuldigte die Fake News auf Anfrage von "Meedia" damit, dass man für den Text mit dem Regisseur gesprochen habe und dieser die Zitate aus der Dokumentation falsch wiedergegeben habe - trotz schriftlicher Autorisierung.

Wenn das so ist, ist das natürlich blöd gelaufen. Ehrlich. Auch mit dem Versuch, das "ehrlichste Medium Deutschlands" zu sein.WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: Former U.S. President Barack Obama (R) congratulates U.S. President Donald Trump after he took the oath of office on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC.

La Russie a prôné samedi à Munich un ordre mondial "post-occidental", au moment même où les Etats-Unis réaffirmaient leur alliance à une Europe déstabilisée par l’arrivée de Donald Trump.

S'exprimant à la Conférence pour la sécurité de Munich qui réunit un parterre de dirigeants étrangers dont le vice-président américain Mike Pence, M. Lavrov a annoncé la fin de "l'ordre mondial libéral" conçu selon lui par "une élite d'Etats" occidentaux à visées dominatrices.

"Les dirigeants responsables doivent faire un choix. J'espère que ce choix sera celui d'un ordre mondial démocratique et juste. Si vous voulez, appelez le +post-west+", a ajouté l'homme de confiance de Vladimir Poutine, qualifiant au passage l'Otan de "vestige de la Guerre Froide".

Son discours intervenait quelques heures après la première allocution internationale du vice-président américain Mike Pence, qui a, lui, réaffirmé la validité de l'alliance transatlantique.

Dans le climat d'incertitude qui entoure l'ordre international et particulièrement l'avenir des relations russo-américaines sous Donald Trump, M. Lavrov a proposé à Washington des "relations pragmatiques de respect mutuel".

"Le potentiel de coopération dans les domaines politique, économique, humanitaire est énorme, mais il doit encore être réalisé, nous y sommes ouverts dans la mesure où les Etats-Unis le sont", a-t-il ajouté.

Dans son discours samedi matin, le vice-président américain a pour sa part évoqué très brièvement la relation russo-américaine, avant tout pour rassurer les Européens.

"Sachez que les Etats-Unis continueront de demander des comptes à la Russie, même si nous cherchons des terrains d'entente. Comme vous le savez le président Trump pense que c’est possible", a-t-il dit.

'Partager le fardeau'

Donald Trump avait déstabilisé ses partenaires en souhaitant bruyamment un rapprochement avec Vladimir Poutine.

En visite en Europe cette semaine, son secrétaire d'Etat et le chef du Pentagone ont tempéré ces velléités, au risque d'impatienter Moscou et d'accroître le flou sur les intentions réelles de Washington.

Calme et posé, M. Pence a ainsi réaffirmé que les Etats-Unis seraient toujours "le plus grand allié" des Européens, et assuré de l'engagement inébranlable des Etats-Unis dans l'Otan.

Mais il a aussi fermement réitéré les exigences américaines d'un engagement financier plus important de ses partenaires, censés consacrer 2% de leur PIB aux dépenses militaires.

"La promesse de partager le fardeau n'a pas été remplie depuis bien trop longtemps", y compris "par nos plus grands alliés", a-t-il dit, visant implicitement l'Allemagne et la France.

"Le président Trump attend de ses alliés qu'ils tiennent leur parole. Le temps est venu de faire plus", a-t-il martelé.

Poliment, des ministres européens ont rétorqué que l'Europe contribuait aussi à la stabilité du monde par l'aide au développement.

En outre "quel intérêt d'atteindre les 2% quand on ne peut pas payer les retraites", s'est interrogé le chef de la diplomatie allemande Sigmar Gabriel, citant l'exemple emblématique de la Grèce.

Le ministre français des Affaires étrangères, Jean-Marc Ayrault, a lui regretté sur Twitter que M. Pence n'ait pas dit "un mot sur l'UE", un sujet sur lequel il était attendu, M. Trump ayant par le passé loué le Brexit et semblé souhaiter un éclatement de l'Union européenne.

Ukraine et hackers

En ouvrant la journée samedi, la chancelière allemande Angela Merkel a pour sa part lancé un appel au multilatéralisme pour faire face à des défis immenses comme le jihadisme ou la crise migratoire.

Si elle a tendu la main à la Russie dans la lutte contre le terrorisme, elle a de nouveau plaidé la "fermeté" sur l'Ukraine, dossier qui empoisonne les relations entre l'Occident et Moscou.

La chef de la diplomatie de l'Union européenne Federica Mogherini a répété que les sanctions imposées à la Russie seraient levées lorsque les accords de paix de Minsk seraient appliqués.

Répliquant à "sa bonne amie" Mogherini, Sergueï Lavrov a martelé la position russe selon laquelle Kiev était le principal responsable de la non application des accords.

Enfin, interrogé sur les accusations de piratage de la Russie dans la campagne électorale pour la présidentielle française, M. Lavrov a répliqué qu'il voulait "voir des faits".

Being the jaded hacks that we are, we’ve mostly seen and done it all. But nothing prepared us for Molly Goddard’s AW17 show at London Fashion Week, which was jaw-droppingly beautiful from the set to the clothes.

Here’s the set. At first we thought it was Hilary Alexander Instagramming a fancy lunch...

One of the hottest designers to emerge from last year, Molly is known for her tulle dresses, and favours embroidery, smocking and crocheting. In an interview with Dazed she said: “I am a bit of granny I suppose as I like old things. I like embroidery and it’s a dying skill so it would be great if more young people could get into it.”

Her show was breathtaking.

@mollymgoddard #topshop #londonfashionweek #hfmxlfw A post shared by Hilary Alexander Official (@hilaryalexanderobe) on Feb 18, 2017 at 6:25am PSTLas redes sociales son en ocasiones un campo de batalla, en el que el conocimiento y la información se mezclan con las opiniones más feroces y crueles.

Andrea Compton, una de las youtubers e influencers más conocidas y famosas de España ha denunciado en su perfil de Instagram el último ataque ha recibido por su físico.

La joven asegura que mientras buscaba una imagen de una de sus entrevistas encontró un foro en el que un grupo de mujeres hablaba de su peso, de su físico e incluso de su piel. La influencer dijo basta y publicó un amplio texto acompañado de una foto suya en un bañador negro en el que se desahogaba contra las mujeres que han criticado su cuerpo.

"Yo llevo un año haciendo un ejercicio muy importante que es mirarme al espejo cada día, aceptarme y verme espectacular", asegura la youtuber en el texto. Además, ha confesado que si hubiese visto esos comentarios hace un año lo habría pasado muy mal: "Llego a leer ese foro hace un año cuando estaba mentalmente destruida y me hundo en la más absoluta miseria", comentó.

Para concluir la publicación, Compton quiso mandar un recado a todas esas mujeres que critican a otras por su aspecto físico: "Si eres mujer y me estás leyendo, por favor... cuida lo que dices de otras mujeres. Intentad no hacer daño a nadie, es muy muy muy importante", sentenció.

Buscando una foto mía para una entrevista que me habían pedido, me he topado con un foro espantoso donde tenían un hilo entero hablando de mi peso y de mi piel, de lo gorda que soy y los granos que tengo. El hilo tenía un año, pero cuando lo he leído... me he quedado completamente helada, de que fueran mujeres quienes estaban haciendo esto, y no sólo a mí, a mujeres que para mí son preciosas y perfectas, con todos sus pesos alturas y estilos. Horrible que mujeres abran foros e hilos para criticar a otras únicamente por su físico, no saben el daño que se hacen entre ellas al hacer algo así. Ojalá se respetasen entre ellas, en vez de criticarlas, se ayudasen y sobretodo se dijesen cada día lo preciosas que son. Yo llevo un año haciendo un ejercicio muy importante que es mirarme al espejo cada día, aceptarme y verme espectacular. Me gusta cada parte de mí en todo momento, me gusto con una 46, con una 42 y con una 50. Me ha costado mucho tiempo aceptar que cada año tengo y tendré un peso diferente, pero ¡menos mal! porque llego a leer ese foro hace un año cuando estaba mentalmente destruida y me hundo en la más absoluta miseria. Si eres mujer y me estás leyendo, por favor... cuida lo que dices de otras mujeres. Intentad no hacer daño a nadie, es muy muy muy importante. (Me dirijo a mujeres porque es con lo que me he topado hoy, pero evidentemente cualquier ser humano debería respetar y cuidar del otro). Una publicación compartida de Andrea Compton (@andreacomptonn) el 16 de Feb de 2017 a la(s) 6:07 PST





La publicación lleva en menos de un día más de 100.000 me gusta y numerosos comentarios que apoyan el texto de la influencer.

Imagen de H&M este año, junto a Beyoncé, en ropa de verano y bañadores. "Trata de ser la mejor versión de ti misma y deja de preocuparte por tus mulos, que no tienen nada de malo", aconseja a las jóvenes.

Lawley es quizas la supermodelo de las modelos de talla grande. Ha protagonizado numerosas portadas de revistas, incluido Vogue Italia, Marie Claire y Elle Francia. Esta modelo 'plus size' también ha sido imagen de Ralph Lauren. "Hay muchas modelos de talla gran en Nueva York haciéndolo muy bien ahora mismo. Y esto sólo va a ir a mejor", ha dicho.

Huffine posó desnuda para el número de mayo de 2012 de S Moda. "[Un reportaje editorial en Vogue Italia] abrió los ojos a la industria para probar que somos guapas, sexys y buenas modelos. Ahora la gente quiere ver más. Las discusiones pasadas [sobre Photoshop] han hecho que la industria entienda que la gente quiere ver chicas de verdad", dijo.

En febrero de 2002, Elle Francia definió a Lynn como "el cuerpo, refiriéndose a que sus curvas representan el modelo ideal de mujer.

Esta modelo británica ha puesto en marcha Curve Project London, una agencia para modelos de todas las tallas que buscan hacerse un hueco en el mundo de la moda. Comenzó a desfilar como maniquí de tallas grandes cuando una agencia dejó de contar con ella por ganar peso. Le gustaría ser ejemplo de que "estar delgada no es la única forma de poner un pie en el mundo de la moda".

Elle, en su edición de Quebec, llevó a portada una sesión de fotos con LeGault para su número de mayo de 2013. La modelo canadiense expresó su alegría: "El hecho de que sólo reciba respuestas positivas por esta portada me hace feliz. Parece que la gente ya no se queda tan sorprendida de ver curvas en los medios. ¡Es una gran noticia!

Participó en un anuncio de Lane Bryant que fue prohibido de cadenas como Fox, con al excusa de que enseñaban mucha piel, aunque ella batalló mediáticamente la posibilidad de que fuera por tratarse de modellos de talla grande.

Munster ha popularizado el blog The Plus Size Life, en el que posa con todo tipo de estilos para reivindicar que no hay que estar delgado para lucir de forma fabulosa cualquier moda.

Se hizo modelo de tallas grandes tras ser modelo 'tradicional' y sufrir desórdenes alimenticios, aunque ella misma va cambiando de talla año a año. En una conferencia en febrero pidió a los diseñadores que también fomenten el cambio.

Se hizo famosa desfilando para Jean Paul Gaultier en 2007 en París. Ha creado su propia revista VOL•UP•2 y hace campaña para promover cambios en el mundo de la moda.  Compartir  Tuitear  ✖ PUBLICIDAD Compártelo ✖ cerrar Esta imagen

Hace unos meses, el conocido chef británico ya fue noticia después de hacer un plato al que llamó "paella", con el que se ganó las críticas de gran parte del pueblo español.

Tras ese "arroz con cosas", el cocinero ha ido un paso más allá y se ha atrevido con uno de los platos italianos más famosos: los espaguetis a la carbonara.

El conocido chef compartió una curiosa adaptación —que poco o nada tiene que ver con el plato original— de la famosa receta de pasta a la carbonara. Además, ha tenido la osadía de presentar el plato con forma de tarta. "Mira esta belleza, ¿te gusta la carbonara? ¿te gustan las tartas? ¡Esto es para ti!", dijo Oliver adjuntando de los espaguetis en cuestión.

La pasarela ha vivido una revolución francesa abanderada por la actriz Victoria Abril, quien abrió el desfile con ropa interior inspirada en el siglo XVIII y lo cerró, encarnada en una María Antonieta en el Palacio de Versalles.

Con las primeras salidas, la directora creativa de la firma, Núria Sardá, ha querido rendir homenaje al pueblo que se sublevó con una lencería de aspecto sencillo en el que camisas blancas de popelín juegan con corsés de arpillera o bustiers de rafia.

Después adquirieron protagonismo la lencería con reminiscencias militares, un abanico de prendas con carácter más guerrero, más revolucionario.

En la última parte del desfile llegaba el momento de la lencería aburguesada, con espíritu de fiesta; "son prendas más románticas, delicadas y sensuales", explicaba hoy a EFE Núria Sardá, quien propone conjuntos lenceros de tul flocado y encajes de chantilly, cuajados de lazos.

REUTERSWhen our friends break up and play their catharsis out on social media, we tend to take to secretive WhatsApp groups to collectively bitch about it behind their backs.

However when you’re Professor Green and Millie Mackintosh, things are a leetle bit more public.

In the week that Professor Green aka Stephen Manderson dropped an are-they-aren’t-they picture with his girlfriend Fae Williams wearing a huge opal rock, ex-wife Millie and fellow Made In Chelsea star Hugo Taylor uploaded the same picture of themselves on Instagram at the British Fashion Council’s drinks during London Fashion Week.

Hugo’s picture was captioned ‘lethal cocktail’ while Millie’s caption said this.

💋 A post shared by Millie Mackintosh (@milliemackintoshofficial) on Feb 17, 2017 at 12:35pm PSTWhen one of our favourite emerging designers - Matty Bovan - worked with one of our favourite models - Winnie Harlow - only one thing was going to happen.

This amazing awesomeness at London Fashion Week.

Last year, Bovan was feted after being hand-picked by Fashion East as the sole newcomer to their London Fashion Week catwalk. Since graduating from Central Saint Martins last year, the 26-year-old designer has worked with Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu; he has also been mentored by the one and only Katie Grand.

Bovan has always been a champion of model diversity, and this year’s show which featured the most divine layering of prints, colours and textures isn’t any different.

Here’s a quick peek at some of the ladies backstage:

He certainly is.The first doll to be based on a transgender person is hitting the market and it's of transgender activist Jazz Jennings. pic.twitter.com/lpV5WqORuuSe siete stati miracolosamente risparmiati dal marketing, vi ricordo che è da poco passato San Valentino. E forse siete come me.

Sono cresciuta guardando film Disney e commedie romantiche. Il Principe Azzurro, "e vissero felici e contenti", i primi incontri perfetti, I gesti grandiosi pieni di suspense ed emozione e così via, eccetera eccetera. Ah, quella sensazione rassicurante e indistinta. Tutto quel "oh mio dio, il ragazzo perfetto è davvero perfetto". Quella speranza che, un giorno, avrai anche tu qualcuno che si farà largo a spintoni nella folla di un aeroporto strapieno per impedirti di salire su quell'aereo ed esibirsi in un monologo strappalacrime sul perché dovete stare insieme.

Sì, guardo ancora commedie romantiche. E, sì, le adoro ancora.

Come coppia, non festeggiamo San Valentino. Qualcuno di voi inorridirà. A qualcun altro non interesserà per niente. E altri tra voi appoggeranno in pieno questa presa di posizione. Non ho niente contro San Valentino. È solo un'occasione che abbiamo deciso di non festeggiare, di comune accordo.

A dire il vero, prima andavo matta per i gesti romantici. Le grandi dimostrazioni d'amore. Quei momenti da favola, pianificati alla perfezione, che ti tolgono il respiro.

È divertente però, perché dopo dieci anni e due figli, vedo l'amore e il romanticismo sotto una luce completamente diversa. E posso dire con sincerità che, ora, sono scesa a patti col fatto che non ci regaleremo fiori e cioccolatini di rito. E mi va bene così. Lo giuro. Carissimo marito, in caso te lo stessi chiedendo, non è un trabochetto.

Gesti importanti, fiori, cioccolatini vanno benissimo, ma di recente ho deciso d'impegnarmi a notare le piccole cose che succedono ogni giorno e che mi dimostrano cos'è l'amore.

Quando inizi a cercare queste piccole cose, ci vedi l'amore dentro. Sono dappertutto. Provateci.

L'amore è quell'ora in più di sonno che lui ti concede e di cui non ti sei accorta finché, svegliandoti, non ti sei sentita un po' più "umana".

L'amore è quello sguardo segreto, quella risata sommessa che vi scambiate quando il vostro bambino dice o fa qualcosa di divertente e forse anche leggermente inappropriato.

L'amore è la bottiglia d'acqua fresca che appare magicamente sul tuo comodino, perché lui sa che ti viene sete quando ti svegli per allattare il bimbo ogni due ore.

L'amore è rendersi conto che è passata una settimana e tu non hai lavato neanche un piatto perché ci ha pensato lui.

L'amore è quel momento in cui siete in stanze diverse, cercando di far addormentare i bambini, e improvvisamente senti le farfalle nello stomaco all'idea che, di lì a poco, passerai del tempo con il tuo migliore amico.

L'amore è in quella conversazione sul divano quando entrambi indossate pantaloni da tuta e mangiate cibo thai direttamente dalla confezione, scambiandovi aneddoti sui vostri figli e guardando video dove sono adorabili anche se hanno dormito solo cinque minuti.

L'amore è in quei momenti in cui vi incazzate l'uno con l'altro, e poi vi rendete conto che essere arrabbiati non è divertente e che vi manca il vostro compagno, così ve ne fate una ragione e chiedete scusa.

L'amore è nell'empatia che lui ti mostra quando entrambi sapete fin troppo bene che, in questo particolare momento, sei in preda agli ormoni e forse anche un tantino irrazionale.

L'amore è l'effetto che ti fa il messaggio in cui ti dice che torna a casa prima.

L'amore è renderti conto che sei impaziente di vederlo varcare la soglia di casa alla fine di ogni giornata, proprio come lo è vostro figlio. E non solo perché questo significa che ci sono più adulti in servizio, al comando delle truppe, ma perché la tua metà è lì con te e ti rende felice.

L'amore è lui che accetta le tue ossessive regole d'igiene, quando usa le tue apposite spugnette da cucina perfettamente a norma, senza fare una piega.

L'amore è quel momento in cui provi a far addormentare tuo figlio e non ce la fai più, ma arriva lui e si occupa di tutta la trafila di carezze e coccole. E tu siedi sul bordo del letto e lo osservi mentre ama vostro figlio.

L'amore non si trova sempre nei grandi momenti. Anzi, molto più spesso, è in quei tanti momenti apparentemente insignificanti, transitori, che costellano la vostra giornata. I momenti che ti passano davanti senza che tu te ne accorga, perché sei troppo occupata ad aspettare che i violini inizino a suonare e i fuochi d'artificio esplodano in cielo.

Fai un bilancio dei momenti della tua giornata. Ti assicuro che resterai sorpresa di fronte alla miriade di cose che, in realtà, non saranno altro che il vostro modo di dimostrarvi amore reciproco. Che l'amore è talmente radicato nella vostra vita insieme da pervadere gran parte delle vostre azioni e decisioni quotidiane. Le cose che fai e che pensi non siano così importanti ma che, osservate da vicino, nascono dall'amore che provate l'uno per l'altro.

Preferirei questo ai fiori e ai cioccolatini, in qualsiasi momento.ADVERTISEMENT

With such youthful good looks, it’s hard to believe some of our favourite celebs will be turning the big 5-0 this year. But 2017 is actually a big milestone year for a number of famous faces, including Pamela Anderson.

Despite getting older, the Canadian model says she’s embracing her age. “I’m excited about getting old,” she told People magazine last year. “I feel like there’s much more freedom in aging and just going with the flow.”

Here, we’ve rounded up 20 celebrity parents who are turning 50 this year, from Pamela Anderson to Jamie Foxx. We just know they’re going to rock it!ADVERTISEMENT

Au moins 140 réfugiés somaliens ont été admis aux États-Unis après s'être vu interdits d'entrer en vertu du controversé décret-loi en matière d'immigration signé par Donald Trump, ont indiqué d'autres réfugiés somaliens qui les ont côtoyés.

Ces sources s'exprimaient sous le couvert de l'anonymat puisqu'elles craignent pour leur sécurité. Celles-ci se trouvent au plus important camp de réfugiés au monde, Dadaab, qui abrite plus de 200 000 Somaliens.

Le groupe de 140 réfugiés dont l'entrée a été approuvée par les autorités américaines était sur le point de se rendre aux États-Unis quand le président Trump a promulgué son interdiction d'entrée pour les ressortissants de sept pays majoritairement musulmans.

Tous ont donc été contraints de rester dans un camp de transition de la capitale du Kenya, Nairobi. Ils ont ensuite été renvoyés dans des camps de réfugiés.

Or, une cour américaine a suspendu le décret-loi de Donald Trump. Les 140 réfugiés somaliens ont donc été redirigés à Nairobi au cours de la dernière semaine, avant leur départ pour les États-Unis.

La Chine va cesser ses importations de charbon de Corée du Nord jusqu'à fin 2017, durcissant sa position après un nouveau test de missile et privant Pyongyang d'une source cruciale de revenus qui lui rapportait plus d'un milliard de dollars par an.

"La Chine va cesser momentanément ses importations de charbon en provenance de Corée du Nord pour le reste de l'année", a indiqué samedi le ministère chinois du Commerce.

Cette suspension, qui débutera dimanche et s'appliquera jusqu'au 31 décembre, concerne aussi les cargaisons en attente d'un examen aux douanes.

Ce durcissement intervient peu après l'essai par Pyongyang de son missile balistique Pukguksong-2: celui-ci a parcouru dimanche dernier 500 kilomètres avant de retomber en mer du Japon, suscitant de vives réactions en Asie comme à Washington.

Le lendemain, Kim Jong-Nam, demi-frère en disgrâce du dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-Un, était assassiné en Malaise. Réputé apprécié par Pékin, il vivait en exil en territoire chinois, à Macao.

Pour Koh Yu-Hwan, professeur à l'université sud-coréenne Dongguk, ces deux épisodes ont pu exaspérer Pékin, déjà irrité de voir son turbulent voisin accélérer le développement de son programme nucléaire à visée militaire.

'Provocations'

"La Chine a pu vouloir lancer un avertissement, après les provocations que constituent ce dernier lancement de missile et le meurtre de Kim Jong-Nam (où nombre d'observateurs suspectent la main de Pyongyang, ndlr)", explique Koh Yu-Hwan à l'AFP.

"C'est également un geste de bonne volonté à l'égard de Washington, le signe que Pékin accomplit bien sa part d'efforts pour endiguer la Corée du Nord", poursuit-il.

Les Etats-Unis avaient accentué la pression vendredi: le secrétaire d'Etat américain Rex Tillerson, qui rencontrait son homologue chinois Wang Yi pour la première fois, avait appelé Pékin à oeuvrer "par tous les moyens" à "modérer" son voisin.

De fait, la Chine, unique allié de Pyongyang et son principal soutien diplomatique, lui fournit un soutien économique vital, mais cache de moins en moins son agacement face à l'intransigeance de Kim Jong-Un.

Celui-ci n'a toujours pas visité la Chine, cinq ans après son arrivée au pouvoir.

En lançant son missile juste après un entretien téléphonique conciliant entre le nouveau président américain Donald Trump et son homologue chinois Xi Jinping, Pyongyang "a pu tenter d'attiser la discorde entre les deux puissances", souligne Wang Dong, expert géopolitique de l'Université de Pékin.

Mais, selon lui, "vu le caractère éminemment provocateur de ce missile, la Chine s'est résolue à agir pour marquer sa nette opposition".

La suspension des importations chinoises dévoilée samedi représente un coup dur pour les finances de Pyongyang, qui verra disparaître une cruciale source de devises.

Resserrer l'étau

En 2016, la Chine avait importé 22,5 millions de tonnes de charbon nord-coréen (une hausse de 15% sur un an), pour un montant total avoisinant 1,19 milliard de dollars, selon les douanes chinoises.

La suspension annoncée samedi est destinée à "appliquer la résolution 2321 du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies", a insisté Pékin. Adoptée le 30 novembre, celle-ci resserrait l'étau des sanctions internationales contre Pyongyang en raison de son programme nucléaire.

La résolution plafonnait notamment les ventes nord-coréennes de charbon à 400,9 millions de dollars (ou 7,5 millions de tonnes) par an à partir de 2017, une réduction de 62% par rapport à 2015.

Pékin avait alors suspendu à partir du 11 décembre, pour trois semaines, ses importations --ce qui ne les avait pas empêcher de bondir de 13% sur un an pour l'ensemble de décembre. Et le commerce avait de nouveau repris début janvier.

Sous le précédent régime de sanctions, le Conseil de sécurité autorisait les achats de charbon et minerai de fer de Corée du Nord pourvu que les recettes ne servent pas à financer son programme nucléaire. Ce qui permettait à Pékin d'accroître ses importations en arguant de sa bonne foi.

La Chine semble toujours prête à manier autant la carotte que le bâton.

En marge d'un G20, Wang Yi, chef de la diplomatie chinoise, a ainsi plaidé vendredi pour une reprise des négociations à Six (les deux Corées, Japon, Russie, Chine et Etats-Unis), estimant qu'il fallait briser le cercle vicieux des essais nucléaires et des sanctions.

Volker Bouffier hat sich erneut für ein Bündnis der Union mit den Grünen ausgesprochen

Er sieht auch die CSU nicht als Hindernis für Schwarz-Grün im Bund

Für Bundeskanzlerin Merkel sind die Grünen aber offenbar nicht der bevorzugt Partner

Hessens Ministerpräsident Volker Bouffier (CDU) ist bekannt als Freund von Schwarz -Grün. Schon im November hatte er sich für ein Bündnis mit den Grünen ausgesprochen - jetzt hat er seine Forderung wiederholt. Die Union muss sich ein schwarz-grünes Bündnis als Option für den Bund offenhalten, sagte er dem "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".

Die Union müsse bei der Bundestagswahl so stark werden, dass gegen sie nicht regiert werden könne, sagte der stellvertretende Bundesvorsitzende.

"Ich werbe für Offenheit"

"Und dann sollten wir mit einem Partner zusammen eine Regierung bilden können, die nicht wieder aus einer großen Koalition besteht", sagte Bouffier. Hessen habe gezeigt, dass ein schwarz-grünes Bündnis funktioniere. "Deshalb werbe ich für Offenheit bei der Union." CDU und CSU müssten "darauf achten, dass man sich nicht strategisch die Wege verbaut".



Bouffier zeigte sich davon überzeugt, dass ein solches Bündnis nicht an der CSU scheitern würde. "Horst Seehofer ist ein Mann mit außergewöhnlich viel Erfahrung", sagte er. Er gehe davon aus, dass der CSU-Chef nach der Wahl "die Dinge bewerten und zu Schlüssen kommen wird".

Im Moment liege das Problem ohnehin bei den Grünen. "Die müssten sich erst mal inhaltlich so sortieren, dass sie für uns als Partner in Frage kommen."

Die Kanzlerin sieht das offenbar anders. "Die Grünen sind kein bevorzugter Partner" der Union nach der Bundestagswahl, sagte sie im Dezember.

Kaum jemand wirbt vermutlich so stark für eine schwarz-grüne Koalition wie Bouffier. Das mag auch an seiner eigenen Erfahrung liegen: Seit 2013 regiert Bouffier zusammen mit den Grünen in Hessen.

Einerseits kommt der türkische Premier Yildirim nach Oberhausen, um für den Machtausbau seines Präsidenten zu werben

Andererseits fordert Grünen-Politiker Beck, dass Yildirim wegen Spionageverdachts festgehalten wird

Grünen-Politiker Volker Beck fordert laut einem Bericht des "Spiegels" und "Spiegel Onlines", dass die deutschen Behörden gegen den türkischen Ministerpräsidenten Binali Yildirim wegen des Verdachts der Spionage ermitteln.

Der Hintergrund: Imame des Moscheeverbands Ditib stehen unter Verdacht, auf Anweisung des türkischen Religionsministeriums Diyanet mutmaßliche Anhänger der Gülen-Bewegung in Deutschland bespitzelt zu haben. Das Amt ist Regierungschef Yildirim direkt unterstellt.

Yildirim solle bei seinem Deutschland-Besuch vernommen werden

In einem Schreiben an den Generalbundesanwalt in Karlsruhe sowie an die Staatsanwaltschaft Duisburg und die Polizei in Oberhausen verlange Beck daher, dass Yildirim überprüft werden solle.

Der "Spiegel" zitiert: Es bestehe "der Verdacht, dass sich Herr Yildirim selbst der geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit in mittelbarer Täterschaft, der Anstiftung zur geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit in mittelbarer Täterschaft oder der Beihilfe zur geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit strafbar gemacht hat". Der Generalbundesanwalt soll die Polizei bereits mit entsprechenden Ermittlungen beauftragt haben.

Beck fordere außerdem, dass Yildirim bei seinem Besuch in Deutschland am Samstag vernommen wird. Der Regierungschef will in Oberhausen für die umstrittene Verfassungsreform in der Türkei werben. Beck plädiert dafür, Yildirims Ausreise zu unterbinden, "solange dies aus strafprozessualen Gründen erforderlich ist". Der Ministerpräsident könne sich nicht auf seine Immunität berufen, da er nicht auf amtliche Einladung der Bundesrepublik gekommen sei.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Erdogan lässt Türken in vielen Ländern Europas bespitzeln

Der Grünen-Politiker Beck hatte im Dezember Strafanzeige wegen des Verdachts der geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit gegen Ditib-Imame gestellt. Außerdem soll er der Generalbundesanwaltschaft brisantes Material übermittelt haben.

Deutsch-türkisches Verhältnis litt schon unter weniger

Die Situation ist damit in zweierlei Hinsicht brisant:

Einerseits, weil viele Politiker in Deutschland entsetzt sind, dass Yildirim in Oberhausen vor etwa 10.000 Anhängern Werbung für die Verfassungsreform in der Türkei machen darf - mit der Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan noch mehr Macht an sich reißen wird. Schon jetzt ist er maßgeblich dafür verantwortlich, dass in der Türkei Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Demokratie mit Füßen getreten werden. Viele Politiker plädierten dafür, wenigstens dem Treiben in Deutschland einen Riegel vorzuschieben.

Andererseits mag man sich nicht vorstellen, was passieren würde, sollten die deutschen Behörden Yildirim tatsächlich vernehmen - so berechtigt das vielleicht aus juristischer Sicht sein mag. Es ist anzunehmen, dass massive Proteste von Yildirims Anhängern in Oberhausen die Folge wären, die möglicherweise die Sicherheitskräfte an ihre Grenzen bringen könnten.

Das Verhältnis der Bundesrepublik zur Türkei hat in der Vergangenheit schon unter deutlich harmloseren Vorfällen gelitten. Man denke etwa an den Streit um das sogenannte Schmähgedicht von Satiriker Jan Böhmermann.

(ame)El entrenador del Barcelona, Luis Enrique Martínez, ha asegurado que los resultados que se produzcan con vistas a lo que queda de temporada "no tiene nada que ver con la decisión" de continuar en el banquillo azulgrana.

El preparador asturiano, cuyo contrato con el Barcelona termina el próximo 30 de junio, ha desvelado en la rueda de prensa previa ante el Leganés que todavía no ha tomado una decisión sobre su futuro.

"Lo que pase en los próximo meses no tiene nada que ver con mi decisión", ha subrayado Luis Enrique, quien ha enfatizado que "todavía no he tomado una decisión" con respecto a su futuro.

El técnico azulgrana ha comparecido con el recuerdo del 4-0 contra el PSG todavía muy presente en el entorno: "Me afectan cero las críticas, porque sino no podría estar sentado aquí durante casi tres años. No miro ni me interesa lo que se pueda opinar. Hay una distancia considerable entre vosotros (los periodistas) y mi persona".

En cualquier caso, ha querido enviar un mensaje de optimismo al afirmar que "estamos vivos en las tres competiciones", aunque ha reconocido que en la Liga de Campeones están "un pelín tocados".

En este sentido, se ha mostrado convencido de que sus jugadores van a tener "alguna posibilidad" de remontar el partido de vuelta de los octavos de final que se disputará en el Camp Nou el próximo 8 de marzo.

"Desde el miércoles estará ese partido con el PSG en mi cabeza, cada noche y cada minuto, pero falta todavía mucho", ha avisado Luis Enrique, quien ha analizado que el 4-0 en el Parque de los Príncipes fue un "varapalo que nos ha aparecido por sorpresa".

"El rival fue superior y hay que aceptarlo y, a partir de ahí, hay que mejorar nuestro rendimiento. El resultado fue justo, incluso pudo ser mayor", ha recordado.

Busca el preparador pasar página cuanto antes y solucionar los problemas que está teniendo su equipo en superar la presión avanzada de sus rivales.

"Hay una tendencia en los últimos meses de apretarnos más, pero es cierto que no estamos encontrando soluciones", ha admitido el técnico azulgrana, quien ha puntualizado que se está trabajando para mejorar en la salida del balón.

BARCELONA-LEGANÉS

Sobre el encuentro del domingo ante el Leganés, desconoce Luis Enrique qué Leganés se encontrará, más aún después de que en el mercado de invierno el equipo madrileño haya incorporado hasta siete jugadores.

"Es una incógnita no solo porque tienen muchas variantes a nivel táctico, sino también por el hecho de haberse reforzado con tantos jugadores en el mercado de invierno. Es un equipo que genera muchas dudas, pero es algo que sucede en los partidos", ha analizado.

Para el asturiano será "un encuentro diferente" por lo sucedido en la Liga de Campeones que servirá "para ver la respuesta del equipo ante una situación difícil".

De esta manera, para intentar olvidarse de ese resultado, ha evitado mirar la televisión o escuchar la radio —"no os escucho nunca, imagínate después de un partido como el del martes. No me acerco a un televisor ni borracho. Ni a una radio", ha dicho— y asegura que se ha dedicado a jugar a parchís junto a su mujer.

"Son un tipo de declaraciones que no tengo ni comentar. Me avala mi trabajo", ha resumido Luis Enrique en respuesta a las críticas que han surgido tras el traspié sucedido en París.

Ve a nuestra portada Facebook Twitter Instagram PinterestPolemico e rabbioso fino all'ultimo, utopista e anticonformista per natura e per scelta, appassionato e vitale sotto la scorza del suo apparente cinismo. Questo era Pasquale Squitieri, nato a Napoli il 27 novembre del 1938 e scomparso oggi in una clinica romana, per complicazioni polmonari, assistito dalla moglie, l'attrice Ottavia Fusco, sposata dopo anni di convivenza nel 2013. I funerali ci saranno lunedì alle 15 nella Chiesa degli Artisti a Roma.

L'aggettivo che meglio lo definisce come artista è "fisico": il suo cinema sprigionava un vitalismo e una immediatezza espressiva che riproduceva bene la sua indole. Spesso coinvolto in battaglie d'opinione e in faziosità ideologiche, per anni venne rappresentato come "il regista con la pistola" (che si voleva portasse alla fondina come un trofeo machista), mentre il carattere celava sensibilità e timidezze mascherate dietro gli onnipresenti occhiali da sole a specchio. Straordinario motivatore e personalità carismatica, deve certamente la sua fortuna al cinema ad un linguaggio diretto e senza fronzoli che caratterizzava i suoi film, ma anche al lunghissimo sodalizio con Claudia Cardinale, prima compagna ed attrice-feticcio, poi amica e confidente inseparabile che non lo ha mai lasciato solo, anche dopo la separazione.

Nello scorso novembre, premiato alla carriera dalla rassegna assisiate "Primo piano sull'autore" seppe stupire la platea con un infervorato commiato tutto dedicato alla gratitudine per i suoi attori (Claudia in prima fila) e per i giovani, una generazione a cui è affidata - disse - la nostra sola speranza, ma che "non sappiamo proteggere dalle insidie di una società sempre più marcia e irredimibile".

Laureato in legge, assunto al Banco di Napoli, deve a un infortunio professionale (un'accusa di peculato che gli costò comunque cinque mesi di carcere) la spinta definitiva ad abbandonare il lavoro e a tuffarsi nella sua vera passione per la cultura. Fu Vittorio De Sica a scommettere su di lui nel 1969, producendo il suo lungometraggio d'esordio, "Io e Dio", permeato di un ribellismo istintivo contro la prepotenza del potere e la cecità della gente "perbene", comprese le autorità ecclesiastiche. E' il frutto dell'ondata anti-sistema del '68 che trova in Squitieri un appassionato sostenitore, fino a spingerlo su posizioni non lontane da gruppi di contestazione come "Lotta continua". Da regista sceglie invece la strada della metafora politica ammantata da cinema di genere e, con lo pseudonimo di William Redford, si lancia nello spaghetti western con due titoli di successo: "Django sfida Sartana" e il più personale "La vendetta è un piatto che si serve freddo" del 1971. Rivisti oggi, sono film che mostrano già il talento più evidente del giovane autore: linguaggio asciutto, forti sentimenti, gusto per la narrazione popolare, grandi ideali da ribelle solitario e un anarchismo di fondo che spiegherà le sue controverse posizioni politiche, dalla sinistra alla destra, fino ad un isolamento intellettuale che pagherà sempre in prima persona.

Non è quindi un caso se, abbandonato il cinema di genere, ne porterà gli elementi strutturali in racconti più personali, dedicati al Meridione, alla sua terra "destinata sempre a pagare per tutti sotto il tallone dei vincitori", narrando piaghe come il banditismo, la mafia, la camorra. Qui si mostra capace di conquistare il pubblico coi suoi film migliori: "I guappi!" (1974) con Fabio Testi, "Il prefetto di ferro" (1977) con Giuliano Gemma), fino a "Li chiamarono… briganti" (1999) con Enrico Lo Verso nei panni del discusso Carmine Crocco, condannato all'ergastolo per banditismo dopo l'Unità d'Italia e poi rivalutato dalla storiografia partenopea come eroe popolare.

Un tipico eroe perdente nel pantheon personale di Pasquale Squitieri come lo erano il Prefetto Mori (mandato dal fascismo a combattere da solo la Mafia), il pentito Ragusa del film omonimo (ispirato al caso Buscetta) e perfino lo stanco e disilluso Mussolini di "Claretta" (1984) con Rod Steiger e Claudia Cardinale. L'insuccesso di "Li chiamarono…briganti" (ritirato dalle sale in circostanze mai chiarite e accusato di revisionismo storico), chiuse a Squitieri molte porte del cinema, tanto da indurlo ad abbracciare la carriera politica nelle file di Alleanza Nazionale (e poi del Polo delle Libertà), ma non ad abbandonare la sua vena artistica. Negli anni successivi avrebbe infatti diretto ancora cinque film tra cui un vigoroso "L'avvocato Di Gregorio" sul tema delle morti bianche con un istrionico Giorgio Albertazzi e il film-testamento "L'altro Adamo" del 2014 con Lino Capolicchio e Ottavia Fusco, parabola visionaria sul futuro prossimo.

Il sociale lo appassionava da sempre, tanto da aver dedicato più di un lavoro alla piaga dell'immigrazione clandestina e a quella delle droga, fino a indurlo (verso la vecchiaia) ad abbracciare le idee radicali, iscrivendosi al partito transnazionale di Marco Pannella.

Emarginato, un po' per scelta e un po' per il carattere brusco e polemico, dall'élite intellettuale, scomodo per tutti, ma sempre difeso dal successo popolare, lascia in eredità un pugno di film da rivalutare, una figlia (nata dalla relazione con Claudia Cardinale) e un gruppo ristretto di amici e sostenitori che in lui hanno sempre riconosciuto l'onestà delle idee, la passione individualista, la voglia di non rassegnarsi mai.

Lui non ci sarà. C'era oggi, all'incontro della minoranza Pd, ma non ci sarà domani all'assemblea del Pd dove si decideranno le sorti del partito.

Massimo D'Alema, fuori da teatro Vittoria, si racconta: "Se Renzi telefona per dire che lui è d'accordo con quello che gli si propone sicuramente questo apre un processo politico che porta verso il congresso nei tempi ordinari, normali. Se Renzi vuole tirare diritto per la sua strada è chiaro che noi non possiamo accettare questa prepotenza. Le cose sono chiarissime, la questione è nelle mani del segretario del partito".

Una eventuale rottura nel Pd? gli chiedono i cronisti. "Non è colpa mia" chiosa secco l'ex premier.

Uno de esos periódicos, el Diario de Noticias de Navarra, ha protagonizado la atención de muchos usuarios de Twitter por su peculiar forma de titular la sentencia de la Audiencia Provincial de Palma, que condenó a seis años de prisión a Iñaki Urdangarin, y multó con 256.000 euros a su mujer, la infanta Cristina.

Er sieht auch die CSU nicht als Hindernis für Schwarz-Grün im Bund

Für Bundeskanzlerin Merkel sind die Grünen aber offenbar nicht der bevorzugt Partner

Hessens Ministerpräsident Volker Bouffier (CDU) ist bekannt als Freund von Schwarz -Grün. Schon im November hatte er sich für ein Bündnis mit den Grünen ausgesprochen - jetzt hat er seine Forderung wiederholt. Die Union muss sich ein schwarz-grünes Bündnis als Option für den Bund offenhalten, sagte er dem "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".

Die Union müsse bei der Bundestagswahl so stark werden, dass gegen sie nicht regiert werden könne, sagte der stellvertretende Bundesvorsitzende.

"Ich werbe für Offenheit"

"Und dann sollten wir mit einem Partner zusammen eine Regierung bilden können, die nicht wieder aus einer großen Koalition besteht", sagte Bouffier. Hessen habe gezeigt, dass ein schwarz-grünes Bündnis funktioniere. "Deshalb werbe ich für Offenheit bei der Union." CDU und CSU müssten "darauf achten, dass man sich nicht strategisch die Wege verbaut".

NOUVEAU! SURLIGNE ET PARTAGE

PRESIDENTIELLE 2017 - Déjà en délicatesse avec le Parlement européen, qui lui réclame le remboursement des sommes allouées à ses assistants parlementaires, Marine Le Pen est aussi attaquée pour son absentéisme chronique aux sessions de l'Assemblée de Strasbourg. Pourtant bien présente mercredi dernier pour voter contre le traité de libre-échange avec le Canada (Ceta), la candidate du Front national à l'élection présidentielle a brillé par son absence le lendemain lors de l'examen d'un texte qui intéresse pourtant au premier plan sa campagne électorale.

Objectif de ce règlement adopté à une très large majorité des eurodéputés: rendre obligatoire le contrôle et le recoupement des documents d'identité de tout citoyen européen et des étrangers souhaitant entrer ou sortir de l'espace Schengen. Une réforme profonde de l'étanchéité des frontières européennes, que le Front national décrit régulièrement comme des "passoires" (par exemple ici, ici ou encore là), et qui vise "à ériger un puissant bouclier contre le terrorisme en Europe" en interdisant son accès aux combattants étrangers.

Le nouveau système de contrôle doit notamment permettre aux autorités européennes de s'assurer que des personnes ne pénètrent pas sur le territoire communautaire grâce à des papiers volés ou détournés. Les contrôles seront obligatoires à toutes les frontières aériennes, maritimes et terrestres, tant à l'entrée qu'à la sortie.

Un texte qui aurait dû légitimement s'attirer les grâces du Front national qui a fait du contrôle aux frontières et de la maîtrise de la liberté de circulation l'alpha et l'omega de sa stratégie anti-terroriste. Or non seulement Marine Le Pen ne s'est pas présentée au vote mais ses amis présents dans l'hémicycle ont oscillé entre abstention et vote contre, selon le relevé du Lab d'Europe1.

"On vote pour renforcer les frontières européennes et lutter contre la menace terroriste : Mme Le Pen n'est pas là, certains dans sa délégation votent contre, d'autres s'abstiennent. Naïvement, nous avons cru que Schengen et la lutte contre le terrorisme étaient un sujet important pour eux. Mandats fictifs?", ont ironisé les eurodéputés socialistes français dans un communiqué.

Die Außenminister Russlands und der Ukraine unterstützen einen neuen Anlauf für eine Waffenruhe von kommenden Montag an in der Ostukraine.

Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers believes the Earth is flat.

To be sure, planet Earth is round. But during a Friday podcast hosted by his teammates Channing Frye and Richard Jefferson, Irving declared that the Earth is flat.

“This is not even a conspiracy theory. The Earth is flat,” Irving said, urging people to do their research on the matter. The point guard blamed “them” for lying to us but did not clarify who “they” are.

“What it really came down to for me,” Irving explains, “was everything that was particularly thrown in front of me, I had to be like, ‘OK, this is all a facade, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in that is true or whether or not or whatever.’”

(If you can stomach it, you can hear more of his explanation here, starting at the 15:00 mark.)

His flat Earther remarks were so strange they trended on Twitter later that day. Obviously, ESPN writer Arash Markazi had to ask him about it later that night.

“What’s your thoughts on that?” Markazi asked, failing to hold back his laughter.

“I think people should do their own research,” Kyrie reiterated to Markazi. “Hopefully they’ll either back my belief or throw it in the water.”

La Russie a prôné samedi à Munich un ordre mondial "post-occidental", au moment même où les Etats-Unis réaffirmaient leur alliance à une Europe déstabilisée par l’arrivée de Donald Trump.

S'exprimant à la Conférence pour la sécurité de Munich qui réunit un parterre de dirigeants étrangers dont le vice-président américain Mike Pence, M. Lavrov a annoncé la fin de "l'ordre mondial libéral" conçu selon lui par "une élite d'Etats" occidentaux à visées dominatrices.

"Les dirigeants responsables doivent faire un choix. J'espère que ce choix sera celui d'un ordre mondial démocratique et juste. Si vous voulez, appelez le +post-west+", a ajouté l'homme de confiance de Vladimir Poutine, qualifiant au passage l'Otan de "vestige de la Guerre Froide".

Son discours intervenait quelques heures après la première allocution internationale du vice-président américain Mike Pence, qui a, lui, réaffirmé la validité de l'alliance transatlantique.

Dans le climat d'incertitude qui entoure l'ordre international et particulièrement l'avenir des relations russo-américaines sous Donald Trump, M. Lavrov a proposé à Washington des "relations pragmatiques de respect mutuel".

"Le potentiel de coopération dans les domaines politique, économique, humanitaire est énorme, mais il doit encore être réalisé, nous y sommes ouverts dans la mesure où les Etats-Unis le sont", a-t-il ajouté.

Dans son discours samedi matin, le vice-président américain a pour sa part évoqué très brièvement la relation russo-américaine, avant tout pour rassurer les Européens.

"Sachez que les Etats-Unis continueront de demander des comptes à la Russie, même si nous cherchons des terrains d'entente. Comme vous le savez le président Trump pense que c’est possible", a-t-il dit.

'Partager le fardeau'

Donald Trump avait déstabilisé ses partenaires en souhaitant bruyamment un rapprochement avec Vladimir Poutine.

En visite en Europe cette semaine, son secrétaire d'Etat et le chef du Pentagone ont tempéré ces velléités, au risque d'impatienter Moscou et d'accroître le flou sur les intentions réelles de Washington.

Calme et posé, M. Pence a ainsi réaffirmé que les Etats-Unis seraient toujours "le plus grand allié" des Européens, et assuré de l'engagement inébranlable des Etats-Unis dans l'Otan.

Mais il a aussi fermement réitéré les exigences américaines d'un engagement financier plus important de ses partenaires, censés consacrer 2% de leur PIB aux dépenses militaires.

"La promesse de partager le fardeau n'a pas été remplie depuis bien trop longtemps", y compris "par nos plus grands alliés", a-t-il dit, visant implicitement l'Allemagne et la France.

"Le président Trump attend de ses alliés qu'ils tiennent leur parole. Le temps est venu de faire plus", a-t-il martelé.

Poliment, des ministres européens ont rétorqué que l'Europe contribuait aussi à la stabilité du monde par l'aide au développement.

En outre "quel intérêt d'atteindre les 2% quand on ne peut pas payer les retraites", s'est interrogé le chef de la diplomatie allemande Sigmar Gabriel, citant l'exemple emblématique de la Grèce.

Le ministre français des Affaires étrangères, Jean-Marc Ayrault, a lui regretté sur Twitter que M. Pence n'ait pas dit "un mot sur l'UE", un sujet sur lequel il était attendu, M. Trump ayant par le passé loué le Brexit et semblé souhaiter un éclatement de l'Union européenne.

Ukraine et hackers

En ouvrant la journée samedi, la chancelière allemande Angela Merkel a pour sa part lancé un appel au multilatéralisme pour faire face à des défis immenses comme le jihadisme ou la crise migratoire.

Si elle a tendu la main à la Russie dans la lutte contre le terrorisme, elle a de nouveau plaidé la "fermeté" sur l'Ukraine, dossier qui empoisonne les relations entre l'Occident et Moscou.

La chef de la diplomatie de l'Union européenne Federica Mogherini a répété que les sanctions imposées à la Russie seraient levées lorsque les accords de paix de Minsk seraient appliqués.

Répliquant à "sa bonne amie" Mogherini, Sergueï Lavrov a martelé la position russe selon laquelle Kiev était le principal responsable de la non application des accords.

Enfin, interrogé sur les accusations de piratage de la Russie dans la campagne électorale pour la présidentielle française, M. Lavrov a répliqué qu'il voulait "voir des faits".

Former Manchester United footballer Dwight Yorke has said he was “made to feel like a criminal” when he was denied entry to the US.

The 45-year-old said he was stopped from boarding the aircraft in Qatar, which was flying to Miami on Thursday.

Yorke said a red flag came up against his name because his passport showed he had visited Iran.

Mike Egerton/EMPICS Sport Dwight Yorke said he was 'made to feel like a criminal' when he was denied entry to the US.

“I couldn’t quite believe what was happening. I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal,” Yorke told The Sun.

He said he had bought his ticket, checked in and was about to board the flight when he was stopped by two officials.

The former footballer said he was told there was a problem with his visa due to the Iranian stamp in his passport.

“I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn’t even stay overnight,” Yorke said.

Yorke said he was told that if he got on the flight he “would simply be deported back to Qatar” once he arrived in the US.

Richard Keys, who works for BeIn Sports with Yorke, slammed the incident as “crazy”.

Well done @realDonaldTrump. Man U ambassador Dwight Yorke denied transit access to Miami cause he has Iranian stamp in passport. #crazy — Richard Keys (@richardajkeys) February 17, 2017

In January Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending the US’s refugee program and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

These include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Yorke is not the first sportsman to speak out about Trump’s contentious travel ban.

Last month British Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah, who has lived in Oregon for six years, said the ban was “deeply troubling”.

Farah, who is originally from Somalia, said the US President’s policy “comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice”.

He added: “Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome.”Cristiano Ronaldo ha protagonizado una de las grandes jugadas del partido entre el Real Madrid y el Espanyol que este sábado se ha disputado en el Santiago Bernabéu.

The Real Time host questioned why Republicans were so willing to give those with the “magic” capital R after their name such an easy ride.

The presenter said that, had a member of the Democrat party made such derogatory comments about the US, the Republicans would have been highly critical of them.

Maher said:

“I’ve got to say to all you flag waving right-wingers who are always say ‘I’m not just gonna stand her and let you run down America’, you’re standing there and letting Trump run down America.”

“When Trump said ‘I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t loose voters, he wasn’t making a joke. He’s never made a joke unless his entire life is some sort of Andy Coffman-style performance, in which case stop it. No, he was simply stating an actual fact for once, which is if you have the magic ‘R’ after your name you can drive a hummer through a daycare centre and Fox News will say the babies were asking for it.”

“America is the Republican party’s bitch and they can criticise and betray her but you can’t.”

“Why do Republicans get away with this? Why do they have patriotic immunity? America is like a dysfunctional family where the Democrats are the older, mature son who works hard and does everything right, but somehow is never good enough. And the Republicans are the young asshole son who’s a fuck up no matter how many times he crashes the Camaro, daddy buys him a new one.”

RSPCA inspector Justin Stubbs said: “I have never seen anything like it, it was just a sea of yellow. And the noise was unbelievable.

“The chicks are only about a day old and are really tiny and quite delicate. Some of the birds were dead or dying when we arrived so some, sadly, had to be humanely put to sleep.

“Thankfully, most of the chicks did not appear to be suffering.”

RSPCA It is believed the chicks came from a commercial chick producer nearby.

“The breeder came to the scene to collect the surviving birds and take them back to their unit,” Stubbs added.

“These tiny birds wouldn’t have survived long out on their own at such a young age and in such unpredictable weather conditions.

“For someone to dump these vulnerable chicks is unbelievable.

Bruce Springsteen (67, "Born To Run") hat bei einem Konzert in Brisbane, Australien, einen Fan auf die Bühne geholt, um mit ihm gemeinsam einen Song zu performen. Der Jugendliche soll mit einem Plakat zuvor auf sich aufmerksam gemacht haben. Darauf stand: "Fehle gerade in der Schule... Kann ich 'Growin' Up' mit dir spielen?" Springsteen habe den Teenager dann zu sich geholt und mit ihm sein Lied auf der Gitarre gespielt.

Laut der australischen Zeitung "Sydney Morning Herald" stand der Junge namens Nathan Testa (14) schon einmal mit seinem Idol gemeinsam auf der Bühne. 2013, als Nathan erst elf Jahre alt war, performte er am gleichen Ort mit ihm "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" und stahl Springsteen dabei die Show. Nathan ist allerdings nicht der einzige Fan, den der "Thunder Road"-Sänger gerne mal auf die Bühne holt. Springsteen gibt immer mal wieder jemanden die Chance, mit ihm zu singen. Bis Ende Februar tourt die Rocklegende noch durch Australien und Neuseeland.

Sie sind ein Fan von Bruce Springsteen? Kaufen Sie hier sein "Greatest Hits"-AlbumÈ bella, sorridente. Il suo volto sembra disteso. Tutta la bellezza di Angelina Jolie sta in queste foto, le prime scattate dopo il divorzio con Brad. Con lei ci sono i sei figli che l'hanno accompagnata ad Angkor per la presentazione del suo nuovo film. Una pellicola che racconta una pagina tragica della storia cambogiana: i crimini commessi dai Khmer rossi durante il loro breve ma sanguinoso regime tra il 1975 e il 1979.

All'anteprima dell'opera - il cui titolo è "Prima hanno ucciso mio padre" - hanno assistito il re cambogiano Norodom Sihamoni e centinaia di sopravvissuti al regime. Il film è l'adattamento di un libro eponimo scritto dalla militante dei diritti umani loung ung, nel quale vengono ricordati gli orrori del regime di pol pot.

Che arrivano da Siem Reap, Cambogia. L'attrice sorride, il suo volto è disteso, sembra serena, circondata dai suoi sei bambini. Per la 41enne è la prima apparizione pubblica dopo la richiesta di divorzio da Brad Pitt, datata settembre 2016.

Loung ung aveva cinque anni quando i Khmer Rossi presero Phnom Penh e poté osservare il dramma della sua famiglia, prima di fuggire negli stati uniti.

Sotto il dominio di Pol Pot due milioni di cambogiani, un quarto della popolazione, perse la vita per le torture, la fame, le esecuzioni. Migliaia di fosse comuni sono state scoperte dopo la loro caduta, vittime di un'interpretazione atrocemente utopica del marxismo.

Durante una conferenza stampa a Siem Reap, Angelina Jolie ha affermato che la Cambogia è la sua "seconda patria" e ha detto di aver scelto di adattare il libro di Loung Ung perché voleva raccontare il periodo dei Khmer rossi "con gli occhi di un bambino". Ha inoltre rivelato che il film le ha permesso di sentirsi più vicina al figlio adottivo, che ha visitato con lei i meravigliosi templi patrimonio mondiale dell'umanità.

I sei figli della diva, tre dei quali adottivi, erano al fianco della madre durante la visita e anche all'udienza che re Norodom ha concesso all'attrice e regista. "Ho voluto mettere l'accento non solo sulla guerra, ma anche sull'amore della famiglia e sulla bellezza del paese, e ho voluto in realtà capire cosa i genitori biologici di mio figlio possano aver passato. Volevo conoscerli meglio, conoscere meglio il loro paese".

Questo è il secondo film diretto da Agelina jolie, dopo "nella terra del sangue e del miele", la storia di un amore distrutto dalla guerra in Bosnia. Jolie ha ottenuto la cittadinanza cambogiana. Nel 2002 ha adottato il suo primo figlio, Maddox, che si trovava in un orfanotrofio della provincia di Battambag, nella parte occidentale della Cambogia. La star ha spiegato che il figlio l'ha spinta a girare questo film.

Papa David Beckham macht Fortschritte

Wenn Sie nach David Beckham duften wollen, sind Sie hier richtig

Die berühmte Familie von Designerin und Ex-Spice-Girl Victoria Beckham (42) und Fußball-Star David Beckham (41) macht gerade in Kanada Winterurlaub. Dort wurde Brooklyn bereits von Paparazzi mit Armbinde abgelichtet. Für ihn ist der sportliche Teil des Urlaubs vorüber. Sein Vater hingegen freut sich über die Fortschritte, die er auf dem Snowboard macht, wie auf seinem Instagram-Account zu sehen ist.

Zu einem Clip, der ihn in Aktion zeigt, schrieb er: "Tag 4 und ich muss sagen, langsam habe ich es raus... Eines der Dinge, die ich immer tun wollte und jetzt endlich darf..." Zu seiner Zeit als Profi-Fußballer war die Verletzungsgefahr sicher zu groß. Auch Romeo (14), Cruz (11) und die fünfjährige Harper scheinen sich mit ihren Eltern bestens in Kanada zu amüsieren.

El preparador asturiano, cuyo contrato con el Barcelona termina el próximo 30 de junio, ha desvelado en la rueda de prensa previa ante el Leganés que todavía no ha tomado una decisión sobre su futuro.

"Lo que pase en los próximo meses no tiene nada que ver con mi decisión", ha subrayado Luis Enrique, quien ha enfatizado que "todavía no he tomado una decisión" con respecto a su futuro.

El técnico azulgrana ha comparecido con el recuerdo del 4-0 contra el PSG todavía muy presente en el entorno: "Me afectan cero las críticas, porque sino no podría estar sentado aquí durante casi tres años. No miro ni me interesa lo que se pueda opinar. Hay una distancia considerable entre vosotros (los periodistas) y mi persona".

En cualquier caso, ha querido enviar un mensaje de optimismo al afirmar que "estamos vivos en las tres competiciones", aunque ha reconocido que en la Liga de Campeones están "un pelín tocados".

En este sentido, se ha mostrado convencido de que sus jugadores van a tener "alguna posibilidad" de remontar el partido de vuelta de los octavos de final que se disputará en el Camp Nou el próximo 8 de marzo.

"Desde el miércoles estará ese partido con el PSG en mi cabeza, cada noche y cada minuto, pero falta todavía mucho", ha avisado Luis Enrique, quien ha analizado que el 4-0 en el Parque de los Príncipes fue un "varapalo que nos ha aparecido por sorpresa".

"El rival fue superior y hay que aceptarlo y, a partir de ahí, hay que mejorar nuestro rendimiento. El resultado fue justo, incluso pudo ser mayor", ha recordado.

Busca el preparador pasar página cuanto antes y solucionar los problemas que está teniendo su equipo en superar la presión avanzada de sus rivales.

"Hay una tendencia en los últimos meses de apretarnos más, pero es cierto que no estamos encontrando soluciones", ha admitido el técnico azulgrana, quien ha puntualizado que se está trabajando para mejorar en la salida del balón.

BARCELONA-LEGANÉS

Sobre el encuentro del domingo ante el Leganés, desconoce Luis Enrique qué Leganés se encontrará, más aún después de que en el mercado de invierno el equipo madrileño haya incorporado hasta siete jugadores.

"Es una incógnita no solo porque tienen muchas variantes a nivel táctico, sino también por el hecho de haberse reforzado con tantos jugadores en el mercado de invierno. Es un equipo que genera muchas dudas, pero es algo que sucede en los partidos", ha analizado.

Para el asturiano será "un encuentro diferente" por lo sucedido en la Liga de Campeones que servirá "para ver la respuesta del equipo ante una situación difícil".

De esta manera, para intentar olvidarse de ese resultado, ha evitado mirar la televisión o escuchar la radio —"no os escucho nunca, imagínate después de un partido como el del martes. No me acerco a un televisor ni borracho. Ni a una radio", ha dicho— y asegura que se ha dedicado a jugar a parchís junto a su mujer.

"Son un tipo de declaraciones que no tengo ni comentar. Me avala mi trabajo", ha resumido Luis Enrique en respuesta a las críticas que han surgido tras el traspié sucedido en París.

Oh, this is good.

In the video above by Cut, several couples openly talk about the first time they had sex together. And not only do these lovebirds get super detailed for five minutes, they have some pretty hilarious stories, too.

"I think he kicked the dog out, shut the door," one woman said. "[Shut] the curtains so the dog couldn't even look in, go play with the squirrels," her partner replied.

And it gets better.

But first-time sex isn't always picture perfect.

It can be nerve-wracking, embarrassing and for many, hard to achieve orgasm. And remember, there is always some type of awkwardness involved.

"If your relationship is casual, and you spend a lot of time and effort setting the mood for the first time, you might be setting yourself up for more awkwardness,” sex therapist Vanessa Marin says. "Make a few jokes, acknowledge the awkwardness, then try to enjoy your time together."

Communication is key, and like always, practice makes perfect.

But the video also makes something else very clear: sex with your significant other changes over time.

Whether you have kids or just a different kind of connection, it's clear sex means something completely different than it did when you first got together.

NOUVEAU! SURLIGNE ET PARTAGE

PRESIDENTIELLE 2017 - Non, Benoît Hamon n'est pas seulement venu parler union de la gauche au Portugal. En déplacement ce samedi à Lisbonne, le vainqueur de la primaire socialiste a réitéré sa promesse de légaliser le cannabis s'il est élu président de la République, prenant exemple sur le Portugal, pays pionnier en matière de dépénalisation de toutes les drogues, y compris les plus dures.

"La légalisation du cannabis est un moyen de tuer les trafics, plutôt que les trafics tuent", a déclaré le député des Yvelines à l'issue d'une rencontre d'environ une heure avec João Goulão, directeur de l'organisme qui chapeaute l'opération, la Sicad. Se disant "déterminé sur ce sujet", mais aussi respectueux et prudent, Benoît Hamon a expliqué que sa proposition de légaliser le cannabis "supposera un travail spécifique, auquel le ministère de la Santé devra se consacrer" et qu'il ne se lancerait pas dans le processus "la fleur au fusil".

En clair: "Ce n'est pas en 2018 qu'on aura des débits de cannabis partout sur le territoire", s'est-il amusé en mimant un claquement de doigts.

Comment le Portugal a divisé par deux la consommation d'héroïne

A ceux qui s'opposent à toute évolution législative au nom du rejet des drogues, l'ancien ministre de l'Education oppose une posture de pragmatisme. "C'est bien de dire moralement 'non'. Mais encore? On laisse notre jeunesse en contact avec des dealers qui peuvent leur vendre des drogues dures, dans un système qui ne protège pas, mais qui impose", a-t-il détaillé.Le candidat prône, comme l'a fait le Portugal, une politique d'accompagnement doublée d'un gros effort de prévention.

Le Portugal a choisi en 2001 de décriminaliser aussi les drogues dures en raison d'une très forte consommation - notamment d'héroïne - qui concernait alors jusqu'à 1% de la population. Concrètement, a expliqué João Goulão, l'usage n'est plus illégal et les consommateurs disposent de possibilités de prise en charge, médicale, ou sociale et psychologique.

Outre une division par deux des consommateurs d'héroïne, le Portugal compte aujourd'hui selon cet ancien médecin, devenu une référence sur la question dans le pays, seulement quelque 5000 personnes hors du système de prise en charge. Soulignant l'unanimité politique, il s'est félicité que ce soit le fruit d'une "politique d'État, davantage qu'une politique de gouvernement".

"La légalisation du cannabis, c'est un État qui dit : 'nous avons un problème de santé publique, avec une augmentation de la consommation, notamment chez les jeunes, il faut une prise en charge plus forte et libérer les forces de police pour des tâches plus importantes'", a argumenté l'ancien ministre de l'Éducation, qui n'envisage pas d'étendre sa proposition à l'ensemble des drogues.

"C'est parce que je pense qu'il est dangereux de se droguer qu'il faut légaliser", a-t-il ajouté.

Très fortes réticences en France

L'idée est pourtant loin de faire l'unanimité en France. Hormis Jean-Luc Mélenchon (France insoumise) et Yannick Jadot (EELV), le député de Paris est le seul candidat à défendre frontalement une légalisation du cannabis pour en maîtriser les coûts sociaux et sanitaires tout en libérant les forces de police d'une répression qui capte une grande part de leur temps de travail.

A l'inverse, le vainqueur de la primaire de la droite François Fillon et la candidate du Front national Marine Le Pen s'opposent résolument à toute évolution législative sur le sujet.

De son côté, Emmanuel Macron s'est prononcé dans son livre "Révolution" en faveur d'une contraventionnalisation du délit de possession de cannabis, ce qui éviterait des peines de prison aux consommateurs. Mais dans un entretien récent au Figaro, le candidat En Marche! a semblé durcir son approche en affirmant ne pas croire "à la dépénalisation des 'petites doses' ni aux peines symboliques. Cela ne change rien".

Malgré ce flou, son entourage a précisé au HuffPost que l'ancien ministre de l'Economie, s'il est élu à l'Elysée, fera bien passer le délit de possession de cannabis à une simple contravention.

La question de la légalisation, qui implique que l'Etat contrôle également la production et la distribution du cannabis, est toutefois loin de convaincre tout le monde au sein même du Parti socialiste. Manuel Valls s'y était lui-même frontalement opposé. Interrogé sur les débats pendant la primaire autour de cette question, Benoît Hamon a rappelé qu'il l'avait "emporté avec près de 60% des voix". "Maintenant, je suis dans la présidentielle, je veux me projeter vers l'avant, ce qui m'importe aujourd'hui, c'est de parler aux Français, pas aux dirigeants du Parti socialiste", s'est-il agacé.

La Chine va cesser ses importations de charbon de Corée du Nord jusqu'à fin 2017, durcissant sa position après un nouveau test de missile et privant Pyongyang d'une source cruciale de revenus qui lui rapportait plus d'un milliard de dollars par an.

"La Chine va cesser momentanément ses importations de charbon en provenance de Corée du Nord pour le reste de l'année", a indiqué samedi le ministère chinois du Commerce.

Cette suspension, qui débutera dimanche et s'appliquera jusqu'au 31 décembre, concerne aussi les cargaisons en attente d'un examen aux douanes.

Ce durcissement intervient peu après l'essai par Pyongyang de son missile balistique Pukguksong-2: celui-ci a parcouru dimanche dernier 500 kilomètres avant de retomber en mer du Japon, suscitant de vives réactions en Asie comme à Washington.

Le lendemain, Kim Jong-Nam, demi-frère en disgrâce du dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-Un, était assassiné en Malaise. Réputé apprécié par Pékin, il vivait en exil en territoire chinois, à Macao.

Pour Koh Yu-Hwan, professeur à l'université sud-coréenne Dongguk, ces deux épisodes ont pu exaspérer Pékin, déjà irrité de voir son turbulent voisin accélérer le développement de son programme nucléaire à visée militaire.

'Provocations'

"La Chine a pu vouloir lancer un avertissement, après les provocations que constituent ce dernier lancement de missile et le meurtre de Kim Jong-Nam (où nombre d'observateurs suspectent la main de Pyongyang, ndlr)", explique Koh Yu-Hwan à l'AFP.

"C'est également un geste de bonne volonté à l'égard de Washington, le signe que Pékin accomplit bien sa part d'efforts pour endiguer la Corée du Nord", poursuit-il.

Les Etats-Unis avaient accentué la pression vendredi: le secrétaire d'Etat américain Rex Tillerson, qui rencontrait son homologue chinois Wang Yi pour la première fois, avait appelé Pékin à oeuvrer "par tous les moyens" à "modérer" son voisin.

De fait, la Chine, unique allié de Pyongyang et son principal soutien diplomatique, lui fournit un soutien économique vital, mais cache de moins en moins son agacement face à l'intransigeance de Kim Jong-Un.

Celui-ci n'a toujours pas visité la Chine, cinq ans après son arrivée au pouvoir.

En lançant son missile juste après un entretien téléphonique conciliant entre le nouveau président américain Donald Trump et son homologue chinois Xi Jinping, Pyongyang "a pu tenter d'attiser la discorde entre les deux puissances", souligne Wang Dong, expert géopolitique de l'Université de Pékin.

Mais, selon lui, "vu le caractère éminemment provocateur de ce missile, la Chine s'est résolue à agir pour marquer sa nette opposition".

La suspension des importations chinoises dévoilée samedi représente un coup dur pour les finances de Pyongyang, qui verra disparaître une cruciale source de devises.

Resserrer l'étau

En 2016, la Chine avait importé 22,5 millions de tonnes de charbon nord-coréen (une hausse de 15% sur un an), pour un montant total avoisinant 1,19 milliard de dollars, selon les douanes chinoises.

La suspension annoncée samedi est destinée à "appliquer la résolution 2321 du Conseil de sécurité des Nations unies", a insisté Pékin. Adoptée le 30 novembre, celle-ci resserrait l'étau des sanctions internationales contre Pyongyang en raison de son programme nucléaire.

La résolution plafonnait notamment les ventes nord-coréennes de charbon à 400,9 millions de dollars (ou 7,5 millions de tonnes) par an à partir de 2017, une réduction de 62% par rapport à 2015.

Pékin avait alors suspendu à partir du 11 décembre, pour trois semaines, ses importations --ce qui ne les avait pas empêcher de bondir de 13% sur un an pour l'ensemble de décembre. Et le commerce avait de nouveau repris début janvier.

Sous le précédent régime de sanctions, le Conseil de sécurité autorisait les achats de charbon et minerai de fer de Corée du Nord pourvu que les recettes ne servent pas à financer son programme nucléaire. Ce qui permettait à Pékin d'accroître ses importations en arguant de sa bonne foi.

La Chine semble toujours prête à manier autant la carotte que le bâton.

En marge d'un G20, Wang Yi, chef de la diplomatie chinoise, a ainsi plaidé vendredi pour une reprise des négociations à Six (les deux Corées, Japon, Russie, Chine et Etats-Unis), estimant qu'il fallait briser le cercle vicieux des essais nucléaires et des sanctions.

Roberto Baggio compie 50 anni e la festa è con i terremotati di Amatrice. L'ex campione di calcio, accompagnato dal presidente dell'Amatrice Calcio, Tito Capriccioli, sta incontrando i bambini del comune reatino colpito dal sisma della scorsa estate nella mensa di Campo Lazio, dove è in corso la festa del Carnevale. Baggio ha incontrato anche il sindaco Sergio Pirozzi. Una scelta maturata in sordina una settimana fa, lontano dai riflettori, che lo porta nelle zone di Amatrice e Norcia, colpite dalla sequenza sismica a partire dal 24 agosto. Il fuoriclasse di Caldogno è partito in mattinata insieme alla sua famiglia: prima tappa all'interno del piccolo container che dopo il sisma ospita l'ufficio del sindaco di Amatrice, Sergio Pirozzi.

Dopo Amatrice, Roberto Baggio sarà anche nella città terremotata di Norcia nella giornata in cui festeggia il suo 50mo compleanno. La conferma arriva da Alberto Allegrini, vicepresidente della pro loco di Norcia, dove Baggio è atteso per le 19. Qui, nella tensostruttura della Protezione civile che fino a pochi giorni fa ospitava la mensa per gli sfollati, è stata organizzata per le 21 una cerimonia per festeggiare il Pallone d'oro, con tanto di torta e candeline.

Domani Baggio dovrebbe stare di nuovo a Norcia, per una visita al centro storico della città e per dare il calcio d'inizio di una partita amichevole tra giovani calciatori del posto.La sentencia del 'caso Nóos' copa este sábado todas las portadas de los principales periódicos de tirada nacional, local y regional.

박지원 국민의당 대표는 18일 "탄핵 인용 후 혼란과 불안은 '문재인 공포증'을 가져오고 후보 비교우위론으로도 국민의당이 승리한다"고 말했다.



박 대표는 이날 자신의 페이스북을 통해 "대세론으로 오만하거나 역선택 운운하며 계산하지 말라. 국민은 알파고 국민"이라며 이렇게 밝혔다.



박 대표는 "민주당은 문재인 전 대표, 안희정 충남도지사, 이재명 성남시장, 최성 고양시장, 박원순 서울시장, 김부겸 의원 등 여섯 후보 덕분에 흥행에 성공했고 국민의당은 사실상 안철수 전 상임공동대표 한 사람으로 흥행이 없었다"고 말했다.



이어 박 대표는 "반기문 전 유엔 사무총장을 보았기에 황교안 대통령권한대행 국무총리는 후보가 아니고 자유한국당과 바른정당 후보는 의미있는 후보가 아니다"라고 평가했다.



그러면서 "당은 두자리 숫자, 안 전 대표는 한자리 두자리 숫자를 오르락내리락하며 미세한 상승세를 보고 손학규 전 대표의 입당은 불을 붙였다"며 "본선은 안(안철수), 손(손학규), 천(천정배)과 문 전 대표의 대결"이라고 했다.Ursprünglich wollte der Amerikaner Michael Glidden nur mit seinen Hunden die Gegend rund um den „Chugach National Forest“ im US-Bundesstaat Alaska erkunden.

(ame)Two new tease-trailers have appeared for the much-anticipated new series of ‘Twin Peaks’, and keen-eyed fans will soon recognise the footage.

Both trailers have been carved from scenes from the original series, aired in 1990, which saw Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) sent to the northwestern town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of Laura Palmer.

The first trailer revisits one of the show’s most famous scenes, when Cooper smashed his head against a mirror, and saw that he had been transformed into the mysterious ‘Bob’ (this takes a huge amount of explaining, you’ll just need to revisit the original series to get across this as well as the multitudes of other bizarre happenings).

A tag line in the new trailer then tells us ‘It’s Happening Again’, before present-day Kyle steps into shot.

The second trailer similarly retraces steps to the original series, with footage of the unwrapping of Laura Palmer’s body, accompanied by the same tag-line.

The new series picks up 25 years after the inhabitants of this quaint, picturesque town were stunned when their beautiful homecoming queen was murdered.

The new series will be once again directed by David Lynch, and set to comprise 18 episodes.

Many of the original cast members are also on board - as well as Kyle MacLachlan, David Duchovny will be returning, as well as Sherilyn Fenn.

Catherine E. Coulson, who played the memorable Log Lady, died in 2015, but the Log Lady will in fact be part of the new series, as the actress had already filmed several scenes.

Angelo Badalamenti, whose haunting theme music contributed so much to the atmosphere of the piece, is also in place as the show’s music composer.

The original show, which won a catalogue of Awards, including a Grammy for its theme, has attracted a cult following ever since and been credited by TV directors ever since for its influence, for showing what was possible to achieve on the small screen.

Twin Peaks airs Monday 22 May 2am on Sky Atlantic, the same time as the US premiere and repeats Tuesday 23 May 9pm. Catch up with series 1 and 2 on Sky Box Sets and NOW TV.

ABC Photo Archives via Getty ImagesUS-Vizepräsident Pence soll bei der Sicherheitskonferenz keinen Kopfhörer für eine Übersetzung getragen haben, als Kanzlerin Merkel sprach

Präsident Trump hatte sich vor Kurzem genauso verhalten

Es ist nur ein Detail. Aber eines, das Wirbel ausgelöst hat.

Am Samstag ist US-Vizepräsident Mike Pence während der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz zum ersten Mal auf Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) getroffen. In ihrer Rede hatte die Kanzlerin sich für internationale Zusammenarbeit ausgesprochen und betont, wie wichtig die USA für Europa im Anti-Terror-Kampf seien.

Als Pence den Worten der Kanzlerin lauschte, fehlte da aber etwas: der Stöpsel im Ohr, über den Pence den Dolmetscher gehört hätte. Einer Journalistin des SWR und der ARD fiel dieses Detail auf und teilte über den Kurznachrichten ein Bild vom Vizepräsidenten als Beleg:

US-Vizepräsident Pence verfolgt Merkel Rede ohne Übersetzung. Versteht er deutsch oder interessiert es ihn nicht? pic.twitter.com/Z9ZuqdBv9B — sabrina fritz (@FritzUSA) 18. Februar 2017

Genau wie sein Chef

Kann Pence womöglich Deutsch und braucht daher keinen Übersetzer, der in sein Ohr flüstert? Über die Fremdsprachenkenntnisse des Vizepräsidenten ist zumindest nichts bekannt. Die Journalistin stellt daher auch die Frage in den Raum: Interessiert Pence die Rede von Merkel vielleicht gar nicht?

Was die Beobachtung umso bemerkenswerter macht: Auch US-Präsident Donald Trump war kürzlich aufgefallen, als er beim Besuch von Japans Premier Shinzo Abe auf einer Pressekonferenz keinen Kopfhörertrug. Seine Erklärung damals: Er sei über den Inhalt von Abes Rede informiert gewesen.

Vielleicht wusste also auch Pence schon vorab, was die Kanzlerin sagen würde. Oder er konnte es sich denken.

(sk)Han pasado 12 años desde que se emitió el último episodio de la popular serie de humor Friends y todavía siguen apareciendo nuevas teorías sobre ella.

La última, la que desarrolla la web Digital Spy, tiene que ver con Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) y con un 'cameo', el del actor Brent Spiner, conocido por dar vida al comandante Data en la serie Star Trek.

Según esta teoría, Joey Tribbiani podría no ser un personaje de ficción sino una persona real.

Lo que leen. Y el enlace de toda esta teoría es Spiner, quien apareció en el decimocuarto episodio de la décima temporada, El de Princesa Consuela, interpretando a James Campbell, el hombre que queda en un restaurante con Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) para entrevistarla para la firma de moda Gucci. La mala suerte para Rachel es que en el mismo restaurante está su actual jefe, al que no le había comentado nada sobre dicha entrevista.

Pues bien, en Joey, el 'spin-off' de Friends dedicado a Joey Tribbiani, también aparece Spiner, pero esta vez interpretándose a sí mismo.

¿Qué puede significar esto? Según Digital Spy, si Spiner aparece interpretándose a sí mismo, eso quiere decir que, en Joey, Joey se era una persona real que interpretó a Joey Tribbiani en Friends.

Más o menos como Will Smith en El Príncipe de Bel Air.El ultraderechista Geert Wilders inició hoy la campaña electoral del Partido de La Libertad (PVV) con promesas de expulsar "a la escoria marroquí" y "recuperar Holanda para los holandeses" tras los comicios del 15 de marzo.

"Si lo que buscáis es tener de nuevo en vuestras manos a este país, solo podéis votar por un partido", aseguró el político a los múltiples seguidores que acudieron a arroparle en su primer día de campaña.

Wilders culpó a los holandeses de origen marroquí de provocar "la inseguridad" callejera en el país y prometió poner fin a la inmigración procedente de países musulmanes. Asimismo, resaltó que la Unión Europea es responsable de "todos los males" de Holanda.

Este partido ultraderechista eligió la ciudad portuaria de Rotterdam, en el sur de Holanda, para dar comienzo a su campaña electoral, rodeado de decenas de agentes de seguridad y guardaespaldas.

Se paseó entre sus seguidores, a los que abrazaba, entregaba panfletos electorales y prometía "devolverles" Holanda si votaban por él.

El dirigente ultraderechista también aprovechó la presencia de decenas de medios de comunicación para atacar a "los partidos del sistema", a los que suele acusar de "elite" o sobre los que lamenta que "están vendidos a Bruselas".

El líder del PVV lidera las encuestas de intención de voto que se han conocido los últimos meses y se mantiene por delante del actual primer ministro holandés, el liberal Mark Rutte.

No obstante, aunque gane los comicios generales del 15 de marzo, tendrá dificultades para formar una coalición de Gobierno, ya que la mayoría de partidos ha descartado unirse al PVV debido a sus ideas xenófobas.게시됨: 2017년 02월 18일 17시 02분 KST

박영수 특별검사팀의 공식 수사 기간이 막바지에 접어들었지만, 최대 하이라이트인 박근혜 대통령 대면조사는 일정조차 잡히지 않은 것으로 알려졌다.

청와대와 특검이 일정 조율에 진통을 겪음에 따라 대면조사는 다음 주 이후로 미뤄질 가능성이 커졌다.

18일 법조계에 따르면 특검은 최근 청와대 측에 이번 주 안으로 박 대통령 대면조사를 희망한다는 뜻을 전달했지만, 답변을 받지 못한 것으로 알려졌다.

이에 따라 박 대통령 대면조사는 다음 주 이후로 넘어가게 됐다.

일각에서는 청와대 측이 당초 대면조사를 받아들인다는 기조 아래 특검과 협의해왔지만, 최근 상황 변화로 고심이 깊어진 게 아니냐는 관측이 나온다.

특검은 14일 박 대통령과 최순실씨 측에 430억원 규모의 뇌물을 제공한 혐의로 이재용 삼성전자 부회장의 구속영장을 청구했고 법원은 이를 발부했다.

삼성 측이 뇌물을 건넸다는 특검 논리가 일정 부분 소명됐다고 법원이 판단한 것으로, 박 대통령의 뇌물수수 의혹을 조사할 필요성이 일단 더욱 높아진 셈이다.

헌법재판소가 16일 탄핵심판 최종변론을 이달 24일 하겠다고 밝힌 것도 박 대통령 측에는 압박 요인이 됐다.

박 대통령 측은 그동안 '충분한 심리'를 강조하며 시간이 더 필요하다는 입장이었지만, 탄핵심판 선고가 적어도 이정미 헌재소장 권한대행 퇴임일인 다음 달 13일 이전에는 내려질 가능성이 유력해진 상태다.

이런 상황에서 이달 28일로 수사 기간이 끝나는 특검 입장에선 대면조사를 더는 미루기 어려운 상황이다.

일각에서는 특검이 수사 기간에 대면조사를 못하는 게 아니냐는 관측도 나온다.

그러나 특검은 수사를 끝내기 위해선 의혹의 정점에 있는 박 대통령 조사가 꼭 필요하다는 입장이어서 향후 양측이 어떤 식으로 조율해 매듭을 지을지 주목된다.

Jamie Oliver sigue empeñado en ponerse a países enteros en su contra. Hace unos meses, el conocido chef británico ya fue noticia después de hacer un plato al que llamó "paella", con el que se ganó las críticas de gran parte del pueblo español.

Tras ese "arroz con cosas", el cocinero ha ido un paso más allá y se ha atrevido con uno de los platos italianos más famosos: los espaguetis a la carbonara.

El conocido chef compartió una curiosa adaptación —que poco o nada tiene que ver con el plato original— de la famosa receta de pasta a la carbonara. Además, ha tenido la osadía de presentar el plato con forma de tarta. "Mira esta belleza, ¿te gusta la carbonara? ¿te gustan las tartas? ¡Esto es para ti!", dijo Oliver adjuntando de los espaguetis en cuestión.

Look at that beauty !! Love carbonara? love cake? this is for you! total comfort food on #FridayNightFeast @Channel4 https://t.co/WoEGMM4wmJ pic.twitter.com/RHM3YbTGmw — Jamie Oliver (@jamieoliver) 17 de febrero de 2017

Las críticas por parte de los italianos no se han hecho esperar y numerosos tuits —muchos en tono de humor— han querido recordarle a Olivier que deje de jugar con la comida italiana.

¿Cuál será el próximo país agraviado por Oliver? ¿Será Francia? Sólo él puede saberlo.

Au moins 140 réfugiés somaliens ont été admis aux États-Unis après s'être vu interdits d'entrer en vertu du controversé décret-loi en matière d'immigration signé par Donald Trump, ont indiqué d'autres réfugiés somaliens qui les ont côtoyés.

Ces sources s'exprimaient sous le couvert de l'anonymat puisqu'elles craignent pour leur sécurité. Celles-ci se trouvent au plus important camp de réfugiés au monde, Dadaab, qui abrite plus de 200 000 Somaliens.

Le groupe de 140 réfugiés dont l'entrée a été approuvée par les autorités américaines était sur le point de se rendre aux États-Unis quand le président Trump a promulgué son interdiction d'entrée pour les ressortissants de sept pays majoritairement musulmans.

Tous ont donc été contraints de rester dans un camp de transition de la capitale du Kenya, Nairobi. Ils ont ensuite été renvoyés dans des camps de réfugiés.

Or, une cour américaine a suspendu le décret-loi de Donald Trump. Les 140 réfugiés somaliens ont donc été redirigés à Nairobi au cours de la dernière semaine, avant leur départ pour les États-Unis.

C'est vendredi soir que le gratin de Montréal s'est présenté au Théâtre du Nouveau Monde pour la soirée Côté Coeur, pour amasser des fonds pour la Fondation du TNM.

Découvrez ici les images d'une soirée aux airs de Saint-Valentin par notre photographe Paméla Lajeunesse:ADVERTISEMENT

La vague de décès par overdose qui frappe le Canada bénéficie aux dons d'organes, un développement aussi paradoxal qu'inattendu de la crise du fentanyl qui fait des ravages en Colombie-Britannique (ouest).

"Il y a plus d'organes disponibles pour des transplantations et une partie de ces organes provient de victimes d'overdoses de drogue", explique David Landsberg, directeur des services médicaux de transplantation de la province de la côte pacifique.

Cette corrélation entre les overdoses au fentanyl, un puissant sédatif, et les greffes d'organes est significative depuis la fin 2016.

Entre le début de l'année et le 15 février, 59 organes provenant de 20 donneurs ont été transplantés dans cette province de l'ouest canadien, selon les données des autorités sanitaires. Le chiffre était de 37 provenant de 10 donneurs pendant la même période en 2016.

Le quart des organes greffés cette année ont été prélevés sur des victimes d'overdose au fentanyl, souligne à l'AFP David Landsberg.

La Colombie-Britannique, "la région la plus durement touchée" par la crise des opioïdes, selon Jane Philpott, ministre fédérale de la Santé, a déploré 914 décès par overdose en 2016, 80% de plus qu'en 2015.

Le fentanyl était en cause dans deux tiers de ces décès.

Et la tendance se maintient: pour le seul mois de janvier, 116 décès par overdose ont été enregistrés, selon les statistiques de la province.

Face à cette situation, Mme Philpott a annoncé vendredi de nouvelles mesures pour endiguer cette crise de santé publique, débloquant 75 millions de dollars canadiens (54 millions d'euros), dont 10 millions en aide d'urgence à la Colombie-Britannique.

Le fentanyl, 100 fois plus puissant que l'héroïne, crée une forte dépendance, selon la police. A l'état pur, deux milligrammes, soit l'équivalent de quatre grains de sel, suffisent pour tuer un adulte.

'Un mal pour un bien'

A l'hôpital Saint Paul, dans le centre de Vancouver, David Landsberg conjugue à regret et trop souvent, les décès tragiques par overdose et les dons d'organes qui sauvent la vie des autres.

"Cela me laisse ambivalent", dit-il après un temps de réflexion. "C'est un mal pour un bien".

"J'aimerais voir la fin de l'épidémie au fentanyl mais j'aimerais aussi que les gens sur des listes d'attente pour des dons d'organes reçoivent de l'aide".

Les victimes d'overdose sont traitées de la même façon que les autres donneurs potentiels. Certaines avaient donné de leur vivant leur consentement. Pour les autres, les médecins peuvent avoir l'accord des familles.

Les prélèvements sont opérés une fois la drogue éliminée par les organes de la victime.

Le personnel médical scrute aussi "méticuleusement" les organes des victimes pour s'assurer de ne pas transmettre de maladies infectieuses, compte tenu du risque plus élevé de contracter le virus du VIH ou une hépatite pour les consommateurs de drogues dures.

"Nous discutons de cela en détail avec les patients en attente d'organes et ne faisons la transplantation qu'avec leur approbation", dit-il.

Yesterday, the BBC confirmed to HuffPost UK that the 39-year-old actor would be taking a sabbatical, but denied reports it had been enforced.

BBc Danny Dyer

“Danny is on a short break from EastEnders. This was not enforced by bosses nor has he quit the show,” the statement read.

Now cast and crew on the soap are worried that Danny is on the verge of quitting his role as Queen Vic landlord, Mick Carter.

A source told The Sun: “Danny has been the main conversation on set all week.

The 39-year-old actor, who is paid £400,000 a year, is contracted to stay with the soap until November.

Only last month, the Mick Carter actor hinted that he might leave Albert Square.

“Four years is a long time,” he said. “It’s been really rewarding but there’s other stuff out there.

“I’d love to show other sides to me, I loved theatre and all that.”

Danny’s off-screen antics have made headlines in the past. Last year, he ended up with a black eye after getting caught up in a fight at V Festival with friends of former ‘TOWIE’ star Mark Wright.

And in 2014, he got a bit too close for comfort to ‘Bake Off’ queen Mary Berry during a very sweary appearance on stage at the TV Choice Awards.

Danny Dyer's Words Of Wisdom

BBCC’è vita sul pianeta sinistra. Le immagini di Guerre stellari, dietro il palco, mostrano un’astronave e Yoda, simbolo della saggezza di un mondo lontano: “Devi sentire la forza intorno a te”. Sul palco Peppino Caldarola, ex direttore dell’Unità e presentatore della kermesse, spiega: “Quell’astronave è la sinistra, dobbiamo tirarla fuori”. Poco prima, sulle note di Bandiera rossa, versione riadattata (“evviva il socialismo e la libertà”) aveva così salutato i presenti: “Spero che questo canto vi aiuti a togliere le rughe dal cuore”.

Teatro Vittoria a Testaccio, core di Roma: la scissione, nella sua sostanza politica, è irreversibile, prima che si consumino gli ultimi rituali. L’ultimo prevede la presentazione di un documento all’assemblea di domenica, in cui saranno messi nero su bianco i punti della “svolta”, stra-ripetuti in questi giorni, rifiutata la quale “l’inizio di una nuova storia” è inevitabile: 1) l’impegno a far durare il governo fino al 2018; 2) l’impegno del governo a una inversione di rotta su scuola e lavoro 3) congresso a scadenza naturale, ovvero ottobre. In serata sarà messo a punto da Speranza, Rossi e Emiliano. E sarà chiesto di metterlo ai voti all'assemblea di domani: "Lo bocceranno e a quel punto usciamo" spiegano fonti informate.

Al netto del rituale, conta il cuore, che è già oltre l’ostacolo. E oltre il Pd. Il Vittoria è un catino, nient’affatto nostalgico, molto di sinistra. Enrico Rossi parla di “inquietudine verso il presente”, di “riforma del capitalismo”, di “sfruttamento del lavoro”, “Abbiamo accettato troppo supinamente il mondo così com’è”: “Se hai troppa vicinanza coi potenti, se esalti Marchionne, non meravigliarti se i precari ti sentono distante”. Fortiter in re, suaviter in modo, toni moderati, sostanza tosta, come insegnavano i partiti di una volta, senza effetti speciali, e senza personalizzazione. Certo toni di sinistra, che dentro il Pd non si sentono da tempo: “Abbiamo bisogno di un partito partigiano che in modo netto sta dalla parte dei lavoratori e del lavoro. Troppa contiguità coi potenti rende difficile parlare coi lavoratori”.

In prima fila ci sono Pier Luigi Bersani, Massimo D’Alema, al suo fianco Francesco Boccia. Due file dietro Antonio Misiani e Elisa Simoni, due giovani turchi di Andrea Orlando mandati come osservatori. Presenza che significa anche volontà di dialogo, perché col proporzionale e due partiti è chiaro che il guardasigilli avrà un ruolo naturale di interlocutore del Pd verso la sinistra. C’è un passaggio in cui viene giù la sala. Ed è quando Michele Emiliano, nomina Pier Luigi Bersani: “Di fronte a una situazione molto meno grave di quella in cui si trova oggi Matteo Renzi, Pier Luigi Bersani si è dimesso e ha consentito al partito di superare le difficoltà. Se quel partito è sopravvissuto ed ha dato la possibilità a Renzi di diventare presidente del consiglio è perché il suo segretario è stato capace di vincere il personalismo e di vivere la politica come comunità. Come comunità!”.

Applausi, lunghi lunghissimi. L’ex segretario si alza un po’ dalla sedia e fa un cenno a ringraziare la sala. Comunità, appunto. Ci sono le bandiere del Pd in sala. Dirigenti, militanti, assediati da microfoni per i “pezzi di clima” raccontano che vorrebbero stare nel Pd, ma il Pd è diventato un’altra cosa. Non è odio verso Renzi, è distanza quasi antropologica. “Non è una scelta che facciamo a cuor leggero”, “sono momenti che fanno tremare le vene ai polsi” ripetono. Una signora di Testaccio, una vita nel Pci: “Io domani Renzi lo aspetto fuori all’assemblea. E gli vado a dire che Bersani lo deve trattare bene perché noi gli vogliamo bene ci vuole rispetto”.

È quello che Roberto Speranza, nel suo intervento, il più “politico” dei tre chiama il “nostro mondo”, o meglio una parte, nell’ambito di quella che chiama scissione tra un pezzo del popolo del centrosinistra e Pd. Fa effetto sentire Speranza, che scandisce le parole come accade negli interventi solenni, parlare dell’esperienza del Pd al passato. Parla di “sinistra muta”, “incapace di leggere il nostro tempo”, di un “gruppo dirigente subalterno” che non vede che la rottura sentimentale con un popolo c’è già stata: “Se il congresso si riduce a un plebiscito-rivincita per il capo arrabbiato perché ha perso il plebiscito vero, allora un nuovo inizio sarà scontato”.

La foto dei tre, sul palco, sancisce un punto di non ritorno. Un fatto politico, al netto delle differenze di sfumature e di approcci, con Emiliano che appare più trattativista e gli altri meno. In verità proprio i toni non ultimativi di tutti, assai poco ringhiosi, indicano che la rottura, nella sostanza, appare irreversibile. Non c’è trattativa, ma, come si dice in questi casi, bisogna far ricadere la responsabilità sull’altro. “Non costringete questa comunità ad uscire” urla Emiliano dal palco, "Non rinuncio al sogno per l'arroganza di uno". Intanto già piovono tweet dei fedelissimi dell’ex premier che parlano di “insulti e intolleranza” nella manifestazione di Testaccio. Ormai, due pianeti.

La battuta di Emiliano

Rossi: no a partito di RenziSe i tre moschettieri della minoranza (Rossi-Emiliano-Speranza) invocano "O svolta o addio" la riposta dei renziani alla minoranza Pd riunita questa mattina non si è fatta attendere a lungo. Liquidati alla svelta, come potrebbe accadere domani nel congresso.

"Mai visto tanto odio per il segretario Renzi, neanche a Pontida o in un meetup cinque stelle, dai 101 del Capranica ai 121 del Vittoria" scrive su Twitter il deputato del Pd e renziano Ernesto Carbone.

"Questa mattina toni e parole che nulla hanno anche fare con una comunità che si confronta e discute. Gli ultimatum non sono ricevibili" conferma il vicesegretario del Pd Lorenzo Guerini che sempre attraverso un tweet commenta le parole degli esponenti della minoranza dem.

"Amarezza per toni minoranza Pd. A mano tesa del segretario solo insulti e intolleranza. La scissione è il loro progetto....dietro a D'Alema" è invece il pensiero di David Ermini, sempre affidato ai social, in cui punta il dito contro l'ex segretario Pd (D'Alema oggi ha affermato: "Scissione? Non è colpa mia", ndr).

Contro l'ex leader del centrosinistra anche il senatore Andrea Marcucci. "D'Alema ha già scelto la scissione radunando i suoi. Gli altri seguiranno? Sta a voi Emiliano, Rossi, Speranza, decidere"

"Dolore, rabbia, incredulità. Questo suscitano gli interventi a Roma di Emiliano, Speranza e Rossi. Continuano con la logica dell'ultimatum e del diktat" scrive in un post su facebook il segretario Pd della Toscana Dario Parrini, che è anche deputato Dem. "Sembra averli abbandonati il cuore. Sembra averli abbandonati la ragione. Sembra averli abbandonati il senso di responsabilità. Noi, fino all'ultimo, cercheremo di avere cuore, testa e responsabilità anche per loro", aggiunge Parrini.

"Non ho mai risparmiato critiche a Renzi. Ma quello sentito oggi da palco rivoluzione socialista è inaccettabile e ingiusto perché non vero". Così Matteo Richettisi aggiunge al coro su twitter.

"Fermi dal 4/12. Nel nostro immobilismo tattico siamo incomprensibili per chi ci guarda da fuori. Sicuri che la parola giusta sia fermiamoci?" è infine il commento della deputata Pd Anna Ascani.

La battuta di Emiliano

Rossi: no a partito di RenziFormer Manchester United footballer Dwight Yorke has said he was “made to feel like a criminal” when he was denied entry to the US.

The 45-year-old said he was stopped from boarding the aircraft in Qatar, which was flying to Miami on Thursday.

Yorke said a red flag came up against his name because his passport showed he had visited Iran.

Mike Egerton/EMPICS Sport Dwight Yorke said he was 'made to feel like a criminal' when he was denied entry to the US.

“I couldn’t quite believe what was happening. I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal,” Yorke told The Sun.

He said he had bought his ticket, checked in and was about to board the flight when he was stopped by two officials.

The former footballer said he was told there was a problem with his visa due to the Iranian stamp in his passport.

“I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn’t even stay overnight,” Yorke said.

Yorke said he was told that if he got on the flight he “would simply be deported back to Qatar” once he arrived in the US.

Richard Keys, who works for BeIn Sports with Yorke, slammed the incident as “crazy”.

Well done @realDonaldTrump. Man U ambassador Dwight Yorke denied transit access to Miami cause he has Iranian stamp in passport. #crazy — Richard Keys (@richardajkeys) February 17, 2017

In January Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending the US’s refugee program and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

These include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Yorke is not the first sportsman to speak out about Trump’s contentious travel ban.

Last month British Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah, who has lived in Oregon for six years, said the ban was “deeply troubling”.

Farah, who is originally from Somalia, said the US President’s policy “comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice”.

He added: “Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome.”C’è vita sul pianeta sinistra.

La battuta di Emiliano

Rossi: no a partito di RenziIl rapper J-Ax, ascoltando l'intervento di Michele Emiliano alla convention romana con Roberto Speranza e Enrico Rossi, twitta: "Il discorso di Emiliano sta spaccando tutto. Grande". La risposta del governatore pugliese, candidato alla segreteria del Pd, arriva poco dopo sul social: "Bella zio! Grazie per avermi ascoltato! Sei grande!"

Il discorso di #Emiliano sta spaccando tutto.

CHENNAI -- DMK Working President M.K. Stalin on Saturday sat in protest near the Mahatma Gandhi statue on Marina beach against the manner in which he and his party legislators were evicted from the state assembly.

Chennai: DMK Working President MK Stalin met Governor C.Vidyasagar Rao after #floortest in Tamil Nadu Assembly pic.twitter.com/XH00xT6FOv — ANI (@ANI_news) February 18, 2017

Earlier, he met Tamil Nadu Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao and lodged a complaint against the happenings in the assembly.



Speaking to reporters after he and his party legislators were evicted from the House, Stalin said the party had demanded secret ballot to decide on the motion of confidence moved by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy.



He said the party demanded adjournment of the House for a week so that legislators can go back to their constituencies and seek the people's views before they come back to vote on the confidence motion.



The DMK leader said he sat in protest inside the assembly to press his demand.



Stalin alleged he was forcibly evicted by the marshals and suffered injuries and his shirt was damaged.



He also alleged that his party legislators were assaulted by the marshals while evicting them.

Also on HuffPost India:"Adesso che abbiamo convinto Renzi a sostenere Gentiloni fino alla fine della legislatura senza fargli brutti scherzi, possiamo darci il tempo di riconciliarci e trovare le ragioni per stare ancora insieme". Lo scrive su Facebook il presidente della Puglia Michele Emiliano. E lo fa a pochi minuti dall'inizio della manifestazione della minoranza Pd a Roma, dove parleranno sul palco i tre leader anti-Renzi: Roberto Speranza, Enrico Rossi e, appunto, Michele Emiliano. Un post mattutino, quello del governatore pugliese, che può essere interpretato come un tentativo di tenere ancora aperta la trattativa fino all'ultimo con l'ex premier per evitare la scissione e, in seconda battuta, smarcarsi dalla posizione più oltranzista di Massimo D'Alema.

Ecco il post integrale:

Ieri ho detto a Renzi che basterebbe fare una conferenza programmatica a maggio e le primarie congressuali a settembre per ricomporre un clima di rispetto reciproco e salvare il PD.

Adesso che lo abbiamo convinto a sostenere Gentiloni fino alla fine della legislatura senza fargli brutti scherzi, possiamo darci il tempo di riconciliarci e trovare le ragioni per stare ancora insieme.

Questo è il lavoro che deve fare il segretario. Rimettere insieme i cocci di anni difficili per ripartire insieme.

Senza questo lavoro le distanze politiche tra noi sono troppo grandi e non basterebbe una conta per evitare anche a breve nuovi dissensi e nuovi rischi di conflitto.

Diamoci una possibilità.

Arriva dopo qualche ora la risposta della maggioranza Pd, per bocca del vicesegretario Lorenzo Guerini: teniamo il governo fuori dal congresso. "Il sostegno totale del Pd al Governo Gentiloni c'e' dal primo giorno. La scadenza finale della legislatura non e' nelle disponibilita' ne' di Renzi, ne' di Emiliano, ne' di altri. Suggerirei sommessamente a tutti, a partire dagli amici della minoranza, di tenere fuori il Governo dalle diatribe congressuali, per il bene del Paese e del Pd. Concentriamoci invece sul nostro congresso. Facciamolo. Quello e' il luogo della democrazia interna: chi ha idee non abbia paura di confrontarsi".

Intanto Emiliano non è il solo a pensare che la scissione sia ancora evitabile. "I margini per una trattativa ci

sono": lo ha detto il ministro per i Beni culturali Dario Franceschini ai cronisti, entrando al Palazzo dei congressi a Firenze per consegnare un premio a Piero Angela.While President Donald Trump rails against immigrants and foreign workers taking away American jobs, the Trump Vineyard Estates has filed yet another request for visas for foreign farm workers at its Virginia winery.

The application filed last week asks for H-2 worker visa for 23 laborers at $11.27 an hour from April through October this year.

In December, Trump Vineyard Estates also filed an application with the Department of Labor seeking six visas that would allow the company to hire foreign workers for seasonal jobs. That paperwork was submitted just days after Trump urged an Indiana company not to ship American jobs to Mexico.

Trump Winery, which the president’s son Eric Trump owns, would employ the workers, according to Buzzfeed, The winery’s website says it is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC and is “not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their affiliates.”

But the winery is located on the Trump Vineyard Estates LLC, which filed the visa request.Trump Vineyard Estates is listed as part of the real estate portfolio of the Trump Organization, according to its website. When Trump became president he said he would switch management of his companies to his sons but would maintain ownership. He revealed in a 2015 campaign financial disclosure filing that Trump Vineyard Estates had earned him $150,000 to $1.1 million, Politico reported at the time.

He also boasted at a campaign event last year featuring bottles from the Trump Winery — which was reportedly transferred to Eric Trump in 2012 — that “I own it 100 percent — no mortgage, no debt.”

Trump won approval in December to also hire 77 foreign workers at his Mar-a-Lago resort and Jupiter golf course through the H-2B visa program, according to a review of data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows conducted by Vocativ.

CNN reported last summer that Trump companies have employed at least 1,256 foreign workers — most from Romania and South Africa — in the past 15 years. The companies applied to hire 263 foreign workers even after Trump launched his campaign in which he railed against the loss of U.S. jobs to foreign workers.Εφημερίδα της Μαλαισίας δημοσιοποίησε μια φωτογραφία στην οποία, όπως υποστηρίζεται, φαίνονται οι τελευταίες στιγμές του Κιμ Γιονγκ Ναμ, ετεροθαλούς αδελφού του Βορειοκορεάτη ηγέτη, Κιμ Γιονγκ Ουν, αφού έχει δηλητηριαστεί.

"Sembrano delicati, e invece sono tra i fiori più resistenti. Un segno di rinascita". La nuova vita è quella della villa simbolo della potenza economica del clan dei Casalesi, costruita a immagine di quella di Toni Montana in "Scarface". Confiscata dallo Stato ventitré anni fa, oggi lava le macchie del proprio passato diventando un Centro Riabilitativo per la salute mentale. A memoria di quello che fu un avamposto camorrista, le foto di Mario Spada campeggiano oggi in quelle stanze insieme ad alcuni elementi architettonici rimasti come reperti dei trascorsi criminali. "C'era una volta...Hollywood" è il titolo della mostra che riunisce alcuni scatti della serie "Scarface", realizzata dal fotografo nel 2005 per il settimanale "D di Repubblica", e foto di scena tratte dalle riprese del film "Gomorra". Due anni dopo aver esplorato la reggia di Casal Di Principe come fotoreporter, infatti, Spada fu "assoldato" dal regista Matteo Garrone prima come Virgilio in terra di camorra, poi come occhio sul set: "La casa produttrice Fandango aveva trasformato il mio studio nel suo quartier generale, dove si svolgevano riunioni, casting, prove di trucco. Gli autori usavano le foto di miei lavori per ricreare le scenografie", ricorda il fotografo.

Un grande cancello rosso in ferro e un muro altissimo, almeno 3 metri, intorno alla dimora; un lungo viale fatto di sanpietrini e in fondo, "la villa semidistrutta, bruciata, vandalizzata e completamente spogliata di ogni pezzo di valore: ringhiere, infissi, lampadari, marmi": così si presentava undici anni fa casa di Walter Schiavone, fratello di "Sandokan": "Restavano i segni del lusso e del potere: le colonne, il timpano, e la vasca, come nelle case patrizie dell’Antica Pompei. Entrai dappertutto e spesso la meraviglia di quella singolare scenografia mi faceva sgranare gli occhi: immediatamente aprivo il cavalletto - racconta il fotografo - Dovevo dare il tempo alla luce di scalfire e penetrare nel nero della fuliggine per leggere i dettagli più nascosti; chiudere il diaframma al massimo per ottenere una messa fuoco nitida dell’immagine in tutta la sua profondità. La poca luce che entrava dalle finestre ostruite dalle piante infestanti mi costringeva a esposizioni di decine di minuti, e tutto quel tempo lo utilizzavo per memorizzare il luogo. Non mi bastavano le fotografie".

Anche Marco Onorato, il direttore della fotografia di Gomorra, dovette ingegnarsi per illuminare quegli antri ingoiati dall'oscurità: "Sistemò gli specchi al sole, consentendo così alla luce di rimbalzare all’interno della villa, illuminandola quel poco che bastava per “girare”, continua Spada, "e io mi ritrovavo a scattare negli stessi spazi che avevo già fotografato, ma con un’altra modalità, completamente differente, mentre Marco, l’attore, urlava: 'Vi ammazzo tutti bastardi colombiani'”. Da testimone oculare della realtà a "notaio" della finzione cinematografica, come se i ciak sulla scena fossero il preludio di un evento in corso, non di una recita: "Mi ricordai delle parole di Giovanni Allucci (amministratore delegato di Agrorinasce, il Consorzio che gestisce beni confiscati) che due anni prima mi aveva detto con gli occhi pieni di orgoglio che la villa di Walter Schiavone sarebbe diventata un centro di riabilitazione. Non avevo alcun buon presentimento che questo progetto potesse andare a buon fine. Per fortuna mi sbagliavo". La nuova vita di villa "Scarface" è cominciata il 30 gennaio scorso.Auf der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz ist offenbar ein Waffenstillstand in der Ost-Ukraine ausgehandelt worden | dpa

Russland und Ukraine unterstützen einen neuen Anlauf für eine Waffenruhe in der Ostukraine ab Montag

Eine am Mittwoch verkündete Waffenruhe war zunächst gescheitert

Die Außenminister Russlands und der Ukraine unterstützen einen neuen Anlauf für eine Waffenruhe von kommenden Montag an in der Ostukraine. Das sagte Bundesaußenminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) am Samstag in München nach einem Treffen der sogenannten Normandie-Gruppe, in der Deutschland und Frankreich die Vermittler sind.

Zuerst hatte der Bayerische Rundfunk darüber berichtet.

"Alle Parteien werden ihren Einfluss nutzen"

Am Mittwoch hatte die OSZE die neue Waffenruhe zwischen der ukrainischen Regierung und den prorussischen Separatisten verkündet. Danach war es aber weiter zu Kämpfen mit Toten gekommen.

"Alle Parteien werden ihren Einfluss nutzen, um die Verabredung aus der Kontaktgruppe (...) umzusetzen", sagte Gabriel. An dem Treffen am Rande der Sicherheitskonferenz nahmen neben ihm der russische Außenminister Sergej Lawrow und seine Kollegen aus der Ukraine und Frankreich, Pawel Klimkin und Jean-Marc Ayrault teil.ADVERTISEMENT

Seen on Twitter this week: "It's less of a 'news cycle' these days and more of that BSG episode where the Cylons attack every 33 minutes.” We’re less than two months into 2017 and the pace of terrible breaking news updates has become unrelenting.

For many, sites like Facebook have morphed from being a place you go to look at photos of babies and dogs to one where you get into arguments with otherwise-beloved family and friends. It's exhausting.

And for some people, it's frustrating. Seeing updates on Twitter about the recent shooting in a Quebec City mosque takes on a much different tone when you're wearing a hijab, for example. Many people feel bogged down not just by the weight of the news about other people’s lives but about the weight of news about their own.

While it’s important to be informed and educated about what’s happening in the world, it’s also important to give yourself a breather so you don’t become overwhelmed to the point of inaction and despair. Here are seven tips for dealing with frightening news on social media, from absorbing it as necessary to looking away when you need to.

Plan Ahead

There are times when you know the news is going to be upsetting — for example, when you are opening up the paper the morning after a violent incident. "Sometimes we intentionally seek out information and know that we might find disturbing images and read upsetting news,” says Dessa Bergen-Cico of Syracuse University in New York. "In such cases you can prepare yourself for what you may find and plan how you intend to respond.” Think about how the news might affect you before you read it, and steel yourself for the response as necessary.

Avoid As Necessary

Do you have a relative who is constantly posting inaccurate articles or prejudiced memes on Facebook? If pointing them towards reliable sources or countering the discriminatory language their sharing isn’t getting through, feel free to disengage. Facebook’s hide function exists for a very good reason, and protecting your sanity is one of them. It’s important to speak up when you see discrimination happening — but if history tells you that this particular person isn’t listening then you can save your energy for someone who might.

Get Your News In Print

Checking the news online or on television is convenient, but it also means you can’t control the speed at which you receive the information. It also means you have a lot less control over what you are seeing when. Subscribe to a local or national newspaper or news magazine, Bergen-Cico suggests, and spend some time with that each day. You’ll absorb the information better than if you were just scanning online, and you’ll be supporting the institutions that help ensure quality news coverage.

Choose Reliable Sources

The real news is upsetting enough — you don’t need to add potentially exaggerated or straight-up fake news to the mix. Learn how to evaluate news sources and rely on those that have a solid record of accuracy and strong reporting. "Stick to mainstream reputable news sources because they generally have policies and practices that will warn people prior to exposing them to disturbing content or they will avoid posting such content altogether,” Bergen-Cico says.

Let Yourself Reset

If the news has been particularly hard, it’s OK to take a break. Make an evening news-free, or even a weekend if you can do that in your line of work. "If something is important enough you will learn about it,” says Bergen-Cico. “Meanwhile, by staying away from it you can give yourself a chance to reset yourself emotionally."

Diversify

Political news may be dominating right now but those stories aren’t the only ones worth reading. Look for well-written stories about non-political topics at sites like BuzzFeed Reader, Longreads, Racked, Hazlitt, and The Root.

Work On Disengaging

"If you have recurrent intrusive thoughts and imagery from what you have seen, try to engage in mindful strategies to interrupt the thoughts so that you do not ruminate on them,” says Bergen-Cico. Listen to a meditation app on your phone, play with your pet, watch ASMR videos or Bob Ross on Netflix — things that help you relax and clear your head.ADVERTISEMENT

Découvrez ici les images d'une soirée aux airs de Saint-Valentin par notre photographe Paméla Lajeunesse:



Ruby Rose (30, "xXx: Return of Xander Cage") kämpft in Hollywood immer noch mit Vorurteilen. Der britischen "Cosmopolitan" sagte die Schauspielerin: "Ich habe auch eine weiche und eine nerdige Seite an mir. In Hollywood meinen aber viele: 'Okay, sie ist lesbisch, hat Tattoos und kurze Haare - wir wissen, welche Rolle wir ihr geben können.'" Man müsse den Leuten aber zeigen, wie man wirklich sei. "Viele sagen dann: 'Du bist hinreißend! Überhaupt nicht beängstigend!' Und ich sage dann: 'Beängstigend? Wer sagt, ich sei beängstigend?'"

Früher habe sich Rose auch vielmehr Gedanken darüber gemacht, woran es liegen könne, wenn sie eine Rolle nicht bekommen hat. "Als ich Anfang 20 eine Rolle nicht gekriegt habe, habe ich über alle Fehler an mir nachgedacht. Stattdessen hätte ich einfach begreifen müssen, dass die Rolle, die jemand anderes bekommen hatte, für diejenige wahrscheinlich einfach besser zugeschnitten war." Für Rose läuft es in Hollywood inzwischen aber sehr gut: Seit ein paar Tagen ist der Film "John Wick: Kapitel 2" in den deutschen Kinos. In dem Streifen ist sie neben Keanu Reeves (52, "The Matrix") zu sehen.

Bestellen Sie hier die komplette erste StaffelUn paio di giorni fa, il Daily Mail ha pubblicato delle foto esclusive e "mai viste prima" che mostrano una splendida Marilyn Monroe "in dolce attesa". Foto scattate nel lontano 8 luglio 1960 a New York e vendute nel novembre del 2016 dalla Julien's Auctions, una casa d'aste di Los Angeles. Scatti che provenivano dalla collezione privata di Frieda Hull, una delle "Monroe Six", un gruppo di donne fan dell'attrice, che la seguiva passo passo durante i suoi soggiorni a New York. Nell'articolo viene presentata la testimonianza di Tony Michaels, l'uomo che ha comprato le foto all'asta, in cui afferma di aver saputo da Frieda, sua vicina di casa, della relazione tra l'attore Yves Montand e Marilyn, nata durante le riprese di "Facciamo l'amore", fatto già noto, e che questo l'avrebbe messa incinta. Scott Fortner, uno dei maggiori esperti e collezionisti al mondo di oggetti, autografi e tutto ciò che si possa collegare a Marilyn Monroe, però, ha dichiarato che la storia di quelle foto "è un chiaro esempio di fake news": "Impossibile che Marilyn Monroe fosse incinta all'epoca".

Never-before-seen photos of secretly pregnant Marilyn Monroe https://t.co/1QIR39svOQ pic.twitter.com/F7Ft2isTXL — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) 15 febbraio 2017

"In una delle didascalie delle foto pubblicate dal Daily Mail risalente al gennaio 1960 - spiega Fortner - "viene descritta la 'pancia piatta di Marilyn sul set di "Facciamo l'amore". Agli inizi di giugno, però, si può chiaramente vedere il pancione'. Ma in quello scatto è difficile vedere il ventre di Marilyn, in quanto è coperto dal braccio, quindi la loro prova non è valida". "Anche perché - prosegue Fortner - è risaputo che Marilyn, avesse qualche chilo in più agli inizi degli anni '60".

Fortner è più che convinto: "Marilyn non era incinta, è fuori discussione. Ogni giorno della sua vita è documentato. Se avesse aspettato un bambino nel 1960 lo sapremmo di certo. Come sappiamo, infatti, che rimase incinta tre volte. Nell'estate del '56, mentre recitava in 'Il principe e la ballerina', nell'estate del '57 e l'ultima volta nel '58, durante le riprese di 'A qualcuno piace caldo'. Ma perse il bambino nell'inverno dello stesso anno. Da quel momento, Marilyn non provò più ad avere figli".

Un'altra prova a sostegno della tesi di Fortner gliela fornisce la stessa Marilyn: "Molti, quasi tutti, sono a conoscenza di quanto la Monroe tenesse alla sua immagine e alla considerazione del pubblico. Mai e poi mai avrebbe dato il permesso a qualcuno di fotografarla se fosse stata in attesa di un bambino di Yves Montand, quando ancora sposata con Arthur Miller".

Un altro dubbio lo solleva l'attuale proprietario dei beni di Frieda Hull, amico di vecchia data di Frieda. La donna lasciò a lui tutte le foto presenti nel suo archivio e i memorabilia di Marilyn. "Frieda non fece mai parola della storia né gli fece intendere nulla - afferma Fortner - quindi perché condividere questa informazione con qualcuno con cui, tra le altre cose, ha avuto un litigio, e non altri?".

Un'altra questione riguarda l'esclusività di queste foto. "Una di queste foto 'inedite' - come sottolinea il collezionista - era già stata pubblicata, nel 1991 per la precisione, nel libro di James Haspiel, 'Marilyn: The Ultimate Look at the Legend'". Lo stesso Fortner ha avuto accesso a queste foto, avendo curato il catalogo della collezione di Frieda Hull per la Julien's Auctions proprio in vista dell'asta di novembre. 550 istantanee e 150 diapositive. Analizzate una a una. E tra queste c'erano anche le foto "esclusive". "Non c'era alcun appunto su queste foto, niente che le segnalasse come 'speciali' o altro. Nulla che facesse riferimento al fatto che Marilyn fosse incinta. Eppure in altre foto, sul retro, ci sono degli appunti scritti a mano dalla stessa Frieda in cui viene descritto quanto fotografato e perché. Se queste foto erano così importanti - conclude Fortner - perché sul loro retro non c'è scritto nulla? Ma soprattutto, perché in tutta la collezione di Frieda non è presente il minimo accenno alla presunta gravidanza di Marilyn?".Ursprünglich wollte der Amerikaner Michael Glidden nur mit seinen Hunden die Gegend rund um den „Chugach National Forest“ im US-Bundesstaat Alaska erkunden. Nach seiner Wanderung sichtete er zu Hause die Fotos, die er gemacht hatte – und stellte fest: Er war auf seiner Wanderung nicht alleine.

(ame)Polemico e rabbioso fino all'ultimo, utopista e anticonformista per natura e per scelta, appassionato e vitale sotto la scorza del suo apparente cinismo. Questo era Pasquale Squitieri, nato a Napoli il 27 novembre del 1938 e scomparso oggi in una clinica romana, per complicazioni polmonari, assistito dalla moglie, l'attrice Ottavia Fusco, sposata dopo anni di convivenza nel 2013. I funerali ci saranno lunedì alle 15 nella Chiesa degli Artisti a Roma.

L'aggettivo che meglio lo definisce come artista è "fisico": il suo cinema sprigionava un vitalismo e una immediatezza espressiva che riproduceva bene la sua indole. Spesso coinvolto in battaglie d'opinione e in faziosità ideologiche, per anni venne rappresentato come "il regista con la pistola" (che si voleva portasse alla fondina come un trofeo machista), mentre il carattere celava sensibilità e timidezze mascherate dietro gli onnipresenti occhiali da sole a specchio. Straordinario motivatore e personalità carismatica, deve certamente la sua fortuna al cinema ad un linguaggio diretto e senza fronzoli che caratterizzava i suoi film, ma anche al lunghissimo sodalizio con Claudia Cardinale, prima compagna ed attrice-feticcio, poi amica e confidente inseparabile che non lo ha mai lasciato solo, anche dopo la separazione.

Nello scorso novembre, premiato alla carriera dalla rassegna assisiate "Primo piano sull'autore" seppe stupire la platea con un infervorato commiato tutto dedicato alla gratitudine per i suoi attori (Claudia in prima fila) e per i giovani, una generazione a cui è affidata - disse - la nostra sola speranza, ma che "non sappiamo proteggere dalle insidie di una società sempre più marcia e irredimibile".

Laureato in legge, assunto al Banco di Napoli, deve a un infortunio professionale (un'accusa di peculato che gli costò comunque cinque mesi di carcere) la spinta definitiva ad abbandonare il lavoro e a tuffarsi nella sua vera passione per la cultura. Fu Vittorio De Sica a scommettere su di lui nel 1969, producendo il suo lungometraggio d'esordio, "Io e Dio", permeato di un ribellismo istintivo contro la prepotenza del potere e la cecità della gente "perbene", comprese le autorità ecclesiastiche. E' il frutto dell'ondata anti-sistema del '68 che trova in Squitieri un appassionato sostenitore, fino a spingerlo su posizioni non lontane da gruppi di contestazione come "Lotta continua". Da regista sceglie invece la strada della metafora politica ammantata da cinema di genere e, con lo pseudonimo di William Redford, si lancia nello spaghetti western con due titoli di successo: "Django sfida Sartana" e il più personale "La vendetta è un piatto che si serve freddo" del 1971. Rivisti oggi, sono film che mostrano già il talento più evidente del giovane autore: linguaggio asciutto, forti sentimenti, gusto per la narrazione popolare, grandi ideali da ribelle solitario e un anarchismo di fondo che spiegherà le sue controverse posizioni politiche, dalla sinistra alla destra, fino ad un isolamento intellettuale che pagherà sempre in prima persona.

Non è quindi un caso se, abbandonato il cinema di genere, ne porterà gli elementi strutturali in racconti più personali, dedicati al Meridione, alla sua terra "destinata sempre a pagare per tutti sotto il tallone dei vincitori", narrando piaghe come il banditismo, la mafia, la camorra. Qui si mostra capace di conquistare il pubblico coi suoi film migliori: "I guappi!" (1974) con Fabio Testi, "Il prefetto di ferro" (1977) con Giuliano Gemma), fino a "Li chiamarono… briganti" (1999) con Enrico Lo Verso nei panni del discusso Carmine Crocco, condannato all'ergastolo per banditismo dopo l'Unità d'Italia e poi rivalutato dalla storiografia partenopea come eroe popolare.

Un tipico eroe perdente nel pantheon personale di Pasquale Squitieri come lo erano il Prefetto Mori (mandato dal fascismo a combattere da solo la Mafia), il pentito Ragusa del film omonimo (ispirato al caso Buscetta) e perfino lo stanco e disilluso Mussolini di "Claretta" (1984) con Rod Steiger e Claudia Cardinale. L'insuccesso di "Li chiamarono…briganti" (ritirato dalle sale in circostanze mai chiarite e accusato di revisionismo storico), chiuse a Squitieri molte porte del cinema, tanto da indurlo ad abbracciare la carriera politica nelle file di Alleanza Nazionale (e poi del Polo delle Libertà), ma non ad abbandonare la sua vena artistica. Negli anni successivi avrebbe infatti diretto ancora cinque film tra cui un vigoroso "L'avvocato Di Gregorio" sul tema delle morti bianche con un istrionico Giorgio Albertazzi e il film-testamento "L'altro Adamo" del 2014 con Lino Capolicchio e Ottavia Fusco, parabola visionaria sul futuro prossimo.

Il sociale lo appassionava da sempre, tanto da aver dedicato più di un lavoro alla piaga dell'immigrazione clandestina e a quella delle droga, fino a indurlo (verso la vecchiaia) ad abbracciare le idee radicali, iscrivendosi al partito transnazionale di Marco Pannella.

Emarginato, un po' per scelta e un po' per il carattere brusco e polemico, dall'élite intellettuale, scomodo per tutti, ma sempre difeso dal successo popolare, lascia in eredità un pugno di film da rivalutare, una figlia (nata dalla relazione con Claudia Cardinale) e un gruppo ristretto di amici e sostenitori che in lui hanno sempre riconosciuto l'onestà delle idee, la passione individualista, la voglia di non rassegnarsi mai.

UFC president Dana White says the deal is done. Georges St-Pierre says nothing official yet.

GSP's cage comeback continues to be a windy road, it seems.

Speculation has been mounting in recent days that the former UFC welterweight champion is about to end his hiatus from mixed martial arts and return to action. On Friday, White confirmed it to the Los Angeles Times.

"He's back. I'm excited," White told the newspaper. "We worked at it for a long time and finally got it done."

But St-Pierre (25-2-0) was not willing to jump back on the bandwagon quite yet.

"Nothing official yet," the Montreal fighter told The Canadian Press via text. "No opponent, no date."

St-Pierre has cited ups and downs over the last six months in negotiations with the UFC, saying he has learned from the past "to not be too excited for nothing."

Welterweight champion Tyron Woodley is due to fight Stephen (Wonderboy) Thompson in a title rematch on March 4 at UFC 209, so St-Pierre would have to wait his turn to get his 170-pound title back. White told the Times that St-Pierre had also talked about dropping down to lightweight (155 pounds), a division that now belongs to mega-star (The Notorious) Conor McGregor.

The 35-year-old St-Pierre has not fought since Nov. 16, 2013, at UFC 167 when he won a narrow decision over Johny (Bigg Rigg) Hendricks for his 12th straight victory.

A month later, he announced he was vacating his title and stepping away from the sport.

Citing the pressures of being champion and of being in a constant limelight, St-Pierre said his life has become "completely insane" and a "freaking zoo."

St-Pierre has travelled the world since, but kept training and never shut the door on a return — even when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and had to undergo surgery.

He has sparred with the UFC over drug-testing and declared himself a free agent last October, citing failed negotiations with the UFC's new ownership. In November, he was also one of the marquee names behind the Mixed Martial Arts Athletes Association, formed to protect UFC fighters and help get them their fair share of the sport's revenue.

The UFC could use St-Pierre, with McGregor awaiting the birth of his child and Ronda Rousey's future up in the air. In his heyday, St-Pierre was a pay-per-view magnet.

GSP's return would also pump life into the sport in Canada, which has seen fewer live shows in recent years.

Liquidati alla svelta, come potrebbe accadere domani nel congresso.

"Mai visto tanto odio per il segretario Renzi, neanche a Pontida o in un meetup cinque stelle, dai 101 del Capranica ai 121 del Vittoria" scrive su Twitter il deputato del Pd e renziano Ernesto Carbone.

Contro l'ex leader del centrosinistra anche il senatore Andrea Marcucci. "D'Alema ha già scelto la scissione radunando i suoi. Gli altri seguiranno? Sta a voi Emiliano, Rossi, Speranza, decidere"

"Dolore, rabbia, incredulità. Questo suscitano gli interventi a Roma di Emiliano, Speranza e Rossi.

"Non ho mai risparmiato critiche a Renzi. Ma quello sentito oggi da palco rivoluzione socialista è inaccettabile e ingiusto perché non vero". Così Matteo Richettisi aggiunge al coro su twitter.

"Fermi dal 4/12. Nel nostro immobilismo tattico siamo incomprensibili per chi ci guarda da fuori. Sicuri che la parola giusta sia fermiamoci?" è infine il commento della deputata Pd Anna Ascani.

"It would be so boring if we made a mid-2000s-style indie record. All those bands that I grew up with and shape the way I think about being in a band — the Cons, the Weakerthans, Wintersleep, Broken Social Scene — that’s not really what I listen to anymore. They’re in my DNA, but I just feel like rock has gotten so conservative and doesn’t know where to go. It’s just dull to me. Top 40 pop is way more progressive.”

Andrea Compton, una de las youtubers e influencers más conocidas y famosas de España ha denunciado en su perfil de Instagram el último ataque ha recibido por su físico.

La joven asegura que mientras buscaba una imagen de una de sus entrevistas encontró un foro en el que un grupo de mujeres hablaba de su peso, de su físico e incluso de su piel. La influencer dijo basta y publicó un amplio texto acompañado de una foto suya en un bañador negro en el que se desahogaba contra las mujeres que han criticado su cuerpo.

"Yo llevo un año haciendo un ejercicio muy importante que es mirarme al espejo cada día, aceptarme y verme espectacular", asegura la youtuber en el texto. Además, ha confesado que si hubiese visto esos comentarios hace un año lo habría pasado muy mal: "Llego a leer ese foro hace un año cuando estaba mentalmente destruida y me hundo en la más absoluta miseria", comentó.

Para concluir la publicación, Compton quiso mandar un recado a todas esas mujeres que critican a otras por su aspecto físico: "Si eres mujer y me estás leyendo, por favor... cuida lo que dices de otras mujeres. Intentad no hacer daño a nadie, es muy muy muy importante", sentenció.

Buscando una foto mía para una entrevista que me habían pedido, me he topado con un foro espantoso donde tenían un hilo entero hablando de mi peso y de mi piel, de lo gorda que soy y los granos que tengo. El hilo tenía un año, pero cuando lo he leído... me he quedado completamente helada, de que fueran mujeres quienes estaban haciendo esto, y no sólo a mí, a mujeres que para mí son preciosas y perfectas, con todos sus pesos alturas y estilos. Horrible que mujeres abran foros e hilos para criticar a otras únicamente por su físico, no saben el daño que se hacen entre ellas al hacer algo así. Ojalá se respetasen entre ellas, en vez de criticarlas, se ayudasen y sobretodo se dijesen cada día lo preciosas que son. Yo llevo un año haciendo un ejercicio muy importante que es mirarme al espejo cada día, aceptarme y verme espectacular. Me gusta cada parte de mí en todo momento, me gusto con una 46, con una 42 y con una 50. Me ha costado mucho tiempo aceptar que cada año tengo y tendré un peso diferente, pero ¡menos mal! porque llego a leer ese foro hace un año cuando estaba mentalmente destruida y me hundo en la más absoluta miseria. Si eres mujer y me estás leyendo, por favor... cuida lo que dices de otras mujeres. Intentad no hacer daño a nadie, es muy muy muy importante. (Me dirijo a mujeres porque es con lo que me he topado hoy, pero evidentemente cualquier ser humano debería respetar y cuidar del otro). Una publicación compartida de Andrea Compton (@andreacomptonn) el 16 de Feb de 2017 a la(s) 6:07 PST





La publicación lleva en menos de un día más de 100.000 me gusta y numerosos comentarios que apoyan el texto de la influencer.

Imagen de H&M este año, junto a Beyoncé, en ropa de verano y bañadores. "Trata de ser la mejor versión de ti misma y deja de preocuparte por tus mulos, que no tienen nada de malo", aconseja a las jóvenes.

Lawley es quizas la supermodelo de las modelos de talla grande. Ha protagonizado numerosas portadas de revistas, incluido Vogue Italia, Marie Claire y Elle Francia. Esta modelo 'plus size' también ha sido imagen de Ralph Lauren. "Hay muchas modelos de talla gran en Nueva York haciéndolo muy bien ahora mismo. Y esto sólo va a ir a mejor", ha dicho.

Huffine posó desnuda para el número de mayo de 2012 de S Moda. "[Un reportaje editorial en Vogue Italia] abrió los ojos a la industria para probar que somos guapas, sexys y buenas modelos. Ahora la gente quiere ver más. Las discusiones pasadas [sobre Photoshop] han hecho que la industria entienda que la gente quiere ver chicas de verdad", dijo.

En febrero de 2002, Elle Francia definió a Lynn como "el cuerpo, refiriéndose a que sus curvas representan el modelo ideal de mujer.

Esta modelo británica ha puesto en marcha Curve Project London, una agencia para modelos de todas las tallas que buscan hacerse un hueco en el mundo de la moda. Comenzó a desfilar como maniquí de tallas grandes cuando una agencia dejó de contar con ella por ganar peso. Le gustaría ser ejemplo de que "estar delgada no es la única forma de poner un pie en el mundo de la moda".

Elle, en su edición de Quebec, llevó a portada una sesión de fotos con LeGault para su número de mayo de 2013.

Parece que la gente ya no se queda tan sorprendida de ver curvas en los medios. ¡Es una gran noticia!

Se hizo modelo de tallas grandes tras ser modelo 'tradicional' y sufrir desórdenes alimenticios, aunque ella misma va cambiando de talla año a año. En una conferencia en febrero pidió a los diseñadores que también fomenten el cambio.

Ve a nuestra portada Facebook Twitter Instagram PinterestDer Sicherheitsdienst hat einem Journalisten den Zutritt zu der Veranstaltung des türkischen Ministerpräsidenten Yildirim in Oberhausen verweigert

Die Redaktion sprach von "unbegründeter Zurückweisung"

Bei der Veranstaltung des türkischen Ministerpräsidenten Binali Yildirim in Oberhausen ist einem Journalisten der Zutritt verweigert worden. Trotz Akkreditierung sei der "taz"-Journalist vom Sicherheitsdienst der türkischen Regierungspartei AKP nicht in den Saal gelassen worden, teilte die Redaktion am Samstag mit.

Dies sei mit Sicherheitserwägungen und einer Absprache mit der Polizei begründet worden. Eine derartige Absprache habe die Polizei aber dementiert.

"Selbstverständlich steht es Veranstaltern frei, Personen aus Sicherheitsgründen von einer Teilnahme auszuschließen", sagte Katrin Gottschalk, Mitglied der Chefredaktion der "taz".

"Jedoch hat die ganz offensichtlich unbegründete Zurückweisung unseres Reporters den Geruch einer politischen Maßregelung." Diese Behinderung journalistischer Arbeit sei weder in der Türkei noch in Deutschland akzeptabel.

Genaueres über die Hintergründe war zunächst nicht bekannt.

Yildirim wirbt für Machtausbau von Erdogan

Yildirim will in Oberhausen für ein Präsidialsystem in der Türkei werben. Über eine entsprechende Verfassungsreform soll das türkische Volk am 16. April abstimmen. An dem Referendum können sich auch im Ausland lebende Türken beteiligen. Das Präsidialsystem würde dem Staatspräsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan deutlich mehr Macht verleihen.

Die türkische Regierung steht in der Kritik, die Pressefreiheit in ihrem Land zu unterdrücken. Auf der Rangliste der Pressefreiheit von Reporter ohne Grenzen lag die Türkei schon vor dem Putschversuch im vergangenen Sommer und dem anschließend verhängten Ausnahmezustand auf Platz 151 von 180 Staaten.

Seitdem sind zahlreiche regierungskritische Journalisten verhaftet worden. Gerade erst am Freitag wurde bekannt, dass der Türkei-Korrespondent der deutschen Tageszeitung "Die Welt", Deniz Yücel, in Polizeigewahrsam genommen wurde.

Bei einem Treffen mit Yildirim am Samstag am Rande der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz sprach Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) den Fall an und verlangte, rechtsstaatliche Regeln einzuhalten, wie Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert mitteilte.

Le Mexique et le Canada doivent faire front commun dans la renégociation de l'Entente de libre-échange nord-américain (ALENA) et tenir tête au président américain Donald Trump.

C'est ce que soutient le ministre mexicain de l'Économie, Ildefonso Guajardo, en entrevue au Globe and Mail.

M. Guajardo demande au Canada d'insister pour que les pourparlers soient trilatéraux et non bilatéraux.

Le ministre affirme que le Canada et le Mexique "feront plus de gains ensemble" que séparés.

M. Guajardo convient que le Canada doit défendre ses propres intérêts, comme le Mexique, ajoutant toutefois qu'il n'y a rien de contradictoire à vouloir négocier l'Alena selon les intérêts de tous.

Le gouvernement canadien a récemment réitéré l'importance de sa relation avec le Mexique mais n'a pris aucun engagement à renégocier l'Aléna de façon trilatérale.

PRESIDENTIELLE 2017 - En meeting à Toulon où ses partisans ont été bousculés par des manifestants venus dénoncer ses propos sur la colonisation, Emmanuel Macron a accusé ce samedi 18 février le Front national d'avoir tenté de l'empêcher de tenir sa réunion publique, se posant en défenseur de la démocratie face à l'extrême droite et à une "droite dure".

"Merci d'être là à Toulon. Vous êtes des courageux parce que vous êtes venus jusqu'ici alors que, à l'entrée de cette salle, il y en avait qui ne voulaient pas vous laisser entrer", a lancé dès sa prise de parole le candidat En Marche!. Tout en appelant ses 1200 sympathisants (2000 étaient initialement attendus) à ne pas siffler, Emmanuel Macron a affirmé que cette épreuve "était un test de solidité de notre démocratie. C'est cela ce qui se joue dans cette campagne", accusant le Front national, qu'il avait déjà assimilé aux "ennemis de la République", de se poser en ennemi de la démocratie.

"Vous avez aux portes de cet établissement le Front national, oui, parce qu'il faut appeler ce qui se passe, il faut le nommer, le parti Front national jouant sur les haines, les peurs, les émotions, qui a empêché des centaines d'entre vous de rentrer, qui en a bousculé d'autres, y compris des journalistes, qui se retrouvent aujourd'hui aux urgences. Parce que le parti du Front national ne veut pas que la démocratie fonctionne, ne veut pas qu'elle avance, que le pays regarde en face ses défis. Il veut le confiner dans ses peurs", a-t-il dénoncé.

Très attaqué par le camp Fillon sur la question de la colonisation, Emmanuel Macron a également critiqué "une droite dure qui, elle dans ses rassemblements, fait siffler le camp d'en face, fait siffler les journalistes quand ce qu'ils disent ne leur convient plus, critiquent ouvertement la justice quand elle ne fait plus leur affaire et décident de jouer aussi avec les peurs, les divisions du pays. Pour le pire. Prenant tous les risques, poursuivant comme on l'a vu lors des pires années le FN dans ce qu'il a de plus vil".

"Macron trahison"

Environ 150 personnes ont manifesté samedi après-midi aux abords du meeting d'Emmanuel Macron à Toulon pour protester contre ses propos sur la colonisation, à l'appel notamment du Front national et d'associations de pieds-noirs, a constaté un journaliste de l'AFP. Houleux, le rassemblement, émaillé de coups de sifflet, s'est tenu aux cris de "Macron, trahison!", alors que la police repoussait les manifestants derrière une grande grille d'accès au Zénith de Toulon.

Des bousculades épisodiques se sont produites, quand certains d'entre eux ont tenté de forcer l'accès, à bonne distance de la salle du meeting.

Tenant des drapeaux français frappés en leur centre des pieds-noirs symboliques des rapatriés d'Algérie, les manifestants ont entonné La Marseillaise ou Le Chant des Africains, chant de l'armée d'Afrique durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, repris comme un chant pied-noir. Benjamin Griveaux, le porte-parole du mouvement En Marche!, a accusé le FN sur Twitter d'essayer "d'empêcher le meeting" de M. Macron, déplorant que des responsables FN nationaux comme Florian Philippot ou David Rachline soient "très silencieux".

Pourtant prompt à prendre la défense de la police, Florian Philippot n'a pas relevé, se contentant d'ironiser:

Macron pleurniche parce que ses propos de haine contre la France déclenchent partout l'émoi, bien au delà du FN ! Fallait réfléchir avant. — Florian Philippot (@f_philippot) 18 février 2017 #Macron paye à #Toulon ses déclarations irresponsables. Quand on insulte les Français, il ne faut pas s'étonner du retour de bâton ! — Stéphane Ravier (@Stephane_Ravier) 18 février 2017

Lors de son passage à Carpentras (Vaucluse) vendredi, le candidat avait déjà été interpellé par une trentaine de manifestants, dont certains venus avec notamment une banderole affichant le sigle "OAS", du nom de "l'Organisation armée secrète", groupe paramilitaire qui s'était violemment opposé aux accords d'Evian en 1962.

도널드 트럼프 미국 행정부가 불법 이민자 추방을 위해 주(州) 방위군 투입을 검토하고 있다는 내용의 국토안보부 메모가 17일(현지시간) 공개돼 논란을 빚고 있다.



AP통신, USA투데이 등 외신에 따르면 이 메모는 존 켈리 국토안보부(DHS) 장관이 지난달 25일 작성한 것으로 추정되는 11장짜리 분량이다.



캘리포니아, 애리조나 등 멕시코 국경 인근 4개 주를 포함해 오리온, 네바다 등 11개 주에 최대 10만명의 주 방위군을 배치하는 내용을 담고 있다. 이들에겐 조사, 체포, 구금과 관련해 출입국 관리국 직원과 동일한 권한이 부여된다.



주지사는 주 방위군 투입을 찬성 또는 반대할 수 있으며, 주 방위군 통제권은 주 정부가 갖는다.



이 같은 내용은 공개와 동시에 비판에 부딪혔다. 10만명에 달하는 막대한 주 방위군이 이민법 집행에 동원된 서례는 이제까지 없었다.



미셸 브레인 여성난민위원회 국장은 "군대를 투입해 이민법을 집행하는 것은 부끄러운 일"이라며 "미국에서 피난처를 찾는 이들을 더 큰 곤경에 처하게 할 것"이라고 말했다.



커트 슈레이더 민주당 하원의원(오리건)은 트위터를 통해 "주 방위군을 동원하는 생각은 터무니 없으며 가족을 찢고 미국기업을 파괴하는 행위에 불과하다"고 지적했다.



백악관과 국토안보부 측은 즉각적으로 보도를 부인했다. 숀 스파이서 백악관 대변인은 "100% 사실이 아니다"라며 "(보도가) 무책임하다"고 말했다. 길리안 크리스텐슨 국토안보부 대변인은 해당 메모가 초안에 불과하다며 "주 방위군 동원은 검토하고 있지 않다"고 말했다.



강경한 반(反)이민 정책을 펼치고 있는 트럼프 행정부는 최근 대규모 불법 이민자 단속에 착수했다. 이민세관집행국(ICE)의 첫 단속에서는 680명 이상이 체포됐다.NEWS

TrumpWatch: Donald Trump's Press Conferences And Other Batsh*t Things He Did This Week The best President Trump digest for Brits on the internet.About 1,000 tiny chicks were spotted running around a field in Cambridgeshire on Friday after being abandoned at just a day old.

The RSPCA has launched an investigation after officers were called to a sea of one-day-old chicks who were dumped in Crowland, near Peterborough.

Members of the public alerted the animal welfare charity to the shocking sight.

RSPCA The RSPCA is investigating after 1,000 one-day-old chicks were dumped in a Cambridgeshire field.

RSPCA inspector Justin Stubbs said: “I have never seen anything like it, it was just a sea of yellow. And the noise was unbelievable.

“The chicks are only about a day old and are really tiny and quite delicate. Some of the birds were dead or dying when we arrived so some, sadly, had to be humanely put to sleep.

“Thankfully, most of the chicks did not appear to be suffering.”

RSPCA It is believed the chicks came from a commercial chick producer nearby.

It is believed the chicks came from a commercial chick producer nearby and may have been abandoned by a third-party.

The producer is cooperating and assisting the RSPCA with their investigations, the animal welfare organisation said.

RSPCA Volunteers rescuing the tiny chicks.

“The breeder came to the scene to collect the surviving birds and take them back to their unit,” Stubbs added.

“These tiny birds wouldn’t have survived long out on their own at such a young age and in such unpredictable weather conditions.

“For someone to dump these vulnerable chicks is unbelievable.

“But I’d like to thank all the members of the public who teamed together to help us round up all the birds and confine them in boxes where they could huddle together for warmth.”

Anyone with any information about who is responsible for dumping the birds is asked to contact the RSPCA’s inspector appeal line on 0300 123 8018.Samantha Cameron has revealed how the death of her young son, Ivan, “overshadows everything”.

The fashion entrepreneur said his premature death in 2009, the year before David Cameron entered No 10, was of such magnitude that it made everything else “irrelevant” and “meaningless”, reports the Press Association.

Their first child, Ivan was born with a severe form of epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died shortly before his seventh birthday.

John Giles/PA Archive Samantha and David Cameron with Ivan in 2008.

In an emotional interview for The Times she described how they had to cope with regular “life or death situations” throughout the youngster’s life, yet it came as a “huge shock”.

Mrs Cameron said she sought strength from her faith and found hosting charity events at Downing Street cathartic, although she would often be brought to tears when meeting children and parents in similar situations.

Meanwhile the experience coloured her husband’s politics, she told the newspaper.

“It’s the biggest thing in my life. Being the prime minister’s wife was just a role,” she said.

“Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant. It just overshadows everything. What goes on in the outside world becomes meaningless.

Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive The Cameron's at Ivan's funeral in 2009.

“Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice.”

Mrs Cameron said the couple relied on routine so they did not “fall apart completely” and they still visit Ivan’s grave “very often”.

When Mr Cameron announced his resignation after losing the referendum in June he appeared on the steps of Downing Street flanked by his wife and Ivan’s siblings, Nancy, Florence and Arthur, who had grown up the flat above No 11.

In a way their brother’s death had helped her prepare for the “parallel universe” of life in Westminster, Mrs Cameron explained.

“I think it changed Dave’s politics. It made him understanding, although he couldn’t be too subjective,” she said.

The family now spend their time between homes in Notting Hill, west London, and Oxfordshire, where Mr Cameron served as MP for Witney for 15 years.

Mrs Cameron, who worked for British leather brand Smythson while he was PM, has now launched her own women’s wear label, Ceffin.Photographer Scott Martin visited the Viera Wetlands near Melbourne, Fla. and observed an encounter between a great blue heron and a small American alligator. "The great blue heron 'played' with the little gator for at least twenty minutes before killing and swallowing it," said Scott. Great blue herons eat nearly anything within striking distance, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, insects and other birds. This large, wading bird is a familiar sight to most Floridians. It's a permanent resident of wetlands throughout the state, often seen along ponds, lakes and canals in housing developments.

Posted by FWC Fish and Wildlife Research Institute on Thursday, 16 February 2017After just a few hours, it seems AKA and Bonang Matheba and back together. AKA sent two tweets out on Saturday afternoon apologising to Matheba.

I love you 💜 @bonang_m ... I'm just a bit crazy & intense .... I'm sorry baby. We good. 🙏🏽 — AKA (@akaworldwide) February 18, 2017

Ya so what. Couples fight. Get over it. Life goes on. 💜 — AKA (@akaworldwide) February 18, 2017

In a series of tweets on Friday evening the rapper, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes, said that the two had split. Television personality Matheba's social media feed stayed silent, and still has no posts about him or the break up and subsequent reconciliation.

At my fucking LIMIT for bullshit. — AKA (@akaworldwide) February 17, 2017

Sad to announce that myself & @bonang_m have broken up. We tried guys. 🙏🏽 — AKA (@akaworldwide) February 17, 2017

Guys, Don't ever love a woman more than she loves you. 💔 February 17, 2017

It's not the first time the two have experienced drama. This is the second time that the hot-headed artist has tweeted that the couple have called it quits, our sister site Channel 24 reported. He tweeted last year that they have split, but deleted the post a couple of minutes later, saying that they had a fight and are back together.

Only this time, he left the post up for a good few hours with no signs of backtracking by the end of the day.

Of course, there is the possibility that it may all have been an elaborate publicity stunt.

Matheba's met AKA's family. He bought her a $3000 Gucci handbag. Three Thousand Dollars, in case your eyes glazed over that amount. They went to Thailand together for a much Instagrammed holiday. She even let him lick her face that one time.

And just five days ago Bonang posted this gem.

Shona owns Ferguson Films with his wife, actress Connie Ferguson. Their company has produced some of the country's popular TV shows such as Rockville and The Queen.

In a stream of tweets Shona revealed how it wasn't easy being a black producer and usually the source of the disrespect is from the people he gives jobs to.

Don't focus on the flash & think it's been an easy ride. In fact it gets harder everyday. Being a BLACK PRODUCER is not easy. — UNCLE SHO (@Shona_Ferguson) February 17, 2017

You are disrespected and ill treated for doing good, creating jobs & giving people opportunities to do what they love & earn a living... February 17, 2017 You work hard to contribute to the industry & grow it but it's the very people that you give these opportunities to that spit in your face.. — UNCLE SHO (@Shona_Ferguson) February 17, 2017

He went on to mention that white producers are not treated the same.

White producers are never disrespected by black folks. It's sad that it's our brothers & sisters who wish you ill because u r doing well... — UNCLE SHO (@Shona_Ferguson) February 17, 2017

Some of his followers wondered what had set him off:

@Shona_Ferguson Who has annoyed my uncle? Not amused. — Theresa Ntshutelang (@_Chedza) February 18, 2017

@Shona_Ferguson wuu what have they done to you? — Boni (@inobandras) February 18, 2017

Shona acknowledged that it came with the territory and he wasn't complaining and at the end of the day it was about the work he is quite passionate about.

I'm not complaining, it's part of the business. If I wasn't passionate about what I do I wouldn't do it... — UNCLE SHO (@Shona_Ferguson) February 17, 2017

It's about the work. @Connie_Ferguson & I, through @FERGUSON_FILMS have been delivering A+ coz we work hard. We ❤️ & appreciate what we do.. — UNCLE SHO (@Shona_Ferguson) February 17, 2017

He finished off with a warning for some industry folk.

This is a very small industry. Be careful how you treat people & how you behave. When u are out of work tomorrow just know it's all on YOU.. — UNCLE SHO (@Shona_Ferguson) February 17, 2017Samantha Cameron has revealed how the death of her young son, Ivan, “overshadows everything”.

The fashion entrepreneur said his premature death in 2009, the year before David Cameron entered No 10, was of such magnitude that it made everything else “irrelevant” and “meaningless”, reports the Press Association.

Their first child, Ivan was born with a severe form of epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died shortly before his seventh birthday.

John Giles/PA Archive Samantha and David Cameron with Ivan in 2008.

In an emotional interview for The Times she described how they had to cope with regular “life or death situations” throughout the youngster’s life, yet it came as a “huge shock”.

Mrs Cameron said she sought strength from her faith and found hosting charity events at Downing Street cathartic, although she would often be brought to tears when meeting children and parents in similar situations.

Meanwhile the experience coloured her husband’s politics, she told the newspaper.

“It’s the biggest thing in my life. Being the prime minister’s wife was just a role,” she said.

“Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant. It just overshadows everything. What goes on in the outside world becomes meaningless.

Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive The Cameron's at Ivan's funeral in 2009.

“Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice.”

Mrs Cameron said the couple relied on routine so they did not “fall apart completely” and they still visit Ivan’s grave “very often”.

When Mr Cameron announced his resignation after losing the referendum in June he appeared on the steps of Downing Street flanked by his wife and Ivan’s siblings, Nancy, Florence and Arthur, who had grown up the flat above No 11.

In a way their brother’s death had helped her prepare for the “parallel universe” of life in Westminster, Mrs Cameron explained.

“I think it changed Dave’s politics. It made him understanding, although he couldn’t be too subjective,” she said.

The family now spend their time between homes in Notting Hill, west London, and Oxfordshire, where Mr Cameron served as MP for Witney for 15 years.

Mrs Cameron, who worked for British leather brand Smythson while he was PM, has now launched her own women’s wear label, Ceffin.ÉTATS-UNIS - Candidat déconcertant pendant sa campagne, Donald Trump est un président qui l'est tout autant. Ses usages des médias et des réseaux sociaux continuent d'étonner, tout comme sa façon de malmener les journalistes. Le président, comme l'était le candidat, est extrêmement prolixe sur Twitter.

Mais ses messages doivent-ils tous être scrutés avec la même attention? Contiennent-ils tous une parole qui engage sa présidence? Ces questions ne sont pas encore tranchées pour les journalistes américains, régulièrement désarçonnés par certaines déclarations sur Twitter de Donald Trump.

Ainsi, le 15 février, le président publie: "La Crimée a été annexée sous le mandat d'Obama. Obama était-il trop gentil avec la Russie?" Une saillie qui étonne, jusqu'à ce que certains journalistes relèvent que cet argument avait été avancé quelques minutes auparavant sur la matinale de FoxNews.

Cette façon de commenter de manière intempestive ce qu'il regarde à la télévision est une habitude visiblement bien campée de Donald Trump, comme vous pouvez le voir dans notre vidéo en tête d'article. Avec une tendance à reprendre pour lui les idées des journalistes et invités de FoxNews, tandis qu'il critique en direct CNN, qui lui est généralement moins favorable.

Ainsi, il suggère d'envoyer la police fédérale à Chicago pour arrêter le "carnage" qui s'y déroule, s'appuyant sur les chiffres présentés sur FoxNews. Quand cette même chaîne désigne Chelsea Manning comme étant une "traitresse ingrate", Donald Trump tweete la même expression quelques instants plus tard. Commenter ce que l'on regarde à la télévision, rien d'étonnant pour un accro à Twitter. Sauf s'il est aussi le président de la première puissance mondiale.

La police malaisienne a annoncé samedi l'arrestation d'un Nord-Coréen dans le cadre de l'enquête sur le meurtre du demi-frère du dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-Un, dont le corps est au centre d'une bataille entre Pyongyang et Kuala Lumpur.

L'homme arrêté vendredi soir était en possession de documents fournis aux travailleurs étrangers qui ont permis de l'identifier comme étant Ri Jong Chol, un Nord-Coréen de 46 ans, a précisé la police dans un communiqué.

Cette arrestation porte à quatre le nombre de personnes détenues depuis l'assassinat spectaculaire lundi de Kim Jong-Nam, imputé par Séoul à des agents oeuvrant pour la Corée du Nord.

Des experts malaisiens ont effectué vendredi des analyses d'échantillons du défunt, afin de déterminer la substance toxique qui a apparemment été aspergée sur son visage au moment où il s'apprêtait à prendre un avion à l'aéroport de Kuala Lumpur.

Mais samedi, le ministre de la Santé a prévenu que cette analyse pourrait prendre jusqu'à deux semaines, et qu'aucune information ne serait communiquée "tant que nous n'aurons pas trouvé quelque chose de sûr".

Dans la soirée, l'ambassadeur nord-coréen en Malaisie est monté au créneau lors d'une déclaration à la presse faite devant la morgue de Kuala Lumpur où se trouve le corps de Kim Jong-Nam depuis mercredi.

Kang Chol a affirmé que son pays rejetterait les résultats de l'autopsie, car "la Malaisie l'a imposée, sans notre autorisation et sans que nous y participions". Il a ajouté qu'il avait "fermement" demandé la restitution du corps au chef de la police malaisienne mais que ce dernier avait refusé.

Il s'agit de la première réaction officielle nord-coréenne depuis l'assassinat, mais l'ambassadeur s'est gardé d'identifier Kim Jung-Nam ou d'évoquer les circonstances de sa mort.

Échantillons ADN

Kuala Lumpur a prévenu que le corps ne serait pas remis à Pyongyang tant que les procédures ne seraient pas achevées.

"Jusqu'ici, aucun membre de la famille ou proche n'est venu identifier ou réclamer le corps. Nous avons besoin d'échantillons ADN d'un membre de la famille pour établir le profil de la personne décédée", a déclaré à l'AFP Abdul Samah Mat, chef de la police de l'Etat de Selangor, où est situé l'aéroport.

"La Corée du Nord a adressé une demande pour la restitution du corps, mais avant de le remettre, nous avons besoin d'identifier le corps", a-t-il ajouté.

"Ils sont de mèche avec des forces qui nous sont hostiles", a répliqué l'ambassade nord-coréenne, en insinuant qu'il s'agirait d'une tentative de la Corée du Sud pour porter atteinte à son voisin du nord.

Les relations entre Pyongyang et Kuala Lumpur étaient jusqu'à présent cordiales, et les visiteurs des deux pays sont exemptés de visa, un cas rare pour les ressortissants nord-coréens.

La police interrogeait deux suspectes, l'une détentrice d'un passeport vietnamien, l'autre d'un passeport indonésien, ainsi que le petit ami de cette dernière, un Malaisien.

Kim Jong-Nam, 45 ans, avait été attaqué lundi par deux femmes qui lui auraient jeté un liquide au visage à l'aéroport, où il devait embarquer pour Macao.

L'homme s'est ensuite plaint de maux de tête et hurlait de douleur avant de succomber pendant son transfert à l'hôpital.

La Corée du Sud a pointé du doigt son voisin du Nord, citant un "ordre permanent" du dictateur Kim Jong-Un pour éliminer son demi-frère, et une tentative d'assassinat manquée en 2012, après que Kim Jong-Nam avait critiqué le régime le plus fermé au monde.

Des correspondants de l'AFP à Pyongyang ont constaté que les célébrations jeudi pour l'anniversaire de la naissance de Kim Jong-Il, le défunt père des deux Kim, s'étaient déroulées sans allusion à l'assassinat.

Jeu télévisé

La police malaisienne a arrêté mercredi une femme de 28 ans détentrice d'un passeport vietnamien sous l'identité de Doan Thi Huong.

Des enquêteurs ont ensuite interpellé Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin, un Malaisien de 26 ans. Celui-ci a permis à la police d'appréhender sa petite amie, Siti Aishah, une Indonésienne de 25 ans.

D'après Tito Karnavian, chef de la police indonésienne, des inconnus auraient fait croire à la jeune femme qu'elle participait à un jeu télévisé du style "caméra cachée" dont le but était d'asperger le visage de la victime d'un liquide inoffensif.

"Elle ne s'est pas rendu compte qu'il s'agissait d'une tentative d'assassinat", a déclaré M. Karnavian à des médias indonésiens.

Kim Jong-Nam, un temps pressenti pour être l'héritier du régime, était tombé en disgrâce après avoir été arrêté en 2001 à l'aéroport de Tokyo avec un passeport falsifié de la République dominicaine.

Kim Jong-Nam avait ensuite vécu de fait en exil avec sa famille, à Macao, Singapour ou en Chine.

D'après le journaliste japonais Yoji Gomi qui lui a consacré un livre, Kim voulait introduire des "réformes et des mesures de libéralisation comme l'avait fait la Chine".

Les annonces de purges, d'exécutions et de disparitions - certaines confirmées, d'autres non - sont fréquentes depuis l'arrivée au pouvoir de Kim Jong-Un fin 2011.

Oh, this is good.

In the video above by Cut, several couples openly talk about the first time they had sex together. And not only do these lovebirds get super detailed for five minutes, they have some pretty hilarious stories, too.

"I think he kicked the dog out, shut the door," one woman said. "[Shut] the curtains so the dog couldn't even look in, go play with the squirrels," her partner replied.

And it gets better.

But first-time sex isn't always picture perfect.

It can be nerve-wracking, embarrassing and for many, hard to achieve orgasm. And remember, there is always some type of awkwardness involved.

"If your relationship is casual, and you spend a lot of time and effort setting the mood for the first time, you might be setting yourself up for more awkwardness,” sex therapist Vanessa Marin says. "Make a few jokes, acknowledge the awkwardness, then try to enjoy your time together."

Communication is key, and like always, practice makes perfect.

But the video also makes something else very clear: sex with your significant other changes over time.

Whether you have kids or just a different kind of connection, it's clear sex means something completely different than it did when you first got together.

Watch the full video above.Se siete stati miracolosamente risparmiati dal marketing, vi ricordo che è da poco passato San Valentino. E forse siete come me.

Sono cresciuta guardando film Disney e commedie romantiche. Il Principe Azzurro, "e vissero felici e contenti", i primi incontri perfetti, I gesti grandiosi pieni di suspense ed emozione e così via, eccetera eccetera. Ah, quella sensazione rassicurante e indistinta. Tutto quel "oh mio dio, il ragazzo perfetto è davvero perfetto". Quella speranza che, un giorno, avrai anche tu qualcuno che si farà largo a spintoni nella folla di un aeroporto strapieno per impedirti di salire su quell'aereo ed esibirsi in un monologo strappalacrime sul perché dovete stare insieme.

Sì, guardo ancora commedie romantiche. E, sì, le adoro ancora.

Come coppia, non festeggiamo San Valentino. Qualcuno di voi inorridirà. A qualcun altro non interesserà per niente. E altri tra voi appoggeranno in pieno questa presa di posizione. Non ho niente contro San Valentino. È solo un'occasione che abbiamo deciso di non festeggiare, di comune accordo.

A dire il vero, prima andavo matta per i gesti romantici. Le grandi dimostrazioni d'amore. Quei momenti da favola, pianificati alla perfezione, che ti tolgono il respiro.

È divertente però, perché dopo dieci anni e due figli, vedo l'amore e il romanticismo sotto una luce completamente diversa. E posso dire con sincerità che, ora, sono scesa a patti col fatto che non ci regaleremo fiori e cioccolatini di rito. E mi va bene così. Lo giuro. Carissimo marito, in caso te lo stessi chiedendo, non è un trabochetto.

Gesti importanti, fiori, cioccolatini vanno benissimo, ma di recente ho deciso d'impegnarmi a notare le piccole cose che succedono ogni giorno e che mi dimostrano cos'è l'amore.

Quando inizi a cercare queste piccole cose, ci vedi l'amore dentro. Sono dappertutto. Provateci.

L'amore è quell'ora in più di sonno che lui ti concede e di cui non ti sei accorta finché, svegliandoti, non ti sei sentita un po' più "umana".

L'amore è quello sguardo segreto, quella risata sommessa che vi scambiate quando il vostro bambino dice o fa qualcosa di divertente e forse anche leggermente inappropriato.

L'amore è la bottiglia d'acqua fresca che appare magicamente sul tuo comodino, perché lui sa che ti viene sete quando ti svegli per allattare il bimbo ogni due ore.

L'amore è rendersi conto che è passata una settimana e tu non hai lavato neanche un piatto perché ci ha pensato lui.

L'amore è quel momento in cui siete in stanze diverse, cercando di far addormentare i bambini, e improvvisamente senti le farfalle nello stomaco all'idea che, di lì a poco, passerai del tempo con il tuo migliore amico.

L'amore è in quella conversazione sul divano quando entrambi indossate pantaloni da tuta e mangiate cibo thai direttamente dalla confezione, scambiandovi aneddoti sui vostri figli e guardando video dove sono adorabili anche se hanno dormito solo cinque minuti.

L'amore è in quei momenti in cui vi incazzate l'uno con l'altro, e poi vi rendete conto che essere arrabbiati non è divertente e che vi manca il vostro compagno, così ve ne fate una ragione e chiedete scusa.

L'amore è nell'empatia che lui ti mostra quando entrambi sapete fin troppo bene che, in questo particolare momento, sei in preda agli ormoni e forse anche un tantino irrazionale.

L'amore è l'effetto che ti fa il messaggio in cui ti dice che torna a casa prima.

L'amore è renderti conto che sei impaziente di vederlo varcare la soglia di casa alla fine di ogni giornata, proprio come lo è vostro figlio. E non solo perché questo significa che ci sono più adulti in servizio, al comando delle truppe, ma perché la tua metà è lì con te e ti rende felice.

L'amore è lui che accetta le tue ossessive regole d'igiene, quando usa le tue apposite spugnette da cucina perfettamente a norma, senza fare una piega.

L'amore è quel momento in cui provi a far addormentare tuo figlio e non ce la fai più, ma arriva lui e si occupa di tutta la trafila di carezze e coccole. E tu siedi sul bordo del letto e lo osservi mentre ama vostro figlio.

L'amore non si trova sempre nei grandi momenti. Anzi, molto più spesso, è in quei tanti momenti apparentemente insignificanti, transitori, che costellano la vostra giornata. I momenti che ti passano davanti senza che tu te ne accorga, perché sei troppo occupata ad aspettare che i violini inizino a suonare e i fuochi d'artificio esplodano in cielo.

Fai un bilancio dei momenti della tua giornata. Ti assicuro che resterai sorpresa di fronte alla miriade di cose che, in realtà, non saranno altro che il vostro modo di dimostrarvi amore reciproco. Che l'amore è talmente radicato nella vostra vita insieme da pervadere gran parte delle vostre azioni e decisioni quotidiane. Le cose che fai e che pensi non siano così importanti ma che, osservate da vicino, nascono dall'amore che provate l'uno per l'altro.

Preferirei questo ai fiori e ai cioccolatini, in qualsiasi momento.Avec la newsletter quotidienne du HuffPost, recevez par email les infos les plus importantes et les meilleurs articles du jour. En savoir plusWhen one of our favourite emerging designers - Matty Bovan - worked with one of our favourite models - Winnie Harlow - only one thing was going to happen.

This amazing awesomeness at London Fashion Week.

Rex

Last year, Bovan was feted after being hand-picked by Fashion East as the sole newcomer to their London Fashion Week catwalk. Since graduating from Central Saint Martins last year, the 26-year-old designer has worked with Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu; he has also been mentored by the one and only Katie Grand.

Bovan has always been a champion of model diversity, and this year’s show which featured the most divine layering of prints, colours and textures isn’t any different.

Here’s a quick peek at some of the ladies backstage:

Big things were expected this year at Fashion East’s AW17 show. After his show last year, he said: “I wanted it to say ‘I’m here’ — I am here. I am H-E-R-E — here!”

He certainly is.American talkshow host Bill Maher lambasted Republicans on Friday night in an impassioned speech condemning right-wing politicians for letting Donald Trump “get away with pretty much anything” just because he is a Republican.

The Real Time host questioned why Republicans were so willing to give those with the “magic” capital R after their name such an easy ride.

The presenter said that, had a member of the Democrat party made such derogatory comments about the US, the Republicans would have been highly critical of them.

Maher said:

“I’ve got to say to all you flag waving right-wingers who are always say ‘I’m not just gonna stand her and let you run down America’, you’re standing there and letting Trump run down America.”

“When Trump said ‘I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t loose voters, he wasn’t making a joke. He’s never made a joke unless his entire life is some sort of Andy Coffman-style performance, in which case stop it. No, he was simply stating an actual fact for once, which is if you have the magic ‘R’ after your name you can drive a hummer through a daycare centre and Fox News will say the babies were asking for it.”

“America is the Republican party’s bitch and they can criticise and betray her but you can’t.”

“Why do Republicans get away with this? Why do they have patriotic immunity? America is like a dysfunctional family where the Democrats are the older, mature son who works hard and does everything right, but somehow is never good enough. And the Republicans are the young asshole son who’s a fuck up no matter how many times he crashes the Camaro, daddy buys him a new one.”

비상장 유한회사도 주식회사처럼 철저한 외부감사를 받도록 하고 주요 재무정보를 공시하도록 한 법률 개정안이 최근 국무회의를 통과하면서 국내에 진출한 해외 사치품 업체들이 바짝 긴장하고 있다.

루이뷔통과 구찌 등 국내에 진출한 유럽계 사치품 업체들은 유통업체를 상대로 한 '갑질'과 터무니 없이 낮은 한국 사회 공헌도 등으로 여론의 뭇매를 맞자 잇따라 유한회사로 전환하면서 '비밀주의'를 강화했다.

샤넬과 에르메스 등은 아예 처음부터 유한회사 형태로 국내에 진출했다.

18일 패션업계에 따르면 루이뷔통코리아와 구찌코리아, 에르메스코리아 등 업체들은 비상장 유한회사도 주식회사에 준하는 수준의 외부감사를 받고 주요 재무정보를 공시하도록 한 '주식회사의 외부감사에 관한 법률'(외감법)이 국무회의를 통과하자 긴장한 분위기다.

이들은 '비쌀수록 잘 팔리는' 한국 사치품 시장의 속성을 이용해 뚜렷한 근거도 없이 수시로 가격을 올리고, 백화점과 면세점 등을 상대로 우월적 지위를 이용해 '갑질'을 일삼는 등 지탄의 대상이 돼왔다.

입점을 대가로 매장 수수료를 대폭 낮춰달라고 요구하거나 매장 인테리어비를 유통업체 측에 떠넘기는 행위 등이 대표적이다.

국내 백화점과 면세점 등은 이들의 입점 여부가 매출에 절대적 영향을 미치기 때문에 울며 겨자 먹기로 이들의 요구를 들어줄 수밖에 없는 경우가 많다.

한 백화점 관계자는 "샤넬이나 루이뷔통 등 주요 명품업체들의 '갑질'은 이루 다 꼽을 수가 없을 정도"라면서도 "그들의 심기를 건드릴까 봐 대놓고 비판할 수도 없는 분위기"라고 전했다.

해외 사치품 업체들은 2011~2015년 사이 유통업체를 상대로 한 '갑질'과 본사 배당금에 비해 터무니없이 낮은 한국 사회 공헌 등으로 여론의 뭇매를 맞았다.

바른정당 홍일표 의원(인천 남구갑)은 2016년 10월 열렸던 금융위원회 국정감사에서 외국계 사치품 업체들의 도덕적 해이를 강하게 질타하기도 했다.

당시 홍 의원은 "지난해 11월 기준으로 프라다코리아, 버버리코리아, 페라가모코리아, 불가리코리아, 스와치그룹코리아 등 외국계 명품업체가 한국에서 돈을 벌어 본사에 배당한 액수는 1천117억원에 달한다"며 "외국계 기업들이 한국에서 이익만 빼가고 사회 환원이나 재투자는 거의 없다"고 질타했다.

프라다코리아같은 회사는 2010년 한 해에만 국내에서 벌어들인 돈이 기준으로 194억원에 달했지만 2006~2010년까지 5년 연속 기부금 실적은 '0'이었다.

이처럼 높은 본사 배당률과 낮은 사회 공헌 등으로 여론의 비판을 받자 이들은 문제점을 개선하기는커녕 일제히 기부금 규모 등의 재무정보 공시 의무가 없는 유한회사로 전환, 정보통제를 강화하는 '꼼수'로 대응했다.

루이뷔통코리아는 2012년 법인 형태를 주식회사에서 유한회사로 전환했으며 구찌코리아는 2014년 유한회사로 잇따라 법인 형태를 바꿨다.

샤넬코리아와 같은 회사는 1991년 10월 국내에 진출할 때부터 유한회사 형태로 법인을 설립해 20년 넘게 구체적 재무정보가 공개된 적이 한 번도 없다.

업계 관계자는 "정치권과 언론 등에서 제기한 문제점을 개선하기는커녕 비밀주의 강화로 대응했던 해외 사치품 업체들이 외감법 강화로 곤혹스런 입장에 처했을 것"이라며 "삼성전자나 현대자동차 같은 국내 기업들도 해외에서 사업하려면 현지 소비자들의 마음을 사로잡기 위해 다양한 사회공헌 활동을 하는데 이들도 태도를 바꿀 필요가 있다"고 지적했다.Lo suyo no pudo ser. Ni por asalto ni por consenso. Iglesias le ganó y ahora su próximo núcleo irradiador tendrá que girar en torno a la Puerta del Sol, debajo justo del famoso reloj y frente a la baldosa que a algunos turistas hace sentir en el mismísimo epicentro de España. Iñigo Errejón emprende un nuevo viaje. Esta vez al kilómetro 0.

La decisión está tomada y consensuada. Se anunciará en breve en un acto e el que participarán Iglesias, Errejón y el secretario general de Madrid, Ramón Espinar. El que fuera número dos de Podemos será el próximo candidato de los morados a la Comunidad de Madrid -primarias mediante, claro- y después de rechazar la posibilidad de ocupar el cartel al Ayuntamiento capitalino, que fue la primera oferta que le planteó el líder de su partido. Será que el politólogo es más de municipios que de distritos, que prefiere lo autonómico a lo local o que, quizá, se vea más de presidente -aunque sea regional- que de alcalde, por muy importante que sea el Consistorio.

Pudo haber aceptado la propuesta tras el verano pasado, que fue la primera vez que habló del asunto con Pablo Iglesias, cuando éste tuvo algo más que indicios de que pretendía crear su propio partido dentro del partido y le planteó la oportunidad de que se curtiera en la política local, sumara experiencia de gestión con una victoria de la izquierda y se colocara así el primero en la rampa de salida para cuando se abriera en Podemos la sucesión del actual secretario general.

Errejón pudo haber aceptado la propuesta tras el verano pasado, que fue la primera vez que habló con Iglesias del asunto

Errejón nunca rechazó el ofrecimiento, sino que lo dejó en “stand by” a la espera del resultado de Vistalegre II. Fue así como aceptó el primer pulso (las primarias de Madrid), el segundo (la consulta de diciembre) y el tercero (la Asamblea Ciudadana), siempre convencido de que su fuerza era homologable a la del número uno y su proyecto, más certero para el asalto a los cielos del poder, en este caso, el orgánico. Erró en el cálculo. Y, tras su derrota, el final estaba escrito: los dos no podrían convivir ya en el mismo espacio político. No compartían modelo organizativo, ni estrategia ni equipos, por lo que la cohabitación se antojaba difícil, cuando no imposible.

Pero como dice Iglesias que la paz siempre se construye sobre los resultados de una guerra, es probable que la concordia entre ambos vuelva cuando cada cual ocupe un universo distinto, uno en la arena nacional y el otro en la política madrileña.

La operación ha sido consensuada con Espinar, que lo ha entendido como una salida necesaria para garantizar la paz en Podemos

La operación ha sido consensuada con el secretario general de Madrid, Ramón Espinar, que ha entendido la decisión de Iglesias no sólo como una salida necesaria para garantizar la paz en Podemos, sino como una oportunidad de que la izquierda recupere Madrid, tras más de 20 años de gobiernos de la derecha. Ya en 2015 y con un candidato desconocido entonces como era José Manuel López, PSOE y Podemos sumaron 64 escaños, tan sólo uno por debajo de la mayoría absoluta.

Quien más reparos han puesto a que Errejón se mida con Cristina Cifuentes han sido los anticapitalistas, que tras el congreso de Madrid que enfrentó a Rita Maestre con Espinar vieron reforzada su influencia tras una alianza con el sector “pablista” que resultó decisiva para decantar la batalla en favor del hoy secretario regional. Desde entonces, cambió su estatus interno al convertirse en apoyo sustancial de Iglesias en su disputa con Errejón. De ahí que la operación Kilómetro 0 para Errejón precise, además de unas primarias previas, una candidatura de unidad. Hasta este extremo está ya hablado. Y todo a dos años vista de las próximas municipales y autonómicas.El presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, tiene un problema de imagen en el exterior. Desde la edición estadounidense de The Huffington Post aseguran que el magnate está acomplejado por el tamaño de sus manos.

Debido al complejo de Trump, los usuarios de Reddit han creado una página llamada Tiny Trump (Diminuto Trump) en el que han compartido todo tipo de bromas con el presidente de los Estados Unidos encogido, como en la famosa película de finales de los 80 Cariño, he encogido a los niños.

Las fotografías de Trump en tamaño diminuto hace que su comportamiento se vea reducido al absurdo. Estos son algunos de los mejores montajes del presidente encogido.

En savoir plusLos españoles Willy Hernangómez y Álex Abrines se han estrenado con triunfo en un All Star de la NBA al imponerse con el combinado del resto del mundo al equipo de jugadores estadounidenses (150-141) en el Rising Stars Challenge, con el que ha dado comienzo el fin de semana de las estrellas en Nueva Orleans (Estados Unidos).

El Smoothie King Center, el base canadiense de Denver Nuggets Jamal Murray lideró a la selección mundial con un total de 36 puntos, incluidos nueve triples, en un partido, como es habitual, caracterizado por la falta de defensas y por el espacio para el lucimiento de cara a aro de los jugadores.

Además, el exjugador del CB Sevilla -ahora Real Betis Energía Plus- y compañero de Willy Hernangómez en los Knicks Kristaps Porzingis también tuvo su noche; el ala-pívot letón, que vive su segunda temporada en la NBA, logró un 'doble-doble' de 24 tantos y 10 rebotes.

Abrines y Hernangómez, que entraron a última hora en el encuentro por las bajas por lesión del camerunés Joel Embiid (Philadelphia Sixers) y del congoleño Emmanuel Mudiay (Denver Nuggets), se unieron a la fiesta en Nueva Orleans, envuelta en Mardi Gras.

El balear de Oklahoma City Thunder disfrutó de casi 13 minutos en pista, en los que tuvo tiempo de anotar tres puntos -1 de 5 triples- y dar una asistencia.

The election results only happened last week, yet in some ways it feels like a lifetime. So much is changing in our country. However, whether we like it or not, a lot won't change around climate action unless we take a stand.ADVERTISEMENT

Nous est-il possible d'avoir de la peine pour quelqu'un ou dans ce cas-ci, pour un groupe, sans tomber dans l'autoflagellation, le déni de soi et l'aplaventrisme.

Depuis un siècle, nous accueillons l'immigration d'où qu'elle vienne. Europe, Asie, Afrique, Amérique et Océanie. De toutes religions confondues, bouddhistes, brahmanes, orthodoxes, judaïsâtes, musulmans, témoins de Jehova et j'en passe. Nous avons même la scientologie et les raëliens. Dites-moi que nous ne sommes pas accommodants.

Mais, le dimanche 29 janvier 2017, un jeune exalté peut être aveuglé par une xénophobie dévorante, on ne le sait pas encore, en est venu à tuer six personnes et à en blesser quatre autres. Je sais, c'est révoltant, barbare, cruel et inutile. Il n'y a pas de mots pouvant décrire une telle horreur.

Maintenant que c'est dit. À partir du lundi 30 janvier, tous les membres des différents gouvernements sont venus se flageller publiquement à quelques reprises et ceci en notre nom. Même, un député fédéral de dire: «Pardonnez-nous de ne pas en avoir assez fait». Puis, le maire d'annoncer une première somme de 50 000$ comme assistance aux victimes. Puis, le premier ministre Couillard en remet une couche lors d'une émission télé. Nous aurons des lois anti islamophobes. Pourquoi? Je ne savais pas que je me trouvais en pleine Allemagne Nazi, entouré de xénophobes prêts à en découdre avec une minorité devenue visible.

En moins de quatre jours, quatre dangereux terroristes ont été arrêtés. Un a lancé des œufs, l'autre un pétard, un autre a fait des menaces aux maires qu'on a cachés pendant un temps, un dernier ayant incité à la haine. Sur neuf millions d'habitants, quatre épais ont décidé d'exprimer un trop-plein de frustrations. Alors, le mot est lâché... «De l'islamophobie systémique». Il y a quelques semaines, c'était la culture du viol, les Québécois étaient des violeurs potentiels. Quels tarés nous sommes!

Le 29 janvier journée nationale du souvenir de la lutte contre l'islamophobie.

Municipal: Attribution d'effectifs supplémentaires pour les crimes haineux.

Provincial: Création d'une direction générale contre le racisme.

Fédéral: Voter la motion pour éliminer le racisme systémique et la discrimination religieuse.

Maintenant, les groupes musulmans font des demandes aux gouvernements:

Nous en sommes à la mi-février, l'autoflagellation n'a pas cessé, il en faut plus. Montréal deviendra un sanctuaire, le gouvernement du Québec tente avec beaucoup d'ardeur, de sabrer dans Bouchard Taylor. Taylor lui-même se dissocie de ses recommandations.

Est-il possible que collectivement nous trainions encore avec nous ce bagage judéo-chrétien qui nous pousse à prendre sur nos épaules les actes d'un seul homme contre une communauté.

«Les Canadiens» bien moins racistes que nous s'en sont donné à cœur joie. Les Québécois devenus xénophobes, racistes et islamophobes. Eux qui emploient des mots comme frog, niggers, wops, faggets et qui font régulièrement du Québec Bashing comme sport national.

Sans vouloir être méchant, lors des attentats de St-Jean et d'Ottawa, je n'ai pas vu de mouvement de foule, ni d'autoflagellation de la part d'imams musulmans ou de chefs de cette communauté. Pas plus que pour la majorité canadienne dans l'affaire du Métropolis, ou un homme est mort par erreur sous les balles d'un anglophone envahi par la même haine.

C'est à qui serait le plus désolé, qui fera quelque chose de plus, qui dira le meilleur mot.

Citations Blogue

J'ai beaucoup de peine pour tout ce qui arrive, des pères, des frères, des maris sont morts et cela doit nous attrister. Mais là ou j'arrête, c'est cette manière de faire qui nous rend coupables par association. Le pire, ce ne sont pas les victimes qui le font, mais bien nos élus, nos édiles. C'est à qui serait le plus désolé, qui fera quelque chose de plus, qui dira le meilleur mot.

Le ministre Blais disant qu'il va regarder comment aider cette pauvre mère devenue veuve avec ses enfants. Pendant ce temps, d'autres femmes tout aussi miséreuses demandent de l'aide, sans même recevoir un accusé de réception. «Nous construirons un cimetière musulman.» Tiens donc! C'est donc à nos dirigeants à faire ce travail.

J'écoutais il y a un temps déjà, un reportage sur Charlie Hebdo. Le monde entier avait trouvé triste cette tuerie. Pourtant, tous les «islamistes modérés» ont répété qu'ils avaient insulté Allah et le prophète. Je n'ai pas vu d'autoflagellation ni de grande compassion. Ici, il arrive que quelques imams prêchent la violence contre les impies, mais les autorités se gardent une petite gêne. Mieux, à Québec, on reporte une conférence de Mme Benhabib pour ne pas choquer la communauté musulmane de Québec. Plus crêpe que ça...

Je ne sais pas pour vous, mais je commence à sentir une certaine tension. Il me semble que le deux poids deux mesures et l'électoralisme cousu de fils blancs, sautent aux yeux de la population. En voulant en faire trop et recherchant des votes, nos dirigeants se couvrent et nous couvrent de ridicule.

Ne pas porter de signes qui se veulent religieux pour la fonction publique, c'est ça la laïcité. Pour le reste, le vivre ensemble c'est ce que nous préconisons depuis plus de cent ans.

더불어민주당 대선주자인 안희정 충남지사가 18일 강남의 한복판에서 기득권 질서의 타파를 강력히 주장했다.

서울 강남구 청담아트홀에서 열린 '안희정과 함께 바꿉시다. 전무후무 즉문즉답'에서다.

200여명의 시민들이 참석한 가운데 열린 이날 행사는 최근 바람을 일으키며 지지율이 급상승하는 '안희정 현상' 반영하듯 질문 열기가 뜨거웠다.

노무현 전 대통령의 '적자'를 자임해온 안 지사는 노 전 대통령이 기존 기득권 질서에 맞서왔다는 점을 들어 민주주의의 원리가 제대로 작동하는 공정하고 혁신적인 사회를 만들 자신이 있다고 역설했다.

안 지사는 "우리 사회는 동종교배의 마지막 단계에 들어가 있다. 더 이상 활력이 안 나온다"면서 "지역이란 동종교배, 학교 학연이란 동종교배, 낡은 이념이라는 동종교배, 그 틀에만 들어가면 '얘는 법 없이도 살 놈'이라며 팔이 안으로 굽는다"고 지적했다.

그러면서 "노 전 대통령 때 장관들을 준비 안 된 사람이라고 그렇게 비난들을 했다. 그러나 그것이 기존에 밀어주고 당겨주던 그들의 기득권 질서 밖의 사람들을 밀어내고자 하는 저항이었다"라며 "그 저항에 정말 의기 있게 버티면서 대한민국의 큰 틀의 변화를 이끈 분이 노 전 대통령"이라고 말했다.

그는 "민주주의를 통해 우리는 바로 모든 사람에게 공정한 기회를 만들어내는 틀로 가야한다"면서 "민주주의와 새로운 공정한 사회질서를 위한 제 도전이 곳곳에 있는 우리 사회의 관행을 깨는 계기가 될 것"이라고 강조했다.

안 지사는 "정치와 민주주의 영역에서의 문제는 효율성과 경쟁의 결과에 따른 문제가 아니라 공정경쟁을 가로막는 독점적인 구조를 깨는 게 핵심"이라고 설명했다.

그는 "비즈니스 프렌들리라고 청와대에 재벌들을 불러 밥을 산다고 해서 일자리가 안 생긴다"면서 "새로운 도전이 가능해야한다. 민주주의를 통해 과학과 금융, 경제산업생태계를 혁신해야 한다"고 강조했다.

안 지사는 국민의당 안철수 전 대표와 전날 국민의당에 입당한 손학규 전 민주당 대표의 대표적인 슬로건에 공감대를 표시해 눈길을 끌기도 했다.

안 지사는 "안 전 대표가 LG동물원 SK동물원을 이야기한 대로 문어발식 확장을 통한 대기업의 내부거래를 끊어낸다면 많은 경우 좀 더 공정한 경쟁과 도전의 시장이 열릴 것"이라며 "이게 구조적 핵심"이라고 말했다.

안 지사는 "우리가 경쟁과 물질적 성장의 가치와 외형적 수술을 중심으로 살아왔는데, 손 전 대표가 5년 전 내건 '저녁이 있는 삶'이란 슬로건이 우리에게 준 충격은 우리 행복을 이루는 구성요소에서 인간이란 가치가 가장 소중하고 중요하다고 알려줬기 때문"이라고 말했다.

그러면서 "다음 정부를 이끌려는 대통령 도전자로서 저는 한 인간과 정치인으로서 가지고 있는 가치와 삶의 철학에 철저히 충실할 것"이라며 "제 도전이 바로 말씀하신 모든 근저의 문제를 해결하는 첫 출발점이 될 것"이라고 강조했다.ADVERTISEMENT

A 24-year-old CPM member from Kolkata has complained against a Rajya Sabha MP from the party to West Bengal CPM secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra, following a row between the two. Sumit Talukdar is a junior member of the party and an IT professional living in Bangalore for the past one-and-half years.

It all started with a Facebook post on CPM RS MP Ritabrata Banerjee which surfaced on the internet and didn't go down well with the more idealistic party members. The communist party MP was photographed wearing an Apple watch and using a using a Mont Blanc Meisterstuck pen which costs upwards Rs 30,000.

The post, which was not made by Talukdar, sarcastically captioned the picture with the following line: "the great leader of the have-nots'.

Now Talukdar is part of a private Facebook group comprising other CPM members on Facebook. When the issue of this photo surfaced on that group, Talukdar made some comments on Banerjee, which of course, were not entirely flattering.

When the issue of this photo surfaced on that group, Talukdar made some comments on Banerjee, which of course, were not entirely flattering.

When these comments were brought to Banerjee's notice, he didn't take to it kindly. So, he posted on his Facebook page that he will lodge an FIR against these people. In his own Facebook post, Banerjee said: "I will take necessary legal steps. Going to Delhi tomorrow morning. Will lodge d FIR wd d desired authorities. Thanks for d intimation. I know d frustrated kingpins behind."

The story gets more twisted from here. Not only did Banerjee contemplate filing an FIR against people displeased with a communist leader wearing an Apple watch, an email landed in Talukdar's employer's inbox, allegedly from Banerjee.

The email, apparently, was a veiled threat where the sender told the employer that he would be lodging an FIR against Talukdar with the Delhi Police. The email also said that 'legal steps' will be taken against Talukdar. The opening line of the email, according to reports, read: "This is Ritabrata Banerjee, Member of the Upper House of the Indian Parliament."

It went on to complain that one of the company's employee was making 'hate speeches' and was trying to 'malign' him on social media and urged the employers to 'look into the matter'. The email signed off with Banerjee's name and a phone number.

The email, apparently, was a veiled threat where the sender told the employer that he would be lodging an FIR against Talukdar with the Delhi Police.

We called on the same number. It was indeed Banerjee's number and he took our call. However, he neither denied, nor confirmed that the email id was his. He refused to acknowledge the mail. All he said was, "I don't know anything about what you're talking about."

Talukdar, why chooses to call Banerjee 'Comrade' and not even a little in jest, said that his employers discussed the issue with him. And apparently, after the first email, Banerjee sent another email to the company asking them to not take any action against Talukdar. "Later, another email was sent by Comrade Ritabrata, where he requested my company head to ignore his last email and not initiate any action against me, as there was some miscommunication and misunderstanding regarding the matter. However, the intended damage had already been done," Talukdar wrote in the letter to the CPM party authorities.

He also wrote that while Banerjee is attacking him for having an opinion, the CPM, ironically, has been regularly criticising other parties over "intolerance", "freedom of speech", "right to criticise".

"Now, an MP and a party member has actually proven himself vindictive enough to destroy my means of employment because of what he assumes is 'hate speech' and 'intent to malign'... a member of the Communist party has actually tried to use his clout as a Rajya Sabha MP to influence my employer to take action against me... This was a deliberate attempt to influence my employer using his constitutional position solely for his personal gain," Talukdar's complaint read.

Talukdar also mentioned in his complaint to the party authorities that he would be forced to take legal action due to the attack on his "sole means of survival". When contacted by HuffPost India, Talukdar refused to comment on the matter. CPM party sources said that the matter has been taken seriously and it will be thoroughly probed.

CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said he was in Burdwan district of West Bengal on a party programme, and would inquire once he was back in Kolkata.

Nach "The Jungle Book" im Jahr 2016 und "Die Schöne und das Biest" ab 16. März 2017 folgt als nächstes die Realverfilmung von "Der König der Löwen". Regisseur Jon Favreau (50) hat nun die ersten Casting-Details verraten. Auf seinem Twitter-Account kündigte er die ersten beiden Schauspieler an, die bei dem Projekt dabei sind: Golden-Globe-Gewinner Donald Glover (33, "Atlanta") und James Earl Jones (86, "Der Prinz aus Zamunda") leihen Simba und Musafa ihre Stimmen.

"Ich kann es kaum erwarten, König zu sein. #Simba", schrieb Favreau zu einem Bild von Glover, auf dem der Schauspieler seinen Rollkragen tief ins Gesicht zieht. Für Glover ist es die nächste große Hollywood-Produktion. Er wird zudem Teil des "Star Wars"-Universums und spielt im "Han Solo"-Spin-off den jungen Lando Calrissian. Das Foto von James Earl Jones kommentierte Favreau wie folgt: "Ich freue mich darauf, mit dieser Legende zusammenzuarbeiten. #Mufasa". Der 86-Jährige lieh dem König des Geweihten Landes bereits im Original seine Stimme.

Carve the Mark by Veronica Roth

From the author who gave us the "Divergent" series comes a new sci-fi fantasy series where people in a distant galaxy develop a currentgift — a power that can shape the future. For Akos and Cyra however, their currentgift makes them vulnerable to others' control, putting their lives in danger. Together, they must defeat their enemies and reset the balance of power in their world.

How To Murder Your Life by Cat Marnell

A former beauty writer who once worked at all the best New York glossies and co-founded xoJane, discusses her life (so far) and all its so-not-chic moments. From her many drug addictions, to her hard-partying ways to her bulimia, Marnell doesn't hide a thing. Funny thing is, her unconventional life still sounds ultra glamorous.

The Woman in Cabin 10 by Ruth Ware

In this gripping thriller, Lo Blacklock is travelling on a luxury liner, and while at first it seems like the best trip of her life, it quickly becomes terrifyingly dark after she witnesses a woman being thrown overboard. Trouble is, all the passengers seem to be accounted for. And so, the journalist tries to uncover the mystery.

Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly

It's the book that sparked a million dreams — and an Oscar-nominated film. Based on the true story of the black female mathematicians at NASA whose work helped American men get into space, the book, and the lives of these women, has inspired girls and women around the world to think among the stars.



Born a Crime by Trevor Noah

Told with humour and grace, the "Daily Show" host recounts his life from growing up during apartheid South Africa to that famous desk, starting with his birth, which was in itself a crime. Noah was born to a white father and a black mother during a time when such an act was punishable by prison. Here, Noah documents the struggle of his family and their ultimate way to freedom.

Books for Living by Will Schwalbe

In his follow-up to the bestseller The End of Your Life Book Club, the author looks for the answers to the big and small questions about how to live his life, and tries to figure out how to make sense of the world in a time of so much noise and connectivity. Each chapter focuses on one book and how he finds meaning within it to understand his part in the world.

My Not So Perfect Life by Sophie Kinsella

Perfectly timed for this social media-obsessed world, the bestselling author's new book explores why the grass is always greener on the other side — especially if that other side is using the perfect filter. Protagonist Katie Brenner longs to live a better life, in particular, the life of her boss, Demeter Farlowe. While Farlowe's glam life looks picture perfect, Katie struggles with her mundane existance, until her boss suddenly fires her, and Katie is forced to move back home to her family farm, where she helps set up a luxe "glamour camping" business.

The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis

A celebration of the collaboration between Israeli psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, this book explores the lives and work of two fascinating men who not only revolutionized science and medicine, but created a whole new field of economics.

The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood

Even though this Canadian classic was published in 1985, it's just as timely now. In a dystopian world, women are not allowed to work, read or have friends. The "Handmaids" only have one job: breed. One such handmaiden, Offred, can't let go of her old life and starts thinking about rebellion.

Swimming Lessons by Claire Fuller

Ingrid Coleman writes letters to her husband about the truth of their marriage, but instead of giving them to him, she hides them within the thousands of books her husband collects. Then, she disappears after she writes her last letter. A dozen years later, her daughter comes home to look after her ailing dad. She doesn't believe that her mother is dead, and begins to question the events of her mother's disappearance.

— Princess~Onyix® (@TheNavalMrs) February 18, 2017Donald Trump has launched another scathing attack on US media, labelling news outlets that question him “the enemy of the American people” a day after one of the most extraordinary White House press conferences in political history.

On Friday the US President ranted on social media (again) about “fake news” outlets, tagging the New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS and CNN.

His latest Twitter outburst follows a combative news conference on Thursday, in which the US President goaded journalists, lied about the extent of his election victory and denied he was racist, whilst asking a black reporter to introduce him to the Congressional Black Caucus and telling a Jewish reporter to be quiet.

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

The Republican billionaire frequently launches tirades against the US media, but has never before called them the “enemy” of the American people.

His comments sparked concern and outrage, with Human Rights Watch advising that the US President read their webpage on press freedom.

Tom Malinowski, former assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, was also shocked by Trump’s words.

Others pointed to countries that have branded journalists enemies of the state.

On Thursday Trump said the media were “out of control” and that he would take his message “straight to the people”.

“I’m making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present... because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect they deserve,” he told journalists at the White House press conference.

He also insisted his chaotic administration was actually a “fine-tuned machine”.

Despite the disastrous press conference Trump’s deputy assistant, Sebastian Gorka, later claimed on Newsnight that it was “fabulous”.Los españoles Willy Hernangómez y Álex Abrines se han estrenado con triunfo en un All Star de la NBA al imponerse con el combinado del resto del mundo al equipo de jugadores estadounidenses (150-141) en el Rising Stars Challenge, con el que ha dado comienzo el fin de semana de las estrellas en Nueva Orleans (Estados Unidos).

El Smoothie King Center, el base canadiense de Denver Nuggets Jamal Murray lideró a la selección mundial con un total de 36 puntos, incluidos nueve triples, en un partido, como es habitual, caracterizado por la falta de defensas y por el espacio para el lucimiento de cara a aro de los jugadores.

Además, el exjugador del CB Sevilla -ahora Real Betis Energía Plus- y compañero de Willy Hernangómez en los Knicks Kristaps Porzingis también tuvo su noche; el ala-pívot letón, que vive su segunda temporada en la NBA, logró un 'doble-doble' de 24 tantos y 10 rebotes.

Abrines y Hernangómez, que entraron a última hora en el encuentro por las bajas por lesión del camerunés Joel Embiid (Philadelphia Sixers) y del congoleño Emmanuel Mudiay (Denver Nuggets), se unieron a la fiesta en Nueva Orleans, envuelta en Mardi Gras.

El balear de Oklahoma City Thunder disfrutó de casi 13 minutos en pista, en los que tuvo tiempo de anotar tres puntos -1 de 5 triples- y dar una asistencia.

Mientras, Willy se lució con un 'alley-oop' para concluir, en sus 15 minutos de juego, con dos tantos, además de dar una asistencia y capturar seis rebotes -todos ellos defensivos-.

The 45-year-old said he was stopped from boarding the aircraft in Qatar, which was flying to Miami on Thursday.

Yorke said a red flag came up against his name because his passport showed he had visited Iran.

Mike Egerton/EMPICS Sport Dwight Yorke said he was 'made to feel like a criminal' when he was denied entry to the US.

“I couldn’t quite believe what was happening. I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal,” Yorke told The Sun.

He said he had bought his ticket, checked in and was about to board the flight when he was stopped by two officials.

The former footballer said he was told there was a problem with his visa due to the Iranian stamp in his passport.

“I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn’t even stay overnight,” Yorke said.

Yorke said he was told that if he got on the flight he “would simply be deported back to Qatar” once he arrived in the US.

Richard Keys, who works for BeIn Sports with Yorke, slammed the incident as “crazy”.

Well done @realDonaldTrump. Man U ambassador Dwight Yorke denied transit access to Miami cause he has Iranian stamp in passport. #crazy — Richard Keys (@richardajkeys) February 17, 2017

In January Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending the US’s refugee program and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

These include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Yorke is not the first sportsman to speak out about Trump’s contentious travel ban.

Last month British Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah, who has lived in Oregon for six years, said the ban was “deeply troubling”.

Farah, who is originally from Somalia, said the US President’s policy “comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice”.

He added: “Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome.”ADVERTISEMENT

La vague de décès par overdose qui frappe le Canada bénéficie aux dons d'organes, un développement aussi paradoxal qu'inattendu de la crise du fentanyl qui fait des ravages en Colombie-Britannique (ouest).

"Il y a plus d'organes disponibles pour des transplantations et une partie de ces organes provient de victimes d'overdoses de drogue", explique David Landsberg, directeur des services médicaux de transplantation de la province de la côte pacifique.

Cette corrélation entre les overdoses au fentanyl, un puissant sédatif, et les greffes d'organes est significative depuis la fin 2016.

Entre le début de l'année et le 15 février, 59 organes provenant de 20 donneurs ont été transplantés dans cette province de l'ouest canadien, selon les données des autorités sanitaires. Le chiffre était de 37 provenant de 10 donneurs pendant la même période en 2016.

Le quart des organes greffés cette année ont été prélevés sur des victimes d'overdose au fentanyl, souligne à l'AFP David Landsberg.

La Colombie-Britannique, "la région la plus durement touchée" par la crise des opioïdes, selon Jane Philpott, ministre fédérale de la Santé, a déploré 914 décès par overdose en 2016, 80% de plus qu'en 2015.

Le fentanyl était en cause dans deux tiers de ces décès.

Et la tendance se maintient: pour le seul mois de janvier, 116 décès par overdose ont été enregistrés, selon les statistiques de la province.

Face à cette situation, Mme Philpott a annoncé vendredi de nouvelles mesures pour endiguer cette crise de santé publique, débloquant 75 millions de dollars canadiens (54 millions d'euros), dont 10 millions en aide d'urgence à la Colombie-Britannique.

Le fentanyl, 100 fois plus puissant que l'héroïne, crée une forte dépendance, selon la police. A l'état pur, deux milligrammes, soit l'équivalent de quatre grains de sel, suffisent pour tuer un adulte.

'Un mal pour un bien'

A l'hôpital Saint Paul, dans le centre de Vancouver, David Landsberg conjugue à regret et trop souvent, les décès tragiques par overdose et les dons d'organes qui sauvent la vie des autres.

"Cela me laisse ambivalent", dit-il après un temps de réflexion. "C'est un mal pour un bien".

"J'aimerais voir la fin de l'épidémie au fentanyl mais j'aimerais aussi que les gens sur des listes d'attente pour des dons d'organes reçoivent de l'aide".

Les victimes d'overdose sont traitées de la même façon que les autres donneurs potentiels. Certaines avaient donné de leur vivant leur consentement. Pour les autres, les médecins peuvent avoir l'accord des familles.

Les prélèvements sont opérés une fois la drogue éliminée par les organes de la victime.

Le personnel médical scrute aussi "méticuleusement" les organes des victimes pour s'assurer de ne pas transmettre de maladies infectieuses, compte tenu du risque plus élevé de contracter le virus du VIH ou une hépatite pour les consommateurs de drogues dures.

"Nous discutons de cela en détail avec les patients en attente d'organes et ne faisons la transplantation qu'avec leur approbation", dit-il.

In the age of personal brands and Instagram, it has become an integral part of modern life to show the world just how much fun you’re having. And on..."Alles frei erfunden" - die "Bild" blamiert sich mit Fake News über Falco | Getty / Screenshot / Bild

Die "Bild" hat Großes vor: Sie will "das ehrlichste Medium Deutschlands" sein. Das sei sein Anspruch, verkündete der neue Vorsitzende der "Bild"-Chefredaktionen, Julian Reichelt, kürzlich im "Tagesspiegel".

Auf diesem Weg kommt die Zeitung wirklich sehr gut voran: mit einer Reihe an falschen Informationen.

In der vergangenen Woche verbreitete die Zeitung "die Wahrheit über Falcos Tod", oder, um genau zu zitieren: "die ganze Wahrheit über Falcos Tod".

Falco, genau, das ist der Popstar aus Österreich, der seit 19 Jahren tot ist. Aber nur weil jemand seit 19 Jahren tot ist, heißt das ja nicht, dass er der "Bild" nicht trotzdem noch eine Schlagzeile liefern könnte. Falco starb, als er von einem Parkplatz auf eine Straße fuhr und ein Bus in sein Auto krachte. Die Obduktion ergab: Der Star hatte 1,5 Promille Alkohol, Kokain und Marihuana im Blut.

Es liegt nahe, da einen Zusammenhang zu sehen.

Kein Zitat aus der Dokumentation stimmt

Die Investigativ-Journalisten der "Bild" wollten der Sache aber noch einmal genauer auf den Grund gehen - gut so, so gehört sich das.

Also haben sie sich eine Dokumentation über Falco angesehen. Oh, wir wollen hier keine Fake News verbreiten: Sie haben sich keine Dokumentation über Falco angesehen, sie haben den Artikel nur so geschrieben, dass alle glaubten, sie hätten eine gesehen.

Sie schrieben also über die Kabel-1-Doku "Falco-Die ultimative Doku zum 60. Geburtstag": Hans Reinisch, Falcos Manager - die Info muss stimmen, steht auch so bei Wikipedia - sage, dass Falco "hoffnungslos verliebt" gewesen sei, und zwar in die Dorf-Schönheit Selina.

Selinas Vater, der Bürgermeister des Dorfes, habe allerdings etwas gegen die Beziehung gehabt und den Kontakt verboten. Falcos wilde Vergangenheit habe ihm nicht gefallen. Selina trennte sich - und das habe Falco das Herz gebrochen.

Tatsache ist aber: In der Dokumentation, wie dem medienkritischen Portal "Meedia" als erstes aufgefallen ist, sagt Reinisch nichts von all den Dingen, die er laut "Bild" von sich gab.

Falcos Manager: "Das ist ein Werk der Phantastik"

„Alles, was in der Bild und den anderen Medien gestanden hat, ist frei erfunden“, sagte Reinisch laut "Meedia". Dass Selinas Vater die Beziehung zu Falco wegen dessen Vergangenheit verboten habe, sei zum Beispiel "Blödsinn, der Vater war zu dem Zeitpunkt schon tot".

Auch sei Reinisch nie Falcos Manager gewesen, wie ihn die "Bild" bezeichnet. Falcos tatsächlicher Manager war Horst Bork. Dieser bezeichnet den Artikel als "ein Werk der Phantastik".

Nicht einmal das Foto in dem "Bild"- Artikel ergibt laut "Meedia" Sinn. Die "Bild" zeigt ein Foto, auf dem angeblich Selina zu sehen ist. Doch leider handelt es sich dabei laut "Meedia" lediglich um eine Schauspielerin, die Selina gespielt hat. Kann man aber auch nicht wissen, wenn man sich die Dokumentation nicht angesehen hat.

Die "Bild" entschuldigte die Fake News auf Anfrage von "Meedia" damit, dass man für den Text mit dem Regisseur gesprochen habe und dieser die Zitate aus der Dokumentation falsch wiedergegeben habe - trotz schriftlicher Autorisierung.

Wenn das so ist, ist das natürlich blöd gelaufen. Ehrlich. Auch mit dem Versuch, das "ehrlichste Medium Deutschlands" zu sein.// results fragments requested via ajax should be an empty response if ($_GET['ajax'] != 'true'): ? = __("no entries found")?> endif; ?Avec la newsletter quotidienne du HuffPost, recevez par email les infos les plus importantes et les meilleurs articles du jour.

In retrospect, every election feels like a foregone conclusion. Whatever the UP election result, it will seem obvious. For now, between second and third phases of polling, there is no clarity.

Travelling thousands of kilometres from phase to phase, district to district, we can say for sure that nothing can be said for sure. An election wave makes itself heard even if you try not to hear it. For now, this UP election is an unexpected muddle. In this muddle, our field notes do have some points of clarity.

1. There is no Akhilesh wave.

Travelling in December last week and January first week, one heard voters say 'Akhilesh, Akhilesh' everywhere, and these weren't just Yadav or Muslim voters. Upper caste and non-Yadav OBC Hindus were also widely heard praising Akhilesh Yadav. Many were saying 'Modi for centre and Akhilesh for state.' Suddenly, one hears only Yadavs and Muslims respond to Akhilesh Yadav's branding and development work. When you ask voters about Akhilesh, most praise him or at least say he is ok, but other factors are coming in the way of pressing cycle on the EVM. One reason for this perhaps is the Akhilesh Yadav has frittered away his early gains by not campaigning till the end of January, as he was busy fighting for ownership of the cycle symbol with his estranged father and uncle. He lost the momentum. You have to ask people about Akhilesh and only then do they say positive things about him. By themselves, they do no bring him up (except Muslims). For instance, you don't hear many people talk about his promise of free smartphones.

2. SP-Congress alliance has diluted brand Akhilesh.

One reason why we perhaps don't hear so much 'Akhilesh, Akhilesh' these days is that since the SP announced its alliance with Congress, Akhilesh Yadav's branding has been replaced by joint branding of Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi. Akhilesh Yadav's slogan "Kaam Bolta Hai"--work speaks for itself--has been replaced by "UP ko ye saath pasand hai" (UP likes them together). At the campaign level, this has not only side-stepped Brand Akhilesh, but also confused his messaging before voters. Should people vote to make him CM or should they vote because they like his friendship with Rahul Gandhi?

3. There is no Modi wave.

If there is no Akhilesh wave, there is no Modi wave either. Learning from its mistake in Bihar, the BJP has successfully prevented this election from becoming a Modi election. Modi is doing only 12 odd rallies in a Brazil-size state, in contrast to 30 plus rallies he did throughout the Bihar election. The BJP's campaign is about the BJP, not about Modi or a CM candidate face. The BJP's posters never have Modi alone, not even Modi and Amit Shah alone. They have a few state leaders of various castes and regions. The 2014 Modi wave saw even some Yadavs and Dalits vote for Modi. That's not happening this election.

4. Brand Modi is intact.

There may be no Modi wave but nobody is speaking negatively about Modi. Even the small section of upper castes disenchanted by the BJP for now, would vote Modi if it were a Lok Sabha election.

5. There is no Mayawati wave as her Dalit-Muslim alliance failed to take off.

There is no Mayawati wave either. Dalits complain about law and order, as do many non-Yadav OBCs. Unlike the past, they are not coming together against Yadav dominance in a big way as non-Yadav OBCs are heavily inclined towards the BJP this time. Mayawati's pitch for a Dalit-Muslim alliance has failed as Muslims are inclined towards the SP-Congress alliance.

6. BSP remains the weakest player, yet a dark horse.

There maybe no BSP or Mayawati wave, but the BSP this election is the party of choice for those who are unhappy with both the BJP and the SP-Congress. This is operating more at the constituency level. The BSP has the least bad candidate selection, done much before the BJP or SP-Congress. In many places, BSP has 'fresh' faces. It's impossible to say how much this would benefit the BSP, but with a solid Dalit vote bank, the BSP remains a force to reckon with even at its worst.

7. The SP-Congress alliance has consolidated Muslim votes, but lost some Hindu votes.

Until the SP-Congress alliance was announced, there was a lot of talk about whether Muslims would see the SP or the BSP as their first choice. The alliance ended that discussion. Only in seats where the SP candidate is not seen as winnable are the Muslims going with the BSP. Muslims are the only voters widely using the word Gatbandhan, or alliance. This has effectively brought about a Yadav-Muslim consolidation, much like 2012. At the same time it has reduced the attraction of non-Yadav Hindus, both upper castes and OBCs, towards Akhilesh Yadav as a CM who has tried to rise over caste and community. With an M-Y consolidation, the SP is reverting to its old self.

8. BJP's gains from communal polarisation are limited.

As Jati and Pratyashi, caste and candidate, dominate the public discussion on the election, the BJP's gains from communal polarisation are limited. High Muslim population in the first, second and sixth phases often turns the battle into an "H-M" one. But it's less H-M than usual. It's not 2014 when the memory of the 2014 Muzaffarnagar riots was fresh. The BJP's attempts to polarise have been delayed and inefficient. Its campaign over triple talaq for instance, didn't end up becoming a big issue. Besides, H-M polarisation often helps the SP in seats with large Muslim populations, especially if the Hindu vote is not seeing consolidation. In other words, the three phases with high Muslim population are unlikely to see a BJP sweep like 2014. They are more likely to be a mixed bag.

9. Muslims love Akhilesh.

It is funny how Akhilesh Yadav tried to tone down the SP's usual rhetoric around Muslim identity politics, yet it is Muslims who seem to be the most fond of him. Everywhere, Muslim voters are speaking of Akhilesh the way Modi fans speak of Modi. Muslim voters insist they are Akhilesh fans only because he delivers development without discrimination to all sections of society. They defend him on the high number of incidents of communal violence during his regime. Not just young ones, Muslims of all ages have bought Brand Akhilesh hook, line and sinker.

10. Poor ticket distribution is hurting both SP-Congress and BJP.

Part of the reason why this election is looking more intractable than it should be, is ticket distribution. The SP, Congress and BJP, all three are facing unhappy communities over the choice of tickets. There's rebellion on a lot many seats. Everywhere you can find their party workers complain about the choice of candidates. Jati and Pratyashi are a prime topic of conversation among voters everywhere. Upper castes are unhappy where the BJP has given tickets to OBCs and OBCs are unhappy where tickets have been given to upper castes. The SP-Congress have done a bad job of ticket distribution because of their family feud and a messy last minute alliance. But what's the BJP's excuse? No one knows.

11. Upper castes unhappy with BJP are going to BSP, in small numbers.

Smart and early ticket distribution is helping the BSP, though only a little. A small section of upper castes, especially Brahmins and Baniyas, who are unhappy with the BJP for whatever reason (demonetisation, tickets) are seeing the BSP as an option. Since this is happening silently, it is difficult to estimate the extent of this shift. For such voters, the SP-Congress is not an option because they don't want to vote with Muslims, don't like Yadav dominance in their constituency, or do not want to vote for the Congress. They appreciate Akhilesh Yadav but his image and work are not enough to make them press the cycle button.

12. Demonetisation is not an issue for the poor.

Very few non-traders complain about demonetisation. You can even find Yadavs and Dalits praise Modi for it. The November euphoria over fighting black money is no longer there. Yet, if you ask Modi supporters why they like Modi, they often say notebandi was great, and they are happy about news of tax raids and Modi's promise to clean up the economy of black money. This is especially true of the MBCs, the most backward castes. Demonetisation is still a net loss for Modi over the sweeping votes he got in 2014, but that the poor approve of the move even now is an indication that Modi's class narrative of becoming a messiah of the poor is working.

13. The trading community wants to send the BJP a message.

It's difficult estimate the extent, but the trading community--mostly but not only Baniyas--are reluctant to go and vote. One has heard from a few traders the figure of 20% who may sit at home. But there are also those voting SP or BSP to make the BJP lose, so as to send a message to the BJP. What they are most unhappy about is what they see as an attempt to brand them as black money hoarders and 'thieves' with 'tax terrorism'. Losing some of its core voters is bad news for the BJP, which is unable to either trumpet or defend demonetisation in its campaign. Like voters, the BJP too is trying to not talk about demonetisation, but it knows very well the silent undercurrent amongst traders.

14. Non-Yadav OBCs love Modi.

Ask them who they are voting for, and they say Modi. Not BJP or its candidate, but Modi. They have been impressed by Modi's policies and promises, are often inclined towards Hindutva, and are even attracted to Modi as one of them (Modi is from the Teli OBC community.) It is important to note that Jats in west UP are non-Yadav OBCs and they have deserted the BJP this time. It is safe to say that while non-Yadav OBCs are mostly with the BJP, they are also affected by changing caste equations and poor candidate selection affect them too. In Barabanki for instance, Kurmis are unhappy with both BJP and SP for not giving tickets to Kurmis in the region. That the BJP is in alliance with a Kurmi party in east UP is not enough for them. So while non-Yadav OBCs are mostly with the BJP, the consolidation is not like 2014.

15. Jats have deserted the BJP.

The RLD should thus win a few seats, but this will damage the BJP a lot more than benefit the RLD. The Jat desertion of the BJP in phase one has damaged its ability to build a hawa in its favour. Jat disenchantment with Modi is also the reason why communal polarisation was weaker than caste politics in phase one.

16. So who's winning? 'Samikaran' politics makes it hard to say.

"Equations are changing daily," is what one often hears by the socially influential people who dominate the village square. This UP election has become 403 elections, the constituency dynamic overriding all attempts of parties to create a statewide narrative that could turn into a wave.

17. Voters expect hung assembly.

Nine of ten people you speak to in a day say they expect a hung assembly. That doesn't happen these days. The days of unstable coalitions ended in Uttar Pradesh a decade ago. In 2014, the Lok Sabha saw India's first government with a single party majority in 30 years. And now UP's voters expect a hung assembly? Voters expect a hung assembly but that doesn't mean it will necessarily be a hung assembly. As only 2 of 7 phases have polled, anything can happen. This election is up in the air.

18. A wave could still come about.

Just because there is no wave yet doesn't mean there may be no perceptible wave in the next few days. After every phase there is potential for the election to turn.ADVERTISEMENT

NEW DELHI -- Five months after he quit the People's Democratic Party (PDP), MP Tariq Hameed Karra on Saturday joined the Congress party. He attacked the central government for "mishandling" the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.



Addressing reporters at the Congress party headquarters, Karra said: "When we floated PDP in 1999, our basic declaration was against fascist forces and how we should take the state out of slumber."



"But after the 2014 assembly elections, the PDP, which had sought votes against (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi's polarization politics, joined hands with him," he said.



"That decision forced me to distance myself from the party," Karra said.



He also said that he tried to distance himself from the PDP even when the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was Chief Minister. "I had started giving them warnings and suggestions," he said.



"I had told them it is not in the interest of the state and Indian polity that we give space to such people and such parties who have been engaged, since pre-Independence, in putting the social fabric of the country into jeopardy," he said.



He also accused the central government of mishandling the situation in the state in 2016 and said: "When the unrest started in Kashmir in 2016 BJP-PDP in connivance mishandled the situation and people of the state."



"They jailed people, they killed people and even blinded the children," he alleged.



"Thus my conscious did not allow me to remain in the PDP and I resigned," he said.



Karra resigned from the party on 16 September, 2016.

Also on HuffPost India:Non sappiamo ancora quale sarà l'esito finale della vicenda in atto nel Pd. Ci auguriamo che essa non si concluda con una scissione. Lo facciamo non per l'ecumenismo che è assai facile per chi non è coinvolto direttamente nello scontro. Lo facciamo perché riteniamo assai fragile il sistema politico-istituzionale preso nel suo complesso, a rischio la tenuta economico-finanziaria del Paese, in crisi la nostra coesione sociale dopo 10 anni di recessione, assai pericoloso e problematico un contesto internazionale dominato da "uomini forti" come Trump, Putin, Erdogan, la cui politica e' avventurista e segnato dalla debolezza dell'Europa. Chi scrive ha vissuto in prima persona ben due scissioni del Psi.

Quelle scissioni, però, avvennero in un sistema politico solidissimo dominato per un verso dalla Dc e per altro dal Pci, per cui con le scissioni i socialisti fecero solo del male a se stessi, ma non alla democrazia italiana. Oggi non è cosi. Per un verso Renzi come leader, per altro verso il Pd con la sua alleanza con la pattuglia centrista-riformista costituita da NCD, UDC, Moderati, Scelta Civica, Centristi di Casini, Psi di Nencini, assicurano la governabilita', non una governabilita' in senso astratto, ma una governabilita' in funzione della ripresa dello sviluppo della sicurezza della lotta al terrorismo. Tale e' il ruolo che sta svolgendo il governo Gentiloni. Orbene e' chiaro che per evitare la scissione sia la maggioranza sia l'opposizione devono fare dei passi in avanti perche', in quest'epoca dominata dal leaderismo, in primo luogo Matteo Renzi come leader del partito e dall'altra parte Bersani devono impegnarsi lealmente per evitarla.

Ciò detto di fronte a questa drammatica crisi del Pd e al fatto che nel centrodestra non è ancora chiaro se Berlusconi e Forza Italia si richiudono nell'alleanza subalterna all'area sovranista e lepenista guidata da Salvini e dalla Meloni oppure se intendono giocare il ruolo autonomo di una area moderata che fa riferimento al PPE, è indispensabile, anche se tardivo, che le forze centriste facciano finalmente sentire la loro voce. Esse, in primo luogo l'NCD, hanno il merito di aver impedito l'interruzione immediata della legislatura nel 2013 e il demerito di non essersi finora aggregate e di avere sviluppato una forte iniziativa politica e programmatica.

Ciò è avvenuto in modo episodico e intermittente mentre più spesso queste forze hanno rilasciato a Renzi una sorta di delega in bianco anche per l'indubbio spirito riformista e innovativo da lui messo in campo fino alla gestione del referendum. Ora con il risultato del referendum un ciclo politico si è chiuso e la crisi ne è una dimostrazione. Allora indipendentemente dallo sbocco di questa crisi che ci auguriamo positivo è indispensabile che tutte le forze di centro collocate nella terra di nessuno (e' proprio il caso di dirlo) fra una Forza Italia tuttora in cerca del suo ruolo e il Pd si aggreghino e battano un colpo, sia sul piano politico che sul piano programmatico. In primo luogo queste forze devono assicurare in modo attivo il loro sostegno al governo Gentiloni, che insieme al presidente della Repubblica, esprime l'unico punto di riferimento positivo per la tenuta del Paese.

In secondo luogo queste forze centriste riformiste devono esprimere alcuni punti fermi di natura programmatica, indispensabili anche per riportare il Pd alla sua vocazione riformista a fronte di derive populiste e stataliste che sembrano oggi attraversarlo, in primo luogo una netta scelta per l'Europa: l'Europa va riformata e rinnovata non abbandonata o attaccata in modo strumentale. Se l'Europa ha sbagliato sul terreno del rigorismo l'Italia anche adesso ha sbagliato non tagliando realmente le spesa pubblica, che e' l'unica strada per ridurre la pressione fiscale e far riprendere la crescita. In secondo luogo va smontata l'oppressione fiscale che sta strangolando l'Italia, in terzo luogo è indispensabile un effettivo garantismo: il rilancio dell'Europa è ancora più indispensabile di fronte alla aggressività da un lato di Trump e dall'altro lato di Putin.

In questo quadro una forza insieme centrista e riformista ha un ruolo da svolgere, purché essa esca dalla sua attuale afasia politica, dalla tendenza a conservare una frantumazione di gruppi ognuno dei quali pensa di avere in sé il leader per tutta l'area. In ogni caso il nodo centrale è quello di avere da parte di tutti, in primo da Renzi, che ha la massima responsabilità politica e delle varie componenti del Pd e dell'area centrista che il governo Renzi e lo svolgimento delle elezioni in una fase nella quale ci sia una nuova legge elettorale e che sia marcata da una iniziativa sulle questioni più drammatiche che riguardano il Paese è decisiva per la tenuta della nostra democrazia che raramente è stata cosi a rischio".MOSCOW, RUSSIA - OCTOBER 06: Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Maria Zakharova speaks during a press briefing at the Russian Foreign Ministry building in Moscow, Russia, on October 06, 2015.

Die Redaktion sprach von "unbegründeter Zurückweisung"

Bei der Veranstaltung des türkischen Ministerpräsidenten Binali Yildirim in Oberhausen ist einem Journalisten der Zutritt verweigert worden. Trotz Akkreditierung sei der "taz"-Journalist vom Sicherheitsdienst der türkischen Regierungspartei AKP nicht in den Saal gelassen worden, teilte die Redaktion am Samstag mit.

Dies sei mit Sicherheitserwägungen und einer Absprache mit der Polizei begründet worden. Eine derartige Absprache habe die Polizei aber dementiert.

"Selbstverständlich steht es Veranstaltern frei, Personen aus Sicherheitsgründen von einer Teilnahme auszuschließen", sagte Katrin Gottschalk, Mitglied der Chefredaktion der "taz".

"Jedoch hat die ganz offensichtlich unbegründete Zurückweisung unseres Reporters den Geruch einer politischen Maßregelung." Diese Behinderung journalistischer Arbeit sei weder in der Türkei noch in Deutschland akzeptabel.

Genaueres über die Hintergründe war zunächst nicht bekannt.

Yildirim wirbt für Machtausbau von Erdogan

Yildirim will in Oberhausen für ein Präsidialsystem in der Türkei werben. Über eine entsprechende Verfassungsreform soll das türkische Volk am 16. April abstimmen. An dem Referendum können sich auch im Ausland lebende Türken beteiligen. Das Präsidialsystem würde dem Staatspräsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan deutlich mehr Macht verleihen.

Die türkische Regierung steht in der Kritik, die Pressefreiheit in ihrem Land zu unterdrücken. Auf der Rangliste der Pressefreiheit von Reporter ohne Grenzen lag die Türkei schon vor dem Putschversuch im vergangenen Sommer und dem anschließend verhängten Ausnahmezustand auf Platz 151 von 180 Staaten.

Seitdem sind zahlreiche regierungskritische Journalisten verhaftet worden. Gerade erst am Freitag wurde bekannt, dass der Türkei-Korrespondent der deutschen Tageszeitung "Die Welt", Deniz Yücel, in Polizeigewahrsam genommen wurde.

Bei einem Treffen mit Yildirim am Samstag am Rande der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz sprach Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) den Fall an und verlangte, rechtsstaatliche Regeln einzuhalten, wie Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert mitteilte.

(ame)Sappiamo tutte cos'ha significato questo per molte di noi, donne single: quella domanda, che suona più come un'affermazione, “Cosa? Sei ancora single?”. Sì, società. Molte di noi sono ancora single e non è detto che sia un male. Anche se siamo in tantissime, potremmo pensare di essere gli unici esseri umani single sul pianeta, perché intorno a noi vediamo coppie ovunque e durante questa settimana forse ci siamo sentite particolarmente sole, mentre affogavamo in vino e pizza.

Ma voglio ricordarvi che voi non siete in errore, è la società ad esserlo perché il matrimonio non è un traguardo, né un obiettivo obbligatorio. A tutte le signore impegnate/sposate: ascoltatemi bene prima di non seguirmi più su twitter. Negli ultimi decenni, le frequentazioni e il matrimonio si sono trasformati. Siamo passati da una società in cui l'amore era volontario, ad una società in cui l'amore è obbligatorio. La società considera le giovani donne single come persone “strane” o che hanno un problema, una questione irrisolta. Per liberarci alla svelta da quest'etichetta, cerchiamo qualcuno e forse è proprio questo il problema. Vogliamo qualcuno per sbarazzarci di quell'etichetta anziché rimuoverla da sole. Ci dimentichiamo di noi stesse, mentre inseguiamo qualcun altro per uniformarci alla società.

Voglio approfittare di questo momento per ricordare a te, la ragazza single al bar il giorno di San Valentino, che la società non è importante, TU sei importante. La società non ha ancora digerito il fatto che il matrimonio non è uno scopo obbligatorio, non è un traguardo. È un'opzione, una scelta. Non ti serve una laurea per sposarti, ma un partner disponibile e, sinceramente, a volte non è facile trovarlo e sembra sia ancora più difficile per una giovane donna indipendente e ambiziosa. Inoltre, la società non ha ancora accettato pienamente che non tutte le donne mettono il matrimonio in cima alla lista delle cose da fare nella vita, molte mettono prima la carriera. La società non è pronta per donne indipendenti e ambiziose ma va bene così, perché non sei tu che devi adeguarti alla società, è la società che deve adeguarsi a te. Non fraintendetemi, credo di parlare per la maggior parte delle donne quando dico che molte di noi vogliono sposarsi in un magnifico abito bianco, ma a volte non è la priorità assoluta dei nostri programmi di vita.

Perciò, signore, voglio divi una cosa, SIATE VOI STESSE. Il matrimonio non è una cosa che DOBBIAMO raggiungere o pianificare, né un traguardo. Dedicatevi alla carriera, agli hobby, ai viaggi. Cambiate il mondo, dimenticatevi della società. Fate ciò che amate, uscite da quel bar e andate a cambiare delle vite.

La vostra,

Ragazza single ambiziosa.Ragazzi maggiorenni sarebbero stati 'adescati' da un parroco di Napoli, attraverso i social network, per partecipare a festini gay: la vicenda è stata portata al vaglio dell'arcivescovo di Napoli, il cardinale Crescenzio Sepe che, oggi, non ha voluto esprimere commenti in merito.

Un vero e proprio dossier quello giunto nella sede della Curia Arcivescovile partenopea, con i particolari di quanto accaduto: gli appuntamenti sarebbero stati presi anche attraverso una specifica chat alla quale, fa sapere uno dei giovani adescati, che ha 28 anni, molti preti si collegherebbero - a suo dire - in maniera abituale. Per le prestazioni sessuali ci sarebbe stata anche la corresponsione di denaro, 20-30 euro ad appuntamento, che però il ragazzo riferisce di avere percepito solo su insistenza del parroco.

In una intervista rilasciata al Il Mattino il giovane svela come tutto è iniziato: qualche messaggio via posta elettronica, poi la richiesta di amicizia su facebook e, alla fine, gli incontri a sfondo sessuale, anche due-tre volte al mese. Gli appuntamenti sono avvenuti, secondo quanto dice il 28enne, nell'abitazione del parroco, poi anche in altri appartamenti. Il legame con il sacerdote si sarebbe instaurato in un momento particolare della vita del giovane: dopo le prime remore, il ragazzo si sarebbe lasciato andare.

Nell'intervista definisce l'uomo di Chiesa una persona gentile, affettuosa, rassicurante. Non solo. Ce ne sarebbero anche altri, di sacerdoti, che avrebbero avuto incontri con giovani maggiorenni. Il ventottenne riferisce anche dell'esistenza di una chat, che nel corso degli anni ha pure cambiato nome, frequentata da sacerdoti e frati, dove si offrirebbe conforto, una mano contro la solitudine, e anche una particolare forma di amicizia che poi sfocerebbe in incontri di carattere sessuale.

La storia tra il ventottenne e il parroco si sarebbe interrotta quattro-cinque mesi fa, per volere del ragazzo: una decisione che il parroco non avrebbe preso bene. Prima della 'rottura' - sostiene il giovane - era diventato più insistente e questo lo infastidiva. Comunque, lui non sarebbe stato l'unico ragazzo che il parroco frequentava.

Nel dossier fatto arrivare al cardinale Sepe si farebbe riferimento anche al coinvolgimento di un altro sacerdote, un amico del parroco, conosciuto in seminario, che il ragazzo ha anche cercato di contattare, sempre via social network, ma inutilmente. "Non posso parlare, devo andare via subito". Così, dal canto suo, il cardinale di Napoli, Crescenzio Sepe, ha risposto a un giornalista che gli ha chiesto un commento sulla vicenda del sacerdote che sarebbe al centro del dossier in cui si ipotizzano festini gayNEWS

바른정당 대선 주자인 유승민 의원은 18일 "합당할 생각은 없다. 당을 합치지 않더라도 보수후보 단일화는 강하게 주장하고 있다"고 밝혔다.

유 의원은 대한노인회 대구시연합회를 방문해 임원을 만난 자리에서 자유한국당 등과 합당 의사를 묻는 말에 이같이 말했다.

이어 "보수후보가 분열해 있으면 선거를 해보나 마나 같아서 그런 이야기를 하는데 오해를 많이 받았다"며 "누가 대통령이 되더라도 여소야대 때문에 대통령 되는 사람이 국회, 야당 찾아다니며 협조를 구해야 한다"고 덧붙였다.

지지율이 오르지 않고 보수층에게 공격받는다는 우려에는 "자유한국당 의원들은 대통령 탄핵 문제를 갖고 태극기 집회에 나가고 저 같은 사람 욕하고 하는데, 헌법재판소 결정이 나면 그런 문제가 정리되지 않을까 생각한다"고 강조했다.

대통령 탄핵과 관련해서 한 참석자가 "촛불도 끄고 태극기도 내려야 한다"고 하자 "결정이 나면 어느 쪽도 승복 못 할 텐데 정치인이 부추기면 안 된다. 결과에 승복하도록 모두 약속해야 한다"고 주장했다.

그는 "오는 19일 어르신 복지공약을 발표한다"며 "기초생활보장 대상자 부양의무자 조건을 폐지하고 건강보험 어르신 진료비를 현재 1만 5천원에서 2만원으로 높인다는 공약을 제시하겠다"고 밝혔다.

유 의원은 대구노인연합회를 방문하기 전 대구도시철도공사 강당에서 열린 대구지하철 화재 참사 14주기 추모식에 참석해 희생자 넋을 기리고 유족을 위로했다.

이에 앞서 김태일 2.18안전문화재단 이사장과 홍승활 대구도시철도공사 사장을 만나 추모사업 현황에 설명을 들었다.

유 의원은 "안전문화재단이 출범해서 다행이다"며 "추모사업을 안전문화재단이 매듭지어 주길 바라며 정치인으로서 저도 노력하겠다"고 했다.

또 추모사에서 "희생자 넋을 모실 장소를 마련하지 못해 뼈아프게 반성한다"며 "광주나 안산에는 트라우마센터가 있는데 대구에는 없다. 트라우마를 치유할 수 있도록 국가가 도움의 손길을 줘야 한다"고 말했다.Es ist kein Geheimnis, dass Neu-Präsident Donald Trump sehr darauf achtet, wie er auf die Bevölkerung wirkt.

Aber ganz egal, was der amerikanische Präsident auch unternimmt, um sein Bild in der Öffentlichkeit zu verbessern - es wird immer Menschen geben, die versuchen, ihn noch etwas kleiner aussehen zu lassen.

Seit letzter Woche kursieren bearbeitete Bilder im Internet, auf denen Trump ganz anders zu sehen ist als wir es von ihm gewohnt sind.

Was dahinter steckt, erfahrt ihr im Video oben.

Am Samstag ist US-Vizepräsident Mike Pence während der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz zum ersten Mal auf Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) getroffen. In ihrer Rede hatte die Kanzlerin sich für internationale Zusammenarbeit ausgesprochen und betont, wie wichtig die USA für Europa im Anti-Terror-Kampf seien.

Als Pence den Worten der Kanzlerin lauschte, fehlte da aber etwas: der Stöpsel im Ohr, über den Pence den Dolmetscher gehört hätte. Einer Journalistin des SWR und der ARD fiel dieses Detail auf und teilte über den Kurznachrichten ein Bild vom Vizepräsidenten als Beleg:

US-Vizepräsident Pence verfolgt Merkel Rede ohne Übersetzung. Versteht er deutsch oder interessiert es ihn nicht? pic.twitter.com/Z9ZuqdBv9B — sabrina fritz (@FritzUSA) 18. Februar 2017

Genau wie sein Chef

Kann Pence womöglich Deutsch und braucht daher keinen Übersetzer, der in sein Ohr flüstert? Über die Fremdsprachenkenntnisse des Vizepräsidenten ist zumindest nichts bekannt. Die Journalistin stellt daher auch die Frage in den Raum: Interessiert Pence die Rede von Merkel vielleicht gar nicht?

Was die Beobachtung umso bemerkenswerter macht: Auch US-Präsident Donald Trump war kürzlich aufgefallen, als er beim Besuch von Japans Premier Shinzo Abe auf einer Pressekonferenz keinen Kopfhörertrug. Seine Erklärung damals: Er sei über den Inhalt von Abes Rede informiert gewesen.

Vielleicht wusste also auch Pence schon vorab, was die Kanzlerin sagen würde. Oder er konnte es sich denken.

Schöne Frauen sind in Hollywood gefragt. Kein Wunder also, dass einige der Filmstars vorher auch auf Schönheitswettbewerben aufgetreten sind. Eine große Karriere startete 1986 bei der "Miss World"-Wahl, wie dieser Instagram-Post uns noch mal in Erinnerung ruft. Auf dem Foto ist Halle Berry (50) zu sehen, die damals für die USA bei der Miss-Wahl antrat. Bei dem Wettbewerb in London 1986 war die Schauspielerin gerade einmal 20 Jahre alt. "Wo alles anfing", schrieb die 50-Jährige zu ihrem Bild aus vergangenen Tagen.

Interessanterweise trägt Halle Berry derzeit wieder eine ähnliche Frisur wie 1986, wie ebenfalls auf Instagram zu sehen ist. Ein voluminöser Lockenkopf, der ihr bis in den Nacken reicht, ziert momentan das Haupt des Hollywood-Stars. Die "Miss World"-Krone konnte sie 1986 allerdings nicht mit nach Hause nehmen, sie belegte Platz sechs.

Bereits drei Jahre später konnte sie aber erste TV-Rollen ergattern, unter anderem in "Unter der Sonne Kaliforniens". Ihr Filmdebüt gab sie in Spike Lees "Jungle Fever" (1991) an der Seite von Wesley Snipes. Nach Erfolgsfilmen wie "X-Men" und "Passwort: Swordfish" schaffte sie mit "Monster's Ball" schließlich den großen Durchbruch. Sie erhielt 2002 für ihre Darbietung in dem Drama den Oscar als "Beste Hauptdarstellerin". Im gleichen Jahr übernahm sie in "James Bond - Stirb an einem anderen Tag" an der Seite von Pierce Brosnan die Rolle einer Geheimagentin der NSA.Ursprünglich wollte der Amerikaner Michael Glidden nur mit seinen Hunden die Gegend rund um den „Chugach National Forest“ im US-Bundesstaat Alaska erkunden. Nach seiner Wanderung sichtete er zu Hause die Fotos, die er gemacht hatte – und stellte fest: Er war auf seiner Wanderung nicht alleine.

Zug in Belgien entgleist: Ein Mensch stirbt, viele werden verletzt | dpa

Ein Passagierzug ist am Samstag in der Nähe von Brüssel entgleist. Das teilte ein Vertreter der Bahn mit.

Der Zug fuhr Berichten zufolge langsam aus dem Bahnhof von Löwen, etwa 20 Kilometer von Brüssel entfernt, als das Unglück passierte.

Der Sender VRT berichtete unter Berufung auf den Bürgermeister der Provinzhauptstadt Löwen von 19 Verletzten und einem Toten. Den Angaben zufolge entgleiste mindestens ein Waggon bei der Ausfahrt aus dem Bahnhof. Zu dem Zeitpunkt fuhr der Zug demnach nicht sehr schnell.

Der Bahnverkehr wurde unterbrochen. Rettungskräfte waren vor Ort.

(ll)Libertad, sensualidad y calidad ha sido el lema oficial de Andrés Sardá, que ha subido a la pasarela de la Fashion Week Madrid su particular revolución lencera con rústicos bustier de rafia, conjuntos de tul y seda o miriñaques de latón dorados con tules y encajes de chantilly, una prendas tan osadas como enérgicas.

La pasarela ha vivido una revolución francesa abanderada por la actriz Victoria Abril, quien abrió el desfile con ropa interior inspirada en el siglo XVIII y lo cerró, encarnada en una María Antonieta en el Palacio de Versalles.

Con las primeras salidas, la directora creativa de la firma, Núria Sardá, ha querido rendir homenaje al pueblo que se sublevó con una lencería de aspecto sencillo en el que camisas blancas de popelín juegan con corsés de arpillera o bustiers de rafia.

Después adquirieron protagonismo la lencería con reminiscencias militares, un abanico de prendas con carácter más guerrero, más revolucionario.

En la última parte del desfile llegaba el momento de la lencería aburguesada, con espíritu de fiesta; "son prendas más románticas, delicadas y sensuales", explicaba hoy a EFE Núria Sardá, quien propone conjuntos lenceros de tul flocado y encajes de chantilly, cuajados de lazos.

(ll)Was an diesem Samstag in Deutschland passiert, ist politisch extrem heikel

Einerseits kommt der türkische Premier Yildirim nach Oberhausen, um für den Machtausbau seines Präsidenten zu werben

Andererseits fordert Grünen-Politiker Beck, dass Yildirim wegen Spionageverdachts festgehalten wird

Grünen-Politiker Volker Beck fordert laut einem Bericht des "Spiegels" und "Spiegel Onlines", dass die deutschen Behörden gegen den türkischen Ministerpräsidenten Binali Yildirim wegen des Verdachts der Spionage ermitteln.

Der Hintergrund: Imame des Moscheeverbands Ditib stehen unter Verdacht, auf Anweisung des türkischen Religionsministeriums Diyanet mutmaßliche Anhänger der Gülen-Bewegung in Deutschland bespitzelt zu haben. Das Amt ist Regierungschef Yildirim direkt unterstellt.

Yildirim solle bei seinem Deutschland-Besuch vernommen werden

In einem Schreiben an den Generalbundesanwalt in Karlsruhe sowie an die Staatsanwaltschaft Duisburg und die Polizei in Oberhausen verlange Beck daher, dass Yildirim überprüft werden solle.

Der "Spiegel" zitiert: Es bestehe "der Verdacht, dass sich Herr Yildirim selbst der geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit in mittelbarer Täterschaft, der Anstiftung zur geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit in mittelbarer Täterschaft oder der Beihilfe zur geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit strafbar gemacht hat". Der Generalbundesanwalt soll die Polizei bereits mit entsprechenden Ermittlungen beauftragt haben.

Beck fordere außerdem, dass Yildirim bei seinem Besuch in Deutschland am Samstag vernommen wird. Der Regierungschef will in Oberhausen für die umstrittene Verfassungsreform in der Türkei werben. Beck plädiert dafür, Yildirims Ausreise zu unterbinden, "solange dies aus strafprozessualen Gründen erforderlich ist". Der Ministerpräsident könne sich nicht auf seine Immunität berufen, da er nicht auf amtliche Einladung der Bundesrepublik gekommen sei.

Der Grünen-Politiker Beck hatte im Dezember Strafanzeige wegen des Verdachts der geheimdienstlichen Agententätigkeit gegen Ditib-Imame gestellt. Außerdem soll er der Generalbundesanwaltschaft brisantes Material übermittelt haben.

Deutsch-türkisches Verhältnis litt schon unter weniger

Die Situation ist damit in zweierlei Hinsicht brisant:

Einerseits, weil viele Politiker in Deutschland entsetzt sind, dass Yildirim in Oberhausen vor etwa 10.000 Anhängern Werbung für die Verfassungsreform in der Türkei machen darf - mit der Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan noch mehr Macht an sich reißen wird. Schon jetzt ist er maßgeblich dafür verantwortlich, dass in der Türkei Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Demokratie mit Füßen getreten werden. Viele Politiker plädierten dafür, wenigstens dem Treiben in Deutschland einen Riegel vorzuschieben.

Andererseits mag man sich nicht vorstellen, was passieren würde, sollten die deutschen Behörden Yildirim tatsächlich vernehmen - so berechtigt das vielleicht aus juristischer Sicht sein mag. Es ist anzunehmen, dass massive Proteste von Yildirims Anhängern in Oberhausen die Folge wären, die möglicherweise die Sicherheitskräfte an ihre Grenzen bringen könnten.

Das Verhältnis der Bundesrepublik zur Türkei hat in der Vergangenheit schon unter deutlich harmloseren Vorfällen gelitten. Man denke etwa an den Streit um das sogenannte Schmähgedicht von Satiriker Jan Böhmermann.

Die einen rühren es ein, andere ekelt es so sehr, dass sie den Rückstand einfach wegschütten. Dieser ist aber ganz normal, denn während der Lagerung des Jogurts ist es nur natürlich, dass Flüssigkeit an die Oberfläche tritt.

Was nur wenige wissen: Die milchige Lösung ist Milchserum und weitaus gesünder als wir denken.

Le vice-président américain Mike Pence a tenté samedi de rassurer les alliés des États-Unis en Europe, en renouvelant l'appui "indéfectible" de son pays envers l'OTAN.

M. Pence, qui s'exprimait à Munich, en Allemagne, dans le cadre d'un sommet sur la sécurité, a indiqué que les États-Unis respecteront leurs engagements envers l'Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique nord.

Mike Pence, qui effectue sa première mission à l'étranger, a assuré que le président Donald Trump "supportera l'Europe".

Plusieurs pays européens se sont montrés sceptiques envers la politique étrangère de Donald Trump, voyant le nouveau président comme un "isolationniste".

THE VOICE SAISON 6: BATTLE A L'IMAGE: Nikos Aliagas OK NIKOS-OKN

TÉLÉVISION - La 6e saison de l'émission "The Voice" n'avait pas encore commencé que l'on apprenait une nouveauté pour cette nouvelle saison. Deux nouveautés viennent bousculer cette édition 2017: l'arrivée de Matt Pokora et d'une nouvelle règle dévoilée en décembre dernier par nos confrères du site RTL. Selon la radio, les coaches de l'émission pourront désormais "buzzer" pour voler non plus un mais plusieurs talents aux autres jurés.

En d'autres termes, Matt Pokora, Florent Pagny, Mika et Zazie auront désormais le droit de pratiquer un "vol de talent permanent" au moment fatidique de l'épreuve des "battles", c'est-à-dire des sessions pendant lesquelles deux candidats d'une même équipe s'affrontent en duel.

L'épreuve de la traditionnelle battle sera donc plus corsée que les autres années. En effet, le coach ayant sauvé un candidat pourra par la suite "buzzer" un nouveau candidat qu'il juge meilleur que le précédent. Auparavant, les juges avaient déjà le droit de "buzzer" pour sauver le candidat de leur équipe qui venait d'être éliminé mais ils ne pouvaient pas revenir en arrière.

Le Mexique et le Canada doivent faire front commun dans la renégociation de l'Entente de libre-échange nord-américain (ALENA) et tenir tête au président américain Donald Trump.

C'est ce que soutient le ministre mexicain de l'Économie, Ildefonso Guajardo, en entrevue au Globe and Mail.

M. Guajardo demande au Canada d'insister pour que les pourparlers soient trilatéraux et non bilatéraux.

Le ministre affirme que le Canada et le Mexique "feront plus de gains ensemble" que séparés.

M. Guajardo convient que le Canada doit défendre ses propres intérêts, comme le Mexique, ajoutant toutefois qu'il n'y a rien de contradictoire à vouloir négocier l'Alena selon les intérêts de tous.

Le gouvernement canadien a récemment réitéré l'importance de sa relation avec le Mexique mais n'a pris aucun engagement à renégocier l'Aléna de façon trilatérale.
