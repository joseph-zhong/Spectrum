The Top 10 Moments From New York Fashion Week

Image

1. Many Shows Tackled the Political Climate

Who says fashion is just about the clothes? This week, several New York designers used their shows to send messages (some subtle — others much more overt) about the Trump administration and the political atmosphere in general. Public School showed red baseball caps that read "Make America New York," while the designer Adam Lippes made signs and displayed them outside his Washington Square Park home, where the Planned Parenthood march took place later that day. And at Prabal Gurung, the designer closed his show by sending models out in a series of T-shirts with message such as “I Am an Immigrant” and “Revolution Has No Borders.”

2. Raf Simons Had a Super-Strong Debut

The most anticipated show of the week was Raf Simons’s debut at Calvin Klein — and it lived up to all the expectations. What most thought would be an exercise in minimalism turned out to be anything but. From the show venue (designed by his friend and collaborator Sterling Ruby) to the collection, which riffed on American style — power suits, varsity sweaters and quilts — and the presence of the newly launched denim and underwear campaign, Simons made a powerful first statement for the relaunch of Calvin Klein. And if that wasn’t enough, the brand hosted an afterparty rave at its Garment District headquarters that lasted into the wee hours of the night. Now that’s what I call a debut.

3. A Fashion Party for the Sneakerheads

Nike also knows how to throw a party — the brand kicked off the season with a celebration of its latest footwear collaboration with Comme des Garçons. The hip crowd (not just fashion regulars) mingled in the Japanese brand’s flagship Chelsea store, clamoring to get their paws on the three styles of limited-edition sneakers — one of which included an updated version of the classic Nike Dunk shoe, reimagined by Rei Kawakubo with clear PVC side panels.

4. The Most Beautiful New Store in New York

SoHo just got a little prettier thanks to Simone Rocha, the London-based designer who opened her first U.S. store on Wooster Street this week. She turned the lofty downtown space into an extension of her imaginative universe where art and fashion come together in total harmony. There are mannequins in white lace communion-like dresses suspended in a white cage — and a Louise Bourgeois piece that anchors the space behind the cash register. All in all, the space feels like a feast not just for the body but also for the mind.

5. There’s Nothing Quite Like a Fashion Show Party

A handful of designers presented their fall/winter 2017 collections in a way that felt more like a party than an actual show. Rag & Bone hosted a photo exhibition of their collection, which turned into a celebrity-filled dance party D.J.ed by Thom Yorke, Baja East threw a late-night bash at Gilded Lily and Phillip Plein had Nas open his runway show (with the Kills performing throughout). Alexander Wang didn’t have his famous afterparty, but his actual runway show felt like one. Beer was served upon entering, and guests stood in a theater where hip-hop music was blasting to watch the show.

6. The Row Show Felt Like a Quiet Protest

It can be quite tricky to navigate what is powerful in the world of fashion when, at the moment, it seems that louder your voice the more attention you receive. Not in the case of The Row, whose show was one of the most impactful of the week. There were no gimmicks — just well-designed clothes. With a soundtrack that included the song “Freedom” by Richie Havens, the designers Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen showed a minimalist collection that was perfect through and through. What was undetectable to the audience were the small messages sewn into the white shirts that read “Hope,” “Freedom” and “Dignity.”

7. Casting Got More Diverse

This season, designers were more inclusive in the models they chose for their shows. Kanye West cast the hijab-wearing model Halima Aden in Yeezy, the Nigerian designer Maki Oh filled her presentation entirely with women of color, J. Crew featured “real” women — and the 65-year-old Jacky O’Shaughnessy walked in the Tome show. And in several shows, designers opted to include models who were larger than size 0. Michael Kors cast Ashley Graham, and Prabal Gurung, who just announced a collaboration with Lane Bryant, included Candice Huffine and Marquita Pring.

8. We Celebrated Valentine’s Day, Of Course

Valentine’s Day always lands in the middle of New York Fashion Week. And this season, the retailer matchesfashion.com celebrated its love-themed collaboration with the jewelry designer Delfina Delettrez on the same day. The heart-shaped earrings and other pink sapphire, pearl and gold pieces debuted during a love-filled cocktail hour, hosted by Chloë Sevigny and furnished with chocolates, strawberries and champagne.

9. Marc Jacobs Made a Strong Statement With the Quietest Show

There was no music to mark the beginning of the Marc Jacobs show — no curtain drawn to reveal the runway, no lighting cast on a dramatic set. In fact, there was no set at all; just two long rows of folding chairs, which faced each other, to form the catwalk. Usually relied upon to close New York Fashion Week with entertaining, theatrical runways, the designer pared back this season. He invited fewer guests, and insisted on no social media during the show. He stripped away the pomp and circumstance, sending models across the center of the empty Park Avenue Armory floor, to put the focus wholly on the clothes, which reflected the time in New York City when hip-hop began to give shape to a visual identity — and an attitude. As showgoers exited the venue onto Park Avenue, they walked up to and then past the models, who were sitting on their own folding chairs, with cellphones pointed toward the guests. Through their lens, we ended New York Fashion Week.

10. New York’s Emerging Designers Are Especially Exciting

The city’s underground talent is growing stronger each season. A handful of independent designers — such as Eckhaus Latta, Vaquera, Gauntlett Cheng, Eric Schlösberg and Shan Huq — make their shows about the clothes and about their friends, and that’s what keeps us coming back to see them. They bring a young, creative aura to New York Fashion Week — which is especially needed as so many designers are leaving the city to show in Paris.Over the years, Vigliotti, who is 63, gradually evolved from a hauler of waste to a producer of fine fertilizers. And so he was well positioned when New York City contracted last year with six companies to transform the food waste it currently collects from the curbsides of almost a million residents. Four of those companies will send their scraps to traditional compost facilities. A fifth will truck its share to the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in north Brooklyn. There, chopped-up food will be stirred into giant tanks that already digest sewage, anaerobically, using microbes; the resulting biogas will be captured and used to power turbines on site or to heat nearby homes. Vigliotti’s contract, the second-largest, allows him to annually shunt more than 23,000 tons of city food waste into his soon-to-be-built Yaphank plant, where it will mingle with 155,000 tons of scraps from two counties outside the city. When it is up and running, American Organic Energy will have the largest anaerobic digester east of the Mississippi. “I’d like to say I had a vision of environmental responsibility,” Vigliotti told me, with a wink, about the origins of his new endeavor. “But I saw food composting as a business opportunity.”

Throughout the modern era of waste collection, New Yorkers, like other Americans, have been asked to pull all kinds of things from their kitchen trash cans for a supposedly higher purpose than burial at the dump. First it was paper, metal and plastic, then electronic goods and, in some places, textiles. Now we increasingly separate food waste. Sometimes we know where these recyclables will eventually alight — junk mail may be converted to printer paper, for example — but mostly we remain in the dark. There has always been an aura of mystery to these flows, in part because markets for recyclables continually change. For those who voluntarily set out food scraps for municipal collection — true believers, that is — the process provokes yet another layer of uncertainty. We assume our dregs are headed for a giant compost pile somewhere, but what happens to it next?

For a brief time, I could provide answers to such questions. As my own compost baron, I sorted and tipped my grapefruit rinds and eggshells into a front-yard composting bin; the resulting fertilizer fed my building’s crab-apple tree. But when I ran out of leaves to mix into the scraps, my “compost” grew extremely smelly. Odors, flies and quality control can bedevil even the most experienced food-waste recyclers, but I didn’t give up. Instead, a few years ago, I upgraded from a solo operation to something just a little bigger, joining the 200,000 other New Yorkers who weekly marched their organics to one of 74 drop-off sites — at farmers’ markets, subway stations, libraries — around New York City, collectively diverting 2.3 million pounds of food waste from the dump each year.

Lugging scraps to my farmers market was enormously satisfying. I liked returning my potato peels to the woman who grew my potatoes; I knew she’d make good use of them. The act also felt more immediately important than many other things I did to lessen my planetary impact, like driving less and line-drying more. When the Department of Sanitation’s curbside organics-collection program expanded to my Brooklyn neighborhood in 2015, I was grateful, but also a little wary. Placing my scraps on the curb in a securely latched, hard-sided bin was certainly convenient, but my compost cycle was starting to spiral, from small-batch to medium to — well, I wasn’t sure what. I had no idea where this centralized system deposited my scraps, or how — or if — they were transformed into something of value.

By 2018, the Department of Sanitation hopes to extend its curbside program — the largest residential-food-waste collection scheme in the country — citywide. But quantity doesn’t always equal quality, and already there is evidence that an industrial future may not match the integrity of the artisanal present. Longer supply chains mean burning more fuel to transport this resource, and recipients of scraps have little control over what New Yorkers throw into their bins. Because local composters, at urban farms, educate their suppliers, they don’t need to remove plastic bags, twist-ties and other detritus from their feedstock. But the anonymity of industrial-scale operations means that such contaminants can easily slide through.

When New York’s curbside program began several years ago, trucks trundled city scraps down the New Jersey Turnpike to the Peninsula Compost Company, a large facility in Wilmington, Del. But after Waste Management, the nation’s largest solid-waste handler, bought a controlling interest in the plant six years ago, its compost quality declined — it contained too many shards of glass and pieces of plastic — and neighbors began to complain that the yard smelled like the bottom of a garbage pail. Environmental regulators forced Peninsula to shut down in 2014.

Since then, the city has been carting food waste to several local transfer stations, one of which I visited in Jamaica, Queens. Inside a dreary industrial shed at a private company called Regal Recycling, a team of workers in rubber boots and face masks combed through a 10-foot-tall pile of organic waste collected from various schools. Using long-handled hoes and their gloved fingers, the men painstakingly extracted plastic baggies, milk boxes, Capri Sun pouches, sporks and balls of aluminum foil. (As the volume of curbside organics climbs, Regal and other city transfer stations will install mechanical preprocessing equipment.)

Michael Reali, Regal’s vice president, told me the city paid him about $80 a ton to receive this material, and then he paid truckers to transport the waste upstate and a permitted composter $35 per ton to receive it. Sometimes the load was clean, sometimes not. Reali pivoted away from the school waste and gestured toward a 20-foot mound shoved against the opposite wall. Collected from two fruit wholesalers, the pile was almost 100 percent mangoes and avocados, with very little extraneous material. (And it smelled great.) I was starting to understand that compost, like oil, has different grades. Pure commercial streams like this one were akin to West Texas light crude: clean and easy to process. School and residential streams were like tar sands: dirty and expensive to upgrade.

Reali’s decontaminated table scraps eventually made their way to McEnroe Organic Farm, which stretches over 1,100-acres of rolling pastureland and cultivated fields in the mid-Hudson Valley. There I watched as front-end loaders mixed the food with locally sourced wood shavings and straw. The woody materials provided more carbon to complement the food’s nitrogen and bulk up the compost. Thoroughly mingled, the compost was then laid in rows and covered by a fleece blanket to cook; heat killed any pathogens and weed seeds. Twice a week for a month, workers remove the blankets and spider a mechanical windrow turner over the top, fluffing and mixing. After resting for several more months, the compost is fed into a screening machine. About 60 percent of McEnroe’s 28,000 tons of finished material nourishes the farm, which raises organic vegetables, grains and pastured meat. The rest, selling for up to $100 a cubic yard, helps balance its books.

The nation’s industrialized compost operations bring in roughly $3 billion annually; American farmers bought $21.2 billion of conventional fertilizers in 2016. I liked being part of this smaller economy, though. McEnroe’s adorable Angus calves and grain-filled silos made it easy to imagine that my waste was circling virtuously, even as I blocked out the miserable labors of the transfer station downstate. The system worked, I liked to think. Compost could scale up; food could return to being food.Ms. Krauss is a connoisseur of songs, not a songwriter, and her enchantment with the compositions she has culled ordinarily sets the tone of her self-produced albums. This time, though, she chose to pursue a partnership that could yield a particular vibe. She lent her voice to a wistful duet version of “Make the World Go Away” on Jamey Johnson’s 2012 collection of classic Hank Cochran country songs, and the elegant shuffle echoed easeful studio performances of the Nashville Sound era. She zeroed in on the project’s seasoned producer, Buddy Cannon, who had a low-key way of drawing her out at the microphone.

“When I sang for him,” she said, “I noticed that there was such a desire to perform for him, and that doesn’t always come so much. Usually you’re kind of searching your own navel all the time for your inspiration.”

When Ms. Krauss and Mr. Cannon began sifting through potential songs on his office computer, she stipulated that they steer clear of go-to country standards. “I’m just one big B-side,” she quipped, referring to songs that take a back seat to the more popular tracks on records. Drawing heavily from the ’50s and ’60s catalogs of country and bluegrass stylists like Willie Nelson, Mac Wiseman, Brenda Lee, Glen Campbell and Eddy Arnold, Ms. Krauss and Mr. Cannon rounded out their selections with a couple of songs that were actually from her lifetime, one of which, “Dream of Me,” she recalled hearing at a bluegrass festival in her youth but didn’t realize that Mr. Cannon had written.

In language and chord structure, the vintage selections seem simple next to the bulk of Ms. Krauss’s repertoire. “There’s a certain feeling, a mystery about songs that are older than you, and I love that,” Ms. Krauss said. The sentiment isn’t confined to music; her two-story house, built in 1918, is full of antiques. To protect an old table from drink rings, she wryly offered her closed laptop: “Go ahead and use this coaster.”

The recording process began smoothly enough: “I just get great players in there and sit back and listen to what they do,” Mr. Cannon said. Ms. Krauss requested horns like those that Merle Haggard sometimes used, and for once, her fiddle fills are dwarfed by the frequent, pillowy flourishes of a string section.

The trouble arose when it came time to record Ms. Krauss’s vocals. “One day she’d come in to sing, and if she wasn’t hearing it the way she wanted to hear it, she’d say, ‘Today’s not the day,’” Mr. Cannon recalled. “We went in a lot of days and worked for 30 minutes and knocked off because she just said, ‘I don’t have it today.’ To me, she sounded wonderful. I mean, on her worst days, she sounds better than everybody.”

Ms. Krauss explained the recurring vocal issue was “a stress reaction”: “Your voice box just kind of, brrp, just closes up. It tightens up, and you have to loosen it up.” She turned to physical therapy, then visited the noted voice coach Ron Browning, who suggested she “stop striving and just be.” “I felt like I was 17 again,” she marveled. “It was amazing! I’ve given people lessons with him as gifts.”

As a young singer, Ms. Krauss tended to use the full force of her rarefied instrument, but by the time she scored a mid-90s country breakthrough with “When You Say Nothing at All,” she was artfully recalibrating her approach, softening her attack, applying beguiling, breathy shading. “I was talking to Jerry Douglas about this,” she said, referring to the Dobro player in Union Station, “and we were like, ‘Remember when you first started playing, and it was so much fun, and you didn’t think about anything, and you just did what you did? And then you got really wrapped up in watching what you would do to refine what you do?’”

She summarized, “I think you go from being mindless to being self-conscious, and then you want to end up being mindless again.”

Along the way, Ms. Krauss came to embody a particular feminine vocal archetype. “There’s something about how clear her tone is and how much control she has and restraint she uses,” said the country-pop singer-songwriter Cam. “She can sing bluegrass, Americana, country, across all those genres, and she can reach so many people that don’t even listen to those genres normally.”

The eight million or so who bought the T Bone Burnett-produced soundtrack to “O Brother, Where Art Thou” heard Ms. Krauss sing the folk hymn “Down to the River to Pray” a cappella, with impossibly delicate vibrato; one could imagine her floating above the fleshly realm, an otherworldly vessel for earthy music. People invariably describe her as an “angel,” a word that has no room for the sort of cheeky, blues-tinged note bending she does at times on this album.

“Well, obviously, they don’t know me,” she said, swiftly brushing the perception aside. “But what a compliment.”

Contradictions are at the heart of Ms. Krauss’s sensibilities: the juxtaposition of the exquisiteness of her singing and the brawniness of the male vocal partners she chooses (in this case, Mr. Johnson, Hank Williams Jr. and others); contrasts between notions of naturalness and refinement; the tension between mastering a well-mapped musical lineage and embracing a broad-minded, pop-attuned versatility.

On the title track of the new album, Ms. Krauss displays an empathetic grasp of a longstanding country theme: anxiety about how exposure to cosmopolitanism can change a person. “He came to you, big city, from our little country town,” she frets, “and every step he takes with you is down/You’re as cold and heartless as the chilling winds that blow/Before you freeze his heart, please let him go.”

Her reading of “River in the Rain,” from Roger Miller’s Huckleberry Finn-inspired musical “Big River,” conveys melancholy admiration of forceful, unfettered freedom. She accentuates the inner dialogue of “You Don’t Know Me,” her singing burdened with quiet resignation to keep hidden romantic desires hidden. Hinting at feelings just beneath the surface is a Krauss specialty, and such “one-sided conversations” are her “favorite subject.” “A lot of times, women, their strength has been judged by their ability to hide emotion,” she mused.

Ms. Krauss will go only so far in analyzing her gifts and inclinations before retreating to modesty or comic relief. Asked how conscious she is of her image, she offered a goofy anecdote: Many years ago, when she was just beginning to be recognized in public, she wanted so badly to go for a swim on tour that she bought a maternity swimsuit at a garage sale, despite not being pregnant, and was, of course, spotted wearing the ill-fitting thing.

“That’s the only kind of awareness — like, ‘Oh man, I wish I would have cleaned up,’” she said, sounding far more amused than embarrassed. “But really, otherwise, you’re just doing your gig.”This is disappointing. At the same time, the show doesn’t lack for political content; there’s plenty, however discreetly framed. And there are advantages to having no ironbound curatorial concept in play: At least the 30 or so artists get equal time with their varied voices, some mild, some strong, several new to New York.

Still, some thematic structuring would have been a help, even at the risk of reinforcing stereotypes of tropical exoticism, revolutionary fervor, etc. One obvious theme is the presence of nature, a universally loaded one in the age of climate crisis. It’s everywhere here. The performance artist Glenda Léon notates music and dance scores with images of raindrops. The Cuban-American conceptualist Maria Elena González punches holes in photographs of palm trees.

Humberto Díaz, currently an artist-in-residence at the Bronx Museum, extends the active life of fallen tree branches he scavenges from the city’s parks by attaching industrial brooms to their tips. For a long-unseen installation from the early 1990s, the artist Alexis Leiva Machado, known as Kcho, transforms a set of palm saplings into what look like giant oars, a reminder of earlier waves of exodus from the island by boat to escape political persecution.

The Cuban-born Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) was part of that refugee generation and came to the United States as a child. Her attachment to Cuba remained profound, often expressed as an intimate, sacrificial identification with the natural world. In a series of works called “Siluetas,” she virtually merged with it, buried herself, by tracing and burning the shape of her body into the earth, as documented in a dozen photographs from her art school years at the University of Iowa in the 1970s.

In such images, Ms. Mendieta was indirectly referring to a specific aspect of Cuban cultural history: the forced mass migration that was the Atlantic slave trade. Beginning in the 16th century, hundreds of thousands of slaves were shipped from Africa to Spanish colonial Cuba to work on sugar plantations, bringing their languages, arts and spiritual lives with them.

The spirit of Afro-Caribbean religions that developed on the island was central to much of Ms. Mendieta’s work, and to that of several other artists in the show. In the 1980s, José Bedia became a priest of Palo Monte, a religion with roots in the Kongo kingdom of Central Africa, home to many New World slaves. Belkis Ayón, who took her own life in Havana in 1999 at age 32, was inspired by Abakuá, an all-male, Nigerian-derived secret society that she, heretically, infuses with female energy in a magnificent body of black-and-white figurative prints.

These hybrid faiths, and others, are still widely practiced. And skin color continues to be, even in a country that once made utopian claims to colorblindness, a social and economic determinant. This is a reality that the artist María Magdalena Campos-Pons has been addressing for years in ritualistic whiteface performances — one took place, unannounced, in Piazza San Marco during the 2013 Venice Biennale — and in role-playing photographic self-portraits, like the ones in the show.

The Cuban Revolution is itself a state religion and its gods inevitably find a place in the show, though as objects of ambivalent devotion. A cigar-puffing Fidel Castro makes an early appearance, surrounded by peasant soldiers and patriotic kids, in a 1969 painting by the political Pop artist Raúl Martínez. José Angel Toirac and Meira Marrero depict Fidel Castro as an absurdly towering titan, while Carlos Garaicoa emblazons his name above a photograph of a headless sculptural angel shot in an upscale Havana hotel.

Ezekiel Suárez, who with the artist Sandra Ceballos founded Havana’s oldest alternative space, Espacio Aglutinador, was hounded by censors in the 1990s. In response, he took to writing secret, tweet-size messages to Castro on the reverse side of his abstract embroideries, literally hiding subversive content in his art.

For decades, to the outside world, Cuban art meant propaganda. Portraits of Castro and Che Guevara were best sellers because that’s all that was on the market. The curators of “Wild Noise” put an antic spin on this phenomenon, without abandoning it. But they also include some genuinely moving political work. In 1996, Mr. Toirac and Ms. Marrero did a series of 12 portraits, from news photos, of corpses found in a city morgue after the Cuban president, Fulgencio Batista, had been overthrown by the Revolution in 1959. Who these people were, and why and how they died, is unrecorded. The military has memorials to unknown soldiers; these are unknown citizens. The artists treat them with reverence, painting their features with wine and gold leaf.

Photo

They take a refined, even delicate approach to a large subject. There are other examples. Diana Fonseca Quiñones distills the texture of a crumbling Havana in small abstract collages made of paint scraps harvested from building exteriors. Pedro Pablo Oliva portrays José Martí, the apostle of Cuban independence, as a slumbering saint in dapper tropical whites. And the conceptualist Wilfredo Prieto sketches, in the faintest of ink lines on a long paper scroll, images of every project he has completed in a prolific career.

In the end, Ms. Bruguera’s resistance to a show that she found to be too unprotestingly in line with the Cuban government’s dictatorial control of art is well taken. And this leads to a natural question: If work from the permanent collection of the National Museum in Havana had traveled, would it be any more radical than what we see here?

In short, “Wild Noise” maybe as good as we could expect considering the official sources and compromises involved. We may find a bolder take on truth-in-history in a larger show, “Adiós Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950,” which opens at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, on March 5. In terms of point of view, the title alone speaks volumes.Photo

When an applicant to the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health got an email on Wednesday saying it was “delighted to welcome” her, she said she was overcome with euphoria.

She began sobbing, and her body shook.

“I couldn’t even control my body,” said the applicant, a 23-year-old for whom Columbia was the No. 1 choice. “My teeth even started chattering. I didn’t even know that could happen.”

That jubilation lasted only about 75 minutes, however, as a second email arrived informing her — and 276 other prospective students — that the acceptance notices had been sent in error.

When the applicant got the follow-up email, she said she had the same physical reaction as before — but for opposite reasons. She said that when she called the admissions office, a person who answered the phone apologized but could shed no light on why it happened.

“This is a really big mistake,” said the applicant, who requested anonymity because she was still awaiting word on her application and feared antagonizing admissions officials. “It’s ridiculous. I don’t understand how they can get away with it and just say ‘sorry.’”

For applicants, the episode added anxiety to a time already fraught with it. Which school accepts — or rejects — an applicant can have broad implications about a student’s future finances and career path.

The errant email from Columbia was the latest in a string of similar mistakes by big-name universities. Carnegie Mellon University last year emailed about 800 applicants to a graduate computer science program to say they were accepted, only to email them again later the same day to say, in effect: Oops, not really. Similar episodes happened at Tulane last year and Fordham in 2013.

In 2014, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published an account explaining how it had sent an email about undergraduate financial aid that erroneously told applicants they had been accepted. Time magazine inventoried a list of errant admission episodes dating to 1995. One of the more spectacular failures occurred in 2009, when the University of California, San Diego sent 28,000 students an email saying they had been accepted when they had not been.

In its second email on Wednesday, Columbia University attributed the mistake to “human error” but did not elaborate. A university official was not available on Thursday night to comment.

The second email, which was signed by Julie Kornfeld, vice dean for education, said that the university was “working assiduously to strengthen our internal procedures” to ensure it would not happen again.

“We deeply apologize for this miscommunication,” the email said. “We value the energy and enthusiasm that our applicants bring to the admissions process, and regret the stress and confusion caused by this mistake.”Photo

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A man from North Korea has been arrested in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Malaysian police announced Saturday.

The man, identified as Ri Jong Chol, 46, was arrested Friday evening, the police said, but they provided no further details.

The police had been searching for four men, including at least one North Korean, who they believed had been involved in the attack on Mr. Kim on Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

Two women suspected of being involved in the attack, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, were arrested earlier in the week. A Malaysian man, described as the boyfriend of the Indonesian woman, was arrested and is said to be assisting the police in the investigation.

On Friday, North Korea broke its silence on Mr. Kim’s assassination, demanding that the Malaysian authorities surrender the body and vowing to reject any post-mortem they conducted.

The response to the assassination, in a statement by the North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, also accused the Malaysians of plotting to “besmirch” the North over the killing, heightening tensions between the two countries.

The statement was read to reporters outside a Kuala Lumpur hospital where the body of Mr. Kim, 46, has been held since he was attacked on Monday at the airport.

The police believe that the assassination was carried out by two women who struck Mr. Kim with a poisoned needle and wiped quick-acting poison on his face as he awaited a flight to Macau, where he lives with his family.

Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said Friday that the Indonesian suspect, Siti Aishah, told the Malaysian police that she had thought she was engaged in a prank and had been paid a small amount for her participation. She told the police that she had not realized it was an assassination, he said.

South Korean officials have said they suspect that the assassination was ordered by Kim Jong-un, 33, as part of his effort to consolidate power in the reclusive country, run by his family for nearly seven decades.

Malaysian news media on Thursday quoted officials as saying that the North Korean government had requested the body.

The ambassador’s statement on Friday did not identify the body as that of Kim Jong-nam.

But the statement, quoted by news agencies at the scene, said that the “Malaysian side forced the post-mortem without our permission and witnessing” and that “we will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance.”

Channel NewsAsia, in its account of the ambassador’s response, quoted him as saying, “We will respond strongly to the moves of the hostile forces towards us with their intent to besmirch the image of our republic by politicizing this incident.”

No relatives of Kim Jong-nam have come forward from Macau to claim the body. The South China Morning Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported on Friday that the relatives had been placed under police protection in Macau, fearing for their safety.President Trump spoke about his executive orders, the economy and his polls. We checked the facts.“This is probably more math-y black and Hispanic kids than I’ve seen in my whole career,” said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. “That’s why I’m here.”

The extreme racial homogeneity in the rarefied realm of young math wizards has drawn little attention in a nation where racial equality in the basic institutions of civic life — schools, housing, health care, policing — remains elusive. But it has become an increasing source of consternation for some mathematicians, educators and business leaders, who see it directly linked to the striking underrepresentation of blacks and Latinos in high-paying, high-status jobs in finance, science and technology. As those occupations increasingly propel our society, they fear that enrichment programs for mathematically gifted children, while rooted in meritocratic ideals, have become a particularly potent means of reinforcing privilege.

Even as movie audiences celebrate “Hidden Figures,” the story of black women who overcame legally sanctioned discrimination to perform critical calculations in the race to put a man on the moon, educators say that new, subtler obstacles to higher-level math education have arisen. These have had an outsize influence on racial prejudice, they contend, because math prowess factors so heavily in the popular conception of intelligence — a concern that recently provoked the creation of “Mathematically Gifted and Black” and “Latin@s and Hispanics in Mathematical Sciences,” websites featuring math professionals from underrepresented backgrounds.

“Fundamentally, this is a question about power in society,” said Daniel Zaharopol, BEAM’s director. “Not just financial power, but who is respected, whose views are listened to, who is assumed to be what kind of person.”

BEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program’s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph.D.’s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative problem-solving that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline.

And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM 6-ers with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders — a mix of hedge-fund millionaires and professional mathematicians — was to hook them enough to want to keep at it.

A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against.

By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of well-off parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges.

“When I was 6, my dad taught me to use the abacus and do mental math,” one student at a selective program called MathPath wrote on the application form.

By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where “math is not in the air,” Dr. Bernstein said.

The parents of the boy at the snack cart, Jonathan Jackson, do not have degrees in math or science. His school, Kipp STAR, is a well-regarded charter school in Harlem, but does not have a math team. And like many of the other students at BEAM, Jonathan, who is African-American, seemed to have already internalized the racial stereotypes about math that, studies have shown, shape self-image among young Americans of all backgrounds.

“They did a study that shows white kids have more chances,” he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, “I don’t know if it’s really true.”

A Subway Ritual Begins

Tracing Jonathan’s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures.

Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program’s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school.

When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. “You need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,” she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.

She was all the more certain on the Friday before the program started, when the world awakened to a Facebook Live video of an unarmed black cafeteria worker in Minnesota, Philando Castile, bleeding to death in his car after being shot by a police officer.

She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: “Just do what he says, and like, don’t try to resist,” he recited.

She thought of math as a field that “usually Asians dominate,’’ she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison.

“But it could act as a buffer,” she remembers thinking.

Ms. Ashburn, a postal clerk who graduated last year with a business degree from Monroe College in the Bronx, left before dawn for work on the first day of camp. Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, a year older than him, was headed to summer school after dropping off their younger brothers at karate camp. Jonathan walked himself around the corner at 7 a.m. to meet his subway group in what would become a daily routine.

Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. “Hello,” he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. “I am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school.”

Thays Garcia, also 11, was the group’s third member.

“I love math,” she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems.

Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony.

Now an account manager at Coca-Cola, Mr. Rincon had several years earlier set Thays up with Khan Academy, a widely used service with free online math lessons.

As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: “Calculator.”

But Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not “the theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,” as he put it in his email to BEAM. “I want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see.”

A “Supersize” Math Education?

Photo

Jonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not.

He had also placed above grade level on New York’s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city’s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black.

He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created.

But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to high-performing minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level.

Others voiced perceptions that reflect common stereotypes — including the idea that Asians are naturally better at math than anyone else. Sociologists say that misconception exists in part because a high proportion of Asian immigrants to the United States already possess a math-related degree. They are, in turn, better equipped to steer children toward advanced math programs, as are native-born scientists and engineers, who are disproportionately white.

In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns.

Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups.

“We don’t see many applications from blacks and Latinos,” said Glenn Stevens, the director of Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists, a summer math camp for high school students based at Boston University.

“I wish I could tell you it was improving,” said Elaine Hansen, the director of the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. “I don’t see that it is.”

African-Americans, about 15 percent of the working-age population under 45, obtained about 2 percent of the Ph.D.’s in the fields of math, engineering and physical sciences awarded in 2015, compared to 18.7 percent in social work and 7.3 percent of doctoral degrees in all fields, according to the National Science Foundation. (A total of 20 black graduate students received Ph.D’s in math and statistics, out of 1,802). Hispanics were only marginally better represented.

That means whites and Asian-Americans are the near-exclusive recipients of the tens of billions of dollars in public funding devoted to research in those fields. It also affects private-sector employment: Both Google and Facebook reported last year that Hispanic and black employees together account for only 4 percent of their technical work force.

There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides poorer-quality education to many minority students.

But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don’t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of enrichment-math experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology.

“How do you even know a whole bunch of students are supersizing their education and you’re just doing your homework and getting A’s in your A.P. calculus classes?” said Quinton McArthur, M.I.T.’s associate dean of admissions. “It’s exacerbated the gap and no one even realizes.”

BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been “swimming in a culture of math’’ from an early age.

But BEAM’s selective camp for students from low-income backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results.

“Although our students make tremendous progress,” Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, “it is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential.”

BEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: “We need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,’’ he said.

The Camp, and Complications

At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic.

“Mathematicians love the struggle,” one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. “When you feel uncomfortable, you’re learning.”

But whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate.

In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students’ progress. “I can’t get them to stop doing math,” said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side.

But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated.

“I find they’re not very good at self-advocating when they’re lost or bored,” said another teacher, Marcelle Good. “I guess they’re used to being lost or bored.”

During the program’s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations.

“How do you get kids who haven’t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?” Dr. Bernstein lamented.

“He’s engageable,” said Michael Pershan, who teaches middle-school math at St. Ann’s, a private school in Brooklyn Heights. “I vote for upping the mathiness.”

“I’m open to suggestions for how to reach him,” said another. “He’s a pretty big distraction in my class.”

Beyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math.

A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived.

“Hey, Thays,” he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner.

He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a close-up picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train.

“You going to try it?” she asked, nodding toward the problem. They both knew she had already solved it. (See how she did it in this quiz; it’s question No. 5.)

He shrugged, looking sideways at her.

“Maybe,” he said.

By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another’s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition; Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go.

But they didn’t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer.

His friends did not know that Jonathan’s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school.

Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school.

But one day on the subway that week, they talked about Black Lives Matter, a subject that held an emotional resonance, at least for Thays and Jonathan. When it came up, it seemed at first that Emyr had not been able to hear the thread of Thays and Jonathan’s conversation over the subway din.

Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it.

Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: “There was a kid in the back of the car,” he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile.

Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr’s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican.

“No,” Emyr said. “But it’s true.”

Jonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in.

“How can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?” he demanded. “It’s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop.”

Seeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day.

Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her “Codes Codes Codes” class: “I’m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions.”

Then Thays added the problem’s final complication: “How many questions does it take if I’m allowed to lie once?”

As they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the error-correcting codes that underlie digital storage and communications.

“There’s also something called binary,” Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr.

The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. “What about you guys?”

“Of course I’m going to BEAM 7,” Emyr said.

“J. J.?” she prodded. But he was peering into his phone.

A Counselor Assist

That Jonathan was one of just a few African-American boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young African-American males, even in elementary school.

BEAM relies on the schools with whom it partners to select which students to take its admissions test, and teachers, studies have shown, pass over qualified black students for gifted programs at higher rates than for whites and Hispanics. Black boys, said Danny Martin, an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, are most subject to the classroom dynamic he calls “Learning Mathematics While Black.’’

Along with incarceration rates that are higher for young black men than for any other group, that dynamic may contribute to why black women receive a higher share of bachelor’s degrees in math, chemistry and physics, fields in which men of other ethnicities outnumber women.

Whatever the reason, many of the college-age counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan.

One of them was Christian Henderson, an African-American accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N.Y. “It’s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,” he said, “so they know in their head they’re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that’s true.”

Jonathan’s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics.

A straight-A student at a Harlem high school where the majority of his fellow students were deemed unprepared for college, Mr. Pineda had taken A.P. calculus and secured admission to Amherst with the help of an organization called QuestBridge aimed at matching underrepresented minority students with top-tier colleges.

By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the “summer math nerds,” as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead.

“You should look at this, J. J.,” Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM’s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. “I think you’d like it.”

Thays’s Absence

The following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train.

Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911.

Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room.

When she didn’t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays’s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. “Thays! I know you’re just at home watching TV!”

He also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns.

BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you’re trying to make a triangle.

For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you’ll need 3 pennies total; if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies; for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10.

So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin.

After nearly a week away, Thays returned — her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery — to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared.

At home on one of the final days, Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes.

“How’s that camp going?” she asked. “Are you still behind in your math?”

He was silent for a moment.

“You know, I’m not at that camp because I’m bad at math,” he said finally. “I’m there because I’m good at math.”

The Last Subway Ride

Photo

On the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan.

Mr. Zaharopol made a final plug for the online pre-algebra class he hoped they would take, which started a few weeks after the beginning of school. Each student received a sheet of paper with information about how to log on. BEAM would cover the cost.

They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year.

Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up.

A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays’s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own.

“She wants to go home with her regular group,” he said, shrugging.

On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar; then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character.

“You made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,” he noted. “Their eyes are supposed to be black on white.”

“Where’s my present?” Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. “Come on, Thays.”

Thays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope.

“Oh special, special JJ,” she had written. “You are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7.”

Jonathan paused for a moment before looking up.

“Now if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,” he said, and put his arm around her.

The three exchanged phone numbers.

Doubts and the Power of Math

Photo

A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. “I want to get a Ph.D. in math,” one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: “I learned math they don’t teach me at school.”

The teachers, though, wondered how much they’d really been able to achieve.

“They’re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,” Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. “But how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?”

As police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan’s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. “It’s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,” she said of the new president.

She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt.

Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online pre-algebra class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons.

“I might not be able to do it for a few weeks,” he told me. “I have homework.”

But Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home.

And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again.

“Hey,” he typed into his phone.

“Who is this?” came the reply.

“Jonathan from BEAM,” he replied.

“J. J.??!!”

Her phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn’t received his texts.

They traded messages, until Jonathan’s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended.

“I am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,” he typed quickly.

When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? “I want to get into Bronx Science!” Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city’s most selective public high schools. “I mean who doesn’t?” Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? “To see my BEAM peers,” wrote Emyr, in addition to “challenging my brain.”

Jonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn’t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn’t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM’s key lesson: “I find proportion problems interesting because I’ll always be confused,” he wrote, “but I figure out the answer anyways.”

On Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.

Most of his pictures show elegant interiors, but he’ll also turn his back on a sunken living room or paneled library and point his camera out the window. More than 200 of his multimillion-dollar panoramas are collected in “Vista Manhattan: Views From New York City’s Finest Residences,” recently out from Schiffer Publishing ($45). Mr. Tauber, who lives in Rye, N.Y., spoke about his King Kong perspectives, the magic of twilight and the best places to live and look.

What will readers find in this book that they can’t see from an observation deck or very high hotel lobby?

There aren’t a lot of public places in Central Park where you get to look over the reservoir the way you can from the Ardsley, at 320 Central Park West. There are a zillion places where you see the Empire State Building, but at 845 United Nations Plaza — Trump World Tower — there’s a great perspective where the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building look like they’re the same height because the Chrysler Building is closer. And you wouldn’t necessarily be in any of those places at that magical period 20 to 30 minutes after sunset, when it’s not absolutely dark, and lights are beginning to shine through the windows, and there’s that glow. The time of day plays a large role in how a view looks. After shooting an apartment during the day, sometimes we’ll return to shoot at twilight.

With so many buildings going up, are New Yorkers losing their views?

In one of my shots you see the south side of the Essex House hotel and Hampshire House building on Central Park South reflected in 157 West 57th Street, one of the new, supertall condo towers. You get the sense that the view the people had in those buildings is no longer there.

Do you think residents of these towers ever get tired of their views?

It’s never come up, but I think there’s no doubt they get used to it. Especially when you’re living above the clouds, you’re almost not even part of the city, everything is so small below you. That’s the perspective you get from the upper floors of the new 432 Park Avenue building, that pencil that sticks up. You can see it from everywhere. It’s so tall, I have to shoot wider or else I’d chop off the top of it.

Are there any pictures you regret not including?

There’s a great shot in my Instagram feed of 1 World Trade Center from 100 Barclay Street, sort of straight up the north side of the tower. Because of the way the sides of 1 World Trade are designed, the top just sort of disappears into a point. And then 100 Barclay and 7 World Trade Center are reflected in the glass.

It is not the first time Italy has forged an agreement with Libya to stem the flow of migration. But the most effective attempt was before Libya descended into chaos with the collapse of its government in 2011.

Libya has since become the prime launching point for many of the 180,000 migrants who reached Italy last year, when more than 5,000 people died trying to make the Mediterranean crossing.

Even previous agreements met criticism for the sometimes brutal tactics that North African countries used to hold back migrants. Embryonic as it is, this latest plan to stem the flow is already being criticized as both potentially unworkable and inhumane.

Some international experts are skeptical about the scope of the operation, and human rights groups fear the plan is the equivalent of throwing the migrants back into the frying pan of Libya, where many are fleeing dangers and dire conditions.

The internationally backed Libyan government the European Union is dealing with has barely a toehold in the fragmented, violence-plagued country, and may even be verging on collapse. Much of the Libyan coast remains in the hands of criminal and rebel groups.

“It’s a first step taken with an interim government that doesn’t really control the country, but it’s a first step,” said Natalino Ronzitti, professor emeritus of international law and an adviser at the Institute for International Affairs in Italy.

“We need to see whether it complies with human rights and whether Europe will open identification centers for migrants in Libya, or will help Libya do so, but we know little about that at present,” Ms. Ronzitti said.

The pilot program is the first of its kind within Operation Sophia, the European Union’s anti-immigrant trafficking operation, and is part of an effort that European leaders agreed to this month at their summit meeting in Malta, where they pledged “sustainable and predictable” funding to train the Libyan Coast Guard.

The day before the Malta meeting, Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, signed an agreement with the Libyan premier, Fayez Serraj, to curb migrant trafficking from Libyan shores.

In exchange, Italy will provide money, technology, medicine and training to set up migrant holding centers in the country, which it ruled as a colony between 1911 and 1943.

Italian Embassy officials were the last European delegation to leave Tripoli in 2015, and last month became the first to return to their original compound.

This week, Italy’s Interior Ministry hosted a meeting in Rome with 10 Libyan mayors from the southern region of Fezzan, the main gateway for migrants into Libya, to underscore Italy’s intention to help them control the border.

“We can’t expect such a large phenomenon to have an immediate solution,” Roberta Pinotti, Italy’s defense minister, acknowledged one recent morning aboard the aircraft carrier stationed in Valletta’s harbor.

“But it’s a phenomenon that we want to be able to govern,” she said, citing the thousands of weekly arrivals in Italy, even in winter.

Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, echoed the sentiment. “The training didn’t take place because there is a crisis, but to try to prevent a crisis,” he said.

The migrant holding centers are among the most contentious components of the plan.

Hussein Thwadi, the mayor of the western coastal city of Sabratha, Libya, the busiest departure point for Mediterranean crossings, has said that keeping migrants in Libya is a “dangerous step” because the country does not have the resources to deal with them.

Huge numbers of migrants are already in Libya, and they face constant threats, humanitarian groups point out.

Last year, Doctors Without Borders highlighted the “alarming levels of violence” against migrants and refugees in Libya, including sexual attacks and killings, not only from smugglers, but also from myriad armed groups and individuals.

Migrants reported being detained by militiamen for months in dire conditions. Others were kept in a form of slavery by private individuals who forced them into labor, often in exchange for scarce food.

“As Libya is not a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and is itself emerging from a humanitarian crisis, E.U. countries cannot assume that these rights are granted,” Doctors Without Borders said last year, referring to the United Nations treaty that outlines the rights of the displaced. “E.U. countries, therefore, should not deny people the chance of reaching Europe.”

Anything that stems the flow of migrants in Libya also runs the danger of running up against the interests of the powerful armed groups that control the trade. In a country racked by conflict, migrant smuggling has become a lucrative business for a bewildering array of criminal gangs and associated militias.

European leaders concede that Libya’s instability and widespread violence were causes of concern.

“The young men who received this training, when they return to their country, will face enormous pressure from criminal gangs and smugglers who have an influx of millions of euros a week,” Mr. Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, acknowledged.

Most smugglers’ boats depart from remote beaches along a 230-mile stretch of coastline in the west of the country, between Misurata and the border with Tunisia.

Theoretically, this territory is controlled by the U.N.-backed unity government led by Mr. Serraj, which installed itself in Tripoli last March with backing from the United States and other Western countries.

In reality, much of the coastline, as well as the desert towns through which the migrants pass, is controlled by a network of criminal and militia groups with a vested financial interest in the continuation of the trade.

Few believe the unity government has the military muscle, political clout or money to stop the trade, given that it barely controls even the capital, Tripoli.

Its forces control the city port and a handful of government ministries, but otherwise compete for turf with a rival administration led by a coalition of Islamists and militants from Misurata.

Gunmen from dueling factions frequently clash on the city streets in violence that has intensified in recent weeks, prompting warnings from Western officials that the unity government is in danger of being completely marginalized, if not worse.

The U.N.-backed administration is also under pressure from rivals in the east of the country, where forces led by the strongman Gen. Khalifa Hifter have taken near-complete control of the country’s second-largest city, Benghazi.

General Hifter has consolidated his forces, with backing from Egypt and Russia, and has shunned the unity government. During an Egyptian-led effort to broker peace between rival Libyan factions in Cairo this week, Mr. Serraj and Mr. Hifter refused to meet.

The Italian plan to train the Libyan Coast Guard has already run afoul of Libya’s fractious political scene after the San Giorgio, an Italian Navy vessel participating in the program, docked in western Libya last month.

In an indication of the potential pitfalls ahead, leaders in the east of Libya accused the Italians of illegally entering the country.Bighorn Sheep Hunting Permits Fund Conservation

Why Older Women Postpone Retirement

Not Everyone Loves ‘La La Land’

On the other hand, when I saw “Hidden Figures,” at the end the entire audience applauded, and was chattering on about the movie when leaving the theater. “La La Land” left me kind of cold and uninspired, whereas “Hidden Figures” did just the opposite. I’m hoping “Hidden Figures” is the upset winner for the Oscar. The country needs to feel good right now.

Countless shared the view of an Arizona veteran I interviewed: “ They didn’t have to draft us. It was a part of what we were supposed to do.” As he saw it, “It was part of my duty as a man.”

Others found themselves ensnared by the draft. As one veteran noted, “The Selective Service sword of Damocles had been hanging over our head since we all turned 18.” Still, a large majority of those drafted in 1967 answered their country’s call: Only 7,234 of the 298,559 men who were drafted failed to report for duty that year. “I guess I just accepted it and figured, ‘Hey, let’s go give it a shot — make the best of it,’ ” one veteran told me.

Wherever the men were coming from, they either boarded crowded troop ships (many from World War II) or left on planes; in the latter case, in less than 24 hours, they went from home to a war zone. One soldier said that upon arriving in Vietnam, he “felt like Alice stepping through the looking glass.” The heavy odor of jet fuel and feeling like being in a “very smelly sauna” took his breath away. As he stepped off the plane, a stewardess mouthed “good luck.” “I knew my life would never be the same from this moment on,” he recalled. “This was the initiation into my rites of passage.”

The experiences of service members in Vietnam often differed depending on location, type of service and, above all, timing. Some rarely left the relatively safe confines of the major bases, working as clerks, accountants and mechanics. Others were thrown into combat; an astounding 997 men were killed on their first day in Vietnam.

Vietnam ’67 Historians, veterans and journalists recall 1967 in Vietnam, a year that changed the war and changed America.

While 2.3 million men and women served in the Vietnam theater, the hard fighting fell on a relatively small percentage of those men, primarily the infantry and close support, like artillerymen, tank crews and pilots. And it’s true that many of those men experienced psychological and emotional difficulties. A veteran admitted crying “for the suffering, the pain, and for the fear that invades you because you don’t know when you’re going to die.” But few of them broke; most conquered the fear (and often the boredom) of searching for an elusive guerrilla enemy in the South, or fighting pitched battles in the northern war zones against hardened North Vietnamese Army regulars.

Where men did sometimes break, and where they were most liable to commit war crimes, was in the South. Being unable to identify the enemy created overwhelming stress. A barber or laundress on base or a peasant working in the fields during the day might lay booby traps at night. This led to atrocities: Rogue members of the anti-guerrilla Tiger Force killed hundreds of civilians; in March 1968, American soldiers killed hundreds more at the South Vietnamese village of My Lai.

But war crimes were very far from common. Indeed, for each atrocity, there were many more acts of kindness toward civilians and bravery in combat. Soldiers rebuilt schools, homes and roads, often on their own initiative; 244 Americans received the Medal of Honor, more than in World War I and Korea combined.

Most men, wherever they were, just wanted to go home. Few had any illusions about how the war would shape the rest of their lives, but they also pined for their old normal existence, and a return to their families and hometowns. Few veterans can forget the day they left Vietnam, most walking up the steps of a “Freedom Bird” airliner for the trip home. One recalled, “Boy, everybody stood up and cheered when the pilot announced we were crossing into the United States.”

But those returning received few parades or recognition, and often felt isolated from their countrymen. One remembered his sister asking, “Who are you fighting for, the North Vietnamese or the other guys?” He lamented: “I knew that nobody back here understood what was happening. Because if my own family didn’t know, what hope did I have with somebody who even know me?”

The disconnection and boredom of life stateside led some to return to Vietnam for another tour. Nonetheless, the majority persevered back home. As one said: “Most of the veterans returned home reasonably whole, as whole as returning veterans from earlier wars. The majority were not dopers, did not beat their wives or children, did not commit suicide, did not haunt the unemployment offices, and did not boozily sink into despair and futility.”

They hid their emotional scars, just as their fathers had after World War II, though they bore the added injury of an angry, often disrespectful America. They were forced to carry the weight of political and military decisions, to answer for Johnson and William Westmoreland, whether they agreed with them or not. This, in a way, is where the stereotype of the fragile veteran finds some truth — not in the war itself, but in the reception, back home. As the writer Tim O’Brien noted, “Some vets, more than a decade later, have not yet recovered, and some never will.”

Still, polls show that a vast majority of Vietnam veterans are proud of their service and sacrifice.

This isn’t to say that Vietnam veterans were no different from those of other wars; the unique experiences of that war created unique challenges at home. Thousands suffered the long-term effects of Agent Orange; thousands more, especially those who served later in the war, came home with drug and alcohol problems, or later developed them as coping mechanisms.

But lost in that stereotype is the strength of the response from the veteran community. Veteran activists revolutionized the Veterans Administration health system, demanding — and winning — better care. Others, like Bob Kerrey, Max Cleland, Chuck Hagel and John McCain, moved into politics, where they worked on behalf of fellow veterans. And they built the Wall — the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Founded by veterans and funded through private donations, the wall gave veterans a place to heal, not just themselves, but their often frayed bonds with their fellow Americans.

Of the 298,559 men who entered service in 1967, 11,363 did not return from Vietnam. Most veterans understand the feelings of an anonymous author who said: “War drew us from our homeland in the sunlit springtime of our youth. Those who did not come back alive remain in perpetual springtime, forever young, and a part of them is with us always.”The Serbian-born designer, who counts the Duchess of Cambridge, Blake Lively and Melania Trump among her clientele, has worked in this area since settling in the British capital in 1999. Her Roksanda label employs 50 people, with the multifloor studio and offices just a stone’s throw from the canal. Their go-to spot for lunch or gifts for clients is the De Beauvoir Deli Co. “There was nothing here when I arrived — now I’ve heard that Shoreditch and Hackney combined have the most designers per square foot in the whole of Europe,” said Ms. Ilincic, 40. “But the prices are going up and people are moving. It’s such a shame.”

The Irish designer, named by the British Fashion Council as the 2016 British woman’s wear designer of the year, lives with her boyfriend and baby daughter in a small Victorian house with a garden in De Beauvoir Crescent in Hackney. Her studio is nearby, and her team’s favorite drinking spot is the Prince George, just off Wilton Way. (Doubtless everyone went there early this month to celebrate the opening in New York of Ms. Rocha’s first store in the United States.)

In September, the Peter Pilotto designers invited guests to their studio for the brand’s spring runway show. Its doors open onto the Regent’s Canal, so there were swans and hipsters on bicycles sailing past the window during the event. A beloved local establishment, the nearby Towpath Cafe, provided the catering. As Mr. de Vos said at the time: “We’ll really be bringing people more into our world here, and surrounding them with what we live and breathe every day. We’ll get to show them our side of East London.”

The Irish-born designer also developed his J.W. Anderson label in the Dalston heartlands. But investment by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2013 allowed him to take over a three-story industrial building just off Kingsland Road. He lives nearby, in the Stoke Newington area. “I don’t want to live in Mayfair — it’s not the zeitgeist around me,” he said last year. In the mid-2000s, “when I came to London, I moved to Dalston, and you build your world from there.”

“My sister Tammy and I started our business in a bedroom in Dalston. Working, eating and sleeping in the same place,” said the Scottish designer , who celebrated a decade on the London Fashion Week schedule in 2016. “Then we moved into the building next door. And over time, step by step, we’ve expanded floor by floor.” Mr. Kane still lives in the neighborhood, and has said his favorite local haunt is the Dalston Superstore, an eclectic gay bar and cafe with cocktails, comfort food and a full calendar of art shows and music events.

Cloth dyeing during the Middle Ages, the Spitalfields silk weavers of the 17th and 18th centuries and the rag trade of the 19th century — the East End of London has long been a home to the fashion industry.

In the 1990s, the empty warehouses and industrial spaces of East End neighborhoods like Shoreditch and Hoxton became the studio dwellings and galleries of visual artists in the group YBA, or Young British Artists. Along with them, and through the next decade, came a generation of young fashion designers and creatives.

Today, Hackney — which includes Dalston and Haggerston, neighborhoods reached from Shoreditch and Hoxton by traveling north up the Kingsland Road — houses the studios and offices of pace-setting fashion brands and their designers, including Christopher Kane, Roksanda Ilincic, Jonathan Anderson and the team of Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos. The Haggerston Riviera, a tongue-in-cheek nickname given to a stretch of Regent’s Canal lined with cool bars and cafes, music venues and artists’ studios, is at its heart.She added, “Saloua Raouda Choucair is an extraordinary new name.”

Two years later the CRG Gallery in Manhattan organized Ms. Choucair’s first solo show in the United States. Profoundly affected by Alzheimer’s disease, she was unable to attend either one or enjoy her belated success.

“All the timings were wrong with my mother, so I’m not surprised this happened so late,” her daughter told The International Herald Tribune (now the international edition of The New York Times) in 2013. “She started with abstraction when people in Beirut were just discovering Impressionism. In the ’60s, no one was paying attention to her, and then when they started paying attention, the war started. Even if there was some good attention, something always went a little wrong.”

In an effort to redraw the art-historical map, Jessica Morgan, now the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York, organized the Tate show after chancing upon a work by Ms. Choucair in 2009 at a Beirut gallery. Speaking to BBC television in 2013, she said, “Her work is highly experimental, and she continued throughout her life to produce an extraordinary body of sculpture and painting that in many ways allows us to rethink abstraction.”

She was born Saloua Raouda in Beirut on June 24, 1916. Her father, Salim Raouda, was a landowner and pharmacist. He died of typhus soon after being conscripted into the Ottoman Army during World War I, leaving his wife, Zalfa Najjar, to raise their three children. The family, which was well off, belonged to the often persecuted Druze sect, a non-Islamic religion.

Saloua attended the progressive Ahliyyah School for Girls and took painting lessons with the nationalist landscape artists Moustafa Faroukh and Omar Onsi. She studied biology at the American Junior College for Women and philosophy and history at the American University of Beirut. An extended trip to Cairo in 1943 exposed her to Islamic art and architecture.

She helped found the Arab Cultural Center in Beirut and in 1947 exhibited at its gallery in what was often cited as the first showing of modern abstract art in the Arab world.

That year she left for Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts, whose traditionalist training she supplemented with classes at the more freewheeling Académie de la Grande Chaumière. After hearing the painter and sculptor Fernand Léger speak at the École des Beaux-Arts, she spent time at his studio before coming into her own as an early member of L’Atelier d’Art Abstrait (the Studio of Abstract Art), led by Edgar Pillet and Jean Dewasne.

She developed a series of jewel-like small paintings of interlocking geometric forms that she exhibited with the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, founded by Sonia Delaunay and Nelly van Doesburg. In 1951 she had a solo show at the Galerie Colette Allendy before returning to Beirut, where she married Yusif Choucair, a journalist.

In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two granddaughters.

Ms. Choucair’s approach was rigorously reductive and purist.

“Arabs are the most sensitively sophisticated of peoples in understanding art, and that is why they broached the subject at its abstract essence,” she wrote in her 1951 manifesto, “How the Arab Understood Visual Art.” The goal, she added, was “the eternal essence that is defined neither by time nor space.”

In the early 1960s she shifted her focus to sculpture, producing modular works that could be disassembled or reassembled into squares, rectangles and towers with an architectural feel. Le Corbusier’s modular housing project in Marseille, France, which she visited in 1949, made a deep impression on her, and she developed ingenious variations on the modular principle in her “Poems” series of the 1960s and ’70s.

Ms. Choucair worked in a variety of materials, including wood, aluminum, brass, terra cotta and tufa stone, with a pared-down elegance and sensuous touch that sometimes recalled Brancusi. Her biomorphic wood sculptures, typified by the “Screws” series of the 1970s in particular, radiated warmth and simplicity.

One of her most extended projects was the “Duals” series of the ’70s and ’80s, two-part interlocking forms in aluminum, brass, fiberglass, wood and other materials.

Ms. Choucair worked steadily through Lebanon’s civil war, which began in 1975. It left a visible imprint on her painting “Two = one,” made during her Paris years, when a bomb hit her building, ripping holes in the canvas and embedding glass shards in it.

She struggled to find an audience. “She was an avant-garde who was inspired by the principles of Islamic art, but without any visual references to what people were accustomed to seeing in that art,” her daughter, Ms. Schoukair, told The Wall Street Journal in 2013.

“There was no correlation to calligraphy or Arab-esque patterns,” she said. “Her style is pure abstraction of form and line, just like a mathematical equation. Therefore my mother was often misunderstood, pushed aside, ignored, and left to be on her own.”

Attention gradually came her way. In 1974 the Lebanese Artists Association sponsored a retrospective of her work at the National Council of Tourism in Beirut, and in 2011 her dealer, Saleh Barakat, and her daughter organized a retrospective at the Beirut Exhibition Center. In recent years her work has been seen at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, the Whitechapel Gallery in London and the Haus der Kunst in Munich.

“A critic once told me that my work has a European influence,” Ms. Choucair told one interviewer. “I object. It is a universal influence. What I experience, everyone in the world experiences, and, in fact, all of the rules I apply to my sculpture are derived from Islamic geometric design.”Organizing for Action, the political nonprofit group that grew out of former President Barack Obama’s election campaign, has created a “Recess Toolkit” with suggestions on how to effectively ask questions at the events. Last week, the group held an online seminar with members of Indivisible, the most prominent activist organization to emerge in response to Mr. Trump’s election, to coach supporters on how to challenge lawmakers — in a “civil and respectful way” advised one strategist, according to a recording of the session.

Planned Parenthood is hoping to flood the sessions with members in pink T-shirts, urging Congress to keep in place the health care law and the organization’s funding.

“It’s going to be intense,” said Emily Tisch Sussman, who leads the political arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. “All every group wants to know is how to find out where the town halls are going to be.”

The recess, traditionally a time for lawmakers to take the temperature of their constituents, comes at a surprisingly vulnerable moment for Republicans. They are struggling to gain traction on a legislative agenda despite controlling both congressional chambers and the White House, as the new administration remains mired in controversy over its targeted travel ban and pre-election contact with Russia, among other issues.

While complaints about the health care act — high premiums in particular — helped elect Mr. Trump, polls show it has become more popular as voters realize that repealing it would mean that an estimated 30 million people lose health insurance.

There are few indications at this point that the conservative base of the Republican Party is mobilizing for action on a large scale during the recess. FreedomWorks, the Washington-based libertarian group that in 2009 nurtured Tea Party groups to rally against the legislation that became the health care act, said it was planning a Washington rally next month to let lawmakers know that there remained significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

But just as the energy after Mr. Obama’s inauguration seemed to be on the right, this year it seems to be on the left. Anti-abortion demonstrations in some cities this month were met with much larger crowds of abortion rights supporters. At a widely viewed town-hall-style meeting held by Representative Gus Bilirakis in Florida, a local Republican Party chairman who declared that the health care act set up “death panels” was shouted down by supporters of the law.

Several Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have dismissed the pro-health care act crowds as “paid protesters,” not constituents. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, without offering evidence, called the protests a “very paid, AstroTurf-type movement,” unlike the Tea Party demonstrations against the drafting of the health care law in 2009, which he characterized as “very organic.”

In fact, some of the most formidable and well-established organizing groups on the left have found themselves scrambling to track all of the local groups sprouting up through social media channels like Facebook and Slack, or in local “huddles” that grew out of the women’s marches across the country the day after the inauguration.

“We’re just constantly being flooded with people asking us, ‘What can we do, where can we go?’” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org, who coined the “dam-bursting level” description. “For politicians to imagine that it’s something that any group could turn on and off like a light switch is a critical miscalculation.”

Ms. Sussman spent much of one morning this week communicating with 1,600 up-and-coming activist groups on a Slack channel that one of them organized.

“It doesn’t work for organizations to bigfoot strategy; it’s not the way organizing happens now,” said Kelley Robinson, the deputy national organizing director for Planned Parenthood, which is fighting the defunding of its health clinics. “There are bigger ideas coming out of the grass roots than the traditional organizations.”

Established groups in Washington are running more traditional campaigns.

The Alliance for Healthcare Security, a coalition of health care worker unions and other groups, is running television and online ads during the recess in five states where it believes Republican senators are either inclined to vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or vulnerable to defeat in re-election bids if they vote for repeal. The ads — in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada and West Virginia — feature constituents with life-threatening diseases telling emotional stories about how the health care law saved their lives.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is keeping track of Republican lawmakers who do not hold town-hall-style meetings. Some events have been canceled, and Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey said he had done so because the meetings have been “hijacked” by groups hostile to Mr. Trump. The committee plans to run internet ads trying to shame lawmakers for not facing their constituents in public since voting last month on a procedural motion aimed at repealing the health law.

Some of the most creative activity is coming from people who are new to political activism. In Plymouth, Minn., Kelly Guncheon, a financial planner who described himself as an independent, has organized a “With Him or Without Him” meeting for Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican who has not scheduled any of his own. A volunteer offered to make 400 cupcakes decorated with a “Where’s Waldo?” picture of Mr. Paulsen’s face, and Mr. Guncheon said he planned to project onto screens legislation that Mr. Paulsen had supported. Participants will be asked to write down questions, which will be delivered, along with a recording of the event, to Mr. Paulsen’s congressional office after the recess.

Mr. Guncheon, like other new activists, said he was not looking to traditional political groups for guidance.

“In this new culture, this new era, we have to figure out new ways to do things,” he said. “There’s certainly no leadership at the head of the Democratic Party, or the state party. Not that I’m a Democrat anyway, but that seems to be the opposition party.”

Other new groups organizing on Facebook have arranged similar events, calling them “no-show” or “empty-chair” meetings, for Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, as well as for Republican lawmakers from California, New Jersey and New York.

In response to Mr. Gardner’s complaints that the people showing up at his office to request town-hall-style meetings were paid protesters from other states, one group showed up at his office with a banner on which members had written their Colorado ZIP codes.

National groups are looking past the recess, to try to keep up the momentum for the local efforts.

Ms. Sussman, at the Center for American Progress, said her group planned a training and planning session in April for new activist leaders. Save My Care, another Washington group, is to begin an online campaign on Monday where people can register to have a hospital wristband sent to their congressional representative. The wristbands, which read “I will lose my health care if you vote to repeal,” will be delivered to Congress after the recess.

Planned Parenthood is signing up “defenders” and holding 90-minute training sessions to help teach new activists how to tell reporters and lawmakers their personal experiences with the group’s health services, and what it would mean to lose them.

The group is planning a rally in Milwaukee on Feb. 25, the last weekend of the recess week, with Planned Parenthood patients from Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s district expected to testify how they would be affected if clinics lost funding. Mr. Ryan has said he would defund Planned Parenthood in any repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Still, said Nicole Safar, the group’s director of government relations in Wisconsin, “This is more about movement-building than targeting Paul Ryan.”

“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” she said. “We’re going to put as much pressure as we can on Paul Ryan during the recess, for sure, but this isn’t going to end any time soon.”LINCOLN: “Lincoln,” by David Herbert Donald

There are so many books published about Lincoln every year — probably more books in total than on any other president — that prizes exist solely to honor books about our 16th president. Yet this (fairly massive) 1995 biography by David Herbert Donald, a Harvard historian, pulls together much of the scholarship into a definitive single volume that views Lincoln’s failings and fumbling as much as his achievements. Donald succeeds in demythologizing and humanizing one of the most admired public figures in American history.

GRANT: “Personal Memoirs,” by Ulysses S. Grant

There are several great biographies of Grant, including one coming from Ron Chernow this fall, but it’s quite possible that no one wrote about our 18th president and former commanding general of the United States Army better than Grant himself. Considered to be one of the gold standards of military memoirs, Grant’s book was an instant best seller, hailed by both critics and the public for its honesty and high literary quality, and has remained in print and on college curriculums ever since. Grant finished the book several days before he died in 1885.

McKINLEY: “The Triumph of William McKinley: Why the Election of 1896 Still Matters,” by Karl Rove

Surprised to know that George W. Bush’s former senior adviser is also an amateur historian? Some might be even more surprised to know that the book is quite good, with widely positive reviews from critics when it came out in 2015. Rove was long obsessed with McKinley’s election and with the repercussions that particular political moment has had since, down to the unexpected victory of Donald Trump. According to our reviewer, Rove’s “richly detailed, moment-by-moment account in ‘The Triumph of William McKinley’ brings to life the drama of an electoral contest whose outcome seemed uncertain to the candidate and his handlers until the end.”

THEODORE ROOSEVELT: “The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,” by Edmund Morris

It was this Pulitzer Prize-winning book that inspired Ronald Reagan to request the author, Edmund Morris, to be his official biographer. (The result of that endeavor, “Dutch,” didn’t go entirely according to plan.) The first of a three-part biography of Teddy Roosevelt (the other two volumes, “Theodore Rex” and “Colonel Roosevelt,” were equally acclaimed), this book is considered one of the best biographies of the 20th century. Our reviewer described it as “magnificent,” calling it “a sweeping narrative of the outward man and a shrewd examination of his character,” a rare work “that is both definitive for the period it covers and fascinating to read for sheer entertainment.”

WILSON: “Wilson,” by A. Scott Berg

Woodrow Wilson is one of those figures who go in and out of fashion, and he is currently very much out of vogue. Nonetheless, this fascinating 2013 book by the best-selling author of acclaimed biographies of Charles Lindbergh and Katharine Hepburn tells the tumultuous and unlikely story of the rise and terrible fall of our 28th president, who catapulted from the presidency of Princeton University to the governorship of New Jersey and into the Oval Office, with shockingly little government experience. The book begins with Wilson’s victorious welcome in Europe for the Treaty of Versailles; the rest follows like a haunted Shakespearean tragedy in vivid novelistic prose.

F.D.R.: “No Ordinary Time. Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II,” by Doris Kearns Goodwin

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This 1994 look at Franklin and Eleanor during the Second World War became a massive best seller for good reason. Written with the same historical nuance and narrative flair as her “Team of Rivals,” Goodwin’s book combines political, social and cultural history into a meaty (759 pages) but highly readable account of two extraordinary figures. As our reviewer noted, this story of a marriage is also an “ambitiously conceived and imaginatively executed participants’-eye view of the United States in the war years.”

EISENHOWER: “Eisenhower in War and Peace,” by Jean Edward Smith

Only a quarter of this book is devoted to Eisenhower’s presidency and beyond. Instead, the focus here is on the military experience that prepared Eisenhower for leadership: the ability to make do with limited means, to delegate authority, to cooperate with allies and keep up morale. It added up to a presidency marked by competence and stability. “Eisenhower’s greatest accomplishment may well have been to make his presidency look bland and boring: In this sense, he was very different from the flamboyant Roosevelt, and that’s why historians at first underestimated him,” the Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis wrote in his 2012 review. “Jean Edward Smith is among the many who no longer do.”

KENNEDY: “A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House,” by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.

Schlesinger served in the Kennedy White House, but far from clouding this history of Kennedy’s presidency, his closeness makes his a unique account of the era. The brevity of Kennedy’s tenure finds its counterpoint in this encyclopedic chronicle of those tumultuous years: the victory over Nixon, the challenges from Moscow and Southeast Asia, the momentum of civil rights. Our reviewer’s only complaint: He wished the book had been longer than its thousand-plus pages.

JOHNSON: “Master of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson,” by Robert A. Caro

Robert Caro, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “The Power Broker,” has written four volumes of his biography of Lyndon B. Johnson so far, with more to come — making the selection of just one of his installments a challenge. But then again, this book is an easy win. In the words of our reviewer, the former Times columnist Anthony Lewis: “The book reads like a Trollope novel, but not even Trollope explored the ambitions and the gullibilities of men as deliciously as Robert Caro does. I laughed often as I read. And even though I knew what the outcome of a particular episode would be, I followed Caro’s account of it with excitement. I went back over chapters to make sure I had not missed a word.”

NIXON: “Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man,” by Garry Wills

“It is no small undertaking to write about the intellectual history of the United States, provide an analysis of modern politics, and keep track of where Richard Nixon fits into it all. Therefore Wills’s book is very large.” That’s Robert B. Semple Jr. in the Book Review, taking stock of Wills’s extraordinary portrait of Richard Nixon, published in 1970, in the context of “a nation whose faith has been corrupted, whose youth knows it has been had, whose president is president only because he has been able to sell a sufficient number of equally deluded souls on the proposition that he can bring us together today ‘because he can find the ground where we last stood together years ago.’” Elsewhere in The Times, John Leonard wrote that “Wills achieves the not inconsiderable feat of making Richard Nixon a sympathetic even tragic — figure, while at the same time being appalled by him.” Nixon would serve nearly four more years before his resignation, but with regard to the verdict on his presidency, Wills had the last word. And still has it.

REAGAN: “ Reagan,” by Lou Cannon

This biography came out in the second year of Reagan’s first term, but its underlying theme, in the words of our reviewer — “that Mr. Reagan’s career represents a triumph of personality and intuition over ignorance” — stands the test of time. Cannon’s bracingly critical approach might strike a chord with current consumers of news: “Mr. Cannon pursues Mr. Reagan’s ‘lies’ and ‘ignorance’ relentlessly, from an occasion on which Mr. Reagan ‘freely lied’ about his acting experience and salary when he was breaking into Hollywood to his presidential news conferences which have become ‘adventures into the uncharted regions of his mind.’ The author is careful to make the distinction between ignorance and stupidity. Mr. Reagan, he says, has ‘common sense,’ but his photographic memory is cluttered with dubious information gleaned from his favorite periodicals, Reader’s Digest and Human Events.”

OBAMA: “Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance,” by Barack Obama

In 1995, Barack Obama was a writer and law professor in his mid-30s, with little evidence of the presidential about him. His memoir traces his roots; it doesn’t prophesy his future. (“After college in Los Angeles and New York City, he sets out to become a community organizer,” our reviewer writes. “Mr. Obama admits he’s unsure exactly what the phrase means, but is attracted by the ideal of people united in community and purpose.”) But Obama’s voice, its cadences now familiar worldwide, provides a through line from the writer who “bravely tackled the complexities of his remarkable upbringing” to the leader who embodied those complexities in the highest office in the land.Photo

Abba Tor, whose engineering prowess helped the landmark Trans World Flight Center take wing at Kennedy International Airport — and kept it from cracking apart — died on Feb. 11 in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 93.

The cause was cardiac arrest, his daughter, Shuli Tor, said.

Associated with Eero Saarinen and Louis I. Kahn, pillars of modern architecture, Mr. Tor worked with Mr. Saarinen on the John Deere World Headquarters in Moline, Ill., and the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center in New York, and with Mr. Kahn on the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven.

But he earned his reputation with Trans World Airlines’ birdlike terminal, designed by Mr. Saarinen. It was completed in 1962 and has since been celebrated as a symbol of the jet age.

Most important was his insistence, against Mr. Saarinen’s wishes, that the lobed roof be divided into four discrete vaults, instead of being formed as a single 55,000-square-foot expanse of concrete, without joints.

Otherwise, Mr. Tor warned, the concrete would surely crack, even if it was being poured for a project designed by the eminent Mr. Saarinen.

In a 2008 interview with Kornel Ringli, for Mr. Ringli’s book, “Designing TWA: Eero Saarinen’s Airport Terminal in New York,” Mr. Tor recalled a conversation with John Dinkeloo, one of Mr. Saarinen’s young associates.

“Concrete is dumb,” Mr. Tor said he told Mr. Dinkeloo. “It doesn’t know for whom it is being poured.”

Engineering necessity gave birth to one of the most inviting facets of the terminal’s undulating interior: ribbons of skylights along the joints that were opened among the four vaults. The skylights turn what might have been a heavy blanket into something luminous and billowy.

“Once they were told that they have to make joints, because the structure cannot be poured all at once, they said, ‘Let’s use this requirement to let some light in,’ ” Mr. Tor told Mr. Ringli. “There was a kind of — I would say — tension between the architect and the engineer. But it was a beneficial tension.”

Another example of beneficial tension is the four great sloping Y-shaped buttresses that support the outside corners of the converging vaults. Originally, they were to have been vertical stilts, but wound up looking more like Henry Moore sculptures than hard-working structural elements.

Mr. Tor and Mr. Saarinen stood together under the terminal’s 6,000-ton roof in 1960, just after the formwork and scaffolding needed for the concrete pour had been removed. The vaults held up.

“Mr. Tor,” Mr. Saarinen said, “if this roof were to fall on my head now, I would die a happy man.” He died in 1961, before the building was complete.

Tyler Morse, who is redeveloping the long-empty terminal as the TWA Hotel, met Mr. Tor about six months ago.

“Abba was quoting the vector forces on various points of the four lobes, both individually and where they come together,” Mr. Morse wrote by email. “It was as if he had just finished the engineering calculations that week, not 60 years ago.”

Abba Tor was born on Nov. 1, 1923, in Warsaw, to Aryeh and Rachel Turkeltaub. His father, a Zionist, ran a paper-products business. The family emigrated to Palestine in the early 1930s, before Nazi Germany’s onslaught.

In Haifa, Mr. Tor earned a degree in civil engineering at the Technion, where he met an architecture student, Nomi Blumenthal, whom he married in 1946.

His wife died in 1998. Their son, Daniel, died in 1979. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Tor is survived by a sister, Judith Lukin. He lived in Hastings-on-Hudson.

In 1952, while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, Mr. Tor was sent to the United States to work at the National Bureau of Standards. He earned a master’s degree at Columbia University in the 1950s. He later taught there and joined the leading engineering firm Ammann & Whitney. He returned to Israel in 1963 and remained there until 1967, before settling permanently in the United States, where he founded the firm Pfisterer, Tor & Associates with Henry A. Pfisterer.

Imposing reputations did not faze Mr. Tor. He and Mr. Dinkeloo disagreed on what concrete pouring method should be used for the buttresses at the T.W.A. terminal. As Mr. Tor recalled it, Mr. Dinkeloo warned him that if he did not accede, Mr. Saarinen would have his head on a platter.

“My head will not do him any good on the platter,” Mr. Tor said. “My head has to stay on my shoulders, not on his platter.”Bighorn Sheep Hunting Permits Fund Conservation

Mr. Pérez, the son of Cuban exiles who was raised in Colombia, said no once again. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, asked about these offers and the current state of the relationship between President Trump and Mr. Pérez, declined to comment.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Pérez, in describing his rejection of the job offers, explained, “I’m not a yes man.” He added, “I told him he needs to hear the voices of people that are not dependent on him, that are going to give him the truth.” To that point, he then told Bloomberg News in a Jan. 31 article he thought the idea of a Mexican border wall was “idiotic.”

That was more than two weeks ago. Despite sending fence-mending letters to Mr. Trump’s personal email account, and getting confirmation from Mr. Trump’s personal secretary that they had been read, Mr. Pérez hasn’t heard a word back.

It’s a rupture that speaks to the uncomfortable social terrain Mr. Pérez now occupies. He is trying to balance a longstanding personal relationship with Mr. Trump as well as his own increasingly prominent role as an arts philanthropist — from producing documentary films and financing exchange programs for Cuban artists to donating over $55 million in cash and art to the financially beleaguered Miami Art Museum, which rechristened itself the Pérez Art Museum Miami in his honor.

Photo

Yet these two milieus — the White House and the cultural arena — now eye each other with both open hostility and wariness toward anyone unwilling to pick a side. Mr. Pérez may see himself as a trusted back channel between apprehensive cultural figures and President Trump: “I would help him try to see the different opinions of the art world,” he said. Much of the art world, however, hardly seems in the mood for such a genteel tête-à-tête.

“Jorge Pérez is wasting his time,” insisted Amanda Keeley, the owner of Miami’s Exile Books, when asked about Mr. Pérez’s efforts to reach out to the president. Ms. Keeley led fellow Miami artists to demonstrate at the Womens March on Washington last month. “Donald Trump isn’t interested in listening,” she said, “and you can’t have a conversation with someone who doesn’t want to listen to you.”

Indeed, as Inauguration Day loomed, many staff members at the museum carrying Mr. Pérez’s name said they believed the time had already passed for measured discussion. There was talk of heeding the call from the New York-based organizers of the J20 Art Strike, which sought to close museums nationwide as a symbolic action opposing not only Mr. Trump but also “Trumpists who use the social prestige of art to legitimize power.” It was hard not to see the museum’s largest benefactor falling within those cross hairs. In response, its director, Franklin Sirmans, sent a memo to the staff, insisting “we will be open to all in our community as a place of dialogue and conversation” on Inauguration Day. A month later, Mr. Pérez is the one looking for help in sparking a dialogue.

“He’s a good friend,” Mr. Pérez said of Mr. Trump. “Or at least he was, until I made a statement about the wall.” The last time they spoke? “Him saying ‘please come to Palm Beach and Mar-a-Lago, we’re spending weekends there.’” And now? “It’s gone to radio silence, to zero,” he said.

Mr. Pérez said he believed that as president, “instead of moderating, Donald was retrenching. The rhetoric of the campaign was brutal,” but he never assumed it was a preview of the candidate’s actual policies. Mr. Pérez was distressed by reports that Mr. Trump intended to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, on whose board Mr. Pérez had served under President Clinton. He was even more upset at chatter that Mr. Trump might take a tougher stand on the trade opening with Cuba, where Mr. Pérez accompanied President Obama last March as part of a historic state visit.

Photo

Mr. Pérez said he couldn’t fathom this turnaround in Mr. Trump: “We used to talk about Cuba as a place to do business — a Trump hotel, a Trump golf course.” So during that last phone call, he asked Mr. Trump point-blank, did he intend to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba? “He gave me no real answer — not yes, not no. Just ‘We’re going to see what happens, I haven’t decided on that yet.’” Next came Mr. Trump’s executive order announcing a travel ban, prompting an exasperated Mr. Pérez to give his fateful Bloomberg interview.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pérez is focusing on art. Later this month, he returns to Havana with Mr. Sirmans, visiting artists’ studios as a prelude to the June exhibition of “On the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art From the Jorge M. Pérez Collection,” drawn from more than 160 artworks that he recently donated.

“Cubans came here and built up great businesses, bringing in Latin Americans who have a love for the city.” He concluded, “contemporary Latin American art and culture is what should go with that movement.”

The composition of “On The Horizon” is evidence of further social changes. The work of younger Cuban artists who came of age in Miami, such as Antonia Wright, will be installed alongside that of artists who left the island at various points in their adult careers, such as Rubén Torres Llorca, as well as those still based there, like Kcho. In years past, that lack of distinction would have been politically fraught.

Mr. Pérez bristled at the notion that re-engaging with Mr. Trump was futile. “Playing into the game is O.K. if you produce results,” he said of such outreach, citing his concerns over a report that the Trump administration was considering eliminating the arts endowment. “If I could sit down with him and get it to function at half its budget until the next Democratic president gets in, is that worse than having it totally cut?”

Mr. Pérez stopped short and chuckled to himself. “First I need to be able to talk to him.” He’s still waiting for the phone to ring.MUNICH — Vice President Mike Pence vowed Saturday that the United States will "hold Russia accountable" even as President Donald Trump searches for new common ground with Moscow at the start of his presidency.

Pence, in an address to the Munich Security Conference, also offered assurances to European allies that the U.S. "strongly supports" NATO. He said the U.S. would be "unwavering" in its commitment to trans-Atlantic institutions like NATO.

In his first overseas trip as vice president, Pence sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by Trump's positive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin. The address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, to end violence in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence met afterward with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference just before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

European countries along Russia's border are rattled by the prospect of deeper U.S.-Russia ties after Trump suggested sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in exchange for a nuclear weapons deal, and after the president referred to NATO as "obsolete" in an interview before his inauguration. Trump has since tempered his language, stressing the importance of the NATO alliance during his telephone conversations with foreign leaders.

Pence also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion. Pence also planned to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

The visit, which includes a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression, Trump's relationship with Putin and whether the new president may promote isolationist tendencies through his "America First" mantra.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," says Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

Pence's stature within the administration was also under scrutiny because of the recent dismissal of Trump's national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign Monday following reports he misled Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat. The vice president learned that he had been misled through media accounts about two weeks after the president was informed.

Pence is also expected to meet with the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. is embroiled in two separate wars. Trump has made clear his intention to defeat the Islamic State group. But he also said the U.S. may get a second chance to take Iraqi oil as compensation for its efforts in the war-torn country, a notion rebuffed by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who will be meeting with the vice president.

Trump's immigration and refugee ban has ruffled feathers with a number of Muslim-majority countries affected by the order currently tied up in court, including Iraq — a close ally in the fight against IS.

In Munich, the American allies were searching for clues from Pence as to how the Trump administration plans to deal with Russia in the aftermath of Flynn's departure, U.S. inquiries into Russia's involvement in the presidential election and Trump's past praise for Putin.

In his remarks, Pence also reinforced the Trump administration's message that NATO members must spend more on defense.

NATO's 28-member countries committed in 2014 to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. But only the U.S. and four other members of the post-World War II military coalition are meeting the standard, Pence said.

Failure to meet the commitment, he said, "erodes the very foundation of our alliance."

"Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment and, for most, that means the time has come to do more," Pence said.

Play Pause Play RestartPresident Trump, in an extraordinary rebuke of the nation’s press organizations, wrote on Twitter on Friday that the nation’s news media “is the enemy of the American people.”

Even by the standards of a president who routinely castigates journalists — and who on Thursday devoted much of a 77-minute news conference to criticizing his press coverage — Mr. Trump’s tweet was a striking escalation in his attacks.

At 4:32 p.m., shortly after arriving at his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump took to Twitter to write:

Photo

The message was swiftly deleted, but 16 minutes later Mr. Trump posted a revised version. Restricted to 140 characters, he removed the word “sick,” and added two other television networks — ABC and CBS — to his list of offending organizations.

The president has referred to the media as the “opposition party” to his administration, and he has blamed news organizations for stymieing his agenda. But the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent.

“Oh boy,” Carl Bernstein, the journalist who helped to uncover the Watergate scandal, said on Friday, after a reporter read him Mr. Trump’s tweet.

“Donald Trump is demonstrating an authoritarian attitude and inclination that shows no understanding of the role of the free press,” he added.

Historians pointed out similarities between Mr. Trump and Richard M. Nixon, who in 1972 told his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, “The press is the enemy.”

Mr. Bernstein said the president’s language “may be more insidious and dangerous than Richard Nixon’s attacks on the press.”

“But there is a similarity in trying to divide the country, and make the conduct of the press the issue, instead of the conduct of the president,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his top advisers strongly believe that an elitist news media lost its credibility by failing to anticipate his political rise.

Still, the notion of the news media as an enemy of the public — especially when voiced by a sitting president — went a step beyond Mr. Trump’s usual rhetorical turns.

Mr. Trump’s tactic of pitting the press against the public was mirrored in a survey distributed by the president’s team on Thursday, which urged Trump supporters “to do your part to fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions.”

Survey questions included, “Do you believe that the mainstream media has reported unfairly on our movement?” and “On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing Republicans? (Select as many that apply.)”

Mr. Trump has deleted tweets in the past, sometimes to correct for typos or to refine his message, and publications are keeping track of these fleeting missives.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his distaste for journalists in more populist terms, saying, “much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests.”

“The public doesn’t believe you people anymore,” Mr. Trump added. “Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you.”Video

Most people who remember the original Civic that Honda brought to America in 1973 remember it as a hatchback. The less popular “sedan” looked exactly the same — it just had a tiny rear door instead of the liftgate. That runt of a car went on to do big things for Honda. The car’s CVCC engine, which ran on both regular and unleaded gasoline (without a catalytic converter), showed Detroit and consumers that Honda had engineering chops to spare.

Yes, there once were two kinds of gasoline. And I grew up with only four television stations. But that’s a different story.

The once stubby Civic grew into sleek coupes and sedans. By 2005, automotive trends had changed so much that the very body style that set up Honda for success vanished from its American lineup.

But everything old is new again. The Civic hatch is back. With 4.4 inches taken off the rear overhang, the aggressive sheet metal creases don’t play out as smoothly as on the sedans. But even with less length, the hatchback remains more useful than the sedan or coupe because its yawning opening swallows 10-speed bikes whole (another thing popular back in the ’70s).

I drove the Sport model that retails for $22,175, plus those pesky taxes and such. The Sport, most easily spotted by its center-mounted exhaust, is a basic car. The only major option available is an $800 continuously variable automatic transmission. You want a better sound system? That’s what the aftermarket is for.

Or, move up to the Sport Touring, which throws in creature comforts plus Honda Sensing, a bundling of safety technology that includes automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Sadly, that means you give up the excellent 6-speed manual gearbox I drove and adds about $7,000 to the price (which would have bought three 1973 Civics).

The Sport is not the sportiest Civic — Si and Type R models are on their way — but it’s tough to get more fun and practicality for your $22,000. It’s the kind of car that, after a couple of miles, gets under your skin and pushes a smile onto your cheeks. Throw it into a corner and it happily obliges, then suggests you do it again.

It is also a refined runner, displaying the kind of polished dynamics found on small luxury offerings a decade ago. There are baby bottoms less smooth than the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. It puts out 180 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque when fed premium fuel. That’s six more ponies than the standard Civic hatch models (which lack the Sport’s more sophisticated knock sensor). And in another blast from the past, the engine is started with a key. The kind you insert and turn.

Fuel economy will not disappoint. Uncle Sam rates the Sport with a manual gearbox at 30 miles per gallon in the city, 39 on the highway. I saw high 20s in mostly urban (and spirited) driving. Going with the automatic drops the highway figure down to 36.

You’ll commute comfortably until Sport’s low-profile tires hit a sharp bump. Those go right on through the chassis to your backside with little filtering. Moderately bolstered seats can hold a wide range of drivers in place during spirited maneuvers.

Without the Touring’s sunroof, the cabin is dark and monochromatic. At least it’s made with good-quality plastics. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels as if it was destined for a car a full segment higher.

Many cars these days have some sort of touch-screen interface. The base Sport goes the nostalgia route with a rudimentary monochromatic LCD screen reminiscent of an ’80s Texas Instruments calculator. But it is supersimple to operate with an honest-to-goodness volume knob and radio station buttons. Honda’s old slogan, “We Make it Simple,” applies here. Don’t worry, there’s Bluetooth for pairing phones.

With belts for three, the back seat has generous room for two average adults. And that’s about it. There are no power ports, seat pockets or folding armrest in the back. Putting a cup of hot coffee in the door pocket is awkward and could result in spills or burned fingers. Ask me how I know. Again, it’s a $22,000 car. Remind friends they didn’t pay for an Uber.

Unless the dual spoilers and faux front and rear venting are too severe for your retinas, the Civic Hatchback should be on the test drive list. That list includes the Chevy Cruze Hatchback, Ford Focus, Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla iM and Volkswagen Golf. Practical, affordable and offering a decent romp on a curvy road, the Civic has returned to its roots. Now, if only Led Zeppelin could reunite.MUNICH — Vice President Mike Pence vowed Saturday that the United States will "hold Russia accountable" even as President Donald Trump searches for new common ground with Moscow at the start of his presidency.

Pence, in an address to the Munich Security Conference, also offered assurances to European allies that the U.S. "strongly supports" NATO. He said the U.S. would be "unwavering" in its commitment to trans-Atlantic institutions like NATO.

In his first overseas trip as vice president, Pence sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by Trump's positive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin. The address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, to end violence in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence met afterward with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference just before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

European countries along Russia's border are rattled by the prospect of deeper U.S.-Russia ties after Trump suggested sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in exchange for a nuclear weapons deal, and after the president referred to NATO as "obsolete" in an interview before his inauguration. Trump has since tempered his language, stressing the importance of the NATO alliance during his telephone conversations with foreign leaders.

Pence also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion. Pence also planned to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

The visit, which includes a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression, Trump's relationship with Putin and whether the new president may promote isolationist tendencies through his "America First" mantra.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," says Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

Pence's stature within the administration was also under scrutiny because of the recent dismissal of Trump's national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign Monday following reports he misled Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat. The vice president learned that he had been misled through media accounts about two weeks after the president was informed.

Pence is also expected to meet with the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. is embroiled in two separate wars. Trump has made clear his intention to defeat the Islamic State group. But he also said the U.S. may get a second chance to take Iraqi oil as compensation for its efforts in the war-torn country, a notion rebuffed by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who will be meeting with the vice president.

Trump's immigration and refugee ban has ruffled feathers with a number of Muslim-majority countries affected by the order currently tied up in court, including Iraq — a close ally in the fight against IS.

In Munich, the American allies were searching for clues from Pence as to how the Trump administration plans to deal with Russia in the aftermath of Flynn's departure, U.S. inquiries into Russia's involvement in the presidential election and Trump's past praise for Putin.

In his remarks, Pence also reinforced the Trump administration's message that NATO members must spend more on defense.

NATO's 28-member countries committed in 2014 to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. But only the U.S. and four other members of the post-World War II military coalition are meeting the standard, Pence said.

Failure to meet the commitment, he said, "erodes the very foundation of our alliance."

"Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment and, for most, that means the time has come to do more," Pence said.

5) 9 A.M. Paddleboarding

Year-round watersports are one of San Diego’s big draws. If you don’t have time to learn how to surf like a pro, try your hand at stand-up paddleboarding. Head to the calm waters of Mission Bay (it’s easier to learn here than in the open ocean) and rent a paddleboard ($20 for the first hour) from Aqua Adventures. Launch off the dock, balancing yourself on the board, and paddle your way out into the water. If you’re lucky, you may catch sight of a sea lion.

6) 12 P.M. Untraditional taqueria

It’s impossible to pinpoint the best tacos in a town with such a surfeit of options, but Lucha Libre’s theme — masked and costumed Mexican wrestlers — lends this place a particular appeal. The bright murals, gold seats and walls decked with homages to the most famous luchadores make you feel as if you’re eating inside Comic-Con, but the food — particularly the specialty taco with grilled crispy cheese and chipotle sauce, topped up with salsas from the extensive bar — is worth lingering over. Add a tamarind soda for the full Mexican experience. Lunch for two, around $25.

7) 1 P.M. Go north

One of the hippest neighborhoods in San Diego, North Park is bursting with cool cafes, breweries and shops. Stroll down 30th Street, pausing to explore the district’s quirkier offerings, like Coin-Op Game Room, a combination game room and bar where retro arcade standbys like Frogger are equipped with cup holders for your cocktail or craft beer (try the La Migra, a cocktail made from mezcal, aged rum, Benedictine and orange bitters). Stop by Hunt & Gather for vintage vinyl, leather jackets and cowboy boots, and grab an espresso ($2.25) at the local coffee roaster Dark Horse. Then take in an exhibit at the contemporary gallery/art supply store Visual, which hosts group art shows and pop-up shops; check the website for details.

8) 4 P.M. New market

A new addition to Point Loma, Liberty Public Market was once a naval training center, but it reopened in March 2016 as a food hall jam-packed with stalls and outposts of the city’s restaurants, cafes and bakeries. The collection here includes the food truck-turned-brick-and-mortar Stuffed, which serves up fast-casual grass-fed beef burgers stuffed with cheese; a branch of WestBean Coffee Roasters, which serves a fantastically creamy nitro coffee; and the wine bar Grape Smuggler, which offers tapas and flights (and a nice place to grab a seat away from the crowds). Gather your snacks and grab one of the high stools at the back of the market to chow down.

9) 6:30 P.M. Ocean Beach Sunset

Some of the most breathtaking scenery in the area is in Ocean Beach, a coastal neighborhood with a chilled-out vibe and a hippie bent. Head to Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and follow the trail along the cliffs, which drop off to the ocean below, in time for the sunset. You’ll usually spot locals meditating or practicing yoga while looking out to sea, pelicans flying by in formation and, down on the water, surfers waiting to catch the next wave. Once the sun has set, take a stroll down Newport Avenue, the main street in what the residents call O.B., which is lined with breweries, kitschy secondhand stores and restaurants advertising San Diego’s famous fish tacos.

10) 9:30 P.M. Pizza and seitan

For a late dinner at one of San Diego’s most popular restaurants, head to South Park, where the Italian staff at Buona Forchetta serves up the city’s best pizza: chewy, heat-blackened crusts topped with burrata and house-made fennel sausage. There’s almost always a long wait (plan on two hours; it doesn’t take reservations for small groups), but put your name on the list and head across the street to Kindred, a buzzy vegan bar with a classed-up rock ’n’ roll aesthetic, and craft cocktails like the mix of gin, crème de violette, absinthe and Peychaud’s it calls the Delirium Moon. Vegan snacks like seitan skewers with harissa and horseradish aioli, and fried pickle slices with a ranch dressing dip, will tide you over until your table at Buona Forchetta is ready.Photo

The Times Opinion columnist Andrew Rosenthal says there is just one thing to talk about this week: “the endless unwrapping of the onion that is Donald Trump’s bizarre relationship with Vladimir Putin.” And that, Mr. Rosenthal says, “is very bad news,” and a serious threat to the security of the United States.

Good, Bad and Mad: Andrew Rosenthal on the News

One of the most maddening things about the constant contact between the Trump Administration and Russian officials before the election, says Mr. Rosenthal, is that President Trump and his team are trying to make this about leaks. “This is not just about the leaked email at this point, Mr. President. This is about your national security adviser undermining the foreign policy of the United States before and giving a serious adversary a little heads-up, in private, about a matter of grave national security.”

Last, the good news. Mr. Rosenthal says the positive point is the press. “It is great to see invaluable and irreplaceable news organizations like The Washington Post and The New York Times doing their vital work without pause,” continuing to uncover the truth about Michael T. Flynn’s phone calls and contacts between other Trump officials and the Russian security apparatus.

Air pollution is a more significant public health hazard in China, India and Eastern Europe, where the average annual levels of PM2.5 pollution, the fine soot particles and molecules that pose the greatest danger to health, are up to 10 times as high as in London.

But in mid-January in Brixton, the area in south London where Ms. Carey lives, hourly mean levels of PM2.5 were higher than in Beijing. And over just five days in January, Brixton exceeded the European Union’s nitrogen dioxide legal limit for the entire year.

London last month was put on a “very high” pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold air and a stationary weather pattern failed to clear the toxic air caused by diesel traffic, as well as by the high use of open fires, which contribute to about 10 percent of pollutants in winter months.

“The time will come when we’ll start wearing masks like in China,” Ray Hussain, 73, said as he waited for his bus on Brixton Road one recent morning. At nearly any point during the rush, 16 double-decker buses lined the road. Traffic was snarled, and whiffs of acrid air stung the eyes.

Mr. Hussain checked Airvisual, an air pollution tracking app on his smartphone. Brixton’s air quality that day was called “Good,” in green lettering. Just below, Hyderabad, a city in India, had a red “Unhealthy” label and a picture of a person wearing a face mask.

The local authorities are scrambling to defuse what many consider a ticking time bomb for public health.

Some schools are considering handing out gas masks to pupils, saying children’s lungs are in danger of being stunted. More than 440 schools are in areas exceeding legal air quality levels, according to Mayor Sadiq Khan of London.

Earlier this month, London’s Metropolitan Police announced a plan to introduce about 300 environmentally friendly cars, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hybrid electric cars, as part of a fleet overhaul.

On Friday, Mr. Khan, who has adult-onset asthma, announced that in October he would introduce in central London a toxicity charge, a $12-a-day tax for the most polluting vehicles, typically diesel- and gasoline-powered automobiles registered before 2006.The board is made up of senior Civil Service officials from six agencies: the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the offices of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence. It operates by consensus, so each department or agency essentially has a veto, and the heads of each agency can overrule a recommendation.

A decision by the board to put a detainee on the transfer list does not necessarily mean he will be released: The government considers eligibility for transfer a policy recommendation, not a legal right. In the Obama era, dozens of men — mostly lower-level detainees from Yemen — stayed locked up for years after being put on the list because there was no good place to send them.

The Obama administration ultimately reduced the list to five, but the Trump administration has given no indication that it will try to repatriate or resettle the men.

Where did the board come from?

The law of war permits the detention without trial of captured enemies until hostilities end. But that rule was designed for traditional wars that last only a few years. Because the war against Al Qaeda and its progeny may last a lifetime, the government decided it needed a process to decide whether it still made sense to keep holding a particular prisoner as the years passed.

In its second term, George W. Bush’s administration set up a predecessor panel called the Administrative Review Board. Unlike the Periodic Review Board, the panel was made up of military officers only, and detainees had no right to legal representation during their hearings. In 2009, Mr. Obama shut down the Bush-era board and appointed a six-agency task force to review the remaining detainees. It recommended transferring 156, continuing to hold 48 without trial, and prosecuting 36, though not all of those ended up being charged. Mr. Obama later created the boards to periodically re-evaluate those who were neither charged nor already on the transfer list.

View all New York Times newsletters.

What is its record?

Since the Periodic Review Board began operating in late 2013, it has re-examined 63 detainees being held in open-ended detention. To date, the board has designated 37 for transfer — most of whom are now gone — while reaffirming the continued detention of 26.

Why is it controversial?

Republicans criticized Mr. Obama’s efforts to whittle down the number of men being held at Guantánamo, warning about the risk of recidivism. According to the office of the director of national intelligence, of 693 former detainees transferred through July 2016, 17.6 percent are “confirmed” to have re-engaged in militant activity, and another 12.4 percent are “suspected” of having done so.

“There should be no further releases from Gitmo,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter early last month, amid the final transfers of the Obama era. “These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.”

Still, most recidivist former detainees left during the Bush administration, which carried out bulk repatriations to countries like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. Among those who left since 2009, 5.6 percent are deemed “confirmed” and 6.8 percent are “suspected.”

Is Trump legally required to keep the board?

No statute requires the boards to operate. The Geneva Conventions require an initial status hearing for captured enemy fighters but not periodic reviews thereafter. But some legal scholars argue that because this war is open-ended, there may be an implied or customary legal requirement for a parole-like process. If Mr. Trump shuts down the boards, lawyers for detainees would probably use that absence of any process to bring new habeas corpus challenges.

The Trump administration has been circulating various drafts of an executive order on detainee policy, some of which call for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to lead a 120-day review of whether to carry out any more transfers. But Charles Stimson, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was the top Pentagon detainee policy official in the Bush administration’s second term and who helped develop the predecessor Administrative Review Board, argued that the Periodic Review Board served a “valuable function.”

“Keeping those boards going is a separate and distinct issue from what criteria they should use and whether or not the secretaries are ultimately going to agree with any recommendation they make,” Mr. Stimson said. “I would caution the administration against scrapping them unless and until they study the issue more closely.”Students have long found ways to make it through school more quickly to save money. But there is increasing momentum to formalize the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt — while N.Y.U. is expensive, many other private universities cost $60,000 or more a year.

Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, pushed to make it easier for students in his state to graduate from public colleges early by allowing more credits from high school or technical programs. Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, included in his budget proposal this month that schools in the University of Wisconsin system should create a three-year degree for 60 percent of its programs by the summer of 2020. Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., which is a state school, has also been experimenting with three-year degree options.

Among elite private institutions, official programs remain rare, though Wesleyan University, the Connecticut liberal arts school, announced a formalized three-year track about five years ago.

N.Y.U.’s “acceleration” effort relies on a few shifts. For example, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of two-credit courses it offers.

It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer — in the past, this has been allowed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their three-year goal.

But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices.

Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy at Temple University, said that shaving time off college as a way to make it more affordable could raise some troubling questions. In college, she said, there is academic learning, but there are also important experiences outside the classroom, like the social networks students build, study abroad programs and internships — assuming students do not have to hold down jobs that crowd out those things in the first place.

While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr. Goldrick-Rab said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things.

“We agree that the price of college is a problem,” she said. But she questioned whether the solution was “to essentially have less college, or less time in college.”

“It’s interesting,” she said of accelerated schedules, “but it worries me.”

Michael S. Roth, the Wesleyan president disputed the idea that there was something uniquely effective about an eight-semester undergraduate education.

“I don’t think there’s anything magical about eight semesters, or six, or 10, for example,” he said. “ I think it’s just a convention.”

Photo

The sped-up tracks are not always popular, however. Mr Roth estimated that about 20 Wesleyan students annually graduate in three years, up from roughly three a year before they made the option official. As of this May, Purdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014.

“So far, we haven’t had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.”

Indeed, many American students take six years to graduate from college.

Ashley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like hip-hop dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid.

Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work.

But this track is not for everyone, she said. Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears, who describes herself as a planner, said she knew she wanted to be an English major when she was a junior in high school. Students who need time to to figure that out, as most do, would be better served taking their time, she said.

“I definitely think this is a way to ease the burden for now, but I don’t think it’s a long-term solution” to the cost of college, Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said. “It doesn’t take into account every type of student, and every type of student should have the ability to make college affordable to themselves.”

Professor Schall agreed that this solution was not for everyone, nor did it suffice on its own. The affordability committee, which was convened by N.Y.U.’s president, Andrew Hamilton, is experimenting with a variety of ways to cut down on costs and give students a financial lift. There are small-ticket items — Facebook can alert students if there is food left over after staff meetings — and those that are much larger. The university froze the cost of room and board this school year for the first time in decades. Tuition increased this year, but Professor Schall said it was the lowest percentage increase in 20 years.

Couldn’t N.Y.U. and other colleges solve the problem just by cutting how much they charge? Professor Schall said there was a constant pressure on universities to increase their capacity to teach and do research, “and those things are expensive.”

“There is no silver bullet,” she continued. “If we could triple our endowment, that would be lovely, but short of that, we’re looking at everything from the price of books to the use of temporary employees,” she said. “We’re trying to be as creative as we can.”Note: This documentary short film was nominated for a 2017 Academy Award.

When I returned home to Greece last fall to make a film about the refugee crisis, I discovered a situation I had never imagined possible. The turquoise sea that surrounds the beautiful Greek island of Lesbos, just 4.1 miles from the Turkish coast, is these days a deadly gantlet, choked with terrified adults and small children on flimsy, dangerous boats. I had never seen people escaping war before, and neither had the island’s residents. I couldn’t believe there was no support for these families to safely escape whatever conflict had caused them to flee. The scene was haunting.

Regardless of the hardship Greeks have endured from the financial crisis, for a long time my home country has by and large been a peaceful, safe and easy place to live. But now Greece is facing a new crisis, one that threatens to undo years of stability, as we struggle to absorb the thousands of desperate migrants who pour across our borders every day. A peak of nearly 5,000 entered Greece each day last year, mainly fleeing conflicts in the Middle East.

The Greek Coast Guard, especially when I was there, has been completely unprepared to deal with the constant flow of rescues necessary to save refugees from drowning as they attempt to cross to Europe from Turkey. When I was there filming, Lesbos had about 40 local coast guard officers, who before the refugee crisis generally spent their time conducting routine border patrols. Most didn’t have CPR training. Their vessels didn’t have thermal cameras or any equipment necessary for tremendous emergencies.

Suddenly, the crew was charged with keeping the small bit of water they patrolled from becoming a mass grave. Each day, thousands of refugees crossed the water on tiny, dangerous inflatable rafts. Most of the passengers, sometimes including whoever was operating the boat, had never seen the sea. Often a motor would stall and passengers would be stranded for hours, floating tenuously on a cold, volatile sea. Or the bottom of a dinghy would simply tear away and all the passengers would be cast into the water. The coast guard felt completely abandoned, they told me, as if the world had left them to handle a huge humanitarian crisis — or allow thousands to drown offshore.

I followed a coast guard captain for three weeks as he pulled family after family, child after child, from the ocean and saved their lives. All the ones in this film were shot on a single day, October 28, 2015. Two additional rescues happened that same day but were not included.

The problem is far from over. Many of the refugees come from Syria, where Russia is intensifying bombings that are killing thousands of civilians and devastating Syrian cities. The United States is planning to respond. According to the Greek Coast Guard, thousands of families with children are lining up along Turkish shores to make the unsafe crossing to Greece.

In making this film, I was struck by the fine lines that separate us, the moments when our paths cross fleetingly, and we look at one another for the first time and sometimes for the last. This film shows that crucial moment between life and death, where regardless of political beliefs, fears or preparation, some people will go beyond themselves to save a stranger.

And it raises questions about our collective responsibility — the choices we all make for ourselves, and for others. We don’t all confront the refugee crisis with the same immediacy as the coast guard captain portrayed here. But as our world becomes more interconnected, and more violent, we do all face a choice — would we act as he does, to save the life of stranger? Or would we turn away?President Trump, in an extraordinary rebuke of the nation’s press organizations, wrote on Twitter on Friday that the nation’s news media “is the enemy of the American people.”

Even by the standards of a president who routinely castigates journalists — and who on Thursday devoted much of a 77-minute news conference to criticizing his press coverage — Mr. Trump’s tweet was a striking escalation in his attacks.

At 4:32 p.m., shortly after arriving at his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump took to Twitter to write:

Photo

The message was swiftly deleted, but 16 minutes later Mr. Trump posted a revised version. Restricted to 140 characters, he removed the word “sick,” and added two other television networks — ABC and CBS — to his list of offending organizations.

The president has referred to the media as the “opposition party” to his administration, and he has blamed news organizations for stymieing his agenda. But the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent.

“Oh boy,” Carl Bernstein, the journalist who helped to uncover the Watergate scandal, said on Friday, after a reporter read him Mr. Trump’s tweet.

“Donald Trump is demonstrating an authoritarian attitude and inclination that shows no understanding of the role of the free press,” he added.

Historians pointed out similarities between Mr. Trump and Richard M. Nixon, who in 1972 told his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, “The press is the enemy.”

Mr. Bernstein said the president’s language “may be more insidious and dangerous than Richard Nixon’s attacks on the press.”

“But there is a similarity in trying to divide the country, and make the conduct of the press the issue, instead of the conduct of the president,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his top advisers strongly believe that an elitist news media lost its credibility by failing to anticipate his political rise.

Still, the notion of the news media as an enemy of the public — especially when voiced by a sitting president — went a step beyond Mr. Trump’s usual rhetorical turns.

Mr. Trump’s tactic of pitting the press against the public was mirrored in a survey distributed by the president’s team on Thursday, which urged Trump supporters “to do your part to fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions.”

Survey questions included, “Do you believe that the mainstream media has reported unfairly on our movement?” and “On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing Republicans? (Select as many that apply.)”

Mr. Trump has deleted tweets in the past, sometimes to correct for typos or to refine his message, and publications are keeping track of these fleeting missives.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his distaste for journalists in more populist terms, saying, “much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests.”

“The public doesn’t believe you people anymore,” Mr. Trump added. “Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you.”Is there another explanation for this that has nothing to do with skin color?

Perhaps black and white Americans, on average, root for different teams, and the teams they root for happen to have more players that share their skin color.

Nope. The differences are the same if we limit the analysis to players on the same team.

Perhaps black and white Americans show different preferences for foreign players, who are twice as likely as American-born players to be white.

Nope. The differences are the same if we just limit the analysis to American-born players.

Perhaps black and white Americans, for whatever reason, like different types of players. Black Americans may like point guards who dish out lots of assists. Such players are more likely to be black. White Americans may like centers who collect lots of rebounds. Such players are more likely to be white.

Nope. Adding these factors does not change the fact that the race of a player influences the racial breakdown of his fans.

Perhaps less surprisingly, Asian-Americans make up a much larger portion of the fan base of Asian players than non-Asian players. This is driven almost entirely by the advent of Jeremy Lin, the Harvard-educated point guard born to Taiwanese immigrants who has proved a hero for Asian-Americans.

The popularity of Mr. Lin among Asian-Americans is so great that many of Mr. Lin’s largest fan bases are in cities in which he has never played, but which have large Asian populations, like Honolulu.

Clearly, a player’s skin color affects the demographic breakdown of his fan base. But how does it affect the size of his fan base? Do white fans give an edge to white players or black fans give an edge to black players?

To test this, we can utilize a social science tool called multi-variable regression, which allows us to model the factors that affect the size of a player’s fan base — his statistics, what team he plays for, his age, how many All-Star games he has participated in, the position he plays, whether he was born in America and, yes, his race.

When we do this, we find that there is a clear edge to being of a certain race. But it goes against what many white owners and journalists have long thought.

If a white and a black player are similar on paper, it is the black player who will have more fans.

Among black Americans, black players are roughly twice as popular as comparable white players. But black players get a slight boost from fans of every racial group. Compared with white players who are similar to them in all ways I could think to measure, black players have more fans among white Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian-Americans.

Honestly, I was blown away by the overall size of this advantage. Roughly speaking, I estimate that a white player would have to score 10 more points per game to have as big a fan base on Facebook as he would have if he were black.

Asian-Americans also have a huge advantage in building a fan base, although this is driven almost entirely by Mr. Lin, who is the 27th most popular player despite being the 80th most prolific scorer. Of the 30 most popular players, he is one of only two men who has never played in an N.B.A. All-Star game. The other is Tristan Thompson of the Cleveland Cavaliers. This initially made no sense to me: Mr. Thompson averages fewer than 10 points per game. But then a friend explained the likely reason to me: Mr. Thompson is dating Khloé Kardashian.

What should we make of the edge in support that black players get? It is of course possible that someone will find an alternative explanation for this correlation, but let’s assume that my analysis of the data holds up and that being black is a large advantage today for N.B.A. players trying to build a fan base. How should we interpret these results? Is it a bad thing or a good thing or nothing?

IF the results were reversed — if white players got a big edge in support — this would clearly be bad news. There is strong evidence that black Americans are discriminated against in many crucial areas of life — jury decisions, police stops, job interviews, dating sites, presidential elections. If African-Americans were discriminated against in building a basketball fan base as well, it would show that white privilege can even show itself in one of the arenas in American life in which blacks have had tremendous success.

But African-Americans getting a boost in support? What should we make of that? I view this phenomenon as good news in at least two ways. I think it’s great that members of minority groups who face discrimination in many aspects of their lives show strong support for other members of the group. And it is also encouraging that many white fans will give some extra support to the country’s most successful minority athletes.Only the AfD, whose populism puts it far outside of mainstream political norms, is openly promising to fulfill a desire for patriotism that would be routine in most other countries.

The result is that a social and political norm intended to stifle the far right is now empowering it. That focus on identity has allowed the AfD, even if it is unlikely to win enough votes to govern, to shape the national conversation to its advantage, and to present itself as the champion of ordinary Germans.

The search for identity

The AfD rally in a snowy square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, was scheduled to last precisely 30 minutes. It started promptly, ran like clockwork and ended with an instruction to the crowd to pick up any litter on the ground.

Such respect for rules and punctuality is something Germans are good at, said several attendees, who clustered in the glow of the small stage, stomping their feet against the numbing cold.

But mostly the mood was one of frustration. A woman in a shearling coat, who asked not to be named out of fear of anti-right-wing discrimination, said that she hoped the AfD would help heal Germany’s “broken self-confidence.”

A chemist with a doctorate, she personified the way that Germany’s identity gap has allowed the AfD to extend its appeal beyond the far-right fringe and into the middle-class mainstream.

“Only in Germany, I found it very strange, people don’t want to say ‘I am German,’ ” she said. Because the party was the only one willing to challenge that taboo, it was the AfD’s message she absorbed.

Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig who studies group identity formation, said, “There has never been a positive definition of German identity since the Nazi era.”

“It is easier to say what you are against than what you are for,” he said. “And this might be more true in Germany, where the national identity was built on ‘never again.’ ”

For decades, German politicians worked to layer any sense of Germanness beneath a European identity.

“Germany has negotiated the European part very well, but the casualty has been Germanness,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who specializes in the legacy of European fascism.

That smoothed the country’s path back into the community of nations after World War II. But Germans are increasingly concerned about the costs. A July 2016 Pew poll found that half of Germans had an unfavorable view of the European Union. As Euroskepticism rises, a growing minority of Germans are chafing at what they see as pressure to place European identity before national identity.

The influx of refugees into the country in recent years has caused particular stress, Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “In Germany, you’re not even allowed to say you’re proud to be German. You have to say you’re European,” she said. “So when these people come in, what are they left with?”

The power of challenging a taboo

When people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to a group identity, and also become more interested in making their group more powerful, Professor Fritsche said he had found in his research. Germany’s traditional political parties have been reluctant to indulge that desire because of political taboos. But the AfD has proved adept at exploiting it.

That strategy was on full display the night of Jan. 17 at a beer hall in Dresden, ground zero for Germany’s far-right movement. Hundreds of AfD supporters had gathered for a speech by Björn Höcke, one of the party’s fastest-rising figures.

Addressing the crowd, Mr. Höcke looked every inch the ordinary German politician, besuited and with a white-toothed grin and an unseasonable tan. But what he said went far beyond the norms of German politics.

Germans are “the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,” he said, a thinly veiled reference to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Germans had “the mentality of a totally vanquished people,” he argued, but it was time for the country to re-embrace its history and develop a positive relationship with its identity.

The crowd’s applause shook the floors, a noisy manifestation of how thrilling transgression can feel in a rule-bound society.

“The foundation of being able to move forward is identity,” Mr. Höcke later elaborated in an interview. “There is no people that has given more to humanity than Germany. It is a great and old people, and it would be sad if it were to sink.”

Mr. Höcke is an extreme figure within his own party, and his speech provoked a backlash from AfD’s national leadership. But his message demonstrates how the party has broadened its appeal: by telling Germans they should have a proud national identity, a message that in Germany could come only from the political fringes.

That has resonated with middle-class supporters like Julian Wälder, 21, a law student who had helped to organize the event in Dresden. He said that his journey to the AfD began with his frustration at the identity taboo.

“The definition we have right now of tolerance in the German political landscape is self-deprecating to a degree that it’s actually self-destructive,” Mr. Wälder said. “Everything will be tolerated except for being a German.”

Focusing on identity allows the AfD to present itself as a protector of ordinary people — punching up against the nation’s political elite, rather than attacking vulnerable refugees portrayed by the party as a threat to the nation.

That approach, accusing the elite of stifling debate over German history and culture, could be especially appealing to Germans desperate to restore a sense of control over their country.

“This will be very attractive to people who perceive their own lives as without control,” Professor Fritsche said.

A minority, but influencing the conversation

The AfD, despite its rapid growth, remains a minority party. Its support reached a high of 15 percent according to a survey by Ipsos in late 2016, but slipped to 12 percent in a Feb. 7 poll by the same firm.

But as mainstream parties become more focused on defending against the far-right upstarts, the AfD’s populist agenda is trickling into their policies and messaging — raising the possibility that the party’s political influence could outpace its electoral gains.

Frauke Petry, the party’s national chairwoman, said that the AfD’s ideas were already shaping the national conversation, even if they were not yet able to shape national legislation.

Professor Fritsche’s research suggests that Ms. Petry could be correct, as right-wing parties become more visible. “What would really be dangerous is to have a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in which people feel a likely right-wing shift, and this leads to a perceived norm shift,” he said.

There are signs that is already happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her re-election bid in December by announcing a more populist agenda. She took a harder line on immigration and called for a ban on Islamic veils that cover the full face, saying they “do not belong to us” and should be “forbidden wherever that is legally possible.”

And although she did not name the AfD directly, she expressly tried to reclaim the identity issue, saying that who “the people” are was something for all to decide, “not just a few, no matter how loud they are.”

Mr. Höcke was unmoved by her rightward shift. He called Mrs. Merkel a “chancellor-dictator” who had broken German law by opening the country’s borders to refugees, and he demanded an end to her “regime.”

“We Germans have to be self-aware,” he said in the interview. “We can see our state falling apart; it’s falling apart before our eyes. It’s about survival.”UNF News is not a television network or a radio network, for that matter. UNF, or Universal News Forever, is the baby, identity, passion and obsession of Kyle Mazza, 19, who posed the question about Mrs. Trump.

The question, which was mocked a little on social media, will most likely end up as a footnote about Mr. Trump’s dealings with the news media. But Mr. Mazza’s unlikely path to the White House is a strange tale befitting these strange times.

UNF News, Mr. Mazza said in an interview on Friday, was his “own news station that I started when I was 8 years old.”

If Mr. Trump were to start paying attention to UNF News, it would be a start: The network has neither advertisers nor subscribers.

Yet in an era of fake news, overheated partisanship and general rancor, Mr. Mazza seems unfailingly earnest and without an agenda — aside from trying to become a reporter, with his own notion of what that means.

After forming WUNF, Mr. Mazza would write articles about events in his hometown, Fair Lawn, N.J. A few years later, he obtained press credentials from a local cable access channel, Fair Lawn TV, giving him access to courts and other official events.

By the time Mr. Mazza got his driver’s license two years ago, he had seven police scanners and three weather radios.

“I always used to monitor the storms and the police reports,” he said. “It was extremely interesting.”

After graduating from high school, Mr. Mazza took classes at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting’s campus in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., while continuing to pursue his passion.

Mr. Mazza’s parents, he said, supported and helped pay for his journalistic ambitions. Once he could drive, he aimed his sights on Manhattan.

“I covered one of the mayor’s press conferences,” he said of Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. “After I did that I got on the list to get advisories from the mayor, so I said, ‘Why not go to City Hall and get myself known there?’”

He soon discovered that in addition to Room 9, where the City Hall press corps works, there was an annex room for reporters in the basement, Room 4a.

Mr. Mazza asked the mayor’s office if he could work from that room. The answer was yes, and for the past couple of years, he has become a semiregular in the City Hall press corps. He said he mostly covers politics, breaking news and entertainment, but allowed that he really covered whatever struck his fancy.

Other reporters had mostly kind things to say about Mr. Mazza, even if they said his approach reflected his age and experience.

Mr. Mazza’s work has, at times, created some unease at home. He recalled when, during a State of the City speech by the mayor in 2016, there was a shooting of two police officers in the Bronx, and he wanted to go with the rest of the press corps with the mayor to the hospital.

“My mom was calling me; she was like, ‘Go home, go home, go home,’” Mr. Mazza said. “She was very nervous, and I went home. But after that, I always went to shootings and now she understands that it is my job.”

But even his mother was shocked when she saw him on national television Thursday.

Mr. Mazza had been going to the White House since the election, and said he had gone to four press briefings conducted by Sean M. Spicer, the press secretary, first securing a daily credential, and then weekly passes. He happened to be in Washington on Thursday when Mr. Trump announced that he was going to hold an impromptu news conference.

“I was prepared,” Mr. Mazza said, explaining that he had a news release from the White House about the first lady opening the visitors office, “and I said to myself, ‘There has not been a lot of coverage about this,’ and I thought it could be interesting.”

Despite the tension during the combative news conference, Mr. Mazza said he was not nervous, saying to himself, “If he doesn’t like my question, he doesn’t like my question. I am just going to ask my question.”

He was not concerned if some people might view his question as a softball.

“I was really honored that he appreciated my question,” Mr. Mazza said. “And I was appreciative he answered my question. The president took the time out of his day to answer my question.”Organizing for Action, the political nonprofit group that grew out of former President Barack Obama’s election campaign, has created a “Recess Toolkit” with suggestions on how to effectively ask questions at the events. Last week, the group held an online seminar with members of Indivisible, the most prominent activist organization to emerge in response to Mr. Trump’s election, to coach supporters on how to challenge lawmakers — in a “civil and respectful way” advised one strategist, according to a recording of the session.

Planned Parenthood is hoping to flood the sessions with members in pink T-shirts, urging Congress to keep in place the health care law and the organization’s funding.

“It’s going to be intense,” said Emily Tisch Sussman, who leads the political arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. “All every group wants to know is how to find out where the town halls are going to be.”

The recess, traditionally a time for lawmakers to take the temperature of their constituents, comes at a surprisingly vulnerable moment for Republicans. They are struggling to gain traction on a legislative agenda despite controlling both congressional chambers and the White House, as the new administration remains mired in controversy over its targeted travel ban and pre-election contact with Russia, among other issues.

While complaints about the health care act — high premiums in particular — helped elect Mr. Trump, polls show it has become more popular as voters realize that repealing it would mean that an estimated 30 million people lose health insurance.

There are few indications at this point that the conservative base of the Republican Party is mobilizing for action on a large scale during the recess. FreedomWorks, the Washington-based libertarian group that in 2009 nurtured Tea Party groups to rally against the legislation that became the health care act, said it was planning a Washington rally next month to let lawmakers know that there remained significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

But just as the energy after Mr. Obama’s inauguration seemed to be on the right, this year it seems to be on the left. Anti-abortion demonstrations in some cities this month were met with much larger crowds of abortion rights supporters. At a widely viewed town-hall-style meeting held by Representative Gus Bilirakis in Florida, a local Republican Party chairman who declared that the health care act set up “death panels” was shouted down by supporters of the law.

Several Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have dismissed the pro-health care act crowds as “paid protesters,” not constituents. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, without offering evidence, called the protests a “very paid, AstroTurf-type movement,” unlike the Tea Party demonstrations against the drafting of the health care law in 2009, which he characterized as “very organic.”

In fact, some of the most formidable and well-established organizing groups on the left have found themselves scrambling to track all of the local groups sprouting up through social media channels like Facebook and Slack, or in local “huddles” that grew out of the women’s marches across the country the day after the inauguration.

“We’re just constantly being flooded with people asking us, ‘What can we do, where can we go?’” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org, who coined the “dam-bursting level” description. “For politicians to imagine that it’s something that any group could turn on and off like a light switch is a critical miscalculation.”

Ms. Sussman spent much of one morning this week communicating with 1,600 up-and-coming activist groups on a Slack channel that one of them organized.

“It doesn’t work for organizations to bigfoot strategy; it’s not the way organizing happens now,” said Kelley Robinson, the deputy national organizing director for Planned Parenthood, which is fighting the defunding of its health clinics. “There are bigger ideas coming out of the grass roots than the traditional organizations.”

Established groups in Washington are running more traditional campaigns.

The Alliance for Healthcare Security, a coalition of health care worker unions and other groups, is running television and online ads during the recess in five states where it believes Republican senators are either inclined to vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or vulnerable to defeat in re-election bids if they vote for repeal. The ads — in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada and West Virginia — feature constituents with life-threatening diseases telling emotional stories about how the health care law saved their lives.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is keeping track of Republican lawmakers who do not hold town-hall-style meetings. Some events have been canceled, and Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey said he had done so because the meetings have been “hijacked” by groups hostile to Mr. Trump. The committee plans to run internet ads trying to shame lawmakers for not facing their constituents in public since voting last month on a procedural motion aimed at repealing the health law.

Some of the most creative activity is coming from people who are new to political activism. In Plymouth, Minn., Kelly Guncheon, a financial planner who described himself as an independent, has organized a “With Him or Without Him” meeting for Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican who has not scheduled any of his own. A volunteer offered to make 400 cupcakes decorated with a “Where’s Waldo?” picture of Mr. Paulsen’s face, and Mr. Guncheon said he planned to project onto screens legislation that Mr. Paulsen had supported. Participants will be asked to write down questions, which will be delivered, along with a recording of the event, to Mr. Paulsen’s congressional office after the recess.

Mr. Guncheon, like other new activists, said he was not looking to traditional political groups for guidance.

“In this new culture, this new era, we have to figure out new ways to do things,” he said. “There’s certainly no leadership at the head of the Democratic Party, or the state party. Not that I’m a Democrat anyway, but that seems to be the opposition party.”

Other new groups organizing on Facebook have arranged similar events, calling them “no-show” or “empty-chair” meetings, for Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, as well as for Republican lawmakers from California, New Jersey and New York.

In response to Mr. Gardner’s complaints that the people showing up at his office to request town-hall-style meetings were paid protesters from other states, one group showed up at his office with a banner on which members had written their Colorado ZIP codes.

National groups are looking past the recess, to try to keep up the momentum for the local efforts.

Ms. Sussman, at the Center for American Progress, said her group planned a training and planning session in April for new activist leaders. Save My Care, another Washington group, is to begin an online campaign on Monday where people can register to have a hospital wristband sent to their congressional representative. The wristbands, which read “I will lose my health care if you vote to repeal,” will be delivered to Congress after the recess.

Planned Parenthood is signing up “defenders” and holding 90-minute training sessions to help teach new activists how to tell reporters and lawmakers their personal experiences with the group’s health services, and what it would mean to lose them.

The group is planning a rally in Milwaukee on Feb. 25, the last weekend of the recess week, with Planned Parenthood patients from Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s district expected to testify how they would be affected if clinics lost funding. Mr. Ryan has said he would defund Planned Parenthood in any repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Still, said Nicole Safar, the group’s director of government relations in Wisconsin, “This is more about movement-building than targeting Paul Ryan.”

“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” she said. “We’re going to put as much pressure as we can on Paul Ryan during the recess, for sure, but this isn’t going to end any time soon.”Photo

Nature photography has rarely been as spectacular as it is in “Planet Earth II,” yet at the same time the reverent, nonjudgmental approach embodied by David Attenborough seems too dispassionate for the cultural and environmental moment, at least to an American audience. This six-part series, which begins Saturday on BBC America, AMC and SundanceTV, invites you to be awe-struck, but also to feel as if everything is just fine in the natural world.

The program, which has already been seen in Britain, is a follow-up to the 11-part 2006 series, for which Mr. Attenborough was narrator (Sigourney Weaver did the American version) and one of the writers. Here he narrates again and introduces segments from delightfully unexpected vantage points for a man of his age. (He is now 90.) The first time we see him, he’s in a hot-air balloon.

“Looking down from two miles above the surface of the earth,” he says, “it is impossible not to be impressed by the sheer grandeur and splendor and power of the natural world.”

That begins a fresh look at nature that takes full advantage of advances that have been made in filmmaking since the original “Planet Earth,” which itself was dazzling. The photographers here get ridiculously close to their subjects. You don’t want to learn too much about how the film was made — the use of a trained eagle for an eagle-cam shot takes the glow off a wonderful sequence, as does the news that some of the program’s tidy vignettes were made so through judicious editing.

Never mind the behind-the-scenes stuff; just enjoy the view. Though “enjoy” may not be the right word — some of what the series serves up may haunt your dreams. Part 1, “Islands,” has an amazing moment in which newly hatched marine iguanas run for their lives as racer snakes, dozens of them, slither after them. Part 6, “Cities,” shows turtle hatchlings, whose DNA tells them to head for the moonlight and the ocean, instead aiming for the lights of a nearby city, and likely death. Yes, kids, life is tough, from the moment it starts.

The series, like the original, is organized by environments: “Islands,” “Mountains,” “Jungles,” “Deserts,” “Grasslands.” The “Cities” episode that concludes it is a new wrinkle: It examines animals that have adapted to urban environments. Some of these, like the rhesus macaques of Jaipur, India, have been getting so much TV time in recent years that they may need agents. The “Planet Earth II” treatment of them isn’t very thorough. Are they a nuisance? A health hazard? A tourist draw? We’re not told.

And that somewhat facile approach infuses the series. Mr. Attenborough has never been one to hector; he has said that he hopes his many fine nature programs have helped people appreciate the variety and fragility of the natural world, but he has eschewed the soapbox in favor of subtlety. This program (the series producer is Tom Hugh-Jones) does, too, for the most part.

“Islands” has a segment about the red crabs of Christmas Island, which lived relatively carefree lives until the accidental introduction of a voracious type of ant, perhaps via a ship, left them confronting a predator against which they had no defenses. Might you extract from that the lesson that the tiniest human disruptions can be catastrophic in the natural world, and further that therefore unchaining corporations from environmental regulations is going to have calamitous consequences? You might, if you were so inclined. Or you might just admire the pretty pictures and then go back to marveling at those racer snakes.Last year, she auctioned off a Cartier watch, Hermès and Chanel bags and her mother’s sapphire-studded compact, along with more idiosyncratic belongings, like a collection of R. Crumb comics. Ms. Buck’s library has been only slightly culled to 7,000 volumes, which are spread out between a storage unit in Poughkeepsie and on walls of steel bookcases in this basement.

In the wake of the Assad piece, Ms. Buck, now 68, said she was “tainted, like a leper,” and developed lesions on her feet that still cause her to limp slightly. Still, she had her defenders.

“I think she was very shabbily treated by Vogue,” said Tina Brown, who has edited two Condé Nast titles, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. “Frankly, it was an editing responsibility. You don’t just blame the writer. Not renewing her contract was harsh and she had no doubt why it was. The fact is, the piece comes in, there are a lot of eyes on it, and a lot of discussions. For Joan to be excommunicated for her work was very shabby.” (A spokesperson for the magazine declined to weigh in.)

Ms. Buck said: “There was so much opprobrium sticking to me. I was so flayed. My life as I knew it had vanished. And so it was a process of trying to figure out, Where did I come from? Where am I going? What really happened? I didn’t know, until I wrote the book, that I had the right to my own life, that I could tell my own story.”

Ms. Buck’s first memories are of a pink palace outside of Paris, a 19th-century copy of the Grand Trianon and an early stop on her parent’s self-exile from McCarthy-era Hollywood. Her father, Jules Buck, was a movie producer whose best friend was John Huston, an Army buddy whose life he had saved. Mr. Buck struggled to find work after leaving Los Angeles. Ms. Buck’s mother, Joyce, was an actress whose best friend was Lauren Bacall. At the pink palace, Jacques Tati and Federico Fellini were impish dinner guests. Ms. Buck learned to speak French before English, setting Frenchness firmly inside her, as she writes, “as a hunger for rules and form that went unmet in the margins of my family’s fantasy of a beautiful French life.” When a French nanny told her that her Jewish family had killed Jesus Christ, Ms. Buck, just 7, apologized politely.

The Bucks landed in London, where Jules would discover a young Peter O’Toole and arrange to have him cast in “Lawrence of Arabia,” after which the two men formed a film company. Ms. Buck grew up partly in the eccentric households of the Hustons, playing dress-up with Anjelica Huston, a surrogate sister. Jules’s fortunes rose with Mr. O’Toole’s, only to vanish when they had a falling out over “The Ruling Class,” their 1972 film. Hurt and humiliated, Jules was later found to be a manic depressive.

A mod teenager in 1960s London, Ms. Buck dressed in Biba and was a guide to that world for Tom Wolfe, who memorialized her, as a composite character, she said, in a newspaper article that would later appear in his 1968 book of essays, “The Pump House Gang.” When the author wrote her a letter that read, “Come to Rotten Gotham,” she enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., but dropped out after 15 months to work as a fashion assistant and book critic for Glamour magazine. She was wary, at first, of sex. “I had an idea that I couldn’t do it until I could make my own living,” Ms. Buck said.

In her book, Ms. Buck gives her sexual guardedness a Marxist interpretation, “a question of ownership,” as she writes. “I belonged to my father until I could earn my own way.” Unsure of her looks, she would nonetheless have love affairs with Donald Sutherland, Eric Rothschild, Jerry Brown and a married European academic with whom she stayed involved for 15 years. Leonard Cohen was an admirer.

Since her teens Ms. Buck has scrupulously noted dialogue in her diaries, which she has saved. “I’d think, ‘Oh, he hasn’t called, did I say the wrong thing?’” she said. “The only way I could get a handle on what had happened every day was to write down what people said, not what I felt.”

Of Mr. Brown, she writes that he told her, “You’re part of this vague elite, you don’t come from anywhere, you don’t represent anything.”

Ms. Buck once worked for Jeanne Moreau as an assistant, and for Guy Bourdin, the French fashion photographer. She met Andy Warhol when she was 22, and he made her the London correspondent for Interview magazine. “I became a slightly plump It Girl,” she writes.

When Ms. Buck and the English writer John Heilpern, now a contributor to Vanity Fair, married in London in the late ’70s, her friend Karl Lagerfeld made her wedding dress; Manolo Blahnik, a friend since they were teenagers, was her attendant. (That dress, a ruffled mauve confection, now lives in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)

After the couple moved to New York in 1979, Ms. Buck wrote “The Only Place to Be,” a novel about “people who wanted to be famous,” she said, though “it was too long and didn’t really have a plot.” Still, it wasn’t badly reviewed, and its publisher, Jason Epstein at Random House, promoted Ms. Buck, to her chagrin, as “the intellectual Judith Krantz.”

When her marriage to Mr. Heilpern ended after five years, Ms. Buck writes, “I’d tried to have a normal life and failed.”

She recalled a fight toward the end of the marriage, when Mr. Heilpern accused her of coming to New York to be a success, and she accused him of wanting to be a failure. “Then he said,” as Ms. Buck remembered, “‘And neither of us got what we wanted.’”

Ms. Huston described Ms. Buck as someone “who combines essences of Coco Chanel and Isabelle Eberhardt” — the cross-dressing, 19th-century Swiss adventuress and author. “She likes potent things,” she added. “I think Joan has a good deal of courage, and often finds herself in rather stringent situations, and maybe she has a taste for that.”

The rehab saga is a fine example. When Ms. Buck checked into the Arizona clinic, the required drug and alcohol tests came back clean. Its director was mystified when Ms. Buck begged to stay. “I have nowhere else to go,” she told her.

Absent a diagnosis, Ms. Buck was put in a room with suicide survivors. Noting that her father was bipolar, she wondered if there was a test for that, too. When those results, from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, also came back “normal,” save for “some evidence of paranoia” — Ms. Buck had answered “yes” to the statement, “People are plotting against me” — she signed up for kickboxing, Adult Children of Alcoholics, Sex Addicts Anonymous and Anger Management. While she was there, Mr. Heilpern sent her a clipping from Page Six reporting she had punched her publisher. When Ms. Buck called her lawyer to ask, “Is that legal?” he replied that she was a public figure and had no recourse. Ms. Buck was incredulous: “The editor of French Vogue is a public figure?”

Ms. Buck will tell you she was miscast as its editor, but others will disagree. She upended what had been the magazine’s rather staid coverage, often devoting its pages to single-topic themes, like film, sex and quantum physics. She also nearly doubled its circulation.

“It was the best period of French Vogue,” Mr. Blahnik said.

Ms. Brown said: “To me, she transformed the magazine. I thought she brought a wonderfully intellectual raised eyebrow to the whole thing. It became a magazine that people talked about.”

She added that she was baffled by the rehab tale. “I don’t know why it happened,” Ms. Brown said.

Ms. Buck said that when she asked Mr. Newhouse why he thought she was a drug addict, he told her that he was concerned because she had lost weight, a surprising response from an executive overseeing a Vogue title. (A spokesman for Mr. Newhouse said he wasn’t available for comment.) A story had also circulated about syringes falling out of her purse onto the floor.

In the book, Ms. Buck speculates that the syringe rumor derived from her habit of carrying vials of seawater given to her by a spa and tipping them into drinks, to boost her electrolytes. During the recent Hudson Valley visit, there was much spritzing from a small bottle of lavender and thyme oil, a product she picked up from Catherine Deneuve, and which she pressed into a visitor’s hands as a prophylactic against the germs of other passengers on the train home.

After French Vogue and the rehab stint, Ms. Buck moved to Santa Fe, looking to make a home for her aged father, who had been in her care through much of her time in Paris, though he died before she was able to move him there. (Early in her tenure at French Vogue, her mother had died of lung cancer.)

“She picked up the tradition of the men and women who used to inhabit Santa Fe,” said Richard Buckley, a former editor of Vogue Homme, “the black sheep who didn’t belong anywhere else and could be who they wanted to be there. And she gave pretty good parties. I don’t mean wild parties where people are hanging off the chandeliers, just ones with interesting people. Where else but Joan’s would you meet Tuesday Weld?”And now the country has exploded in a moment of protest unseen since the 1960s, fueled by the ascension of President Trump. It is a moment that poses fresh challenges for Mr. Coon, an ultraliberal in an ultraconservative state where emotions are running red hot but the injustices, as he perceives them, remain.

What role should he play in this new opposition? Certainly not White Jesus. How scared should he be now with his high profile and African-American girlfriend (also an activist) and habit of not shutting up?

How serious were the threats directed at him and posted on social media? There was this online comment, folksy and menacing, one of many directed at Mr. Coon after his aborted attempt in November to have Ole Miss declared a “sanctuary campus” for undocumented immigrants:

“From what I’ve read there is a large group that would gleefully use his head for a mop and his butt for a broom and God only knows what’s keeping them from it,” wrote the commenter, who identified himself as John Irwin, on the website of the Clarion-Ledger newspaper. “I guess those kids were just not raised the way I was raised.”

For Mr. Coon, there is another, more personal challenge. His critics may dismiss his convictions as P.C. posturing, but he arrived at them after witnessing the lingering prejudices that still marble the Mississippi experience, despite all of the state’s progress in the last half-century. It is a variety of political awakening that happens to some white people in the South, like a switch that flips within. Sometimes it is hard to turn off.

“I hate to say this because it sounds manic, but I can’t go through a day without obsessively thinking about race,” Mr. Coon said. “I think about it all the time, to the point that it sometimes harms my relationships with people.”

He strolled, on this mild winter morning, through the heart of campus, among the scarlet oaks and flowering dogwoods and the monument to the Confederate dead, near the place where white students rioted in 1962 as James Meredith, the school’s first black student, tried to enroll.

Even with his new haircut, and even amid the sea of white faces — Ole Miss is 77 percent white — Mr. Coon, who stands about 6-foot-4, with green eyes under heavy eyebrows, was recognized by a number of black students. Some approached and bumped knuckles. Others caught his eye from a distance, and tilted their chins his way. A subtle gesture of respect.

Mr. Coon pointed out other things he wished to see changed. Last year, the school placed an explanatory plaque in front of the Confederate monument noting that the South’s defeat freed millions. Mr. Coon would have rather seen the whole monument carted away.

He said he would like to see a new name for the campus building that currently honors James K. Vardaman, the early-20th-century Mississippi governor and United States senator who once declared, “If it is necessary every Negro in the state will be lynched; it will be done to maintain white supremacy.”

Not much better, in Mr. Coon’s eyes, is the Lott Institute, which offers a degree in public policy leadership. Its namesake, Mr. Lott, was the senator from Mississippi who resigned from his leadership post in 2002 after publicly praising the 1948 pro-segregation presidential campaign of Senator Strom Thurmond.

“This entire place is in many ways a shrine to white supremacy,” Mr. Coon said.

The fight over the flag was the kind of college experience that Mr. Coon had hoped for three years ago when he left Petal, a white-flight suburb of Hattiesburg, and enrolled at Ole Miss, founded in 1848 to educate the scions of the Mississippi planter class. As a middle school student, Mr. Coon had been a Confederate apologist, he said. But by the 12th grade, his obsession with race and racism was in full bloom, and Ole Miss beckoned to him as an American problem — one in his own backyard, one that he believed needed solving.

Ask him what flipped the switch, and he offers a laundry list: Listening to the hip-hop group N.W.A. Discovering “The Colbert Report.” The Trayvon Martin case. An act of racism by someone close to him still too raw for him to publicly share.

His two best friends were black men, and their best times were often spent crammed in a car together, where Mr. Coon was steeped in their jokes and music and passions and fears — particularly the fear of rogue police officers.

They called themselves Coon and Friends. “The joke was which one’s the coon and which one’s the friends,” one of them, Chris Stewart, 21, recalled.

Mr. Coon told them that he dreamed of making his mark. “He always told me that his biggest fear was dying and not being known for something,” said Mr. Stewart, who plays football at Wake Forest University.

Between his junior and senior years of high school, Mr. Coon attended Boys State, a mock government program, in Starkville, Miss. He was elected to the legislature, and a young black man named Malik Pridgeon was elected governor. But soon after Mr. Pridgeon’s election, the Boys State legislature learned that he was gay and sought to impeach him. Mr. Coon successfully quashed the effort. “I said, ‘Guys, if you impeach the black gay governor in Mississippi, CNN is going to be here.’”

He went on to use the filibuster to kill a school prayer bill, and another that was anti-L.G.B.T. He was granted the program’s highest award.

The next summer, Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., and Mr. Coon was shaken. “I experienced it through social media,” he said. “I felt like I had an obligation. I felt a burden that I have to act.”

He enrolled at the university in the fall of 2014. During the previous spring semester, white students had placed a noose around the neck of the campus statue depicting James Meredith.

In the spring of 2015, Mr. Coon organized two “die-in” protests denouncing police violence. He began earning respect among black activists for his organizing talents. In the fall of 2015, he was elected to the student senate.

Some of the student activists had already demanded that the administration take down the state flag, with its prominent Confederate battle flag symbol in the upper left corner.

The activists planned to pressure the administration with protests, but Mr. Coon had another strategy. He drafted a resolution asking the administration to remove the flag, expecting it would fail and simply serve as another pressure point.

But just before the vote, a group of Ku Klux Klan members showed up on campus. People were appalled and frightened, and the measure passed easily. A few days later, on Oct. 26, 2015, police officers removed the flag on the orders of the interim chancellor at the time, Morris Stocks.

The online vitriol was intense. Mr. Coon’s responses were often laconic.

“You should be ashamed of yourself,” one man messaged him the day the flag came down. “Watch yourself Coon.”

Mr. Coon’s reply: “Don’t care John.”

Other critics are more respectful. Dylan Wood, 20, a junior from Tupelo, Miss., said removing the state flag from the flagship state university was “a slap in the face” to his taxpaying family. “Personally, I like him,” he said, “but Allen Coon is one of the most disliked people on campus.”

There are also fans. On a recent afternoon, Correl Hoyle, an African-American senior, was sitting under the statue of Mr. Meredith with one of a series of signs that he displays in an effort to inspire conversation. (On that day, the sign quoted Prince: “Dearly beloved…”) He said he had spent some time under the statue nearly every school day since the noose episode.

Mr. Hoyle said the flag would never have come down had a white man not been perceived as the leader of the movement. With a black leader, Mr. Hoyle said, it would have been “like the Black Lives Matter movement all over again: People would say, ‘Oh, you’re being overdramatic.’”

Dominique Scott, a sociology major from Texas who was active in the fight against the flag, counts Mr. Coon as a close friend and credits him for his courage and conviction. But she has had words with him about the way the news cameras and the reporters all flocked to him first.

“Coon was not constantly combating that narrative of the white savior,” she said. “When they’d say, ‘You’re so wonderful,’ he wouldn’t do that. He’d just accept the praise and go about his business.”

Mr. Coon is still contemplating such criticism and what it means for his future. Though he had announced that he would reintroduce his sanctuary campus bill in the student senate, he walked the idea back in an interview this month.

“It does eventually become problematic,” he said, “that a white man is leading the charge.”

As a junior with a double major in public policy and African-American studies, he has watched with interest as Democrats in the Mississippi Legislature introduced bills to change the design of the state flag this year. But he knows that in a Republican-controlled Legislature, that change is unlikely to happen.

Mr. Trump’s election has pushed him further left. “I’ve been exposing myself to much more radical politics and ideologies,” Mr. Coon said. “I follow some anarchists and socialists on Twitter.”

In Oxford, there are certain places he will not go anymore — football games, the town square — because he has learned that the likelihood of an ugly confrontation is too great. But he is not an outcast on campus. His social circle consists mostly of black students and activists — the alternative Ole Miss.

“There’s several organizations on campus that the progressives bundle in together,” he said. “I’d argue that there are a lot of liberal-leaning and liberal-identifying people on campus. But the majority of students feel uncomfortable expressing those views, especially those who are in a Greek organization.”

He has been getting serious with his studies. He is getting serious with his girlfriend. He thinks about the children he may have one day. He thinks about their skin tone, and whether he would ever give them his surname.Times journalists around the world bring you a new 360 video every day.Get the Guide

We managed the key parts of an army people often forget about: truck drivers, engineers, explosive disposal specialists, postal workers — and, crucially, doctors.

Midway through my deployment a Marine arrived on base with severe wounds. He’d been shot by an enemy sniper, and the medical staff swarmed around his body, working frantically, skillfully, but it wasn’t enough. He died on the table.

Normally, there’d be a moment of silence, of prayer, but the team got word that the man who killed this young Marine, the insurgent sniper, would be arriving a few minutes later. That dead Marine’s squadmates had engaged the sniper in a firefight, shot him a couple of times, patched him up, bandaged him and called for a casualty evacuation to save the life of the man who’d killed their friend.

So he arrived at our base. And the medical staff members, still absorbing the blow of losing a Marine, got to work. They stabilized their enemy and pumped him full of American blood, donated from the “walking blood bank” of nearby Marines. The sniper lived. And then they put him on a helicopter to go to a hospital for follow-up care, and one of the Navy nurses was assigned to be his flight nurse. He told me later of the strangeness of sitting in the back of a helicopter, watching over his enemy lying peacefully unconscious, doped up on painkillers, while he kept checking the sniper’s vitals, his blood pressure, his heartbeat, a heartbeat that was steady and strong thanks to the gift of blood from the Americans this insurgent would have liked to kill.

This wasn’t just a couple of Marines and sailors making the right decision. These weren’t acts of exceptional moral courage in the way Lieutenant Chontosh’s acts were acts of exceptional physical courage. This was standard policy, part of tradition stretching back to the Revolutionary War, when George Washington ordered every soldier in the Continental Army to sign a copy of rules intended to limit harm to civilians and ensure that their conduct respected what he called “the rights of humanity,” so that their restraint “justly secured to us the attachment of all good men.”

From our founding we have made these kinds of moral demands of our soldiers. It starts with the oath they swear to support and defend the Constitution, an oath made not to a flag, or to a piece of ground, or to an ethnically distinct people, but to a set of principles established in our founding documents. An oath that demands a commitment to democracy, to liberty, to the rule of law and to the self-evident equality of all men. The Marines I knew fought, and some of them died, for these principles.

That’s why those Marines were trained to care for their enemy. That’s why another Marine gave his own blood to an insurgent. Because America is an idea as much as a country, and so those acts defend America as surely as any act of violence, because they embody that idea. That nurse, in the quiet, alone with that insurgent, with no one looking as he cared for his patient. That was an act of war.

After I left the Marine Corps, I met a veteran named Eric Fair. He was quiet. He wrote strange and affecting stories about guilt and alienation, and at first he didn’t tell me much about his past. Only over time did I learn that he’d been an Army Arabic linguist before Sept. 11, and then had signed up as a contractor and gone to Abu Ghraib prison in January 2004, all things he would later write about in his memoir “Consequence.”

Back then Abu Ghraib was a mess, he told me. Thousands of Iraqis, some of them insurgents, plenty of them innocent civilians caught up in the post-invasion chaos, and far too few qualified interrogators to sort it out. And the information they were seeking — it was literally life or death.

So Eric began crossing lines. Not legal lines — he followed the rules. But moral lines, personal lines, lines where it was clear that he wasn’t treating the people in his interrogation booth like human beings.

One time, it was with a boy captured with car batteries and electronic devices. The boy said his father used the batteries for fishing, an explanation that Eric found absurd. So, he used the approved techniques. Light slaps, stress positions. The boy eventually broke and, weeping, told Eric about a shop where his father delivered the electronics.

When a unit was sent to raid the shop, it found half a dozen partly assembled car bombs. “It was an enormous adrenaline rush,” he told me. He’d used techniques he now considers torture and, he thought, saved lives.

So, naturally, he kept using them. There were a large number of detainees caught with car batteries, all of them with the same story about fishing. With them, Eric would go right to the techniques designed to humiliate, to degrade, to make people suffer until they tell you what you want to hear. But Eric didn’t get any more results. No more car bomb factories. Just a lot of broken, weeping detainees.

Eventually, he told a fellow contractor the ridiculous fishing story, and how he wasn’t falling for it, and the contractor told him: “Of course they fish with car batteries. I used to do it in Georgia.” The electric charge stuns the fish, a simple method for an easy meal.

Eric isn’t sure how many innocent Iraqis he hurt. All he knows is how easy it was for him to cross the line. Just as with that wounded insurgent there was a codified set of procedures set in place to help guide Marines and Navy medical personnel to make moral choices, choices they could tell their children and grandchildren about without shame, for Eric, there was a codified set of procedures beckoning him to take actions that he now feels condemn him.

He doesn’t even have the consolation of feeling that he saved lives. Sure, they found a car bomb factory, but Abu Ghraib was a turning point. In 2003, thousands of Iraqi soldiers had begun surrendering to the United States, confident they’d be treated well. That’s thousands of soldiers we didn’t have to fight to the death because of the moral reputation of our country.

Abu Ghraib changed things. Insurgent attacks increased, support for the sectarian leader Moktada al-Sadr surged, and 92 percent of Iraqis claimed they saw coalition forces as occupiers rather than liberators or peacekeepers. WikiLeaks later released a United States assessment that detainee mistreatment at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo was “the single most important motivating factor” convincing foreign jihadists to wage war, and Gen. Stanley McChrystal said, “In my experience, we found that nearly every first-time jihadist claimed Abu Ghraib had first jolted him to action.” Our moral reputation had started killing American soldiers.

So, yeah, they found a car bomb factory. Once.

Eric has a relationship to his war that’s much different from mine. Yet we were in the same war. And Eric did what our nation asked of him, used techniques that were vetted and approved and passed down to intelligence operatives and contractors like himself. Lawyers at the highest levels of government had been consulted, asked to bring us to the furthest edge of what the law might allow. To do what it takes, regardless of whether such actions will secure the “attachment of all good men,” or live up to that oath we swear to support and defend the Constitution.

What to make of that oath, anyway? The Constitution seems to mean different things at different times and places — whether in my unit’s dusty little combat hospital, or in Eric’s interrogation booth, or in a stadium where a crowd cheers a presidential candidate vowing to torture his nation’s enemies. We live in a democracy, so that document can be bent and twisted and re-formed to mean whatever we want it to.

If we choose to believe in a morally diminished America, an America that pursues its narrow selfish interests and no more, we can take that course and see how far it gets us. But if we choose to believe that America is not just a set of borders, but a set of principles, we need to act accordingly. That is the only way we ensure that our founding document, and the principles embedded within, are alive enough, and honorable enough, to be worth fighting for.

Which brings me back to Brian Chontosh, that man with such incredible skill at killing for his country. Years after I left the Corps I was surprised to learn that he didn’t really put much stock in his exceptional kill count. He told Mr. Zabriskie this about killing: “It’s ugly, it’s violent, it’s disgusting. I wish it wasn’t part of what we had to do.”

When people ask him if he’s proud of what he did, he answers: “I’m not proud of killing a whole lot of people. That doesn’t make sense to me. I’m proud of who I am today because I think I’ve done well. I think I’ve been honorable. I’ve been successful for my men, for the cause, for what’s right.”

Brian Chontosh doesn’t dwell on the dead, but he does wonder whether there were times when, perhaps, he need not have killed. One of these is that last soldier in the trench. He’ll remember him, trying to pretend he’s dead but wiggling a bit. “It’s not a haunting image,” he told Mr. Zabriskie. “It’s just — man. I wonder. I wonder if I would have just freaking grabbed the dude. Grabbed his hand, thrown the grenade away or something. I could have got him some medical treatment.”

If he had, then that enemy soldier would have ended up with a unit like mine, surrounded by doctors and nurses and Navy corpsmen who would have cared for him in accordance with the rules of law. They would have treated him well, because they’re American soldiers, because they swore an oath, because they have principles, because they have honor. And because without that, there’s nothing worth fighting for.Photo

Work at the high-security government lab that handles deadly pathogens like the Ebola virus has been suspended since Monday, when it was discovered that nylon hoses used to pump air into the scientists’ protective suits had not been designed or tested for breathing safety, officials said on Friday. The hoses have been in use since 2005.

The problem, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, involved about 100 lab workers, said Steve Monroe, the associate director for Laboratory Science and Safety there. But there is no evidence that anyone has become ill as a result, he said. There is no risk to the public.

The hoses are used with protective gear that looks like a spacesuit, fully enclosing the wearer and providing its own air supply to avoid any possible contact with pathogens, some of which may be airborne.

The potential worry is not that germs could have invaded the air the workers were breathing, but that chemicals released into the air supply from the hose material might have been unsafe to breathe. Air samples from the hoses are being tested to see if any harmful chemicals are present. Results are expected next week.

Dr. Monroe said nylon was a stable compound, and he did not expect that anything of concern would be found.

Widely publicized accidents in recent years at the disease centers and other government labs, involving germs that cause influenza, anthrax and smallpox, have led to efforts to tighten procedures and reporting of mistakes. The discovery and response of this latest problem shows that the C.D.C. is succeeding, Dr. Monroe said, “in our ongoing efforts to improve accountability for lab safety and empower staff to report things that come to their attention.”

Ebola experiments had been underway in the lab that is now closed, he said.

New hoses were expected to arrive Friday night, Dr. Monroe said, adding that they were certified for breathing, but that he did not know what they were made of. Work will resume once the hoses are installed.

He said scientists who worked in the lab expressed some health concerns when they were told about the hoses, but were eager to get back to work.

The problem came to light when the C.D.C. ordered new hoses to replace the original ones, which had been installed when the laboratory opened in 2005. The manufacturer — the same one that had provided the original hoses — informed the C.D.C. that its products were not meant for breathing. Dr. Monroe declined to name the company.

Why the unsuitability of the hoses was not recognized in 2005 is not clear, Dr. Monroe said, adding that he did not know whether the disclaimer about breathing was something that the company adopted after 2005. But he said there was no indication that the company had any knowledge or concerns about the presence of anything toxic in the hoses.

The hoses were meant to carry compressed air for industrial tools like nail guns and paint sprayers, Dr. Monroe said. They did not come with the fitting needed to attach them to the protective suits worn in germ labs. In theory, that mismatch could have been a warning sign: Medical equipment is often manufactured with unique fittings and nozzles so that pieces that do not belong together cannot be joined. The same principle is used at gas stations, where the nozzle for diesel fuel often will not fit into a gasoline tank.

But in the C.D.C. case, instead of looking for hoses created to fit the suits, the lab designer found a manufacturer that could make fittings that would let the industrial hoses hook up with the suits.A few days before the retreat, I met up with the man who, perhaps more than any other figure in the conservative movement, had maneuvered the party toward complete and unbending opposition to Obamacare: Michael Needham of the Heritage Foundation. Needham, 35, is the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, a feral cur of a lobbying organization established by the venerable conservative think tank in 2010 to (as its website puts it) “hold Congress accountable to conservative principles.” Though other organizations — among them the Club for Growth and Americans for Tax Reform — have vigorously opposed Obamacare from its inception, Heritage Action has spent the last six years almost monomaniacally focused on demanding that legislators abolish the hated law. It scores them on what it deems critical votes and loudly condemns any and all apostasies. It names names and, when necessary to its ends, is happy to defy the Republican leadership. In violating Reagan’s “11th Commandment” not to speak ill of others in his party, Needham has come to rival Ted Cruz as one of the least popular Republicans in Washington.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Needham would not seem an obvious choice for this distinction. Smooth-skinned and passively handsome in the manner of Mitt Romney, he grew up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. His youthful acquaintance with struggle was limited to being a Mets fan. After graduating from Williams College in 2004, Needham went straight to work for Heritage, where he was made its director of Asian studies, despite having never visited Asia. In 2007 he briefly left the think tank to become a policy aide for the presidential campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the most liberal of the dozen or so Republican candidates in that cycle. By the time Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010, Needham had again temporarily left Heritage, attending Stanford Business School and dating a Democrat whom he would later marry. There was little in the cards to prefigure his imminent future as the self-designated — and at times deeply reviled — lead driver in the Obamacare demolition derby.

Like virtually every Republican in Washington, Needham was not especially enamored of Trump during the primaries. “Donald Trump’s a clown,” he said on “Fox News Sunday” just a month after Trump announced his candidacy — adding, with evident distaste, “This is a guy who believes in socialized medicine.” Needham’s preferences ran more to Bobby Jindal, and of course to Cruz, whom Needham reflexively referred to by his first name. Still, Needham and his adopted cause had emerged as unambiguous winners of the 2016 election. On the first day of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order to “seek the prompt repeal” of Obamacare.

Thus had Trump and Needham — two men who had never met — become allies. “I think one of the big disagreements we’ve had with the party for a long time is that we think when you’re trying to win an argument, it can only happen when you start them,” the young C.E.O. said as he sat in his Capitol Hill office, looking somewhat fatigued from having spent the previous weekend toilet-training his child. “And this kind of maniacal focus on ‘governing’ ” — his voice taking on a mocking tone — “when all governing means is a bill-signing to get good press, instead of laying out a vision of where you want to take the country, was one of the big divides we had.”

But the long, and at times quixotic, struggle to repeal Obamacare in which Needham has been a lead combatant has more closely resembled a street fight than anything that could reasonably be termed an “argument.” And though it may appear otherwise in a dawning age of Republican near-monopoly on government, the argument is today far from over. According to a January Fox News poll, Obama’s signature program now enjoys a 50 percent approval rating. There is no guarantee that Republicans in the Senate will sign onto legislation that risks leaving millions of their constituents suddenly without health care coverage while alienating key donors — drug makers, insurance companies and doctor associations — who helped shape and support the law Trump now seeks to replace. “The joke around Washington,” the former Democratic congressman Jim McDermott told me, “is that the Republicans are going to repeal Obamacare — and they’ll replace it with the Affordable Care Act.”

The building that houses the Heritage Foundation, on Massachusetts Avenue near the Capitol, stands as an eight-story monument to plain-faced perversity. It was here, in 1989, that the intellectual framework was first developed for what would become the Affordable Care Act. And it is here where Needham has spent the last six years trying to exterminate what he sees as the Frankenstein’s Monster that Heritage inadvertently set loose upon the land.

The basic architecture of the bill that would eventually become the A.C.A. was conceived in 1989 by the Heritage Foundation policy analyst Stuart Butler as a conservative alternative to government-managed health care. It was first put into practice in 2006 by Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who devised his state’s health care policy with the help of two other Heritage health care specialists, Bob Moffit and Ed Haislmaier. But for many decades, conservatives had resisted increasing the federal government’s role in health care. That remained true in 2009, when the newly elected President Barack Obama undertook to pass legislation that would extend health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans.

What Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress ultimately settled on was a framework of health care exchanges — marketplaces where health insurance could be purchased, and had to be, if you weren’t already covered. This was the so-called “individual mandate” first advocated (albeit in the context of a private-sector health care system) by Butler and later embraced by Romney.

Obama opposed the concept as a candidate, in favor of an unspecified plan that he claimed would lower costs. What many Democrats on the Hill — “probably more than half of our caucus,” McDermott says — preferred was a single-payer system, in which health care costs are borne not by insurers but instead by a single fund, typically originating from taxpayers, as Medicare does. But half of the Democratic caucus wasn’t enough for a bill to pass the House, much less the Senate. When a congressional majority failed to materialize for a hybrid measure, known as the “public option,” in which consumers would be allowed to choose among government-run insurance plans as well as private ones, Democrats were left with the individual mandate.

The final 2,700-page legislative package would aim to “increase the quality, availability and affordability of private and public health insurance to over 44 million uninsured Americans,” as the administration put it. Applicants whose income was between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line would be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. Those with incomes at or below 138 percent would now qualify for Medicaid in states that chose to participate in the program. Young people up to the age of 26 were permitted to stay on their parents’ health insurance. Americans with pre-existing medical conditions could not be denied coverage. And a variety of other regulations, taxes, penalties and incentives would be set up to maximize participation on the part of insurers, recipients, physicians and health care centers.

Though the details of the Affordable Care Act, as the final bill came to be called, left plenty of room for disagreement, its fundamental reliance on taxpayer-subsidized health care overseen by the federal government was a concept anathema to most Republicans. In a 28-page memo written by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz in spring 2009, Republicans were urged to use the phrase “government takeover” when referring to the Democrats’ health care package. Less heeded was another admonition in Luntz’s memo: “It’s not enough to just say what you’re against. You have to tell them what you’re for.”

In the end, Republicans lacked the numbers necessary to block the bill. On March 21, 2010, the House finally passed on a party-line vote a version of the bill that was sure to be agreed to by the Democratic-controlled Senate. “We didn’t give in to mistrust or to cynicism or to fear,” Obama, announcing the bill’s passage that night in the East Room of the White House, said. “Instead, we proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.”

The day after Obama signed the bill into law, a four-term Republican backbencher from Iowa named Steve King drafted his own bill in the House to repeal it in its entirety. Since there was no hope of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s considering King’s bill, he had decided to try a rarely successful legislative tactic known as a discharge petition — which, if it gathered signatures from 218 of the 435 House members, would force Pelosi to bring King’s bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote.

A couple of days after King made his move, in mid-June 2010, the two newly minted leaders of Heritage Action — Needham, then 28, and the 32-year old chief operating officer, Tim Chapman — met in the Capitol with Barry Jackson, chief of staff to John Boehner, the House minority leader at the time. Though Jackson today says that he has no recollection of their visit, Needham and Chapman both say they remember it clearly. After explaining the general mission of their new organization, the young conservatives brought up the recently passed Affordable Care Act. Heritage Action, they informed Jackson, intended to push House members to sign King’s petition.

Jackson’s response surprised Chapman and Needham. “He was very clear,” Chapman recalls, “that if we pushed forward on it, we would probably not get all the Republicans on it, and it would be politically detrimental to a lot of Republicans to be on it. He said, ‘I’ve seen all the ads the unions have prepared to run on this stuff.’ I don’t know where he’d seen them. We let off on the gas. We said, ‘We’ll agree to disagree on this one.’ It was the ‘aha’ moment for us: We just don’t see the world the same way.”

As both Chapman and Needham today concede, Jackson might also have had his own “aha” moment, recognizing them as impudent young jerks. Still, their aggression had the full blessing of Ed Feulner, then Heritage’s president, who says fondly of Needham, “He reminded me of myself 40 years earlier.” As for Heritage Action, he said: “We knew we’d be breaking some china.”

Among Republican elected officials, the Heritage Foundation had long been regarded as a tweedy grandfather, revered but not feared. The think tank was proficient at spewing out white papers and keynote speeches. But because of its status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, it could not devote a substantial part of its activities to taking positions on congressional votes or campaigning against political foes. Heritage sat by helplessly in 2003 while President George W. Bush, dismaying conservative purists, promoted and then signed into law a new federal entitlement that used Medicare to extend prescription benefits to senior citizens. Two years later, Heritage could do nothing to rescue Bush’s Social Security privatization measure from defeat. Now, with Heritage Action as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare organization,” the foundation at last had its own squad in the fight. And in Needham, Feulner had a jut-jawed lieutenant whose job, as Feulner put it, would be “to run the flag up the flagpole and see who salutes.”

Steve King’s bill was Heritage Action’s first flag. It had not occurred to Needham and Chapman to see things Barry Jackson’s way — to consider that Republicans’ taking an unambiguous stand to completely repeal Obamacare could cost them House seats five months later. Jackson’s hesitancy to campaign on full repeal was in fact shared by many Republican leaders. One of them, Senator John Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of Obamacare in May: “There is noncontroversial stuff here, like the pre-existing conditions exclusion and those sorts of things. Now, we are not interested in repealing that. And that is frankly a distraction.”

To Needham, there was only one way to look at the matter. “What’s the point in having a conservative party if we’re not going to fight a massive federal intervention in health care?” he told me. “It’s one-sixth of our economy!”

Needham and Chapman knew there were risks in allying themselves with King, an inveterate bomb-thrower with a deep yearning for the spotlight. But King was also a tenacious conservative. On June 16, he introduced his discharge petition, and Heritage Action began sending out emails to the foundation’s 661,000 members, urging them to pressure representatives on both sides of the aisle to sign it — ominously adding in a news release that “those who fail to support this effort are responsible for Obamacare.” The petition soon picked up two highly influential signatories: Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon who was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the House’s internal conservative think tank; and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a staunch conservative and personal hero of Needham’s who refused to vote for Bush’s Medicare bill in 2003.

A month later, Heritage Action turned up the heat on the 34 Democrats — most of them so-called conservative Blue Dogs — who voted against Obamacare in March but had yet to sign King’s discharge petition. In a press statement, Needham declared, “I know their constituents, who will be attending town halls this August, are eager to hear why they do not support the repeal effort.” In September, a single Democrat, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, added his signature. The tally reached 173, well short of what it would take for King’s bill to make it to the House floor — much less to get it passed and then sent over to the Senate, where Republicans’ appetite for abolishing Obamacare altogether was less acute than it was in the House.

But though the discharge petition had stalled, King and Heritage Action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and, eventually, an I-told-you-so. Overall, those who pledged fealty to repealing Obamacare fared better that November than those who didn’t. As King told me recently: “The Barry Jacksons and the John Cornyns were clearly wrong. Look at what happened to the Blue Dogs in 2010. There were 53 of them when Obamacare passed. Now I don’t know if you can count three of them.” King was exaggerating, but not by much — there are 18 members of Congress’s Blue Dog Coalition today. “Pelosi made them walk the plank, and they fell like tenpins after that. Since then, I don’t think there’s been a freshman Republican who didn’t run on the full repeal of Obamacare.”

Bashing Obamacare instantly became a winning Republican message — an indictment of its polarizing namesake, of big-spending Democrats and of the boogeyman of creeping socialism all rolled into one. During the 2010 midterm election cycle, opponents of the A.C.A. spent $108 million on ads pillorying it. As a reward to the 87 Republican freshmen whose victories had enabled the party to retake the House, Eric Cantor devoted part of his first day as the House majority leader to introducing H.R. 2, the “Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act.” It would become the first of more than 50 bills that would pass the House over the ensuing four years designed to repeal, defund, restrict or delay implementation of Obamacare. None of them stood any chance of becoming a law — they were dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But to Heritage Action, they served a purpose: in the organization’s parlance, to “lock in” members, to “orient” the Republican Party to conservative principles so that it would “do the right thing.”

At times, however, what looked like the “right thing” was, from Needham’s vantage, in fact the wrong thing. In April 2011, for example, a bill dismantling part of Obamacare did clear the House and then the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama without hesitation. It was a measure to eliminate the requirement that small companies submit 1099 forms for all transactions exceeding $600, which essentially served as a tax to help pay for the program and which Heritage Action had condemned as “burdensome” and “onerous,” guaranteed to generate paperwork and high accounting fees.

But Heritage Action, because of its ironclad resistance to “partial repeal,” actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision. Yes, it would help small businesses — but then those same small businesses would no longer care to be part of Heritage Action’s crusade. As Needham later told me, “We felt that when anything less than full repeal becomes acceptable, you open the door for every lobbyist in town to say: ‘Hey, while we’re working on full repeal, let’s fix the 1099 issue. Or let’s fix the franchise-restaurant issue’ ” — the popular shorthand for an A.C.A. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week. “You eventually over time whittle off various constituencies that we want to keep as part of the full-repeal platform.” Partial repeal would be well and good if it got rid of what Needham called a “vital organ” of the law: the individual mandate, say, or Medicaid expansion. But “those vital organs were never going to go down if repeal was defined by Washington’s lobbying class. It would be 1099s and these heavily lobbied issues, and then we’ll be stuck with Obamacare.”

In mid-2011, Heritage Action declared that it would “key vote,” or place greater emphasis on, bills it deemed especially relevant as litmus tests of members’ conservative bona fides. Needham also began issuing scorecards on how frequently members of Congress were voting down spending bills. The notion of a 20-something former Giuliani aide grading veteran lawmakers on their principles did not go over well. Representative Rob Wittman of Virginia was taken to task in a Heritage Action analysis for casting only four of a potential 11 votes to cut spending during a series of roll calls; he had to inform Chapman that he had missed those votes because his father had died. (Chapman did not change Wittman’s score but did explain the reason for Wittman’s absence on the Heritage Action website.)

Representative Geoff Davis of Kentucky, a onetime target of Heritage Action’s grading system, fumed to me about the organization’s absolutist browbeating, which came as Republican members were doing their best to thwart Obama’s agenda. “If I’m trying to stop someone’s bleeding on the side of the road, I don’t need to also give them a lecture about how they need to do aerobics and lift weights three times a week,” he said. Echoing the opinion of many Republicans in Washington, Davis asserted that Needham’s operation was less about legislative results than its own fund-raising: “Very quickly, it became a conservative for-profit operation,” he said.

More than once, Chapman recalls, Republican leaders on the Hill called Feulner to say, “You’ve got to rein these guys in.” But Heritage Action had other defenders besides Feulner. The new Republican Study Committee chairman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, felt that Needham’s organization was instrumental in pushing the party rightward. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a rising star in the Tea Party class of 2010, characterized Heritage Action’s messaging as “invaluable.” Even the complaints were tacit acknowledgments of the organization’s growing clout. As a 501(c)(4), Heritage Action was not obliged to disclose its finances, but it was known to have received millions, including $500,000 from the Koch brothers. Rank-and-file-conservative House members pointed with pride to their high Heritage Action scores. Leadership aides saw no choice but to include Needham and Chapman in strategy meetings.

And Heritage Action’s relentless focus on its message — Obamacare is a disaster that must be repealed in full — was already taking its toll. Before the law had even gone fully into effect, polls consistently showed that most Americans disapproved of it. The A.C.A.’s unpopularity persisted despite a number of modifications meant to improve the program and thus quell discontent. As Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary at the time, told me: “The notion from Day 1 was to make this work and listen carefully to the feedback, and to help dampen anxiety without gutting key provisions in the law. What made things difficult was that most of the law wasn’t going to be implemented right away. There was this huge gap in time between designing the bill and actually having the benefits fully in place, which gave a lot of opportunity for the opposition to say, ‘This will kill jobs, pestilence will come, vermin will fall from the sky’ — and very little opportunity for us to say anything other than, ‘Wait and see.’ ”

On this point, if nothing else, Sebelius and Needham could agree: The war on Obamacare would become far more difficult for opponents to wage once the actual benefits became available. New enrollees would begin receiving health care coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. It was a glum axiom among conservatives that once Americans were handed a new entitlement — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance — they were loath to part with it. Moreover, once a gigantic program fully insinuates itself into the federal governing apparatus, disentangling it is a formidable task. “One of my political heroes in town is Don Rumsfeld,” Feulner told me. “And one of Rumsfeld’s rules is that you want to act as quickly and aggressively as you can, because every day someone in the bureaucracy is narrowing the options you’ll have two days later. That’s clearly what’s happening with Obamacare. Every day the options for full repeal get fewer and fewer.”

On Sept. 24, 2013, House Republicans, goaded by Heritage Action and Ted Cruz, drafted legislation in which they agreed to raise the debt ceiling if Obama agreed to a number of conditions, including delaying implementation of his health care law by one year. Senate Democrats objected, but House Republicans wouldn’t budge. As a consequence, the United States Treasury warned it would soon default on its obligations, and on Oct. 1 the government began shutting down. A couple of days later, Tim Chapman met with several senior Republican staff members and members of conservative activist groups in a House conference room.

The shutdown was the crisis point Heritage Action had hoped for — that cherished moment when Republicans finally took a bold, principled stand. The public would express outrage that the president was willing to hold America’s full faith and credit hostage over the much-disliked Obamacare. Democrats would go wobbly. Republicans in both the House and the Senate would stand firm. In the end, Obama would cave. Or so Needham and Chapman hoped. “Kudos to leadership for doing the right thing,” Chapman told the group. “Now let’s prosecute this case!”

His enthusiasm was met with a wall of silence. The others in the room stared at him with a welling resentment. Finally, a tax-policy analyst at Americans for Tax Reform said to Chapman: “You’ve been saying the Republicans need to be brave. Well, we’re doing that. We’ve shut the government down. But what does Heritage Action intend to do to put pressure on the Democrats? So far, the only money you’ve spent over the past few months has been a half-million dollars attacking Republicans.”

Chapman went visibly red-faced. Only a couple of days into the shutdown, it was now occurring to the chief operating officer of Heritage Action that he and Needham had been abandoned by conservative leaders. Within days, the Republicans in the Senate buckled and, with the House Republican leaders in tow, signed a debt-ceiling deal with Obama that said almost nothing about health care. Congress was blamed by the public for causing the shutdown, and its approval ratings plummeted.

Throughout the shutdown, Needham insisted that the public would eventually reward Republicans for standing up to Obamacare. “Look,” he told me at the time, “there’s more Americans who are aware right now of the fact that we have one political party that owns Obamacare and was willing to go to the great lengths of shutting down the World War II Memorial in order to preserve it, and another party that tried to stop it. And Americans deserve that type of clarity.”

This opinion was apparently not shared by Speaker Boehner. In December 2013, he told reporters that groups like Heritage Action had “lost all credibility.” A month later, on the “Tonight” show, he called the government shutdown a “predictable disaster.”

But the continuing intransigence of the repeal advocates was beginning to wear down the White House. Initially, Sebelius says, “we were more focused on the Republican attorneys general across the country who challenged the constitutionality of the law. Until that was resolved by the Supreme Court in June 2012, that was our focus. The congressional action was viewed more as sour grapes and not altogether realistic. Clearly the president wasn’t going to sign anything that would strike down his brand-new law.” By the time of the shutdown, though, the repealers appeared to have succeeded in getting inside the Obama administration’s collective head. As Oct. 1, 2013 — the date HealthCare.gov was to be open for enrollments — approached, little time was available to subject the website to tests that could expose its shortcomings. But “the one thing that wasn’t feasible, knowing how vehemently the Republicans were determined to stop it at any cost, was moving the deadline,” she said. “That would have mobilized the opposition to the point that we might never have been able to launch it at all.”

And so the White House rolled out a deeply flawed website. By this time, the Republican critique of Obamacare was already becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The A.C.A. had been passed with only about one-tenth of the funding that it would need to be fully operational, with the expectation that the rest would be portioned out by Congress annually, through the appropriations process that funds discretionary government programs. From 2011 through 2014, as the House Republicans played round after round of fiscal brinkmanship, Obama reluctantly signed last-minute budget deals that continually shortchanged Obamacare.

“They did a very effective job making sure there would never be enough to fund implementation,” Sebelius told me. “And they came after the budget over and over. Anything that looked like it could be used, they made sure was gone.” That was especially the case, Sebelius said, when it came to educating the public about the program’s benefits — funding that would have made a difference in the 19 states where governors and legislatures had refused to expand Medicaid and had no interest in promoting Obamacare. “Any effort to put in dollars for outreach on the federal level,” she said, “were immediately stripped out.”

It’s impossible to know for sure how much of a role the hobbling of Obamacare played in the outcome of the 2014 midterm elections, in which the Republicans captured the Senate and expanded their majority in the House. But Republicans uniformly campaigned against the program, while Democrats found themselves at pains to demonstrate its virtues. As a bonus for Needham and Chapman, Eric Cantor, the House majority leader had been drubbed in the primary by a Tea Party-backed Republican. In September 2015, Boehner would step down as well.

A month after Boehner resigned, the House considered yet another bill targeting Obamacare. But this one was different from its predecessors. Sponsored by Representative Tom Price, who in just over a year would be Trump’s pick as secretary of Health and Human Services, H.R. 3762 was a “reconciliation bill,” a budgetary measure to defund the health care program that would, in accordance with Senate rules, require only 51 votes to pass in the upper chamber. That threshold was attainable, now that the Republicans had 54 Senate seats. The bigger hurdle was a more arcane one: To qualify for this lower passage threshold as a reconciliation bill, every item in the legislation had to be deemed a budgetary fix, rather than an extraneous provision, by the Senate parliamentarian. Accordingly, it did not include repealing the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. Better to let the Senate legislative aides confer on those matters with the parliamentarian, one staff member who helped write the bill told me.

That approach was not good enough for Needham and Chapman. Heritage Action announced its strong disapproval of the reconciliation bill, instructed members to vote it down and warned that the measure would be key-voted. Insisting that it was “universally acknowledged” that the repeal of the exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion would qualify as reconcilable items, Heritage Action stated that it would be satisfied with nothing less.

The new speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, ignored Heritage Action. On Oct. 23, the reconciliation bill went to the House floor, where all but seven Republicans voted for it. Apoplectic, Needham termed the act a “charade” that “undermines the party’s longstanding position of full repeal.” He added, “We expect the Senate to do better.”

The Senate Republicans did. Their version of the bill included repeal of the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. The parliamentarian ruled that both provisions were extraneous and did not therefore qualify in their present form for a simple-majority vote.

A watered-down version of the bill, which kept the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion but stripped away the ability to enforce either, then passed the Senate and was reapproved by the House. It was sent over to President Obama. On Jan. 8, 2016, he vetoed it. Obama’s final defense of his namesake program would come almost exactly 10 months later, when he received President-elect Trump in the Oval Office and urged him not to eviscerate Obamacare.

Obama’s words, Trump said the following day to The Wall Street Journal, had made him reconsider abolishing the law in full. But 10 weeks later, as one of the very first acts of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order whose mission statement was the “prompt repeal” of Obamacare in its entirety.

The Affordable Care Act’s approval rating has rarely exceeded 50 percent. And over time, as it has strained under the multitude of compromises that were necessary for its passage, it has proved itself worthy of several of the criticisms aimed at it. Though for 80 percent of health care recipients (including those receiving health care from Medicare, Medicaid or their employers) annual rate increases are at historic lows, for the rest the story has been different. The premiums have been rising because of a variety of structural reasons, and because federal assistance to recipients to offset the costs has been in many cases inadequate. Or, as the health-policy analyst Robert Laszewski puts it, “They created a Cadillac with Chevrolet subsidies.” But it is also because unit costs have continued to soar — like the price of prescription drugs, thanks to the sweetheart deal that the pharmaceutical industry cut with the Democrats in exchange for being an early supporter of the law. Some rural states like Alaska have seen very little competition among insurers — something that a public option might have addressed, had the insurance lobby not spent a fortune to defeat that provision. Of the 23 nonprofit insurance co-ops set up by the Affordable Care Act to compete in such areas, only a handful remain — probably at least in part because the co-ops received from Congress only $2.4 billion of the $6 billion originally appropriated to establish them.

To make Obamacare economically feasible for insurers, the program needed to attract a large pool of young and healthy recipients to offset the costs of providing care for the older and less healthy. That ratio has yet to prove satisfactory for many insurance companies — one of which, Aetna, announced last year that it would be abandoning the program in several states. (Aetna publicly blamed Obamacare, saying that it was losing money participating in the exchanges, but a federal judge ruled that Aetna’s real motive was to escape scrutiny for its possibly illegal merger with Humana, and court documents have shown that the company was making money in some states where it was claiming not to.)

Then again, it was always the industry’s expectation that the law would prove flawed in places, and that those shortcomings would be addressed legislatively. As Karen Ignagni, the lead lobbyist for the health-insurance industry during the formation and passage of Obamacare and now president and C.E.O. of EmblemHealth, tactfully puts it: “On the Affordable Care Act, there was a strong difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans going back to the initial days of discussion. And so there was never a coming-together.”

In spite of all this, Obamacare has done far more good than its critics predicted it would. As of 2014, insurers cannot deny coverage to anyone based on their current health status — a meaningful protection for the 133 million Americans with chronic illnesses. Over 15 million poor or near-poor citizens are now receiving Medicaid benefits in the 31 states (as well as the District of Columbia) that have opted for this expansion. Another 3 million Americans under the age of 26 have been allowed to stay on their parents’ health care plans, thanks to the provision in the A.C.A. that Heritage Action warmly refers to as the “slacker mandate.” Meanwhile, during each month that Obamacare has been in existence, the private sector has grown. The bill has not proved to be the “job killer” apocalyptically described by its Republican opponents.

Now that the law is in place, trying to tinker with it in a measured fashion, deciding which parts to discard and which to keep, would be more complicated than simply determining what the public likes and what it doesn’t. As Jim McDermott says: “You can’t just reach in and pull out one thing. It’d be like a doctor doing surgery and saying, ‘Well, since you’re not using your spleen today, let’s take it out.’ It’s all wired together in a very complex way.”

That wiring represents, among other things, the compromises worked out with the various players in the health care ecosystem — doctors’ and nurses’ associations, hospital groups, insurers, drug companies — that enabled the passage of Obamacare in the first place. As Ignagni points out: “It was very unique that all of the different industries were willing to sit at the table and engage in problem-solving together. I don’t really recall any time when that has happened in our economy on any issue.” Collectively, those groups spent close to $273 million on lobbying during the height of the Obamacare debate. They will surely spend a similar sum haranguing Congress to pass a replacement that favors them.

Many conservative remedies have been floated over the years and have been consolidated into Speaker Paul Ryan’s 37-page “A Better Way” summation: expanded health savings accounts, assorted tax credits and refunds, medical-liability reform, portability of insurance from one job to the next and the ability to purchase insurance across state lines. But the problem for Republicans is that Obamacare’s sweeping coverage has changed the paradigm. Of the 31 states that have opted for expanded Medicaid coverage, 16 have Republican governors. None of these governors have expressed a desire to throw their states’ residents off the rolls. At the same time, the fitful and at times rhetorically muddled transition from the known (Obamacare) to the unknown (“something terrific”) has risked throwing the health care industry into turmoil. The aftershocks are likely to be not only economic but also political.

“If you take Obamacare as it looks right now,” says the policy analyst Robert Laszewski, a longtime critic of the legislation, about half of enrollees “don’t get a subsidy because their incomes are too high. They make $90,000 or $100,000 a year but are in the individual market. These tend to be Trump supporters. So if he further destabilizes this thing and there are 20-to-50-percent rate increases, he’ll be screwing his own people.”

Last month, Representative Steve King once again offered his full-repeal legislation, maintaining that in doing away with Obamacare, the country would immediately be “far better off,” even if nothing were done to replace it. To King and Heritage Action, failing to seize this moment of opportunity would constitute a grave betrayal. “It’s pretty clear that the conservative base is expecting Congress to do this,” Chapman told me. “If Congress goes back to the voters in 2018 and people are still enrolling in Obamacare, I think that’s going to be disastrous.” Speaking of the base, Chapman predicted, “They’re basically going to splinter off and create a third party.”

But it took more than the conservative base to elect Donald Trump, and it will take more than them to re-elect many Republican senators and representatives in 2018 and 2020. The rest of the public has begun a decided turn against King’s and Heritage Action’s position. The same Fox News poll last month that found Obamacare’s overall favorability to be 50 percent also found that only 23 percent of respondents favored fully repealing it — a new low since the law was signed nearly seven years ago.

After Trump remarked to The Washington Post on Jan. 15 that he planned to provide “insurance for everybody,” I thought I had better gauge Michael Needham’s reaction. Taken at face value, Trump did not sound much like a man hellbent on tilting health care policy rightward. “I’m concerned when I hear that kind of talk,” King had told me. “I don’t know how deeply he’s gone into the details.”

But Needham chuckled breezily when I brought up Trump’s statement. “I think right now there’s a lot of people who want to jump on words,” he said. “Everybody wants to ensure every American has access to high-quality health care. That is pretty clearly what Trump was saying. What’s the overused phrase? Trump supporters take him seriously, not literally.”

Nor did it seem to bother him that Republicans on the Hill were in a frenzy to develop a consensus for replacement legislation. Up to now, Needham reminded me, the goal had been to inculcate in the party a ceaseless lust for Obamacare repeal. “For the last eight years,” he said, “it hasn’t made sense to litigate the nuance of, Do you use a tax credit or a tax deduction, or what are your views of block-granting?” The Republicans might not end up with a single gargantuan replacement bill, and maybe that was as it should be. “We’re probably in an age where smaller, humbler pieces of legislation are easier to get consensus around.”

This struck me as sensible and, at the same time, somewhat naïve. If, as in Heritage Action’s dream scenario, Obamacare were to be immediately vaporized, it would leave a yawning vacuum — and the first thing to fill it would be anxiety. Every gruesome case of once-insured families now left to die would be duly chronicled by the media. Legislators would panic — but, if recent history is any judge, their reaction would be tame compared with that of the man who now thoroughly owned the post-Obamacare landscape. Was it really so hard, I asked Needham, to imagine Trump faltering under the specter of bad press and equally bad approval ratings and hastily offering up a Trumpcare that bore a suspicious resemblance to Obamacare?

Needham paused for a moment before saying, in a vaguely amazed voice: “I’m a little surprised by the question. Right now, I don’t see much evidence of that playing out.” Trump’s vice president was Mike Pence, “my first hero when I came to Washington.” Tom Price, the nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, and Mick Mulvaney, whom Trump tapped to run the Office of Management and Budget, were longtime supporters of Heritage Action. The former senator Jim DeMint, Ed Feulner’s replacement as president of the Heritage Foundation, was helping to shape the selection of Trump’s prospective Supreme Court nominees. Trump’s team was loaded with Heritage staff members. All this counted for as much as whatever the new president himself thought. “Richard Viguerie, one of the icons of the conservative movement, said to me that what was great about Reagan was that when he walked into the room, you saw your friends and allies walking with him,” Needham told me.

It was a pleasing image, conveying undying fellowship. Yet even Reagan, fierce inveigher against socialized medicine that he was, did not make a dent in Medicare, the program he so loathed, during his two terms in office. Quite the contrary, in fact: He briefly expanded its benefits to include catastrophic care for the elderly before Congress struck down the measure less than a year after Reagan left office.

Now came the president whom Needham once accused of embracing socialized medicine. Maybe he would somehow turn out to be a more reliable friend to the conservative movement than Reagan had been. Or maybe Washington would prove, hardly for the first time, that even the best of friends will let you down.Photo

This is definitely not the way that announcers in New Orleans — or, for that matter, commentators on the TNT network — will introduce the four-player lineup for the N.B.A.’s slam dunk contest on Saturday night.

“Please welcome … Aaron Gordon, who has averaged 8.8 points per game in three seasons for the Orlando Magic …

“Derrick Jones Jr., who has scored a total of 11 points in seven games for the Phoenix Suns …

“Glenn Robinson III, with his 4.3-point average over five seasons for three different teams ...

“And DeAndre Jordan, the one name casual fans should know, with his per-game averages of 8.9 points and 10 rebounds in nine years with the titleless Los Angeles Clippers.”

You will not hear any such statistics cited on All-Star Saturday night, even though it is absolutely true that none of the participants have managed to average 9 points a game over the course of a career.

The N.B.A., which can no longer persuade its biggest names to participate in such a risky novelty event, seems to be doing just fine with its B- and C-list players headlining the dunk contest.

Last year’s event, in Toronto, for example, was an aesthetic and ratings success. Once airborne, the contest was a double-overtime showdown between Zach LaVine, the eventual winner, and Gordon that brought back memories of Michael Jordan versus Dominique Wilkins in the 1980s, minus the outsize reputations.

LaVine passed the ball behind his back before one dunk. Gordon routed it through his legs on a reverse dunk. According to The Associated Press, the telecast drew seven million viewers at its peak, the highest total for any cable show that night.

A dunk contest among LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin and John Wall would surely attract a larger audience. But the event requires too much rehearsal and too many hard landings for such a commitment by established superstars.

LaVine has emerged recently as something of a dunk celebrity, and he might have given the contest in New Orleans a significant boost. But even before his season ended this month with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, LaVine announced that he would not vie for a third consecutive victory. There are only so many ways you can ram a basketball through a hoop.

“I feel like I’ve accomplished everything I could in the dunk contest,” LaVine, 21, told reporters last month. “It would be hard for me to go back and outdo myself. I’m never saying I won’t ever do it again, but I’m focused on this year. Getting the rest and just focusing more on just the game is the main thing.”

While the cast of daredevils continues to change, there remains a core fan base that simply loves outrageous pretzel jams by relatively anonymous contestants.

That theory will be put to its biggest test on Saturday, with the quartet of who-are-these-guys? If even this event manages to pull strong ratings, organizers should consider an even greater leap of faith: Do participants really need to be N.B.A. players, or basketball players at all? Couldn’t tall, well-trained acrobats manage even trickier circus dunks?

The league could include both players and nonplayers, calling the event “Dunking With the Stars.”

When it comes to luring big names to its All-Star break antics, Major League Baseball has easily eclipsed the N.B.A.

Baseball continues to showcase some of its biggest stars in its home run derby — which has attracted TV viewership similar to the dunk contest’s in recent years. But its audience appeal also seems more dependent on well-known names.

Giancarlo Stanton beat such notables as Robinson Cano and Todd Frazier in 2016, when the derby drew 5.5 million viewers, according to the Sports TV Ratings website. Viewership was higher in 2015, at 7.1 million, when Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs joined the festivities.

It may be that baseball’s stars are more easily persuaded to participate in the home run derby because the contest requires little practice and, unlike the dunk contest’s reliance on judging, is decided by a simple, objective standard — how many baseballs are knocked over the wall.

Still, even such a straightforward event requires a great deal of energy and is not tailored for frazzled veterans.

“The home run derby wears you out,” David Ortiz told WEEI.com when he decided not to participate in the 2016 event. “It’s good for the younger guys to do it, puts you on the map for a minute. It takes everything out of you. You definitely have to be in your 20s to do it.”

That goes double for the dunk contest. Double twist, with a reverse finish.And consulates are moving quickly to help. As official representatives of the Mexican government in the United States, the consulates can provide legal guidance and resources for people and families dealing with immigration issues. Mexicans make up about half of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The relationship between Mexico and the United States is at its lowest point in years. After a 35-year-old mother of two American citizens was deported in Arizona last week, the Mexican government warned their citizens living in the United States of a “new reality.” It urged “the entire Mexican community” to “take precautions” and be in touch with the nearest consulate.

Mexican officials say they are eager to keep families already living in the United States together. There are economic concerns too: Mexicans living abroad send more than $25 billion back home, with most of the money coming from the United States, according to Mexico’s central bank.

Perhaps nobody is as busy as Carlos García de Alba, the consul general in Los Angeles, one of the largest offices in the country. He has begun to train nearly every employee in basic legal services and expects to bring in many more immigration lawyers. Still, in recent months, Mr. García has felt torn between his efforts to increase services to worried constituents and trying to calm their nerves.

“We don’t want to provoke and feed a kind of paranoia among our nationals here,” Mr. García said in an interview. “There is a kind of psychosis, people are really scared. Up to now we haven’t seen anything that is really different than the last several years, but the environment is making people panic and they are completely fearful. They want to know what is going to happen and how to protect themselves.”

In the last week, the Mexican government has created a 24-hour hotline to help answer any questions for Mexicans in the United States. Last month, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced that he would spend $50 million to pay for lawyers at every consulate to help people facing deportations. And consulates have been distributing fliers detailing what to do if someone is approached by deportation agents — advising them not to open their doors without proof of a warrant or speak to officers without a lawyer.

Foreign service officers who have spent decades in the United States said in interviews that they had all encountered increased anxiety among undocumented immigrants, as several states have passed their own laws to deal with illegal immigration. But they said this was the most hostile national atmosphere for Mexicans in recent memory, making their jobs both more difficult and more urgent.

Scared by rumors and rhetoric, some consulates have heard of immigrants taking drastic steps to avoid the authorities, like keeping their children home from school, quitting their jobs or selling their homes for cash. And many immigrants may not immediately consider turning to the Mexican government for help.

“There is an inherent feeling of vulnerability that comes with being undocumented in this country, and that vulnerability moves you to get away of anything that is official government,” said Carlos González Gutiérrez, the consul general in Austin, Tex., who estimates that about half of the 200,000 Mexicans living in the region are undocumented. “The first challenge for us is to make sure that immigrants understand that the consulate is a safe place where they can get accurate information.”

Like other consuls, Mr. González has tried to assuage fears by appearing frequently on Spanish-language television and radio, offering information that American officials may not be willing to share. He has been careful to emphasize that the operations appeared to be targeted, not widespread raids as some feared, but also pointed out that several people without criminal records had also been arrested.

Many of the consulates’ most pressing concerns now are defensive. In several cases last week, immigration agents were “unwilling to provide our nationals with the option to talk with our consulate and the obligation to notify us,” said one Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue was still under investigation. Under the Vienna Convention, a 1963 international treaty, any citizen of another country should be offered a chance to speak with their consulate.

Felipe Carrera oversees the department of protection in the Los Angeles consulate, where dozens of lawyers assist with immigration cases. For years, the office has sent a lawyer to the federal immigration center daily, monitoring who is taken in and talking to as many as 15 people a day. Minutes after he heard reports of dozens of arrests last week, several lawyers went there to talk with as many Mexicans as they could.

“Our main purpose is to find out if there have been violations of due process,” Mr. Carrera said. “People need to know they have constitutional rights. We want them to know about the Fifth Amendment and make sure they are properly advised about what happens if they plead guilty.”

Claudia Franco, the consul general in Phoenix, said much of her time these days was spent offering a kind of psychological support to immigrants, answering basic questions and calmly listening to their fears. “We want people to consider worst-case scenarios, to be prepared and have a plan,” she said. The round-the-clock national hotline, based in Tucson, received more than 1,500 calls one day this week, more than double than the average number of calls before Mr. Trump was inaugurated.

Consulates throughout the country said requests for legal assistance had also spiked in the last two months — some come from people who received deportation orders years ago that were never enforced. Others have criminal convictions for using fake Social Security cards; still others may be eligible for special visas because they were victims of domestic abuse or other crimes.

“Most people do not understand what their legal options are,” said Javier Díaz de León, the consul general in Atlanta. “There are a number of people who don’t really have a legal recourse, but it’s much more preferable to know that before you get detained so you can make a wise decision.”

While many people are looking for advice have plans to stay here, many parents of American-born children are now registering them for Mexican citizenship — a kind of insurance in case they are deported and want their children to join them. The Mexican government has offered this kind of dual citizenship for more than a decade. Before the election, Mr. Díaz said, the office handled about 15 applications a day, now they receive double that.

Other offices have experienced similar increases. Monica Sanchez, 26, came to Los Angeles from Morelia, Mexico, more than 10 years ago. Although she has stayed out of legal trouble, she said she was constantly worried that things would change quickly and she would be forced to move back.

“I want to do something, whatever I can do to feel safer and less scared,” she said. “We all want help to take the control we can get, to have some power.”“The fact that in all the 11 championships I’ve never been asked this question says something about where we are” as a country, Mr. Auriemma said. “Forget the answer. The fact that I’ve never been asked means there’s something going on that isn’t normal.”

UConn has won 100 consecutive games since 2014. And while the Huskies are not a lock to win a 12th title, they are favored again to cut down the nets in triumph at the Final Four in Dallas. Now coaches, current players and the team’s former stars are wrestling with the issue of whether UConn should visit the White House in celebration.

The Huskies’ players are amateurs, some still teenagers, not professionals with agents, union protection and multimillion-dollar contracts. They have kept up with the current political situation, and the responses by other athletes, through social media and classroom discussions. Their own reactions were nuanced and considered.

Even before Mr. Trump was elected, UConn players jokingly told one another, “We’re not going if he wins,” the sophomore forward Napheesa Collier said. “Now that it’s actually happened, if we win, I don’t know what everyone’s going to do.”

Photo

Ms. Stewart and Maya Moore, another former UConn star, said they expected that whatever decision the team made, it would be done collectively. Gabby Williams, a junior forward, agreed.

“That’s just what we’ve built here,” Ms. Williams, the team’s most complete player, said. “We don’t have guys that do their own thing. Whatever we do, it’ll be a unified decision.”

If some players did not want to attend a White House celebration, Ms. Collier said, “I really don’t know what I would do in that position; I guess we have to get there first.”

Mr. Auriemma, who will turn 63 during the N.C.A.A. tournament, said the dilemma for him was reconciling respect for the office of the presidency with the possibility that some players might object to meeting Mr. Trump, feeling unwelcome at the White House because of the president’s statements and positions on women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims.

“If we’re fortunate enough to win it, and your players walk in and go, ‘Listen, I’m not going,’ we’ve never had to deal with that before,” Mr. Auriemma said.

“What are you going to do as a coach?” he continued. “It’s not like I can look it up and go, ‘What did other people do?’ We’re in a world that very few of us could have conceived five years ago.”

What would he do?

“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s a good question.”

There is no pressing need for an answer now, he understands, no need to cross a point of no return. The national championship game is not until April 2, and there is no guarantee that UConn will be playing or winning.

“I’m not crossing the Rubicon,” Mr. Auriemma said. “That’s Caesar. Once your army crosses that river, you are an enemy of the state.”

Photo

Mr. Auriemma is no supporter of Mr. Trump. He made that clear last summer in Rio de Janeiro while coaching the American women’s team to a second consecutive Olympic gold medal under him and sixth in a row over all. Asked whether dominance by the United States was good for women’s basketball, he told reporters, “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s O.K. to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex.”

He later expressed shock that Mr. Trump had been elected president.

But Mr. Auriemma is also the most visible representative of Connecticut’s flagship public university. And he has lived a classic immigrant success story, having been born in Italy and then moving to suburban Philadelphia as a boy, winning a record number of N.C.A.A. basketball titles and becoming wealthy in the process. He speaks reverently of the presidency as a symbol of “the most that this country can represent.”

He tells of his mother, Marsiella, being overcome with tears when she shook hands and took a photograph with President Obama. And how boosters accompanying the team have variously complained about the policies of President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Obama on trips to Washington, yet “once they get down there, he puts his hand out and he says, ‘Welcome to the White House,’ and they just melt.”

“Because it’s the president of the United States,” he said.

One should not easily dismiss an opportunity to meet any president, Mr. Auriemma said. “In order to do that,” he said, “you’ve got to have some pretty strong convictions. And we’ve got some pretty socially activist players on our team.”

Sue Bird, the former UConn point guard who won two N.C.A.A. titles and two of her four Olympic gold medals while playing for Mr. Auriemma, said that if some players felt unwelcome at the White House, he would surely take that into consideration.

“I think he’s somebody that understands where he is in this world and what he represents and the platform he has,” Ms. Bird said. “And I don’t think he’s shy about speaking out on his feelings. And with that, I wouldn’t be surprised, to be honest, if they didn’t go.”

Ms. Bird stressed that she was speaking about her own observations, not about any impression that Mr. Auriemma had directly given her. Any decision, she said, would be a “tough call” and would be made by the coach with the intent of protecting his players.

“Because, in reality, they’re kids,” Ms. Bird said. “So it’s hard to know what to do.”

The Huskies are a diverse team ethnically and culturally, and as with any team, there are varied political opinions, players said.

“I don’t think the entire team wouldn’t go,” said Kia Nurse, a junior guard from Hamilton, Ontario. “It would be an interesting thing.”

Forward Batouly Camara, a native of Manhattan and a transfer from Kentucky who is practicing with UConn but not playing this season, is a Muslim whose parents immigrated from the West African nation Guinea.

Her mother, who holds dual citizenship, has been reluctant to travel back to Guinea, where she runs an orphanage, Ms. Camara said, even though Mr. Trump’s travel ban does not target the country. But she added, “I don’t feel anything harsh or anything at all” toward the president.

Ms. Camara said she had received “an overwhelming amount of support” from teammates, coaches and others in the UConn community, for which she was grateful.

She said she expected the team to stick together in making a decision about the White House. “If we decided to go and do something there,” Ms. Camara said, “that could be a platform for us.”

The family of Ms. Collier, the sophomore forward, has a history of political involvement. Her paternal grandfather, Gershon Collier, was a diplomat in the West African nation Sierra Leone who helped secure the country’s independence from Britain in 1961. He later became its ambassador to the United States and chief justice.

“I think it’s a really touchy subject,” Ms. Collier said of a potential visit to the White House. “For me, personally, I don’t really support Trump, but I would still go out of respect for my team. But I don’t know how everybody else feels about it.”

She added, “We kind of try to stay away from politics a little bit, especially because it’s getting so heated.”

Ms. Williams, UConn’s best player, said her personal view would be to visit the White House.

“It shows, despite my feelings, or anyone’s feelings, that’s just kind of the respectful thing to do,” she said, adding that it “kind of makes you look like the bigger person, too.”

But, she said, “to each his own, and people are free to make their own decisions.”Photo

Having opened seven restaurants in eight years, Albert Adrià did not need to open another.

Mr. Adrià, 47, has explored the intersection of modern Spanish cuisine and other traditions more than perhaps any other chef. Five of his restaurants are in the same neighborhood here, creating a kind of culinary theme park that lures some 100,000 diners — half of them foreigners — in a year.

Photo

But the spirit of El Bulli demanded to be heard. That trailblazing modernist outpost on the Costa Brava of Catalonia closed in 2011, leaving behind a legacy as one of the world’s most influential restaurants. Mr. Adrià was El Bulli’s pastry chef, and he worked there for 23 years alongside his brother, Ferran Adrià, its creative force.

So Albert Adrià had everything he needed — the experience, the will and the audacity — to revisit El Bulli. The result is Enigma, which opened in January not as a re-creation of El Bulli, but as an attempt to reimagine it on his own terms.

Photo

“This is not the El Bulli of 2011,” Mr. Adrià said. “Enigma is what El Bulli would be in 2017.”

Like its predecessor, Enigma offers cuisine that is wide-ranging and complex. But it focuses instead on the ingredients and their intrinsic tastes rather than revolutionary techniques, like the foams and spheres that distinguished El Bulli. Unlike that restaurant, Enigma serves cocktails and elaborate snacks. And where El Bulli’s décor was rustic, Enigma’s ambience is futuristic and cool — indeed the tables and chairs look as though they were carved from blocks of ice.

Located as it is on the main floor of a bland office building, Enigma has an anonymous-looking entrance that requires a code number for admission, provided when the guest pays an advance deposit online. Inside, diners begin a journey through six separate spaces, sprawling over 7,500 square feet, where they are served a tasting menu of more than 40 small dishes. The meal costs about $235, excluding drinks.

The first space features waist-high tables where guests stand and receive a hot hand towel and hibiscus tea accompanied by two bite-size tastes that will vary: one night they were a kaffir lime leaf with lime chili and agave honey, and ice crystals of yuzu saki with fresh wasabi and yuzu shavings.

Photo

Diners glimpse what is to come through hanging opaque panels that look like corrugated ice. If the planet Krypton had an elegant restaurant, this would be it. The tufted aluminum netting on the ceiling, shot through here and there with purple and blue lighting, is matched by the gray crepe outfits of the servers.

Open five nights a week, Enigma serves only 24 people at a time (it plans to increase that to 30) in a choreography flowing from one space to the next, including a cocktail bar and a flattop grill where diners can watch the preparation. When served at a table, dishes are often set down in front of diners without comment; the server waits to see if the guest wants to know the ingredients before tasting. Most like to try to decipher what they are eating and hear about it afterward, Mr. Adrià said.

Photo

Some dishes send taste receptors into overdrive, like the squid tartar brushed with a thin layer of coconut oil and a drop of slightly spicy squid ink. Others are gorgeously simple: a Raf tomato cut in half, with one cream made of the red part and another of the green, poured separately into the same bowl.

At the end of evening, about three hours later, guests are suddenly led into a back-room storage area and through a door into a traditional bar for drinks and further tastes. The spell fades slowly.

“I don’t want to bore people or be too pompous,” Mr. Adrià said. “But the worst would be indifference.”

A Times reporter called it “a members-only club for the tanned and surgically enhanced” set. It’s Mar-a-Lago, the 126-room pink castle on Florida’s Gold Coast that is the winter White House for President Donald J. Trump and his new administration.

The White House correspondent Julie Hirschfeld Davis visited Mar-a-Lago for the first time last weekend.

“The press pool doesn’t actually get to enjoy all of the luxuries of Mar-a-Lago,” it doesn’t stay or eat there, says Ms. Davis. But, she (with other members of the media) was on site when President Trump entertained Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and was at their joint news conference called soon after the President learned that North Korea had fired a missile.

In this podcast, Ms. Davis gives listeners a behind-the-scene sense of how a paper’s White House correspondent does her job (or part of it) on a presidential weekend in Palm Beach — and also tells listeners what it means when the White House “lid” comes on, and off.

Ms. Davis says Mar-a-Lago, with its glittery social scene and endless stream of Bentleys and Rolls Royces, is the world that the president understands best and in which he is most comfortable, but is “diametrically different” from the world of official Washington. She says the weekend visit helped her understand why Donald Trump is a “fish out of water” in D.C.

Susan Lehman is host.Things seemed different as recently as December, when the Blackstone Group’s chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, announced the formation of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, whose members would “meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge,” as Mr. Schwarzman put it at the time.

Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included.

Only two people declined, citing time pressures: Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

The final list of 16 included such business luminaries as Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric; Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Bob Iger of Disney; Mary Barra of General Motors; and Virginia Rometty of IBM.

Soon after, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Travis Kalanick of Uber and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo were added, buttressing the group’s expertise in technology and consumer products.

Then Mr. Trump was inaugurated and in short order unleashed his divisive immigration order, leading to chaos at airports and nationwide protests. Exactly one week later, on relatively short notice, he convened the first meeting of the forum, with live television coverage from the State Dining Room of the White House.

Even though nearly every company represented in the forum issued a statement that to varying degrees distanced it from the immigration order or even denounced it, the images of the meeting risked looking like an endorsement of the Trump administration and its policies.

Photo

Images of Mrs. Nooyi, an immigrant born in India (and now a citizen), who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman and within camera range of Mr. Trump, seemed especially incongruous.

And all of this was before the abrupt resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and renewed questions about the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russians.

Mr. Kalanick was the first on the forum to feel the wrath of consumers. Protesters accused Uber of “collaborating” with Mr. Trump and chained themselves to the doors of the company’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Soon after, the hashtag #DeleteUber trended on Twitter. Within four days of the immigration order, 200,000 users had deleted the Uber app, and one of the company’s rivals, Lyft, reported that downloads of its own app had more than doubled.

In an effort to quell the protest, Mr. Kalanick resigned from the forum the day before its first meeting. The “implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are,” he said in a memo to employees.

When I contacted him this week, Mr. Kalanick said: “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.”

Protest flared and a social media boycott campaign took root after the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, joined Mr. Trump’s 28-member Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, announced in January, and then praised the president’s pro-business policies on CNBC.

This week, in an open letter published as an advertisement in The Baltimore Sun (Under Armour’s headquarters is in Baltimore), Mr. Plank said, “I personally believe that immigration is the foundation of our country’s exceptionalism,” and “in a time of division, we aspire to be a force of unity, growth and optimism for our city and our country.” He pledged to oppose “any new actions that negatively impact our team, our neighbors or their families.”

Some Disney employees organized demonstrations in three cities this week, demanding that Mr. Iger resign from the forum, even though he didn’t attend the first meeting because of a conflict with a long-scheduled company board meeting. The demonstrations drew about 120 protesters, the company said.

At the same time, Out & Equal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, praised Mr. Iger’s membership in the forum in a letter to the company, citing his support for workplace equality and ability to influence the president.

Mr. Schwarzman himself received some criticism from a few Schwarzman scholars, who receive support under a program he established for study in China. In a letter to the scholars explaining his role in advising Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote: “In life you’ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice. However, I have always believed one’s obligation is to work for the common good.”

As the Uber experience suggests, the risks of engaging with Mr. Trump are highest for companies with direct exposure to consumers, especially those who can easily switch to a competitor less identified with the Trump brand. General Motors and PepsiCo could face more consumer reaction; the banks and money managers less so; and industrial concerns like General Electric even less.

Photo

At the same time, the benefits of being part of the forum and gaining the ear of the president are obvious: Virtually every Fortune 500 corporation has vitally important interests affected by the federal government, from antitrust, labor and trade policies, to tax reform and bank regulation, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.

Underscoring the value of access, the president singled out Mr. Dimon, whom the Trump campaign had courted as a potential Treasury secretary, saying at the meeting, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie.”

The comment seemed to underscore the degree to which Mr. Trump has turned regulation of Wall Street over to the bankers he railed against during the campaign. (Curiously, given Mr. Trump’s stated hostility to Dodd-Frank, Mr. Dimon is on record as supporting many aspects of the legislation, saying it has made the banking system safer but has also made it more difficult for smaller banks to compete.)

A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.

And refusing Mr. Trump’s invitations risks a presidential Twitter broadside, something that is unprecedented in American political and business history and whose impact is still being assessed. Yahoo Finance last week said it had sifted through more than 34,000 Trump tweets and identified attacks on 62 businesses, including at least two represented in the forum, General Motors and Boeing.

(I asked the White House on Thursday for comment on its interaction with business leaders, but received no response.)

Optics aside, Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said the president’s overtures to executives represented a welcome change from the Obama administration, which largely ignored big business and summoned bankers to Washington to browbeat them publicly over the financial crisis. By comparison, Mr. Trump embraced members of his business forum as “the best and the brightest” and said he welcomed their ideas.

“There’s always the danger that chief executives will be used as photo ops,” Mr. Sonnenfeld acknowledged. But he praised Mr. Trump’s decision “to give chief executives a seat at the table” and said he had talked to at least half of the participants since the meeting. “They’re telling me they found him very receptive to their ideas and willing to listen,” he said. “They’ve said they’re holding each other accountable to be truthful and candid and to raise key issues with him.”

Mr. Sonnenfeld has met with Mr. Trump since the election and offered advice. “He’s very charming and open to new ideas,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “I’ve seen business executives melt in his presence.”

Charles Elson, a professor and expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, also praised the president for reaching out to business leaders. He said he disagreed with Mr. Kalanick’s decision to resign.

“When the president calls, you should go to see him, regardless of your political persuasion, out of respect for the office,” Mr. Elson said. “As a chief executive with a duty to your shareholders, it’s your obligation to do so, like him or not.”

Mr. Schwarzman’s office made a similar point when I inquired this week. “Steve has advised presidents from both parties in the past and feels a duty to help any administration that calls on him if he’s able to do so for the good of the country,” Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman, said.

Still, everyone I spoke to agreed that there were lines they wouldn’t cross. “You don’t have to agree” with the president, Mr. Elson said. “If he asks you to take a political position, you can say no. And if he asks you to endorse something where you have a deep philosophical objection, you shouldn’t do it.”Mr. Yiannopoulos had been scheduled to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month, on an invitation from the school’s College Republicans group. But his talk was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused about $100,000 in damages.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In January, when Mr. Yiannopoulos gave a lecture in Seattle at the University of Washington, a man was shot during protests outside the site of the speech. He spoke in December at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks.

When it was announced on Wednesday that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be interviewed on “Real Time,” another scheduled guest, Jeremy Scahill, a journalist for The Intercept, said in a statement on his Twitter account that he was withdrawing from the show.

“He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,” Mr. Scahill said. “There is no value in ‘debating’ him.”

Mr. Maher followed with his own statement that said, “If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims — and he might be — nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night.”

In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as “the party of Lena Dunham,” the creator and star of “Girls.” (Mr. Maher replied: “Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people.”)

Describing himself as “a virtuous troll,” Mr. Yiannopolous said, “I hurt people for a reason.”

He said people “want to police humor” because “they can’t control it.”

“Because the one thing that authoritarians hate is the sound of laughter,” Mr. Yiannopolous said.

Mr. Maher added, “And also, because when people laugh, they know it’s true.”

Mr. Yiannopolous replied, “Nothing annoys people, or amuses people, like the truth.”

They then discussed an incident from last summer, when Mr. Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of “Ghostbusters” and “Saturday Night Live.”

“I didn’t understand, like, the ‘Ghostbusters’ thing,” Mr. Maher said.

Mr. Yiannopoulos answered: “I wrote a bad review of a movie. Am I not entitled to do that?” After repeating some of the insults he had leveled at Ms. Jones, he said, “I simply don’t accept — I do not accept — that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster, that an A-list, mega-celebrity is crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it.”

“What actually hurts people is, like, murder, violence,” Mr. Yiannopoulos added. “That kind of stuff.”

He added that “mean words” don’t “hurt people.”

Mr. Maher said, “Which some people would say you have incited.”

Mr. Yiannopoulos reacted with surprise. “What? How?” he asked.

“I’m just saying, some people would say,” Mr. Maher answered.

Mr. Yiannopoulos replied, “Well, they would be idiots.”

Speaking to his audience, Mr. Maher said, “Stop taking the bait, liberals,” and asked how they could be afraid of someone he described as “little, British, impish” and a slur for gay people. The two men shook hands, and Mr. Maher moved on to his panel discussion.

But in an online-only segment that ran after the HBO broadcast, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that transgender people were “vastly disproportionately involved in sex crime,” drawing jeers, boos and a shout of “liar” from Mr. Maher’s audience.

Mr. Yiannopoulos also clashed with the comedian Larry Wilmore, another guest on the show.

In remarks to Mr. Yiannopoulos that were bookended by an obscene phrase, Mr. Wilmore took offense at his Twitter trolling of Ms. Jones. “She’s a very thoughtful person and very funny,” he said.

Trying to defuse the tension, Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn’t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. “This is the beginning of your career,” Mr. Maher said. “People are only just starting to hate you.”In a rambling news conference on Thursday, the president said his administration had undertaken “the most substantial border security measures in a generation,” and he said that efforts to find and deport “criminal aliens” would make the United States safer.

“Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised: ‘Oh, he is having strong borders.’ Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.”

But his early efforts to translate all of that talk into action are already running into the reality of governing in Washington, where legal constraints on taking action — and debates about paying for it — are legendary.

Mr. Trump has promised to hire 15,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of a larger deportation force that can remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, something he repeatedly promised to do during the campaign.

But hiring such a large number of agents in a short period of time would be nearly impossible, according to John F. Kelly, the former general whom Mr. Trump chose to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

“I don’t believe we’re going to get 10,000 and 5,000 on board within the next couple of years,” Mr. Kelly told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this month, explaining that stringent hiring standards and training regimens slow down the process.

“I’d rather have fewer and make sure that they’re high-quality people that are already serving in those organizations, already well trained, but I will not skimp on the training and the standards,” Mr. Kelly said.

One of the problems that Mr. Kelly faces is a polygraph test that prospective agents, including those seeking to work for the Border Patrol, must take. According to a former senior homeland security official, nearly 60 percent of applicants fail it.

The test was first put in place after another surge in hiring during the George W. Bush administration. Thousands of people were hired without being properly vetted, which resulted in dozens of corruption cases involving Border Patrol and other agents, who were accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.

The former senior homeland security official, James Tomsheck, who was the assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, office of internal affairs, said in several cases many of the new hires were members of the cartels.

“The corruption and excessive use of force that plague the agency is a direct result of a hiring mandate to hire too many people too rapidly without the proper vetting,” said Mr. Tomsheck, who was removed from his position after, he said, he was accused of being too aggressive in pursuing excessive use-of-force cases.

It is unclear how Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly plan to solve the manpower problem.

One option, swiftly denied on Friday by the White House, was a plan to use as many as 100,000 National Guard troops as part of a nationwide deportation force that would help to augment federal agents and local authorities newly deputized to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

The idea emerged in a draft memorandum, first reported by The Associated Press, which asserted that National Guard troops, under the direction of governors in border states, are “particularly well suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by Department components.”

Gillian M. Christensen, the acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the memorandum was a “very early, pre-decisional draft that never made it to the secretary and was never seriously considered by the department.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Friday morning that the report by The Associated Press was “100 percent not true.”

But advocates for immigrants reacted with alarm.

“The administration wants to put on a show,” said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York. “Their intent is to create fear, to create an environment in which people either self-deport or hide in the shadows.”

The proposal to deploy 100,000 troops would be a stark increase in the size and scope of National Guard involvement in border security, but it is not unprecedented.

Several presidents, including George Bush and Barack Obama, called up thousands of National Guard troops to bolster border patrol operations. While they mostly acted as extra eyes to spot illegal border crossings, at times they carried weapons and assisted in drug arrests.

In 1916, in response to cross-border raids by Mexican bandits and what The New York Times described as a “prairie fire of anti-American sentiment that has been sweeping northern Mexico,” President Woodrow Wilson deployed more than 100,000 guardsmen to the border to reinforce regular Army units.

More recently, in July 2014, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to its border with Mexico in an effort to bolster his border-security credentials as he prepared to start his presidential campaign.

The deployment has been costly, controversial and continues to this day. The troops live in hotels along the border during their deployments, and the estimate of the costs in 2014 were $12 million a month.

Mr. Perry’s efforts coincided with an influx of undocumented Central American immigrants coming across the border, including unaccompanied children and teenagers. Experts expect another surge in arrivals this spring.

In Mr. Trump’s executive order calling for an end to “catch and release,” he also directed Mr. Kelly to do everything possible to “construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.” Immigration experts said that will be costly and take time.

“The bottom line is,” Mr. Appleby said, “they’re doing everything they can legally do until they’re told not to by the courts to expand their capacity to deport as many people as possible.”Finally, a quarter of an hour later, the truck found its way out and the S.U.V. headed uptown.

Over the course of her 15 years in New York, Ms. Brown, who is from Sydney and still speaks with a pronounced Australian accent, has become a prominent figure in the fashion industry, appearing as a judge on Bravo’s “The Fashion Show,” interviewing Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton for Harper’s Bazaar and accumulating 119,000 followers on her Instagram account, where she posts photos with friends like Karolina Kurkova and Christy Turlington.

Yet Ms. Brown insists that when it comes to street style, she is not the one the photographers are after.

“People are always rushing past me to get to Nicky Hilton or something,” she said.

She took a sip of iced coffee, a routine unaffected by the 38-degree weather. “I know it’s weird,” she said. “I don’t mind hot coffee, but this feels like a refreshing beverage.”

So far that morning she had seen The Row (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s collection) and sat in the front row at Carolina Herrera. “I bolted backstage after the show,” she said. “I’m always the first one. Security is like, ‘What are you doing?’ I’m like, ‘I’m a friend! Not going to harm her!’”

Ms. Brown hoped that her day would end by 10 p.m. She goes to certain designers’ dinners during fashion week — Diane von Furstenberg’s, for example — but mostly avoids late-night parties. “I’m a bit of a nana,” she said. “I burn bright and I flame out early.”

Still, she had made time for one big bash the week before: InStyle’s party for its March issue, the first that she had edited from front to back since leaving her post as executive editor of special projects at Harper’s Bazaar in August.

As part of her mission at InStyle, Ms. Brown wants the magazine to become more relatable, and to reflect the hybrid roles of many of today’s celebrities. Hence, the inclusion of contributors like the writer and actress Lena Dunham, the fashion blogger and entrepreneur Leandra Medine, and the actress and model Hari Nef. Hence also, the cover star, Emily Ratajkowski, a model and actress known for her activist side (she campaigned for Bernie Sanders last year).

When the car drew close to the Zimmermann show, Ms. Brown jumped out and jogged-slash-teetered down the remaining block, arriving with minutes to spare. After the show, she dashed off in search of the bathroom.

It took her 15 minutes to get there.

On the way, she chatted with Malcolm Carfrae, former head of communications for Ralph Lauren; congratulated Nicky Zimmermann; and posed for photos with Olivia Culpo, 2012 winner of the Miss USA pageant, and Shay Mitchell, an actress.

Back outside, her hobnobbing duties done, Ms. Brown grabbed Ruthie Friedlander, who runs InStyle’s website, and Sam Broekema, the magazine’s accessories director, and hopped back into her car.

Inside, Mr. Broekema and Ms. Brown flipped through a stack of photos: accessories for the May issue that needed Ms. Brown’s approval.

“It’s the new Panther from Cartier,” Mr. Broekema said in a French accent.

“Can you say ‘Panther’ again?” Ms. Brown said. “The only French I know is ‘I’m tired’ or ‘I need my wine’ French.”

At Rosie Assoulin’s presentation downtown, Ms. Brown and Ms. Assoulin wove between the models, Ms. Brown capturing everything on video. “Can you do the thing where you explain?” she said as Ms. Assoulin pointed out details. “Explain! Explain!”

After checking out every look and greeting Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz, the editor of Vogue Arabia, Ms. Brown huddled with Ms. Medine and Emily Weiss, founder of the Glossier skin care line. She showed them a photo of two of her favorite looks, then posted it to Instagram (caption: “I love you @rosie_assoulin!!!”).

Between shows, Ms. Brown recalled her first fashion weeks, in London in the late 1990s. “I snuck into a couple of McQueen shows, but then I started to get invited,” she said. “I would be in, like, Row J or something.”

It is Row J no more. The last stop before lunch was Proenza Schouler, where Ms. Brown was planted in the front, as she is at every show.

Part of Ms. Brown’s job is to know the right people, the interesting characters, the up-and-comers and the established players. The shows are a chance to pay her respects to the designers she knows and to take a peek at the ones she is curious about. The accumulated knowledge helps her choose looks for shoots and decide which designers to team up with for articles.

It is a lot of socializing, and fashion is full of personalities — and sometimes drama. The secret to Ms. Brown’s success may be how effectively she keeps her head above it. “Go be mad at something else,” she said. “I’m a nice girl and I’m happy to be here.”A 5-year-old Brooklyn boy was viciously mauled at home on Friday evening by one of his family’s two pit bulls, leaving him in critical condition, according to the police and a family member.

The boy was in an apartment in the East New York neighborhood with his father and two younger siblings when the attack happened, the police said. He was initially taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with grave wounds to his head and neck and was later transferred to Long Island Jewish Medical Center.

The boy’s uncle, Mohammed Wilson, said he received a panicked call from his half brother Joel Rivera at 6:46 p.m. “He called me crying and screaming, ‘The dog bit my baby! The dog bit my baby!’” Mr. Wilson said.

Mr. Wilson, 41, said that he sprinted the two blocks to his brother’s apartment and found a terrifying scene. His nephew, Jeremiah Rivera, was lying face down on the floor, with the flesh torn off much of his cheeks and forehead.

“I pray that boy lives, but he won’t have a face anymore,” he said.

The pit bulls were relatively small, according to Mr. Wilson, and had been brought home by Mr. Rivera about two months ago. They were generally kept in a cage and taken out only for walks, he said.

“The dogs are usually so friendly and great with the kids,” Mr. Wilson said, still trembling from the events.

Mr. Wilson added that his half brother tried to be very responsible with the animals. The dogs had recently been vaccinated and registered, he said.

The police cordoned off the block around the modest brick building on Riverdale Avenue where the attack had occurred. The dogs were removed in cages by animal control authorities and taken to their building in Manhattan.

Jeremiah’s younger brother and sister were not seriously wounded, according to Mr. Wilson and the police.

Missie Dunham, 31, said she had often see Mr. Rivera walking around with the three children, playing with them and buying them food.

“I feel for that family,” said Ms. Dunham, an ultrasound technician. “He seemed to really love those kids.”

On Monday, a 75-year-old woman in Queens was killed when her mastiff, one of several dogs she kept in her apartment, bit her torso and arms repeatedly. The mastiff was known around her Long Island City neighborhood as an aggressive animal.Hunched Over a Microscope, He Sketched the Secrets of How the Brain Works

Image

Some microscopes today are so powerful that they can create a picture of the gap between brain cells, which is thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. They can even reveal the tiny sacs carrying even tinier nuggets of information to cross over that gap to form memories. And in colorful snapshots made possible by a giant magnet, we can see the activity of 100 billion brain cells talking.

Decades before these technologies existed, a man hunched over a microscope in Spain at the turn of the 20th century was making prescient hypotheses about how the brain works. At the time, William James was still developing psychology as a science and Sir Charles Scott Sherrington was defining our integrated nervous system.

Meet Santiago Ramón y Cajal, an artist, photographer, doctor, bodybuilder, scientist, chess player and publisher. He was also the father of modern neuroscience.

Image

“He’s one of these guys who was really every bit as influential as Pasteur and Darwin in the 19th century,” said Larry Swanson, a neurobiologist at the University of Southern California who contributed a biographical section to the new book “The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal.” “He’s harder to explain to the general public, which is probably why he’s not as famous.”

Last month, the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis opened a traveling exhibit that is the first dedicated solely to Ramón y Cajal’s work. It will make stops in Minneapolis; Vancouver, British Columbia; New York; Cambridge, Mass.; and Chapel Hill, N.C., through April 2019.

Ramón y Cajal started out with an interest in the visual arts and photography — he even invented a method for making color photos. But his father pushed him into medical school. Without his artistic background, his work might not have had as much impact, Dr. Swanson said.

“It’s fairly rare for a scientist to be a really good artist at the same time, and to illustrate all of their own work, brilliantly,” Dr. Swanson said. “There seems to be a real resurgence of interest between the interaction between science and art, and I think Cajal will be an icon in that field.”

The images in “The Beautiful Brain” illustrate what Ramón y Cajal helped discover about the brain and the nervous system, and why his research had such impact in the field of neuroscience.

Ramón y Cajal wanted to know something no one really understood: How did a neural impulse travel through the brain? But he had to lean on his own observations and reasoning to answer this question.

Image

Ramón y Cajal’s life changed in Madrid in 1887, when another Spanish scientist showed him the Golgi stain, a chemical reaction that colored random brain cells. This method, developed by the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi, made it possible to see the details of a whole neuron without the interference of its neighbors. Ramón y Cajal refined the Golgi stain, and with the details gleaned from even crisper images, revolutionized neuroscience.

In 1906 he and Golgi shared a Nobel Prize. And in the time in between, he wrote his neuron doctrine — the theory of how individual brain cells send and receive information, which became the basis of modern neuroscience.

Image

Ramón y Cajal’s theory described how information flowed through the brain. Neurons were individual units that talked to one another directionally, sending information from long appendages called axons to branchlike dendrites, over the gaps between them.

He couldn’t see these gaps in his microscope, but he called them synapses, and said that if we think, learn and form memories in the brain then that itty-bitty space was most likely the location where we do it. This challenged the belief at the time that information diffused in all directions over a meshwork of neurons.

The theory’s acceptance was made possible by Ramón y Cajal’s refinement of the Golgi stain and his persistence in sharing his ideas with others. In 1889, Ramón y Cajal took his slides to a scientific meeting in Germany. “He sets up a microscope and slide, and pulls over the big scientists of the day, and said, ‘Look here, look what I can see,’” said Janet Dubinsky, a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota. “‘Now do you believe that what I’m saying about neurons being individual cells is true?’”

Albert von Kölliker, an influential German scientist, was amazed and began translating Ramón y Cajal’s work, which was mainly in Spanish, into German. From there the neuron doctrine spread, replacing the prevailing reticular theory. But Ramón y Cajal died before anyone proved it.

Image

Perhaps one of Ramón y Cajal’s most iconic images is this pyramidal neuron in the cerebral cortex, the outside part of the brain that processes our senses, commands motor activity and helps us perform higher brain functions like making decisions. Some of these neurons are so large that you don’t need a microscope to see them, unlike most other brain cells.

Image

Ramón y Cajal studied Purkinje neurons with fervor, illustrating their treelike structure in great detail, like this one from the cerebellum. Axons, such as the one indicated by an “a” in the picture, can travel long distances in the body, some from the spinal cord all the way down to your little toe, said Dr. Dubinsky, who wrote a chapter in “The Beautiful Brain” about contemporary extensions of his work. Ramón y Cajal traced axons as far as he could, she said.

Image

A few of his drawings had features that resembled the work of other artists. In some, Vincent van Gogh appeared influential. In this drawing of the glial cells in the cerebral cortex of a man who suffered from paralysis, the three nuclei (or nucleoli) in the upper left corner resemble Edvard Munch’s “The Scream.”

Image

In addition to showing how information flowed through the brain, Ramón y Cajal showed how it moved through the whole body, allowing humans to do things like vomit and cough. When we vomit, a signal is sent from the irritated stomach to the vagus nerve in the brain and then to the spinal cord, which excites neurons that make us contract our stomach and heave. Similarly, a tickle in the back of your throat can make you cough: The larynx sends a signal to the vagus nerve, then the brainstem and the spinal cord, where neurons signal the muscles in our chest and abdomen to contract. Ahem.

Image

This image is a reconstruction of a dendrite (red) and its axons (multicolored) in the outer part of a mouse’s brain. The dendrite has little knobby spines that stick out and receive chemical messages passed from another neuron’s axon across the synapse, or gap between them, via the tiny white sacs called vesicles. Today we know that synapses are plastic, meaning they can get stronger or weaker with use or neglect. This enables us to think and learn.

This is what Ramón y Cajal described in his neuron doctrine.

“People regularly begin seminars with pictures of the drawings that Cajal made because what they’ve added fits right in with where Cajal thought it should be,” Dr. Dubinsky said. “What he did is still relevant today.”

When the chef Meriko Gubeladze opened Shavi Lomi, she recalled that Tbilisi was “starving for small, homey restaurants with good food.” That was 2011, and the quality of Georgian cuisine — known for its lavish use of spices and aromatic herbs influenced by travelers along the Silk Road — wasn’t the problem, but the uninviting establishments and menu selections — hangovers from the cookie-cutter days of the Soviet era — were. Artery-clogging khachapuri, the cheesy bread often likened to pizza, still tempted. But at every meal? How often could a person eat walnut-paste-stuffed vegetables and a lamb stew called chakapuli, a favorite dish of Stalin. Four years after Shavi Lomi updated these seasonal family recipes, serving them in a cozy atmosphere, other restaurants soon followed suit.

Photo

Tbilisi today has a reimagined dining scene. Instead of the same standard-issue 10 dishes, post-Soviet restaurants are bringing a humble magic to dining in Georgia’s capital city, with a focus on all things organic.

If sumptuous flavors and a living-room-like setting with bright carpets and heirloom batik tablecloths were Shavi Lomi’s contributions, promoting organic food and natural wine was the province of Vino Underground, a popular natural-wine bar and salon just around the corner.

Photo

Between those two pioneering forces, a peaceful culinary revolution began. More than a half-dozen homey restaurants have opened with prideful Georgian menus proclaiming organic status for both food and wine. With the current exchange rate, the experience is not only exciting, but also often a bargain.

This culinary fever also has spread from the traditional tourist area, the sandstone crumbling Old City, to Tbilisi’s more contemporary quarters across the Kura River. Now bargain hunters heading to the Dry Bridge Market, an enclave to buy drinking horns and Soviet memorabilia, can reward their appetite without compromise. Shavi Lomi has relocated there. Another hot spot is Barbarestan, housed in an old butcher shop with meat hooks still visible and caged singing canaries. Family-owned, the restaurant drew its menu from Georgia’s beloved 19th-century cookbook by Barbare Jorjadze, who celebrated the Silk Road influence of her country’s cuisine. While her cookbook remains a strong influence on other local dining spots too, Barbarestan’s fare shows fealty in all details. Ghee, clarified butter, is used exclusively. The nadugi — a typical fresh cheese spread and stuffing — gets a vegan spin when substituting Ms. Jorjadze’s recipe for pumpkinseed milk.

Photo

But the culinary action has especially taken hold in the heart of the Old City. There, behind the gilded and imposing St. George statue in Freedom Square, three restaurants have opened. Strolling the quiet streets, this visitor was pleasantly surprised to come across Ezo, tucked in a residential courtyard. Ezo, its name meaning yard, opened two years ago, and while it’s rustic, don’t be fooled. One can feast like the 12th-century Queen Tamara there for $25 per person. Many of the flavorful organic ingredients are from the owners’ farm.

Proletariat options like the salt-cured jonjoli (bladdernut flowers), staples on any Georgian table, get an unusual twist with familiar walnut garlic sauce. Tender veal in herbs is a customer magnet. Wash it down with glugs of family chacha (grappa) for an authentic accent. Walk another few minutes, on uneven cobblestones and broken sidewalks, past unmarked boutiques and fruit stalls that never seem to shut, and you will find the more upscale Azarphesha, now four years old. With walls of museum-worthy displays showcasing ancient drinking vessels, the restaurant remains of the moment. Yet with its mix of traditional tablecloths and fresh wild posies, the room couldn’t feel less pretentious, especially when a table spontaneously burst out in the traditional, emotional polyphonic village songs, as often happens.

Photo

Husband and wife Nino and Luarsab Togonidze joined with a friend, the American expatriate painter and winemaker John Wurdeman, and fashioned a fascinating Georgian fusion menu. Their riff on the country’s strong pickle culture is emblematic; take the kimchee-like banana peppers with local-toasted sunflower-seed oil. Even with its hints of Peru or Mexico, it tastes of home. From its geek-worthy wine list, all organic and natural, to its foraged juniper gins, the philosophy is uncompromising.

In December, the three opened a new restaurant, Poliphonia, considered one of the best eating spots in town.

Reflecting on the city’s restaurant renaissance, Mr. Togonidze said the country’s recent political calm was only part of the story: “Compounded with a new generation who have grown up in freedom with the excitement about natural wine, how could that energy not spill over to the table?” he said. “After all, in Georgia, wine and food have always been intertwined.”How the Nuclear Threat From North Korea Has Grown

When North Korea tested a missile that fell harmlessly into the sea this month, it was more than just an attempt by its 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un, to jolt a new American president. Arms experts observed something new: solid-fuel technology that makes such missiles easier to hide and launch quickly. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has progressed in four areas that bear watching: arsenal size, bomb strength, missile technology and ability to elude detection.

Arsenal size: small, but thought to be growing

Knowledge of the weapons stockpile is based on estimates. Experts say that North Korea has fewer than 10 nuclear weapons. Satellite imagery of North Korea’s nuclear complex in Yongbyon, combined with official North Korean propaganda photos and recent nuclear tests, suggests that the country could rapidly expand its arsenal. By one estimate, the country now has enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to build 20 to 25 nuclear weapons.

Image

Explosive power: from one kiloton to 10 kilotons in 10 years

The explosive force of North Korea’s first nuclear device, tested in October 2006, was less than a kiloton, which is 1,000 tons of TNT. Its second test, in 2008, had more than double that force.

By January 2016, the country claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb in a fourth test, but outside monitors expressed skepticism. Seismic readings suggested an explosive force of four to six kilotons.

Seismic readings of North Korea’s fifth test, in September 2016, however, registered a force of approximately 10 kilotons, according to South Korea’s Defense Ministry.

Technology: missiles could reach continental U.S. by 2026

In 1999, George J. Tenet, then director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said he could hardly overstate his concern about North Korea’s program, warning that the Taepodong-1 missile, with a reach of up to 1,243 miles, could deliver bomb payloads to Alaska and Hawaii.

In the nearly two decades since, the country’s investment in becoming a nuclear weapons power has succeeded despite diplomacy and international sanctions. In 2016, Mr. Kim launched dozens of missiles for tests and as shows of military might. Some missiles could be launched from mobile pads and submarines, making them easier to hide. They could potentially carry nuclear warheads, according to Siegfried S. Hecker, emeritus director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, birthplace of the atomic bomb.

He and other analysts have said they assume North Korea has designed and demonstrated nuclear warheads that can be mounted on short-range and perhaps medium-range missiles. Writing in September 2016, Dr. Hecker said, “Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or so.”

Covert capability: smaller, more mobile weapons



When he became North Korea’s top leader in April 2012, Mr. Kim said that his “first, second and third” priorities were to strengthen the military, and he declared that superiority in military technology was “no longer monopolized by imperialists.” Less than three years later, Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, then commander of United States forces in South Korea, said he believed that North Korea had made a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a missile.

In May 2015, Mr. Kim said North Korea had the ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons. That claim was greeted with skepticism by analysts, but in March 2016 Mr. Kim was photographed admiring what state media described as a home-built warhead. In August 2016 North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine, demonstrating a significant improvement in its ability to strike enemies stealthily.

The missile test this month, analysts said, further proved that North Korea was committed to producing more lethal systems that could be deployed quickly. “The North Koreans are sincerely paranoid,” said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute’s James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. “They’re increasingly very blunt about how they would use these things preemptively.”Photo

For many years now, successive American administrations have made no secret of their frustration with how little most NATO allies spend on their militaries, leaving the United States with a disproportionately large share of the bill for the joint defense. Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense, recently expressed much the same frustration in remarks delivered in Brussels. It’s a message the other 27 members of the alliance should pay careful attention to. But Mr. Mattis went further, warning that unless the allies paid up, America might reduce its commitment. This part of his speech — in which he echoed his boss, President Trump — sent the wrong message at the wrong time.

These are fraught times for the Western alliance, which even after the Cold War remains a critical unifying bond among the democracies of North America and Europe, and whose members have worked together to confront terrorism in Afghanistan and promote stability in several Middle Eastern countries. Mr. Trump has called NATO “obsolete” for not confronting terrorism and has also suggested that the United States might not come to the support of NATO members that have not met their financial obligations. And now his defense secretary seems to be saying the same thing.

This is disheartening. Putting conditions on American support for an ally under attack is an abject departure from the core commitment of all NATO allies to come to the assistance of any member facing armed aggression. It is egregious at a time when the alliance is again facing an assertive and aggressive Russia, and especially worrisome given the questions over Mr. Trump’s possible links to Moscow. And it is surprising coming from Mr. Mattis, a former Marine Corps general who held high military commands in the United States and in NATO and who has a far clearer notion than his boss of the importance and role of NATO. Mr. Mattis had argued forcefully in his confirmation hearings and in Brussels that the alliance is essential to American security and that Washington has not changed its attitude toward Russia.

Of course unity also means sharing the burden. Some time ago the allies agreed that this means each member should spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on the military. The United States currently spends 3.61 percent, or $664 billion last year, although that figure includes American commitments in Asia and elsewhere. The only NATO members that meet the 2 percent benchmark are Britain, Poland, Estonia and Greece. Germany, by contrast, spends 1.1 percent; France 1.7 percent; and others even less. The laggards could at least meet their minimum obligations, and others could do more.

But unity also means a shared sense of purpose aimed at a common defense. Washington needs to do a lot more to convince NATO allies, especially those on Russia’s periphery, that America has their back. Perhaps by the time Mr. Trump visits NATO in May he will have it right, and the alliance will once again present a unified front to Vladimir Putin and Islamist radicals.Ms. Krauss is a connoisseur of songs, not a songwriter, and her enchantment with the compositions she has culled ordinarily sets the tone of her self-produced albums. This time, though, she chose to pursue a partnership that could yield a particular vibe. She lent her voice to a wistful duet version of “Make the World Go Away” on Jamey Johnson’s 2012 collection of classic Hank Cochran country songs, and the elegant shuffle echoed easeful studio performances of the Nashville Sound era. She zeroed in on the project’s seasoned producer, Buddy Cannon, who had a low-key way of drawing her out at the microphone.

“When I sang for him,” she said, “I noticed that there was such a desire to perform for him, and that doesn’t always come so much. Usually you’re kind of searching your own navel all the time for your inspiration.”

When Ms. Krauss and Mr. Cannon began sifting through potential songs on his office computer, she stipulated that they steer clear of go-to country standards. “I’m just one big B-side,” she quipped, referring to songs that take a back seat to the more popular tracks on records. Drawing heavily from the ’50s and ’60s catalogs of country and bluegrass stylists like Willie Nelson, Mac Wiseman, Brenda Lee, Glen Campbell and Eddy Arnold, Ms. Krauss and Mr. Cannon rounded out their selections with a couple of songs that were actually from her lifetime, one of which, “Dream of Me,” she recalled hearing at a bluegrass festival in her youth but didn’t realize that Mr. Cannon had written.

In language and chord structure, the vintage selections seem simple next to the bulk of Ms. Krauss’s repertoire. “There’s a certain feeling, a mystery about songs that are older than you, and I love that,” Ms. Krauss said. The sentiment isn’t confined to music; her two-story house, built in 1918, is full of antiques. To protect an old table from drink rings, she wryly offered her closed laptop: “Go ahead and use this coaster.”

The recording process began smoothly enough: “I just get great players in there and sit back and listen to what they do,” Mr. Cannon said. Ms. Krauss requested horns like those that Merle Haggard sometimes used, and for once, her fiddle fills are dwarfed by the frequent, pillowy flourishes of a string section.

The trouble arose when it came time to record Ms. Krauss’s vocals. “One day she’d come in to sing, and if she wasn’t hearing it the way she wanted to hear it, she’d say, ‘Today’s not the day,’” Mr. Cannon recalled. “We went in a lot of days and worked for 30 minutes and knocked off because she just said, ‘I don’t have it today.’ To me, she sounded wonderful. I mean, on her worst days, she sounds better than everybody.”

Ms. Krauss explained the recurring vocal issue was “a stress reaction”: “Your voice box just kind of, brrp, just closes up. It tightens up, and you have to loosen it up.” She turned to physical therapy, then visited the noted voice coach Ron Browning, who suggested she “stop striving and just be.” “I felt like I was 17 again,” she marveled. “It was amazing! I’ve given people lessons with him as gifts.”

As a young singer, Ms. Krauss tended to use the full force of her rarefied instrument, but by the time she scored a mid-90s country breakthrough with “When You Say Nothing at All,” she was artfully recalibrating her approach, softening her attack, applying beguiling, breathy shading. “I was talking to Jerry Douglas about this,” she said, referring to the Dobro player in Union Station, “and we were like, ‘Remember when you first started playing, and it was so much fun, and you didn’t think about anything, and you just did what you did? And then you got really wrapped up in watching what you would do to refine what you do?’”

She summarized, “I think you go from being mindless to being self-conscious, and then you want to end up being mindless again.”

Along the way, Ms. Krauss came to embody a particular feminine vocal archetype. “There’s something about how clear her tone is and how much control she has and restraint she uses,” said the country-pop singer-songwriter Cam. “She can sing bluegrass, Americana, country, across all those genres, and she can reach so many people that don’t even listen to those genres normally.”

The eight million or so who bought the T Bone Burnett-produced soundtrack to “O Brother, Where Art Thou” heard Ms. Krauss sing the folk hymn “Down to the River to Pray” a cappella, with impossibly delicate vibrato; one could imagine her floating above the fleshly realm, an otherworldly vessel for earthy music. People invariably describe her as an “angel,” a word that has no room for the sort of cheeky, blues-tinged note bending she does at times on this album.

“Well, obviously, they don’t know me,” she said, swiftly brushing the perception aside. “But what a compliment.”

Contradictions are at the heart of Ms. Krauss’s sensibilities: the juxtaposition of the exquisiteness of her singing and the brawniness of the male vocal partners she chooses (in this case, Mr. Johnson, Hank Williams Jr. and others); contrasts between notions of naturalness and refinement; the tension between mastering a well-mapped musical lineage and embracing a broad-minded, pop-attuned versatility.

On the title track of the new album, Ms. Krauss displays an empathetic grasp of a longstanding country theme: anxiety about how exposure to cosmopolitanism can change a person. “He came to you, big city, from our little country town,” she frets, “and every step he takes with you is down/You’re as cold and heartless as the chilling winds that blow/Before you freeze his heart, please let him go.”

Her reading of “River in the Rain,” from Roger Miller’s Huckleberry Finn-inspired musical “Big River,” conveys melancholy admiration of forceful, unfettered freedom. She accentuates the inner dialogue of “You Don’t Know Me,” her singing burdened with quiet resignation to keep hidden romantic desires hidden. Hinting at feelings just beneath the surface is a Krauss specialty, and such “one-sided conversations” are her “favorite subject.” “A lot of times, women, their strength has been judged by their ability to hide emotion,” she mused.

Ms. Krauss will go only so far in analyzing her gifts and inclinations before retreating to modesty or comic relief. Asked how conscious she is of her image, she offered a goofy anecdote: Many years ago, when she was just beginning to be recognized in public, she wanted so badly to go for a swim on tour that she bought a maternity swimsuit at a garage sale, despite not being pregnant, and was, of course, spotted wearing the ill-fitting thing.

“That’s the only kind of awareness — like, ‘Oh man, I wish I would have cleaned up,’” she said, sounding far more amused than embarrassed. “But really, otherwise, you’re just doing your gig.”“No one at the time thought of the consequences of increased nitrogen dioxide emissions from diesel, and the policy of incentivizing diesel was so successful that an awful lot of people bought diesel cars,” said Anna Heslop, a lawyer at ClientEarth, an environmental law firm that last year forced the British government to produce a better plan to improve air quality.

Air pollution is a more significant public health hazard in China, India and Eastern Europe, where the average annual levels of PM2.5 pollution, the fine soot particles and molecules that pose the greatest danger to health, are up to 10 times as high as in London.

But in mid-January in Brixton, the area in south London where Ms. Carey lives, hourly mean levels of PM2.5 were higher than in Beijing. And over just five days in January, Brixton exceeded the European Union’s nitrogen dioxide legal limit for the entire year.

London last month was put on a “very high” pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold air and a stationary weather pattern failed to clear the toxic air caused by diesel traffic, as well as by the high use of open fires, which contribute to about 10 percent of pollutants in winter months.

“The time will come when we’ll start wearing masks like in China,” Ray Hussain, 73, said as he waited for his bus on Brixton Road one recent morning. At nearly any point during the rush, 16 double-decker buses lined the road. Traffic was snarled, and whiffs of acrid air stung the eyes.

Mr. Hussain checked Airvisual, an air pollution tracking app on his smartphone. Brixton’s air quality that day was called “Good,” in green lettering. Just below, Hyderabad, a city in India, had a red “Unhealthy” label and a picture of a person wearing a face mask.

The local authorities are scrambling to defuse what many consider a ticking time bomb for public health.

Some schools are considering handing out gas masks to pupils, saying children’s lungs are in danger of being stunted. More than 440 schools are in areas exceeding legal air quality levels, according to Mayor Sadiq Khan of London.

Earlier this month, London’s Metropolitan Police announced a plan to introduce about 300 environmentally friendly cars, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hybrid electric cars, as part of a fleet overhaul.

On Friday, Mr. Khan, who has adult-onset asthma, announced that in October he would introduce in central London a toxicity charge, a $12-a-day tax for the most polluting vehicles, typically diesel- and gasoline-powered automobiles registered before 2006.Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, chose to make the statement as an update to his original founder’s letter, which was published in 2012 when Facebook went public. In that letter, he wrote that the social network “was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In an interview this week at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, “the idea of connecting the world was not controversial.”

“The default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction,” he said. “Now, that’s actually a real question.”

Mr. Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains — making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order.

Against that backdrop, the timing of the letter is notable. While other technology executives, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, regularly update their founder letters each year — often tied to financial results — it is the first time Mr. Zuckerberg has refreshed Facebook’s mission statement since the company’s initial public offering.

Mr. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year’s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together.

“We have to build a global community that works for everyone,” he said. “I really don’t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term.”

Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. His letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of “social infrastructure” and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals.

One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this “social infrastructure” — essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests — mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said.

While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook’s finances.

Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, becoming one of the world’s biggest and most valuable public entities.

Yet the power that Facebook has amassed has raised hackles globally. The social network is blocked in China, has stumbled in India and is facing a thicket of regulatory questions in Europe. More recently, Mr. Trump’s election prompted an outcry over whether Facebook influenced the American electorate with false stories on its site. The company has scrambled to contain the fallout, undertaking several experiments to better sort through what people see on its site.

A key moment for Mr. Zuckerberg’s shift in thinking about how to be a global company happened six months ago. In September, Facebook censored an iconic photograph that featured a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Mr. Zuckerberg said the image, titled “The Terror of War,” was rightly censored by Facebook at the time because the company’s content policies did not allow child nudity.

Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value.

Mr. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook’s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company’s blanket global approach of the past decade or more.

“I don’t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “At some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves.”

Mr. Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to “very meaningful groups” — Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to — that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said.

To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook’s “safety check,” a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year.

Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook’s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook’s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying the social network is “not just technology or media.”

Facebook’s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger.

It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people, which in turn may increase the company’s profits.

“There’s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “I just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this.”Last month, The Times published an article explaining why presidents have far less power over the U.S. economy than many people might think.

Yet, since election day, the S.&.P. 500 index is up more than 9 percent — and stocks are on their longest winning streak since September 2013.

The market’s successes have led many to believe that, despite the uncertainty he brings to the political arena, President Trump will be good for business.

Will President Trump be good or bad for business?But that could be changing. This year, for the first time, the institute will give its coveted highest safety rating, known as Top Safety Pick Plus, only to vehicles whose headlights receive a minimum “adequate” score.

The new focus on lights will most likely push automakers to ensure that their lamps not only shine brightly, but also do so far enough down the road. Already, BMW stopped offering the poorly rated halogen lamps on its 3 Series sedans; as a result, the car was designated a Top Safety Pick Plus.

“Headlamps have not been viewed as the safety component that they should be,” said Jennifer Stockburger, the director of operations for the auto test center for Consumer Reports, which also examines headlight quality.

The insurance institute first started testing headlights in 2016 to see how well lamps that swiveled around bends, known as curve-adaptive headlamps, would perform. It found that property damage liability claim rates fell 9 percent for those cars that had curve-adaptive headlamps.

Working with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Consumers Union, the institute then developed headlamp performance standards. It designated how far both low and high beams should reach around curves and in a straightaway without providing glare.

To be rated acceptable, the second-highest rating, high-beam headlights have to shine at least 492 feet down the road, and 328 feet down the right side of the road on low settings.

By law, headlamps today can be of any shape, as long as the light output meets specifications set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Headlamps must also adequately avoid glare, or dazzle as it is known in Europe, for oncoming vehicles and pedestrians.

As a result, vehicle manufacturers generally put a lot of effort into making their headlights stand out as part of a vehicle’s design statement, creating lights that swoop, are flush to the body, or are angled in a way that reflects the vehicle’s sheet metal.

But minimum illumination distance is not mandated, and manufacturers self-certify that their lamps meet the light output criteria.

And once on the road, a variety of factors — including lamps that weren’t aimed properly at the factory or even springs that haven’t settled into place yet — can sharply reduce the ability of a headlamp to shine down the road or light up the important places.

Newer technologies, such as xenon and LED lamps, project light that is brighter and whiter than what traditional incandescent bulbs cast, giving the illusion that they are better. But if they’re incorrectly aimed, they can actually perform worse than older halogen systems, Mr. Lund of the insurance institute said.

When testing headlights, Consumer Reports aims the headlamp according to government specifications. The insurance institute tests lamps as they arrive on the vehicle from the manufacturer. The group says that method gives the consumer a better sense of real-world performance.

Regardless of approach, both groups have found vehicle makers to be responsive to their criticisms.

“The manufacturers are absolutely interested in our results,” said Ms. Stockburger of Consumer Reports. “They’ve changed the performance of their headlamps and improved them over the years that we’ve been testing.”

The insurance institute found a similar reaction.

The headlamp performance of BMW’s 2 Series xenon lamps went from “marginal” to “good,” simply by re-aiming the lamps.

Fiat Chrysler moved to LED lamps for all but the base model of the Jeep Wrangler, and now offers xenon lamps as an option on the Jeep Renegade.

And even better lighting systems could be coming soon.

One new system, generically known as adaptive driving beams, illuminates the road using around 50 to 100 distinct LEDs or, as in the case of BMW, a lamp that changes angles. The goal is to get the reach of high beams without throwing glare.

When onboard cameras sense oncoming vehicles or pedestrians, the lights can adjust automatically, either by dimming individual LEDs in the lamp or moving the light down and to the side, in essence providing always-on high beams without shining the beam into the eyes of other drivers.

Adaptive driving beam headlamps are available from several manufacturers, like Audi, the Opel division of General Motors and Mercedes-Benz in Europe, but they’re not yet legal in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that can change the rules, is now weighing recommendations to make those lights legal.

“We’re very excited about adaptive driving beams,” said David Hines, director of the agency’s office of crash avoidance standards. He would not predict when the standard would be approved, however.

Further into the future are pixel beam headlamps, essentially matrix beam headlamps on steroids. They will use more than a thousand individually controlled LEDs that turn on and off to light or mask small oncoming objects.

Developed by Osram and other lighting manufacturers, pixel beams will be able to shut light off to objects as small as a driver’s face, or a rearview mirror, said Bart Terburg, Osram’s automotive regulations manager. These new systems will start appearing on cars in about four years, he said.

The federal government will also soon join the insurance institute and Consumer Reports in providing headlamp ratings for prospective buyers, much as it now reports on crash-worthiness and fuel economy. It hopes that such data will appear beginning with model-year 2019 vehicles. Such ratings could also increase pressure on automakers to do a better job with lighting.

“We want to help illuminate the road,” Mr. Lund of the insurance institute said, “not just make cars prettier.”While the total amount of annual savings of roughly $2.5 billion would be comparatively small, administration officials want to highlight the agencies in their coming budget proposal as examples of misuse of taxpayer dollars. An internal memo circulated within the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday, and obtained by The New York Times, notes that the list could change. Proposals for more extensive cuts in cabinet-level agencies are expected to follow.

During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised large but unspecified cuts to rein in the deficit, even as he promised to protect programs for his working-class voters and to drastically expand spending on the military, roads, bridges and airports. While the memo in no way resolves that contradiction, it suggests that he could lean toward a small-government philosophy that conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney have fiercely advocated.

The Office of Management and Budget is currently operating with a skeleton staff; Mr. Mulvaney was only confirmed on Thursday. Still, officials there plan to ask agencies targeted for elimination for their responses by next Friday and to finalize the list by March 13, according to a person familiar with the process.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed cuts. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this month that the administration would release a detailed budget in the next few weeks. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has spoken about government spending only in general terms.

“A balanced budget is fine,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. “But sometimes you have to fuel the well in order to really get the economy going.”

He added: “I want a balanced budget eventually. But I want to have a strong military.”

The president’s hope to increase military spending, shared by many Republicans, will probably be at the center of the looming budget battle in Congress. Funding for the current fiscal year is set to expire on April 28. The administration is expected to make a supplemental request before then for money to go to the military — and possibly a wall on the Mexican border.

But under the Budget Control Act of 2011, spending on defense and domestic programs is capped. Democrats will demand that any lifting of those caps for the military be matched by a higher ceiling for domestic programs, setting the stage for a legislative logjam or a showdown over whether to preserve the parliamentary stalling tactic known as the Senate filibuster.

Steve Bell, a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the programs identified in the memo are standard targets for Republican budget-cutters but of little significance in the government’s financial picture.

“It’s sad in a way because those programs aren’t causing the deficit,” Mr. Bell said. “These programs don’t amount to a hill of beans.”

One surprise for some close watchers of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is the inclusion of the Export-Import Bank on the O.M.B.’s list. Other Republican candidates had promised to eliminate the bank, a favorite target of House conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney. Conservatives, led by the billionaire Koch brothers, have run a multimillion-dollar campaign to kill the bank, which guarantees loans for overseas customers of American corporations, by denouncing it as “crony capitalism.”

But Mr. Trump was more circumspect during the campaign, saying he favored programs to promote American exports. The biggest recipient of the bank’s assistance — and its biggest booster — is the aerospace giant Boeing, which President Trump visited on Friday and lavishly praised.

But the president has stacked his White House with budget hawks. Stephen Miller, one of Mr. Trump’s most senior advisers, was a top aide to Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general and spent much of his Senate career trying to rein in government spending.

For director of budget policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council, Mr. Trump chose Paul Winfree, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. In its own proposed budget blueprint, the Heritage Foundation recommended eliminating virtually the same programs listed in the Office of Management and Budget memo, along with a long list of others.

Many of those programs have been attacked by conservatives since the Republican “revolution” of 1994. Led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, the House of Representatives at the time repeatedly went after funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose supporters dragged Big Bird and Kermit the Frog to Capitol Hill to make their case.

The Appalachian Regional Commission, a Depression-era independent agency aimed at developing some of the poorest parts of the country, has also been a target.

These agencies have managed to survive partly because of powerful patrons in the Senate, including the late Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. Even now, with 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats have considerable leverage to save popular programs.

Backers of the National Endowment for the Arts are likely to put up a particularly vigorous fight.

“The public wants to see agencies like the N.E.A. continue,” said Robert L. Lynch, head of Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit organization. “There is always a debate, but there has been agreement among Republicans and Democrats that funding for the arts is a good thing, and it has been kept in place.”

Other agencies on the budget office’s list of cuts include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Corporation for National and Community Service, which finances programs run by AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps. The memo also proposed reducing funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development.

Stephen Moore, another Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign, acknowledged that powerful constituencies were behind many of the programs that are on the chopping block. But he said now that Republicans are finally in control of the government, they must make a valiant effort to fulfill the promises they have been making to voters for years.

“I think it’s an important endeavor to try to get rid of things that are unnecessary,” Mr. Moore said. “The American public has a lot of contempt for how government is run in Washington, in no small part because there is so much waste.”The Playlist: Selena Gomez Chides an Ex, and Remy Ma Stomps on a Foe

Kygo feat. Selena Gomez, ‘It Ain’t Me’

Don’t be deceived by the modest, folky guitar picking that opens this regretful but righteous kiss-off. The crescendo and dance-floor thump arrive soon, as Selena Gomez chides an ex who was drinking and partying too often (insert tabloid speculation here). “Who’s waking up to drive you home/when you’re drunk and all alone?” she sings, with choir-like reinforcements. “It ain’t me.” Kygo’s production isn’t overbearing; sometimes a fingersnap is louder than the kick drum. Nor is it repetitive. Guitars and pianos swirl in and out, and Ms. Gomez’s vocals are chopped up to join the percussion, flinging well-chosen syllables — a recurring “whiskey neat” — at the offending ex. JON PARELES

Fat Joe and Remy Ma feat. Kent Jones, ‘Swear to God’

In a post ricocheting around Twitter yesterday, @DashRomero put up four closed-captioned stills of a video interview given by the rapper couple Papoose and Remy Ma. Papoose is talking about first impressions: “She was like rude to everybody in the room. And I was like oh, I really like her.”

This pugnacity was key to Remy Ma’s appeal as a member of the Terror Squad (see her star turn on the remix of M.O.P.’s “Ante Up”) up until her arrest in 2007 on assault and weapons charges, and her subsequent prison term, which ended in 2014.

Thanks to “All the Way Up,” her hit with former Terror Squad macher Fat Joe, Remy Ma is more in the spotlight than ever. The two have just released a solid collaborative album, “Plata o Plomo,” on which she handily out-raps her partner on every track, and on “Dreamin,” the album finale, she talks about how prison didn’t calm her down, it made her more aggressive. That she still packs punch is clearest on “Swear to God,” one sock to the jaw after another, but with whimsical wordplay that shows off just how light her heavy burdens are:

Say something, said something or mentioned my name, ho

Put a bullet in the brain of the mane on your Polo

You could get this work for free, it’s pro bono

I put funds on your bundles, mad dough on your Afro

Guap on your top, green on your bean

Dubs on your mug, a new bag on your do-rag

Romeo Santos, ‘Héroe Favorito’

The new Romeo Santos single is bachata in its most schlocky, high-gloss form, with fits of smooth jazz mixed in for bad measure, not that it matters. His voice is as piercing as ever, with vowels fired off like tiny firecrackers. It’s sweet enough to render a song about all the superheroes you wish you could become to win over the woman you crave something more than a gimmick. Mr. Santos is also at the absurdist stage of his celebrity, when all that is left is to turn a song about wishing one were a superhero in the eyes of the woman you crave into a video in which you become a superhero — several different ones, as a matter of fact — with the power to sweep your intended off her feet, and also crawl down the outside of her building to grab a kiss. J.C.

Mary. J. Blige, ‘U + Me (Love Lesson)’

There’s blame for everyone in “U + Me (Love Lesson),” Mary J. Blige’s latest exercise in surviving love gone wrong. “Must have been crazy to think that you loved me/I saw all the signs,” she declares. In lines that tumble out so quickly they sometimes overlap, she calls out her own self-deceptions and fears of being alone as well as her ex’s lies and obliviousness. The beat is slow but the arrangement builds nervous energy with quick percussion, insistent strings and backing voices appearing from all directions. Ms. Blige, of course, will get through: “Gotta keep on pushing/And love myself through the hard times,” she resolves. J.P.

Blac Youngsta feat. Lil Yachty, ‘Hip Hopper’

For a long time, proclaiming “I’m not a rapper” was one of the most effective rap boasts possible. It implied that rapping was art, a day job, an inconvenience — the real money was being made elsewhere. The recent generation-and-age-gap Cold War essentially boils down to those who wish their rappers identified as such vs. rappers who feel no need to do so. This track by Blac Youngsta and the bête noire of traditionalists, Lil Yachty, is comic and relentless. Both are rapping well, but neither dwells on it, especially Blac Youngsta, owner of one of the most free-spirited social media presences in hip-hop who raps like he might bust out giggling at any moment. J.C.

Linkin Park feat. Kiiara, ‘Heavy’

This is an Owl City song. C’mon, Linkin Park. Circa 2000 Linkin Park would stuff this song in a locker — and circa 2000 Linkin Park was already stuffed in the locker. J.C.

Oumou Sangare, ‘Yere Faga’

Oumou Sangare emerged as a force in traditional-style Malian music, bringing the style of her home region, Wassoulou, to national and then international renown. She also took on the age-old role of the West African singer as a societal memory conscience, offering virtuous advice. Then she started collaborating with musicians worldwide, transporting the sound of Wassoulou along multiple avenues of funk. “Yere Faga” gently but urgently counsels against suicide using a groove from the great Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, in an ancient-future mix: traditional balafons (marimbas), hearty call-and-response vocals and clouds of sustained female voices, deep bass lines and jabs of guitar noise, making the song at once rooted and unearthly. J.P.

Thundercat, ‘Friend Zone’

Funk redeems frustration in “Friend Zone,” a droll complaint from a guy who’d rather play Mortal Kombat than field another Platonic heart-to-heart late-night phone call from his unrequited crush. “The next time you call me I’m gonna sit and stare at the screen/Waiting for the call to end.” A squishy P-Funk groove, electropop arpeggios, slippery polytonal harmonies and vocals in an aggrieved-nerd falsetto add up to a song that’s funny with a grudge. J.P.

Omar Sosa and Seckou Keita, ‘Dary’

This crystalline, shimmering instrumental, at once animated and serene, comes from an international coalition: the Cuban pianist Omar Sosa, the Senegalese kora player Seckou Keita and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. (“Transparent Water,” the album it comes from, will be released next week; it also includes guests from China and Japan.) The harmonies are soothing, consonant major chords; Mr. Sosa and Mr. Keita take turns offering patterns to underpin one another’s solos. And Mr. Ovalles, on a sensitively changing series of instruments, pinpoints every shift of syncopation as the three players move through kaleidoscopic permutations of what a six-beat rhythm can do. J.P.

Dawes, ‘Roll With the Punches’

The patiently chugging roots-rock of “Roll With the Punches” is the sound of sorrow turning to numb pragmatism. It’s a song about coping with both the material and emotional aftermath of a breakup. Taylor Goldsmith, Dawes’ songwriter and singer, deploys vocabulary with precision, building verses around “symmetrical,” “collateral,” “negotiable” and other four-syllable words. “The separation was logistical/deciding what belongs to whom/how dying love manifests in a rug or a chest/the decorations of a room,” Taylor Goldsmith sings. The video has a rueful, Solomonic conceit: the way that many objects, divided precisely in half, become useless. J.P.UNF News is not a television network or a radio network, for that matter. UNF, or Universal News Forever, is the baby, identity, passion and obsession of Kyle Mazza, 19, who posed the question about Mrs. Trump.

The question, which was mocked a little on social media, will most likely end up as a footnote about Mr. Trump’s dealings with the news media. But Mr. Mazza’s unlikely path to the White House is a strange tale befitting these strange times.

UNF News, Mr. Mazza said in an interview on Friday, was his “own news station that I started when I was 8 years old.”

If Mr. Trump were to start paying attention to UNF News, it would be a start: The network has neither advertisers nor subscribers.

Yet in an era of fake news, overheated partisanship and general rancor, Mr. Mazza seems unfailingly earnest and without an agenda — aside from trying to become a reporter, with his own notion of what that means.

After forming WUNF, Mr. Mazza would write articles about events in his hometown, Fair Lawn, N.J. A few years later, he obtained press credentials from a local cable access channel, Fair Lawn TV, giving him access to courts and other official events.

By the time Mr. Mazza got his driver’s license two years ago, he had seven police scanners and three weather radios.

“I always used to monitor the storms and the police reports,” he said. “It was extremely interesting.”

After graduating from high school, Mr. Mazza took classes at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting’s campus in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., while continuing to pursue his passion.

Mr. Mazza’s parents, he said, supported and helped pay for his journalistic ambitions. Once he could drive, he aimed his sights on Manhattan.

“I covered one of the mayor’s press conferences,” he said of Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. “After I did that I got on the list to get advisories from the mayor, so I said, ‘Why not go to City Hall and get myself known there?’”

He soon discovered that in addition to Room 9, where the City Hall press corps works, there was an annex room for reporters in the basement, Room 4a.

Mr. Mazza asked the mayor’s office if he could work from that room. The answer was yes, and for the past couple of years, he has become a semiregular in the City Hall press corps. He said he mostly covers politics, breaking news and entertainment, but allowed that he really covered whatever struck his fancy.

Other reporters had mostly kind things to say about Mr. Mazza, even if they said his approach reflected his age and experience.

Mr. Mazza’s work has, at times, created some unease at home. He recalled when, during a State of the City speech by the mayor in 2016, there was a shooting of two police officers in the Bronx, and he wanted to go with the rest of the press corps with the mayor to the hospital.

“My mom was calling me; she was like, ‘Go home, go home, go home,’” Mr. Mazza said. “She was very nervous, and I went home. But after that, I always went to shootings and now she understands that it is my job.”

But even his mother was shocked when she saw him on national television Thursday.

Mr. Mazza had been going to the White House since the election, and said he had gone to four press briefings conducted by Sean M. Spicer, the press secretary, first securing a daily credential, and then weekly passes. He happened to be in Washington on Thursday when Mr. Trump announced that he was going to hold an impromptu news conference.

“I was prepared,” Mr. Mazza said, explaining that he had a news release from the White House about the first lady opening the visitors office, “and I said to myself, ‘There has not been a lot of coverage about this,’ and I thought it could be interesting.”

Despite the tension during the combative news conference, Mr. Mazza said he was not nervous, saying to himself, “If he doesn’t like my question, he doesn’t like my question. I am just going to ask my question.”

He was not concerned if some people might view his question as a softball.

“I was really honored that he appreciated my question,” Mr. Mazza said. “And I was appreciative he answered my question. The president took the time out of his day to answer my question.”After four uneven weeks on Capitol Hill since President Trump’s inauguration, lawmakers are heading home. Their constituents will be waiting.

At a series of town hall meetings scheduled during the coming recess, members of Congress are expected to encounter pointed questions, blistering protests and, maybe occasionally, small gestures of gratitude for agreeing to appear in the first place.

Here is what to expect on Saturday:

Double billing in South Carolina

Mr. Sanford found an unusual partner for his town hall event in Mount Pleasant: a group called Indivisible Charleston, the local chapter of a national organization founded on the stated goal of “resisting the Trump agenda.” The group, organized by former congressional staff members, has helped to galvanize opponents of the president who might otherwise be disinclined to attend town hall meetings with their representatives.

Mr. Sanford, whose office worked with Indivisible to plan the event, has been among the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump, having taken issue with the president’s refusal to release his tax returns and his willingness to traffic in misinformation, among other concerns.

The event’s other headliner is Mr. Scott, who has, so far, been far less eager to criticize Mr. Trump.

A Bronx cheer in upstate New York?

Mr. Reed did not have to seek out any protesters. They will surely find him.

Organizers from the Indivisible group are also expected to make their presence known at Mr. Reed’s series of town halls, as The Buffalo News reported. Though he represents a district that has been viewed as safely Republican, the congressman, who was a vice chairman on Mr. Trump’s transition team, is likely to face considerable blowback from left-leaning locals who oppose the president.

Repeal, replace, repeat

By now, Republicans have grown accustomed to voicing their desire to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — a talking point that has lasted several election cycles. But as the effort proceeds in fits and starts in Washington, voters seem to be losing patience.

Answering questions about the health care law is perhaps the thorniest task that Republicans face. The reason: They are taking heat from both sides. Defenders of the law often confront lawmakers with wrenching personal stories of the law’s effects and argue that the measure has been a force for good on balance. Opponents, on the other hand, have listened for years as Republicans pledged to turn back the law and are wondering what is taking so long after the party seized the White House to go along with its majorities in both congressional chambers.

The tweetable moment

Not every town hall has one. But when it arrives, a lawmaker seems to know.

Already this year, there have been constituent confrontations that rippled across social media. Perhaps most memorably, Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was serenaded with chants of “Do your job!” as he strained to quell the anger at a recent forum. Mr. Chaffetz has faced criticism for not seeking aggressive investigations of assorted Trump-related controversies, including possible connections between the president’s orbit and Russian intelligence.

Then there was Representative Tom McClintock of California, who had to be escorted away by police officers after protests at an event earlier this month.

Before the recess, House Republicans had been advised on security precautions in the event of overwhelming protests.The arrest was “just the beginning,” said Sim Sang-jeung, an opposition lawmaker who has campaigned for transparency at the largest companies. She warned against a tendency among the law enforcement agencies to treat major corporate chiefs with kid gloves.

“We needed to see whether prosecutors ask for a sentence befitting his crimes and whether he is convicted with such a penalty,” Ms. Sim said. “Only when he finishes serving such a lengthy sentence will people believe that the law is alive in their country.”

It also raises questions about the fate of Samsung, a huge company whose electronics arm alone accounts for one-fifth of South Korea’s exports.

Wearing a well-tailored suit, Mr. Lee emerged through the metal detectors of a court in Seoul, the capital, on Thursday and past a news media gantlet to his car, which drove him to a detention center to await a decision. Early Friday morning, he learned that he would be staying at the detention center through his trial.

South Korea faces a tenuous balancing act. For decades, its growth has been fueled by companies like Samsung, one of a group of family-controlled conglomerates called chaebol. Chaebol are now firmly embedded in the country’s economy, with the 10 largest generating annual revenue exceeding 80 percent of South Korea’s gross domestic product. Business groups warn that disrupting the chaebol could hurt the broader economy.

“We are shocked and deeply worried,” the Korea Employers Federation, a pro-business lobby, said in a statement about the arrest.

“Samsung is the global company that represents South Korea, and we fear that the vacuum in its management will weigh heavily on the economy by increasing uncertainty and hurt international credibility.”

But the power of the chaebol is coming up against rising public anger over the perception of corruption and favoritism. Among those 10 biggest chaebol, six of their leaders have been convicted of white-collar crimes. Many have been pardoned or had their sentences suspended or reduced. Chaebol leaders face broader questions as well about whether their economic dominance squelches small business and innovation, accusations that their lobbyist denies.

Reflecting the public mood, the governing — and usually pro-business — Liberty Korea Party said it respected the court’s decision to arrest Mr. Lee and expressed “regrets that the people have been again disappointed by the deep-rooted collusion between politics and business.”

Mr. Lee is accused of bribery, embezzlement and perjury as part of an investigation into a confidante of the country’s president, Park Geun-hye. Ms. Park now faces impeachment. Samsung has said Mr. Lee will work to clear his name in court.

The police arrested Mr. Lee and took him into custody, an unprecedented move for a major Samsung official. But in terms of accusations of wrongdoing against a top executive, Samsung has been there before. Mr. Lee’s father, Lee Kun-hee, Samsung’s chairman, has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion.

Still, the elder Mr. Lee never spent time in prison. The fate of the young Mr. Lee, critics of the chaebol say, will be a test of the country’s young democracy and judicial system.

It will also be a test for Samsung. For the first time in its 79-year history, the company has been left leaderless. With Mr. Lee gone, there is no top executive to make long-term plans and strategic decisions.

Samsung has an army of professional executives that manage day-to-day operations of its 58 subsidiaries. But analysts say that without a family-appointed leader, decision making will slow.

In chaebol culture, often likened to an imperial monarchy within South Korea, the chairman must endorse or make corporate decisions. So the removal of Mr. Lee, who has been the de facto leader since his father was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014, is far more serious than the loss of a senior executive at a conventional company.

Choi Gee-sung, the No. 2 lieutenant in the Samsung hierarchy and longtime right-hand man for Mr. Lee, will be the closest substitute to a top manager at the company while Mr. Lee is gone. But Mr. Choi is not a member of the Lee family and is expected to serve largely as a “vassal” caretaker who lacks the kind of sweeping authority and responsibility that Mr. Lee and his father have wielded in placing multibillion-dollar bets on investments or new technology.

In one sign of disruption, Samsung delayed its annual reshuffle of senior managers, which it usually announces in December. Compounding concerns, Mr. Choi and his deputies are also being investigated by prosecutors in connection with the bribery scandal.

The arrest comes at a difficult time for Samsung’s electronics arm. The company has faced stiff competition from Apple and cheaper Chinese smartphone makers alike. It is also still recovering from the discontinuation of its Galaxy Note 7, after flaws led some of the phones to overheat and burst into flames.

Still, few believe Mr. Lee’s arrest will challenge the family’s ultimate control of the company. In 2008, facing corruption charges, Mr. Lee’s father resigned from management, leaving the company to be run by loyal deputies, who served the family for decades and whose responsibilities were to ensure the father-to-son transfer of power.

For Samsung, one test will be whether the argument that its fate is important to the South Korean economy carries the same weight. When huge crowds took to the streets on recent weekends to call for the impeachment of Ms. Park, they also called for the arrest of chaebol chairmen accused of playing a crucial role in the presidential scandal.

On Friday, Moon Jae-in, the opposition leader who tops surveys of potential candidates to replace Ms. Park, called the arrest “proof that justice is still alive in South Korea.”Photo

It’s with a whiff of desperation that President Trump insists these days that he’s the chief executive Washington needs, the decisive dealmaker who, as he said during the campaign, “alone can fix it.” What America has seen so far is an inept White House led by a celebrity apprentice.

This president did not inherit “a mess” from Barack Obama, as he likes to say, but a nation recovered from recession and with strong alliances abroad. Mr. Trump is well on his way to creating a mess of his own, weakening national security and even risking the delivery of basic government services. Most of the top thousand jobs in the administration remain vacant. Career public servants are clashing with inexperienced “beachhead” teams appointed by the White House to run federal agencies until permanent staff members arrive.

Mr. Trump lost his national security adviser this week in a scandal involving ties to Russian intelligence. Robert Harward, a retired vice admiral, refused the job on Thursday, rattled by a dysfunctional National Security Council and a president who has alienated Mexico, Australia and even the British royal family, while cozying up to Moscow.

When Mr. Trump’s assistants can keep the edge of panic out of their voices, they insist that Mr. Trump has gotten more done in the early going than most presidents. And Mr. Trump is so adept at creating smoke that Americans might be forgiven for thinking that’s true. But at this point in the Obama presidency, which did inherit a mess, Congress had passed laws aimed at dragging the economy back from the brink of depression while committing $800 billion in Recovery Act spending to projects ranging from housing to roads to advanced energy technologies.

Mr. Trump’s vaunted $1 trillion infrastructure spending program, by contrast, doesn’t yet exist, because the president confuses executive orders with achievements. Orders are dashed off without input from Congress and the government officials who would implement them. The White House is a toxic mix of ideology, inexperience and rivalries; insiders say tantrums are nearly as common as the spelling errors in the press office’s news releases. Steve Bannon writes the president’s script, and Reince Priebus, the embattled chief of staff, crashes meetings to which he has not been invited.

Mr. Trump complains about the slow pace of congressional confirmation of his appointees, but the obstacle is at his end. His staff doesn’t bother to vet nominees in advance. His pick for labor secretary failed in part because no one in authority seemed to know that the nominee had employed an undocumented immigrant and had been accused of abusing his ex-wife.

“Everything he rolls out is done so badly,” Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, marveled recently. “They’re just releasing comments, tweets and policies willy-nilly.”

If there is any upside here, it is that the administration’s ineptitude has so far spared the nation from a wholesale dismantling of major laws, including the Affordable Care Act, though he may yet kill the law through malign neglect. In the meantime, however, as Mr. Harward’s retreat on Thursday suggests, the chaos carries other risks. A Navy SEAL turned corporate executive, Mr. Harward cited family and financial considerations for refusing the national security job, but privately he was reported to be worried about the effect of a mercurial president on national security decision making. As Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, said this week: “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon, because we’re a nation at war.”

The most damaging downside to the administration’s stumbles could be an exodus of talent from the broader government; scientists, lawyers and policy specialists at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, are openly disheartened at the prospect of working for Scott Pruitt, whose nomination as the agency’s new boss was approved by the Senate on Friday. And if others follow Mr. Hayward’s lead, capable people may be reluctant to come on board and fix things. That would leave the White House further isolated, particularly on foreign policy.

Indeed, unless Mr. Trump can bring some semblance of order to his official household and governing style, the only element of his famous campaign pledge that may prove accurate is the “alone” part.“This is probably more math-y black and Hispanic kids than I’ve seen in my whole career,” said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. “That’s why I’m here.”

The extreme racial homogeneity in the rarefied realm of young math wizards has drawn little attention in a nation where racial equality in the basic institutions of civic life — schools, housing, health care, policing — remains elusive. But it has become an increasing source of consternation for some mathematicians, educators and business leaders, who see it directly linked to the striking underrepresentation of blacks and Latinos in high-paying, high-status jobs in finance, science and technology. As those occupations increasingly propel our society, they fear that enrichment programs for mathematically gifted children, while rooted in meritocratic ideals, have become a particularly potent means of reinforcing privilege.

Even as movie audiences celebrate “Hidden Figures,” the story of black women who overcame legally sanctioned discrimination to perform critical calculations in the race to put a man on the moon, educators say that new, subtler obstacles to higher-level math education have arisen. These have had an outsize influence on racial prejudice, they contend, because math prowess factors so heavily in the popular conception of intelligence — a concern that recently provoked the creation of “Mathematically Gifted and Black” and “Latin@s and Hispanics in Mathematical Sciences,” websites featuring math professionals from underrepresented backgrounds.

“Fundamentally, this is a question about power in society,” said Daniel Zaharopol, BEAM’s director. “Not just financial power, but who is respected, whose views are listened to, who is assumed to be what kind of person.”

BEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program’s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph.D.’s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative problem-solving that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline.

And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM 6-ers with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders — a mix of hedge-fund millionaires and professional mathematicians — was to hook them enough to want to keep at it.

A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against.

By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of well-off parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges.

“When I was 6, my dad taught me to use the abacus and do mental math,” one student at a selective program called MathPath wrote on the application form.

By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where “math is not in the air,” Dr. Bernstein said.

The parents of the boy at the snack cart, Jonathan Jackson, do not have degrees in math or science. His school, Kipp STAR, is a well-regarded charter school in Harlem, but does not have a math team. And like many of the other students at BEAM, Jonathan, who is African-American, seemed to have already internalized the racial stereotypes about math that, studies have shown, shape self-image among young Americans of all backgrounds.

“They did a study that shows white kids have more chances,” he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, “I don’t know if it’s really true.”

A Subway Ritual Begins

Tracing Jonathan’s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures.

Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program’s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school.

When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. “You need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,” she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.

She was all the more certain on the Friday before the program started, when the world awakened to a Facebook Live video of an unarmed black cafeteria worker in Minnesota, Philando Castile, bleeding to death in his car after being shot by a police officer.

She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: “Just do what he says, and like, don’t try to resist,” he recited.

She thought of math as a field that “usually Asians dominate,’’ she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison.

“But it could act as a buffer,” she remembers thinking.

Ms. Ashburn, a postal clerk who graduated last year with a business degree from Monroe College in the Bronx, left before dawn for work on the first day of camp. Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, a year older than him, was headed to summer school after dropping off their younger brothers at karate camp. Jonathan walked himself around the corner at 7 a.m. to meet his subway group in what would become a daily routine.

Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. “Hello,” he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. “I am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school.”

Thays Garcia, also 11, was the group’s third member.

“I love math,” she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems.

Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony.

Now an account manager at Coca-Cola, Mr. Rincon had several years earlier set Thays up with Khan Academy, a widely used service with free online math lessons.

As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: “Calculator.”

But Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not “the theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,” as he put it in his email to BEAM. “I want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see.”

A “Supersize” Math Education?

Jonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not.

He had also placed above grade level on New York’s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city’s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black.

He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created.

But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to high-performing minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level.

Others voiced perceptions that reflect common stereotypes — including the idea that Asians are naturally better at math than anyone else. Sociologists say that misconception exists in part because a high proportion of Asian immigrants to the United States already possess a math-related degree. They are, in turn, better equipped to steer children toward advanced math programs, as are native-born scientists and engineers, who are disproportionately white.

In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns.

Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups.

“We don’t see many applications from blacks and Latinos,” said Glenn Stevens, the director of Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists, a summer math camp for high school students based at Boston University.

“I wish I could tell you it was improving,” said Elaine Hansen, the director of the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. “I don’t see that it is.”

African-Americans, about 15 percent of the working-age population under 45, obtained about 2 percent of the Ph.D.’s in the fields of math, engineering and physical sciences awarded in 2015, compared to 18.7 percent in social work and 7.3 percent of doctoral degrees in all fields, according to the National Science Foundation. (A total of 20 black graduate students received Ph.D’s in math and statistics, out of 1,802). Hispanics were only marginally better represented.

That means whites and Asian-Americans are the near-exclusive recipients of the tens of billions of dollars in public funding devoted to research in those fields. It also affects private-sector employment: Both Google and Facebook reported last year that Hispanic and black employees together account for only 4 percent of their technical work force.

There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides poorer-quality education to many minority students.

But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don’t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of enrichment-math experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology.

“How do you even know a whole bunch of students are supersizing their education and you’re just doing your homework and getting A’s in your A.P. calculus classes?” said Quinton McArthur, M.I.T.’s associate dean of admissions. “It’s exacerbated the gap and no one even realizes.”

BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been “swimming in a culture of math’’ from an early age.

But BEAM’s selective camp for students from low-income backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results.

“Although our students make tremendous progress,” Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, “it is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential.”

BEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: “We need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,’’ he said.

The Camp, and Complications

At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic.

“Mathematicians love the struggle,” one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. “When you feel uncomfortable, you’re learning.”

But whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate.

In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students’ progress. “I can’t get them to stop doing math,” said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side.

But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated.

“I find they’re not very good at self-advocating when they’re lost or bored,” said another teacher, Marcelle Good. “I guess they’re used to being lost or bored.”

During the program’s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations.

“How do you get kids who haven’t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?” Dr. Bernstein lamented.

“He’s engageable,” said Michael Pershan, who teaches middle-school math at St. Ann’s, a private school in Brooklyn Heights. “I vote for upping the mathiness.”

“I’m open to suggestions for how to reach him,” said another. “He’s a pretty big distraction in my class.”

Beyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math.

A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived.

“Hey, Thays,” he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner.

He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a close-up picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train.

“You going to try it?” she asked, nodding toward the problem. They both knew she had already solved it. (See how she did it in this quiz; it’s question No. 5.)

He shrugged, looking sideways at her.

“Maybe,” he said.

By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another’s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition; Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go.

But they didn’t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer.

His friends did not know that Jonathan’s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school.

Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school.

But one day on the subway that week, they talked about Black Lives Matter, a subject that held an emotional resonance, at least for Thays and Jonathan. When it came up, it seemed at first that Emyr had not been able to hear the thread of Thays and Jonathan’s conversation over the subway din.

Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it.

Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: “There was a kid in the back of the car,” he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile.

Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr’s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican.

“No,” Emyr said. “But it’s true.”

Jonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in.

“How can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?” he demanded. “It’s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop.”

Seeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day.

Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her “Codes Codes Codes” class: “I’m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions.”

Then Thays added the problem’s final complication: “How many questions does it take if I’m allowed to lie once?”

As they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the error-correcting codes that underlie digital storage and communications.

“There’s also something called binary,” Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr.

The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. “What about you guys?”

“Of course I’m going to BEAM 7,” Emyr said.

“J. J.?” she prodded. But he was peering into his phone.

A Counselor Assist

That Jonathan was one of just a few African-American boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young African-American males, even in elementary school.

BEAM relies on the schools with whom it partners to select which students to take its admissions test, and teachers, studies have shown, pass over qualified black students for gifted programs at higher rates than for whites and Hispanics. Black boys, said Danny Martin, an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, are most subject to the classroom dynamic he calls “Learning Mathematics While Black.’’

Along with incarceration rates that are higher for young black men than for any other group, that dynamic may contribute to why black women receive a higher share of bachelor’s degrees in math, chemistry and physics, fields in which men of other ethnicities outnumber women.

Whatever the reason, many of the college-age counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan.

One of them was Christian Henderson, an African-American accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N.Y. “It’s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,” he said, “so they know in their head they’re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that’s true.”

Jonathan’s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics.

A straight-A student at a Harlem high school where the majority of his fellow students were deemed unprepared for college, Mr. Pineda had taken A.P. calculus and secured admission to Amherst with the help of an organization called QuestBridge aimed at matching underrepresented minority students with top-tier colleges.

By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the “summer math nerds,” as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead.

“You should look at this, J. J.,” Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM’s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. “I think you’d like it.”

Thays’s Absence

The following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train.

Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911.

Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room.

When she didn’t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays’s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. “Thays! I know you’re just at home watching TV!”

He also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns.

BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you’re trying to make a triangle.

For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you’ll need 3 pennies total; if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies; for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10.

So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin.

After nearly a week away, Thays returned — her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery — to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared.

At home on one of the final days, Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes.

“How’s that camp going?” she asked. “Are you still behind in your math?”

He was silent for a moment.

“You know, I’m not at that camp because I’m bad at math,” he said finally. “I’m there because I’m good at math.”

The Last Subway Ride

Photo

On the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan.

Mr. Zaharopol made a final plug for the online pre-algebra class he hoped they would take, which started a few weeks after the beginning of school. Each student received a sheet of paper with information about how to log on. BEAM would cover the cost.

They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year.

Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up.

A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays’s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own.

“She wants to go home with her regular group,” he said, shrugging.

On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar; then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character.

“You made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,” he noted. “Their eyes are supposed to be black on white.”

“Where’s my present?” Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. “Come on, Thays.”

Thays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope.

“Oh special, special JJ,” she had written. “You are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7.”

Jonathan paused for a moment before looking up.

“Now if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,” he said, and put his arm around her.

The three exchanged phone numbers.

Doubts and the Power of Math

Photo

A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. “I want to get a Ph.D. in math,” one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: “I learned math they don’t teach me at school.”

The teachers, though, wondered how much they’d really been able to achieve.

“They’re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,” Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. “But how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?”

As police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan’s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. “It’s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,” she said of the new president.

She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt.

Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online pre-algebra class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons.

“I might not be able to do it for a few weeks,” he told me. “I have homework.”

But Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home.

And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again.

“Hey,” he typed into his phone.

“Who is this?” came the reply.

“Jonathan from BEAM,” he replied.

“J. J.??!!”

Her phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn’t received his texts.

They traded messages, until Jonathan’s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended.

“I am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,” he typed quickly.

When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? “I want to get into Bronx Science!” Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city’s most selective public high schools. “I mean who doesn’t?” Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? “To see my BEAM peers,” wrote Emyr, in addition to “challenging my brain.”

Jonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn’t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn’t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM’s key lesson: “I find proportion problems interesting because I’ll always be confused,” he wrote, “but I figure out the answer anyways.”

On Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.

As Kellyanne Conway sleepwalks her way through a series of increasingly embarrassing interviews, it’s been hard not to feel sorry for her. It was difficult not to feel bad for her when “Saturday Night Live” depicted her as a craven hack driven to “Fatal Attraction”-style debasement by a desire to appear on the news. When the cast of “Morning Joe” pointed out that Ms. Conway’s recent appearances on news shows proved her a useless source of information, when they sneered at Ms. Conway’s apparent White House ostracization, it was difficult to not feel stirrings of sympathy.

But I can’t feel sorry for Kellyanne Conway. Not anymore.

Not long ago, Ms. Conway felt like a vital part of a system that needed smart people on both sides to make it work. As a pollster who studied the electoral behavior of women, she served as a bridge between the right wing and a demographic that often seemed to perplex them.

The first time I saw Ms. Conway speak was at a New Yorker Festival panel in 2012. I was new to New York City. I was new to writing about politics. I was new to writing, period. On a panel about women voters, Ms. Conway spoke with a pragmatism that stood in opposition to contemporary TV personalities like Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whose brand of delicate pouting defined the conservative zeitgeist. Ms. Conway didn’t appeal to her audience’s sympathy. She had facts.

I liked watching her speak then. I watched her the way a person might stand at the kitchen window and watch a raccoon abscond with the first tomato of spring. I didn’t agree with what she was doing, but I admired her chutzpah.

Once she took the reins of Donald Trump’s campaign, though, she went from smooth to slippery. She’d hammer Hillary Clinton for talking too much about gender and duck behind her femininity in the face of legitimate criticism. If she succeeded, it was because she was Kellyanne. If she failed, it was because she was a woman.

In the months leading up to the election, Ms. Conway generously lent her womanhood as a smokescreen to the Trump campaign. She tried to insert a watered-down version of feminism into the candidate’s platform, despite the fact that no mainstream feminist-leaning organizations supported him. When her boss was caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women, Kellyanne Conway “as a woman”-ed her way out of it. Confronted about Mr. Trump’s chauvinism, she snapped back that women who were in poverty were not served during the Obama years, as though that somehow undid her boss’s history. I gasped so frequently when she spoke that after each interview was over, I’d feel faint, like I’d spent the last several hours blowing up balloons.

When Ms. Conway breached federal ethics laws by hawking Ivanka Trump’s “stuff” in the press briefing room, she got off with no immediate penalty besides being “counseled on the subject.” She told Fox News that the president supported her, that she was lucky to have a nice boss like Donald Trump and that every woman in America should hope to have a boss like him. She made it sound as though declining to punish a woman for ethics violations was somehow feminist, and as though all that matters to women is how their bosses treat them personally, not how their bosses impact the lives of other women.

If I wasn’t too exhausted to feel insulted, I’d have felt insulted.

As Kellyanne’s once-forceful cable news denials have disintegrated into whimpers, I can’t say I feel anything for her at all. I don’t mind when people point out how tired she looks. I simply cannot dredge up any sympathy for a person who has acknowledged the structural problems most women face only when she is personally facing them, or used them as derailing tactics when she’s losing an argument. I can’t mourn the downfall of a fair-weather feminist, a woman who has used her power to hurt other women.

Ms. Conway made her bed. And now it’s time for her to get some sleep.Things seemed different as recently as December, when the Blackstone Group’s chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, announced the formation of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, whose members would “meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge,” as Mr. Schwarzman put it at the time.

Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included.

Only two people declined, citing time pressures: Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

The final list of 16 included such business luminaries as Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric; Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Bob Iger of Disney; Mary Barra of General Motors; and Virginia Rometty of IBM.

Soon after, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Travis Kalanick of Uber and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo were added, buttressing the group’s expertise in technology and consumer products.

Then Mr. Trump was inaugurated and in short order unleashed his divisive immigration order, leading to chaos at airports and nationwide protests. Exactly one week later, on relatively short notice, he convened the first meeting of the forum, with live television coverage from the State Dining Room of the White House.

Even though nearly every company represented in the forum issued a statement that to varying degrees distanced it from the immigration order or even denounced it, the images of the meeting risked looking like an endorsement of the Trump administration and its policies.

Images of Mrs. Nooyi, an immigrant born in India (and now a citizen), who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman and within camera range of Mr. Trump, seemed especially incongruous.

And all of this was before the abrupt resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and renewed questions about the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russians.

Mr. Kalanick was the first on the forum to feel the wrath of consumers. Protesters accused Uber of “collaborating” with Mr. Trump and chained themselves to the doors of the company’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Soon after, the hashtag #DeleteUber trended on Twitter. Within four days of the immigration order, 200,000 users had deleted the Uber app, and one of the company’s rivals, Lyft, reported that downloads of its own app had more than doubled.

In an effort to quell the protest, Mr. Kalanick resigned from the forum the day before its first meeting. The “implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are,” he said in a memo to employees.

When I contacted him this week, Mr. Kalanick said: “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.”

Protest flared and a social media boycott campaign took root after the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, joined Mr. Trump’s 28-member Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, announced in January, and then praised the president’s pro-business policies on CNBC.

This week, in an open letter published as an advertisement in The Baltimore Sun (Under Armour’s headquarters is in Baltimore), Mr. Plank said, “I personally believe that immigration is the foundation of our country’s exceptionalism,” and “in a time of division, we aspire to be a force of unity, growth and optimism for our city and our country.” He pledged to oppose “any new actions that negatively impact our team, our neighbors or their families.”

Some Disney employees organized demonstrations in three cities this week, demanding that Mr. Iger resign from the forum, even though he didn’t attend the first meeting because of a conflict with a long-scheduled company board meeting. The demonstrations drew about 120 protesters, the company said.

At the same time, Out & Equal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, praised Mr. Iger’s membership in the forum in a letter to the company, citing his support for workplace equality and ability to influence the president.

Mr. Schwarzman himself received some criticism from a few Schwarzman scholars, who receive support under a program he established for study in China. In a letter to the scholars explaining his role in advising Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote: “In life you’ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice. However, I have always believed one’s obligation is to work for the common good.”

As the Uber experience suggests, the risks of engaging with Mr. Trump are highest for companies with direct exposure to consumers, especially those who can easily switch to a competitor less identified with the Trump brand. General Motors and PepsiCo could face more consumer reaction; the banks and money managers less so; and industrial concerns like General Electric even less.

At the same time, the benefits of being part of the forum and gaining the ear of the president are obvious: Virtually every Fortune 500 corporation has vitally important interests affected by the federal government, from antitrust, labor and trade policies, to tax reform and bank regulation, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.

Underscoring the value of access, the president singled out Mr. Dimon, whom the Trump campaign had courted as a potential Treasury secretary, saying at the meeting, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie.”

The comment seemed to underscore the degree to which Mr. Trump has turned regulation of Wall Street over to the bankers he railed against during the campaign. (Curiously, given Mr. Trump’s stated hostility to Dodd-Frank, Mr. Dimon is on record as supporting many aspects of the legislation, saying it has made the banking system safer but has also made it more difficult for smaller banks to compete.)

A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.

And refusing Mr. Trump’s invitations risks a presidential Twitter broadside, something that is unprecedented in American political and business history and whose impact is still being assessed. Yahoo Finance last week said it had sifted through more than 34,000 Trump tweets and identified attacks on 62 businesses, including at least two represented in the forum, General Motors and Boeing.

(I asked the White House on Thursday for comment on its interaction with business leaders, but received no response.)

Optics aside, Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said the president’s overtures to executives represented a welcome change from the Obama administration, which largely ignored big business and summoned bankers to Washington to browbeat them publicly over the financial crisis. By comparison, Mr. Trump embraced members of his business forum as “the best and the brightest” and said he welcomed their ideas.

“There’s always the danger that chief executives will be used as photo ops,” Mr. Sonnenfeld acknowledged. But he praised Mr. Trump’s decision “to give chief executives a seat at the table” and said he had talked to at least half of the participants since the meeting. “They’re telling me they found him very receptive to their ideas and willing to listen,” he said. “They’ve said they’re holding each other accountable to be truthful and candid and to raise key issues with him.”

Mr. Sonnenfeld has met with Mr. Trump since the election and offered advice. “He’s very charming and open to new ideas,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “I’ve seen business executives melt in his presence.”

Charles Elson, a professor and expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, also praised the president for reaching out to business leaders. He said he disagreed with Mr. Kalanick’s decision to resign.

“When the president calls, you should go to see him, regardless of your political persuasion, out of respect for the office,” Mr. Elson said. “As a chief executive with a duty to your shareholders, it’s your obligation to do so, like him or not.”

Mr. Schwarzman’s office made a similar point when I inquired this week. “Steve has advised presidents from both parties in the past and feels a duty to help any administration that calls on him if he’s able to do so for the good of the country,” Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman, said.

Still, everyone I spoke to agreed that there were lines they wouldn’t cross. “You don’t have to agree” with the president, Mr. Elson said. “If he asks you to take a political position, you can say no. And if he asks you to endorse something where you have a deep philosophical objection, you shouldn’t do it.”Mr. Yiannopoulos had been scheduled to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month, on an invitation from the school’s College Republicans group. But his talk was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused about $100,000 in damages.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In January, when Mr. Yiannopoulos gave a lecture in Seattle at the University of Washington, a man was shot during protests outside the site of the speech. He spoke in December at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks.

When it was announced on Wednesday that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be interviewed on “Real Time,” another scheduled guest, Jeremy Scahill, a journalist for The Intercept, said in a statement on his Twitter account that he was withdrawing from the show.

“He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,” Mr. Scahill said. “There is no value in ‘debating’ him.”

Mr. Maher followed with his own statement that said, “If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims — and he might be — nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night.”

In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as “the party of Lena Dunham,” the creator and star of “Girls.” (Mr. Maher replied: “Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people.”)

Describing himself as “a virtuous troll,” Mr. Yiannopolous said, “I hurt people for a reason.”

He said people “want to police humor” because “they can’t control it.”

“Because the one thing that authoritarians hate is the sound of laughter,” Mr. Yiannopolous said.

Mr. Maher added, “And also, because when people laugh, they know it’s true.”

Mr. Yiannopolous replied, “Nothing annoys people, or amuses people, like the truth.”

They then discussed an incident from last summer, when Mr. Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of “Ghostbusters” and “Saturday Night Live.”

“I didn’t understand, like, the ‘Ghostbusters’ thing,” Mr. Maher said.

Mr. Yiannopoulos answered: “I wrote a bad review of a movie. Am I not entitled to do that?” After repeating some of the insults he had leveled at Ms. Jones, he said, “I simply don’t accept — I do not accept — that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster, that an A-list, mega-celebrity is crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it.”

“What actually hurts people is, like, murder, violence,” Mr. Yiannopoulos added. “That kind of stuff.”

He added that “mean words” don’t “hurt people.”

Mr. Maher said, “Which some people would say you have incited.”

Mr. Yiannopoulos reacted with surprise. “What? How?” he asked.

“I’m just saying, some people would say,” Mr. Maher answered.

Mr. Yiannopoulos replied, “Well, they would be idiots.”

Speaking to his audience, Mr. Maher said, “Stop taking the bait, liberals,” and asked how they could be afraid of someone he described as “little, British, impish” and a slur for gay people. The two men shook hands, and Mr. Maher moved on to his panel discussion.

But in an online-only segment that ran after the HBO broadcast, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that transgender people were “vastly disproportionately involved in sex crime,” drawing jeers, boos and a shout of “liar” from Mr. Maher’s audience.

Mr. Yiannopoulos also clashed with the comedian Larry Wilmore, another guest on the show.

In remarks to Mr. Yiannopoulos that were bookended by an obscene phrase, Mr. Wilmore took offense at his Twitter trolling of Ms. Jones. “She’s a very thoughtful person and very funny,” he said.

Trying to defuse the tension, Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn’t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. “This is the beginning of your career,” Mr. Maher said. “People are only just starting to hate you.”“What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane,” he said, as the audience guffawed.

Mr. Trump, fresh off his raucous news conference in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, seemed thrilled to escape the marble political prison of the executive complex — and to break free from a narrative of chaos and infighting that has characterized his rocky and eventful presidential debut.

He left Washington after a week of humbling setbacks that included the forced withdrawal of his choice for labor secretary and the firing of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, in the wake of reports that Mr. Flynn misled investigators and Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to Washington.

The president’s trip came hours after the man he chose to replace Mr. Flynn, retired Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward, turned him down. He has plans to meet with other candidates this weekend in Florida.

Mr. Trump’s appearance at the manufacturing complex, in a state he won by 15 points in November, vividly illustrated the second side of his split-screen presidency. It was a disciplined drumbeat of events, including meetings with labor and business leaders intended to demonstrate his commitment to ensuring working-class economic security. That was the pledge that moved skeptical swing state voters to his cause.

“There’s the palace intrigue story about them not being very well coordinated, that the White House isn’t ready for prime time, that he’s still setting things up,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and frequent Trump critic. “There’s a lot of cracks in the armor. And then you have the whole Flynn situation.”

“But you have a very disciplined president when it comes to economic messaging,” said Mr. Graham, who was in Washington on Friday with the Senate in session. “How can that be? I just think he’s more comfortable talking about how we are going to make America a better place for jobs than he is at articulating foreign policy.”

Mr. Trump, a president obsessed with optics, could not have chosen a more impressive backdrop to emphasize his commitment to preserving jobs. His staff spent about a week prepping for his visit to the facility here, a six-story factory hangar with four massive Dreamliners under construction, cowlings peeled back to expose the inner workings of the engines, signs affixed to their bodies to indicate their purchasers — in one case, Aeroméxico.

The visit came two days after Boeing workers in the state rejected an attempt by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to unionize the production line.

South Carolina is a so-called right-to-work state, with a low level of union participation. Since it began production here in 2009, Boeing has hired 7,500 employees spread around several facilities, investing more than $2 billion in land and infrastructure, while spending about $355 million each year on local suppliers and vendors, according to the company.

But that was about it for substance or controversy.

Mr. Trump has criticized Boeing for what he suggested was an overpriced Air Force One replacement. On Friday, he repeated that “the price is too high” but also noted that “we’re negotiating.” Referring to one of Boeing’s major competitors, he said: “We love Lockheed. Great partner.”

The president also said more explicitly than before that the Pentagon would consider buying more Boeing F/A-18 fighters in place of some of the Lockheed Martin F-35s that it had planned to order if Lockheed does not keep lowering the price of the F-35. “If the price doesn’t come down, we would,” he said. Now that Boeing has made it somewhat stealthier, he said, “The F-18’s a great plane.”

Some in the president’s own party, including Mr. Graham, had hoped he would use the trip to announce his support for the embattled Export-Import Bank, a financing partner for Boeing and other companies battling foreign-based competitors. He did not.

The bank is a New Deal-era institution that helps American companies operating overseas arrange and guarantee loans for international customers. It has jokingly been called “the Bank of Boeing,” because the Chicago-based aerospace giant has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the bank’s efforts, with as much of a third of Ex-Im financing deals being steered to help the company win contracts against competitors like Europe’s Airbus.

Mr. Trump, who promised to drain the Washington “swamp,” did not stake out a position on the bank during the 2016 campaign. But he joined the chorus of conservatives and progressive Democrats — ranging from Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, to Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont — who have described the bank as corporate welfare. In one campaign appearance, Mr. Trump called some of the bank’s deals “featherbedding.”

But the president has softened his stance considerably since the inauguration, as he has moved his focus from assuaging his party’s base to fulfilling big campaign promises on jobs, trade and manufacturing. In the last few weeks, he told pro-bank senators that he was leaning toward the appointment of new board members, breaking an impasse that has frozen lending and deal-making for more than a year.

“The comments that he did make during the campaign were critical of the bank, and the signal I got was that he was not a supporter,” said Diane Katz, a fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has worked closely with Mr. Trump’s team but opposes the bank as a government intrusion into free markets.

“Since taking office, he has emphasized the refashioning of trade deals to benefit U.S. workers and retaining manufacturing, so there seems to be a change,” she said. “I hope he’s not backtracking. Boeing, the primary beneficiary of the bank, has a market cap of almost $150 billion. They don’t need any more corporate welfare.”This quiet region of pine-covered mountains and potato fields not far from the North Korean border, long one of the country’s least-developed areas, has overcome a number of obstacles just to get to this point. Pyeongchang, largely unfamiliar even to many Koreans before the Olympic bid, was once seen as a sizable underdog to win the Olympics. It finally succeeded in its third bid after razor-thin defeats to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014.

Still, name recognition remains a problem. To avoid confusion with the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the Olympic host was officially rebranded from its original name, Pyongchang, to PyeongChang, adding an all-important “e” and capital “C.” The new spelling only partly worked, though, as some international media have not adopted the capital C. And travelers have still gotten confused, such as the Kenyan delegate headed to the ski center for a United Nations biodiversity conference in 2014 who accidentally booked a ticket to North Korea instead.

The preparations have also been rocky. There were struggles initially to find domestic sponsors and disputes over funding for venues and the plan to build a downhill course in a virgin forest on a protected mountainside. (The organizing committee has done damage control by promising to replant trees and return the mountain to its natural state after the Games.)

The long-brewing corruption scandal involving the country’s president, Park Geun-hye, has threatened to overshadow the Olympics, too, but organizers maintain that preparations have not been affected and that the Games are free of corruption.

With one year to go before the opening ceremony, organizers are fervently trying to shift attention back to South Korea’s moment in the sporting spotlight. Most of the venues are nearing completion, including a brand-new Alpine ski center, speedskating oval, figure skating arena and sliding track for the bobsled, luge and skeleton events. The two villages for athletes are about half-finished — one in the Pyeongchang mountain cluster, the other in the coastal city of Gangneung, where the ice events will be held. A new high-speed rail line is expected to be completed by mid-2017, too, whisking visitors from Seoul to Pyeongchang in just 69 minutes, compared with the current two-and-a-half-hour drive.

And the Olympic spirit is finally starting to seep into Pyeongchang, a sprawling county made up of ski resorts and sleepy towns like Hoenggye, where the athletes’ village and Olympic Stadium are being built.

Hoenggye is as far from a typical ski town as it gets. The streets are lined with homey dumpling and Korean fried chicken restaurants, as well as nondescript clothing stores with names like Barbie Fashion Shop that stock off-brand sweaters and windbreakers, but nary a ski jacket in sight. A small truck with a squawking loudspeaker makes the rounds in the afternoons selling fresh crab and squid from the coast, and on the outskirts of town, locals hang pollock on wooden racks for days in the winter sun until they become tough as leather, a popular Korean delicacy called hwangtae.

But even in this tranquil hamlet, the excitement is starting to build. The main road into town is already aglow with giant neon letters proclaiming triumphantly to motorists, “Yes Pyeongchang!” In a dry, shallow riverbed, five giant Olympic rings were fashioned from packed snow for the Pyeongchang Winter Festival earlier this year, with tunnels in the curved walls large enough to stroll through and snow carvings of figures like a skiing rooster (for the Year of the Rooster) and the Olympic mascot Soohorang, a smiling white tiger, in the center.

A short drive away, the new Alpensia Ski Jumping Center has also become a draw for families, with young children bundled in heavy jackets warily eyeing the top of the steep, icy slope before heading to the observatory for popcorn and photos in front of a less frightening picture of the real thing.

The hope is that the Olympics can have a lasting impact on the tourism industry here and help South Korea rival Japan — and upstart China — as a winter sports destination.

It may take some time to catch up to its neighbors. According to the Ski Business Association of Korea, the number of ski visits in South Korea grew slowly from 5.4 million in 2004-5 to a peak of 6.8 million in 2011-12, but then fell to just 4.9 million in 2015-16, in part because of a slowing economy and an aging population.

Japan’s ski industry has also seen a sharp decline since the boom years of the 1980s, but still averages more than 30 million ski visits per year. Though the downturn has hit some resorts hard, the attractions in Japan are still legion: well-equipped resorts with dozens of trails and steep verticals; a lengthy ski season that sometimes stretches into early May; a raucous après-ski scene (particularly popular among hard-partying Australians), and above all, the endlessly falling snow.

In China, meanwhile, skiing is also booming among the newly rich and young urban dwellers, with more than 12.5 million resort visits registered in 2014-15. Developers have been pouring money into resorts across the country, none more grand than the $3.2 billion Changbaishan resort near the North Korean border, which is now one of the largest in Asia with 43 trails totaling nearly 20 miles. China is sure to attract even more investment as it gears up for its own Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022.

South Korea actually has a long skiing history. Its first (and still biggest) resort, Yongpyong, opened in 1975, the same year it imported its first snow-making machine from Europe. (This moment is memorialized at Yongpyong in a grainy photo of officials surveying the foreign contraption above the very propagandist-sounding caption: “This artificial snow makes skiing more enjoyable.”)

But one of the main impediments to the country emerging from Japan’s shadow has been geography: South Korea’s mountains are just smaller than its neighbors’ and receive far less natural snow. At Yongpyong, which will host the slalom and giant slalom events during the Olympics, the average annual snowfall is just eight feet, and though it’s cold enough to make artificial snow the entire winter, it’s not quite the same as the deep powder in Hokkaido, the northern Japanese island. At Niseko, one of the most popular resort areas on Hokkaido, the average annual snowfall is an astonishing 50 feet.

Yongpyong has 28 slopes, served by 13 lifts and a gondola, but many of the trails are geared toward beginners and intermediates; an experienced skier can pretty much cover all the “super-advanced” diamond trails by lunchtime. Safety and proper decorum, not speed, also seem to be paramount concerns — fences prevent skiers from going off-piste, helmets are ubiquitous, and signs constantly remind visitors to select the appropriate slope for their skill level and slow down.

Sharing a Korean Hite beer with friends after a morning on the slopes, Ulrike Pertoll, an Italian who lives in Seoul, said she prefers the pure powder in Japan and the longer runs in the Dolomites back in Italy. But, she added, skiing in South Korea has its benefits: Ski rentals and lodging are cheaper than in Japan, and the proximity of the slopes to Seoul means you can leave work at 5 p.m. on a Friday and be on the slopes several hours later. “Where else can you do that so easily in Asia?” she said. Yongpyong’s slopes stay open until 2:30 a.m. for night owls, too.

Kyle Hughes, an Australian who has skied in South Korea for five years and runs an independent online travel guide called Korea Snow, points out other advantages: “The Koreans have the best skiing infrastructure in Asia — they have high-speed gondolas, fast quads, fast eights, the latest magic carpets,” he said. “And they’ve become so efficient at making snow, it’s ridiculous. One [resort] manager told me they don’t care if it doesn’t snow, they have the technology to open the whole season.”

Then there’s the cool factor. Many Koreans started taking up snowboarding in the 1990s after a hugely popular K-Pop boy band, Seo Taiji and Boys, showed off their boarding — and posing — skills in one of their videos. Since then, snowboarding has exploded in South Korea — as much for the style as for the sport itself. And just like the broader Korean wave sweeping Asia in music, television and film, Korean brands are now at the forefront of snowboarding style in the region, too.

These fashions are perhaps most visible at the Welli Hilli Park, a snowboarder’s paradise about an hour’s drive from Yongpyong. There are few downhill runs here; rather, the main attractions are the halfpipe, moguls and snowboard ramp where tricksters in hoodies entertain one another with flips and spins, sneaking cigarettes on the side.In order to fund health insurance for Americans who don’t get coverage through work, congressional Republicans are considering changing the system for those who do.

This week, health care committees in the House and Senate circulated an outline of an Affordable Care Act repeal and replacement plan. That outline explained how money would be spent on the program — on Medicaid, tax benefits for holders of health savings accounts, and tax credits for individuals buying their own insurance. What it did not say was how government would pay for the plan. Moreover, it called for eliminating taxes imposed by the A.C.A., including taxes on medical devices, drugs and health insurance plans.

But congressional Republicans do have an idea about where they could find some money to pay for their health program: by limiting the size of the tax break employers and workers receive on their health plans. Several lawmakers who attended a House Republican caucus meeting Thursday said such a plan was under discussion.

Currently, a dollar your employer spends on your wages is subject to income and payroll taxes, while any dollar spent on your health insurance is tax free. That system, which dates to the 1940s, is loathed by economists across the political spectrum, but it has become a staple of our tax and compensation system. The employer health insurance tax exclusion, as it’s known, is the single largest expenditure in our tax system, costing $216 billion in lost tax revenue last year, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s almost three times the size of the mortgage interest deduction.

For workers and employers, it feels like a great deal: Depending on how much you pay in taxes, the savings on the cost of expensive health benefits can be substantial. And most Americans under 65 benefit from tax savings associated with this policy.

But the economists dislike it anyway, for two main reasons: 1) They argue that it distorts the market for health insurance by creating incentives to spend more money on benefits than salaries. Those richer plans, they argue, lead workers to use too much health care and to remain insensitive to the cost of services, driving up health costs. 2) Liberal economists believe the tax exclusion is regressive, benefiting richer workers more than poorer ones, who would pay comparatively lower tax rates on ordinary income.

Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has had his eye on the tax exclusion for some time, and his committee held a hearing on the policy last year. Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, described the exclusion in his testimony as “the central flaw in our health care system.”

Experts on the left also dislike the exclusion. That’s why a tax on high-cost health plans, nicknamed the Cadillac tax, was part of the original Affordable Care Act law.

Since then, labor and employer groups have mobilized against the Cadillac tax. It turns out that people who aren’t economists don’t like the idea of having their health benefits taxed. An appropriations bill passed in 2015 prevented it from going into effect as scheduled. (And the groups have already begun fighting the rumored exclusion cap, as Sarah Kliff at Vox reported Thursday.)

“It’s turned out to be very hard to say to people: ‘Your health costs are too high. To address this, we think you should pay more for health insurance,’ ” David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard who dislikes the deduction and advised the Obama administration on health policy, wrote in an email. “Not sure why, but it’s not totally effective.”

A major element of the new Republican plan would tend to redistribute resources from the poor to the rich, by providing a flat tax credit by age for all Americans not covered through work. If Republicans proceed with this payment mechanism of capping the tax exclusion, it would push somewhat the other direction, giving greater benefits to middle-class people than to their wealthy bosses.

Workers might end up with less generous health plans, but they’d be paying proportionately less in overall taxes. And, the theory goes, if wages and health benefits are taxed at the same rate, employers might be more inclined to give their workers a raise instead of another health benefit.

But none of the possible benefits of the policy change are likely to make it popular. The Affordable Care Act generally provides benefits for a small fraction of the American population, as would a Republican replacement plan. The number that benefit from the employer system is much, much larger.The crew-cut Haldeman I knew was an affable source of information on university and Republican issues during the early days of Gov. Ronald Reagan’s administration, not at all like the stern figure of President Nixon’s White House years.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Haldeman had been an advance man for Nixon’s losing 1960 presidential bid, and when he rejoined Nixon for the 1968 campaign, he quickly became a powerful insider, leading to his appointment as chief of staff.

His friend, my luncheon host, was a personable Los Angeles public relations man who quickly got to the point: “Bob would like you to consider becoming the White House press secretary. He’s talked it over with the president, who approves.”

White House press secretary to Richard Nixon? I had been raised in a family of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman Democrats. My parents were skeptical about John F. Kennedy, but my wife and I were generational enthusiasts.

I worked hard at keeping personal beliefs out of my work, but there were limits. My first job, in a deeply conservative Omaha newsroom, was a test. Most of my colleagues thought I was a crazed liberal for supporting Medicare and the voting rights and civil rights bills.

At lunch with Haldeman’s emissary, I stammered something about having just signed a new contract with NBC News, a big step to becoming a national political correspondent, my dream job.

He suggested I think about it. “I have,” I said, “and it just isn’t what I am equipped to do. Please tell Bob I am flattered but no.”

Photo

I rushed back to my office and swore my boss to secrecy, saying, “You have to get me out of this.”

As it turns out, Julian Goodman, president of NBC and a patron of my career, was visiting the White House the next day. He made a point of taking Haldeman aside and saying that while the offer was flattering, NBC News had other plans.

The secret held and my standing at NBC News continued to rise while Nixon won re-election and then became embroiled in the Watergate scandal. I watched as Haldeman went to prison with other members of his zealous team.

In the summer of 1973, as the scandal picked up pace, I was named White House correspondent for NBC News. By now Ron Ziegler had given up the daily press briefings, which fell to Jerry Warren, a laconic San Diego newspaperman.

The White House press secretary job is a fuse lit every day, ready to explode with the slightest mistake in language, tone, fact. The most successful press secretaries have common traits. They’ve had a mutually respectful relationship with their boss. They’ve been veterans of campaigns. They didn’t always appreciate the role of the press but they accepted the reality that it wasn’t going away.

I’ve always classified Mike McCurry, President Bill Clinton’s press secretary during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, as a Tom Brady in the job. He had worked for two senators, including Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He had also worked on presidential campaigns and as spokesman for the State Department. He was a liberal but not an ideologue.

As for me, the only lingering effect of my hard and fast decision to decline Haldeman’s offer were two unexpected moments.

In 1987 Hofstra University organized a retrospective on Nixon’s presidency. I was backstage when someone grabbed me in a bear hug, laughing and saying, “You know how many times I’ve watched you on television and thought, I could have put that young man in a position where he could have gotten in a lot of trouble.”

It was H. R. Haldeman.

I said: “Bob, no one knows about your offer. Please!” He laughed again and said, “Don’t worry.”

In 1990, as my 50th birthday approached, NBC colleagues sent crews around New York to get birthday wishes.

One of the crews came into my office and said, “You’ve got to see this!”

The tape rolled. It was Nixon in his familiar blue suit, standing stiffly beside an American flag, saying, “I’ve always thought Tom Brokaw was a man of very good judgment.” Pause. “He never showed better judgment than when he turned down my offer to be my press secretary.”

President Nixon and I had very few views in common, but I was more than willing to accept his conclusion.Photo

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A man from North Korea has been arrested in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Malaysian police announced Saturday.

The man, identified as Ri Jong Chol, 46, was arrested Friday evening, the police said, but they provided no further details.

The police had been searching for four men, including at least one North Korean, who they believed had been involved in the attack on Mr. Kim on Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

Two women suspected of being involved in the attack, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, were arrested earlier in the week. A Malaysian man, described as the boyfriend of the Indonesian woman, was arrested and is said to be assisting the police in the investigation.

On Friday, North Korea broke its silence on Mr. Kim’s assassination, demanding that the Malaysian authorities surrender the body and vowing to reject any post-mortem they conducted.

The response to the assassination, in a statement by the North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, also accused the Malaysians of plotting to “besmirch” the North over the killing, heightening tensions between the two countries.

The statement was read to reporters outside a Kuala Lumpur hospital where the body of Mr. Kim, 46, has been held since he was attacked on Monday at the airport.

The police believe that the assassination was carried out by two women who struck Mr. Kim with a poisoned needle and wiped quick-acting poison on his face as he awaited a flight to Macau, where he lives with his family.

Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said Friday that the Indonesian suspect, Siti Aishah, told the Malaysian police that she had thought she was engaged in a prank and had been paid a small amount for her participation. She told the police that she had not realized it was an assassination, he said.

South Korean officials have said they suspect that the assassination was ordered by Kim Jong-un, 33, as part of his effort to consolidate power in the reclusive country, run by his family for nearly seven decades.

Malaysian news media on Thursday quoted officials as saying that the North Korean government had requested the body.

The ambassador’s statement on Friday did not identify the body as that of Kim Jong-nam.

But the statement, quoted by news agencies at the scene, said that the “Malaysian side forced the post-mortem without our permission and witnessing” and that “we will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance.”

Channel NewsAsia, in its account of the ambassador’s response, quoted him as saying, “We will respond strongly to the moves of the hostile forces towards us with their intent to besmirch the image of our republic by politicizing this incident.”

No relatives of Kim Jong-nam have come forward from Macau to claim the body. The South China Morning Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported on Friday that the relatives had been placed under police protection in Macau, fearing for their safety.“What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane,” he said, as the audience guffawed.

In the last few weeks, he told pro-bank senators that he was leaning toward the appointment of new board members, breaking an impasse that has frozen lending and deal-making for more than a year.

“The comments that he did make during the campaign were critical of the bank, and the signal I got was that he was not a supporter,” said Diane Katz, a fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has worked closely with Mr. Trump’s team but opposes the bank as a government intrusion into free markets.

“Since taking office, he has emphasized the refashioning of trade deals to benefit U.S. workers and retaining manufacturing, so there seems to be a change,” she said. “I hope he’s not backtracking. Boeing, the primary beneficiary of the bank, has a market cap of almost $150 billion. They don’t need any more corporate welfare.”Photo

SAN FRANCISCO — Snap, the parent company of the ephemeral-message application Snapchat, on Friday revealed its own story: the video presentation it will use to pitch investors as it prepares to go public in a few weeks.

The more than 35-minute video walks viewers through Snap’s history, audience, products, revenue sources and expansion plans. The main message: Snap is a company where people have genuine, intimate and fun conversations.

Snap backed that contention with reams of data. The average user visits the Snapchat app more than 18 times a day and spends 25 to 30 minutes in it daily. About 60 percent of users send messages, called snaps, every day. And advertisers will pay to get their messages out to Snap’s engaged users.

Beyond the investor pitch, Snap also gave insights into how and why the company created some of its products. The presentation included interviews with Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, and his fellow founder Bobby Murphy, and a more in-depth peek into the company’s culture.

Here are five key moments from the video presentation:

Minute 1 – Snap is Not Just an App

Video

Snap has called itself a camera company for years now, even though it is largely known as an app maker. Mr. Spiegel explains to viewers that this idea stems from the evolution of cameras.

What started out as hardware devices have become software products that connect to the internet. Cameras now augment the way a person communicates, he says, rather than a person’s memory.

“We’re at the beginning of what cameras can do,” Mr. Spiegel tells viewers.

Minute 3 – Snap Is Nostalgic

Video

The interviews with Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy were shot at Snap’s first office building, a beach bungalow near the Venice Beach boardwalk in Los Angeles.

“Our dream had always been to have an office on the beach,” Mr. Spiegel says, pointing to where he and Mr. Murphy envisioned the company’s future.

“It’s pretty surreal being here,” Mr. Murphy says. “We thought it was pretty big for what we needed at the time.”

From beginning to end, the pitch video is filled with sunny shots of Venice Beach and framed photos of Snap’s early days.

Minute 12 – Snap Is Smaller

Video

Snap’s focus on communication between real friends means the network may stay relatively small and intimate. In an age when social networking has been defined by Facebook and its nearly 2 billion users, it might be hard for investors to see why a smaller network can be valuable too.

“One of the challenges we’ve encountered over time is explaining to people why bigger isn’t better,” Mr. Spiegel says.

He argues that what users have actually wanted is “a better way to communicate with the people they really cared about” rather than “more people to communicate with.”

Snap’s ability to provide that intimacy is used throughout the video to argue that its users are more engaged — and therefore a more valuable audience for marketers.

Minute 32 – Snap Is Nice

Video

The internet is filled with stories about how not nice Mr. Spiegel was in college. But in this video, he is presented as a leader who values warmth. Kind, smart and creative are the things that the company really values, Mr. Spiegel says.

What makes Snap different is “the support and love that we show towards each other,” says Mary Ritti, the company’s head of communications.

But that kindness isn’t saccharine, Mr. Spiegel tells viewers. “When I say ‘kind,’ I mean the kind of kind that compels someone to tell someone they have something stuck in their teeth,” he says.

Minute 34 – Snap Likes Feelings

Video

Near the end of the presentation, Mr. Spiegel describes how people from across the company gather every other week, sit in a circle on the floor and talk about their feelings. He says it’s “about empathy and listening.”

That moment caps the video’s message that being good listeners led Snap to take new approaches to social networking. Snapchat tells users’ stories in chronological order, rather than presenting the latest update first as Facebook and Twitter do, and forgoes the likes, shares and hearts users find elsewhere to foster a less competitive experience.

A key value of Snap, Mr. Murphy says, is “empathy with people here and empathy with our user.”Their names are Sally (Deborah Findlay), Lena (Kika Markham) and Vi (June Watson). They swap descriptions of grandchildren, hobbies, former jobs and the many changes their little neighborhood has seen. Occasionally, they bruise one another’s feelings, not always accidentally; and at one blissful point, they erupt into a spontaneous version of the girl-group classic “Da Doo Ron Ron.”

But shadows stir within the mellow afternoon light. Christopher Shutt’s subliminal sound design lends a foreboding edge to the commonplace noises of traffic and children at play. And as you listen to the women — and with these actresses you can’t help but hang on everything they say — you sense a specific, isolating unease in each.

Before the show, which runs under an hour, has concluded, the individual sources of their anxiety will be revealed, in three exquisite monologues that seem to occur in an interior eternity. (Though the scene doesn’t change here, Peter Mumford’s uncannily precise lighting defines each woman as apart at such moments, utterly alone among others.)

But wait. There’s more to “Escaped Alone” than this sustained backyard idyll. At regular intervals, the stage goes black, and when the light returns it’s in the form of two vast, illuminated red rectangles, one within the other, crackling and burning in the dark. Mrs. Jarrett stands before them, all by herself, delivering reports of a future in which nature, poisoned beyond endurance, has run amok.

These Bosch-like accounts are grotesque and whimsical, painting landscapes of destruction from the basic vocabularies of both contemporary culture and ages-old apocalyptic imagery. Stories of life-devouring flood, famine and pestilence are woven with references to such seemingly trivial phenomena as television cooking shows and selfies.

Here, for example, is Mrs. Jarrett on the devastation wrought by a “wind developed by property developers”: “Buildings migrated from London to Lahore, Kyoto to Kansas City, and survivors were interned for having no travel documents. Some in the whirlwind went higher and higher, the airsick families taking selfies in case they could ever share them. Shantytowns were cleared. Pets rained from the sky. A kitten became famous.”

The reality within the surrealism of such descriptions is what makes them stick to your memory. (I saw “Escaped Alone” at the Royal Court Theater in London a year ago, and its images seem to have been in my bloodstream ever since.) Ms. Bassett delivers these monologues not in the ominous style of some otherworldly oracle but in the matter-of-fact, common-woman manner of her character.

As extreme as these visions are, they also feel ineffably linked to the more everyday worries and make-believe speculations (what bird would you like to be?) that have been shared by Sally, Lena and Vi. And there turns out to be more than meets the eye (or ear) to these women, too, as we learn by carefully calibrated degrees what it is that keeps them awake at night.

The play’s combination of theatrical technique and untrammeled imagination, and of the personal and the universal, make you understand why Ms. Churchill is regarded by many (rightly, I think) as the most dazzlingly inventive living dramatist in the English language. No one in theater these days is better at exploding and reassembling traditional modes of language and storytelling.

“Escaped Alone” is a fairy tale of sorts, as were Ms. Churchill’s earlier “The Skriker” and “Faraway.” This magnificent writer’s latest variation on that form reaffirms such tales’ power to warm us even as they warn of the unspeakable dangers in the wide, dark world beyond.Unilever said it had spurned the offer, which it said “fundamentally undervalues” the British-Dutch company.

Still, that is not expected to end the matter. Pressed by growing competition from upstarts and changing consumer habits, food and consumer-goods giants will have little choice but to seek deals.

And 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that bought Heinz, then Kraft just two years ago, has the resources and the good will of Wall Street to continue to pursue Unilever. It also has the support of Warren E. Buffett, who has previously collaborated with 3G and is expected to provide financing in any deal with Unilever.

A combination of Kraft Heinz and Unilever would create an empire of hundreds of household names, with more than $82 billion in sales. Kraft Heinz’s geographic strength in North American packaged-food sales would complement Unilever’s stronger sales in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia.

Kraft Heinz executives have “said they really want to develop and have an international platform for those Kraft Heinz brands,” said Brittany Weissman, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think Unilever would give them that international platform to get those brands out overseas.”

But a merger would be certain to draw antitrust reviews by regulators from many countries.

“Market power would be much increased, as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,” John Colley, a professor of practice in strategy and leadership at Warwick Business School in Coventry, England.

Kraft Heinz approached Unilever about a potential deal in the last few weeks, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations.

Among its pitches, these people said, was that the combined company would maintain headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. That could prove important amid rising nationalist sentiment, given Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and an election approaching in the Netherlands.

Kraft Heinz, with 3G behind the wheel, has long been considered the most likely to drive a wave of consolidation in the food industry. Friday’s disclosure followed speculation late last year that Kraft Heinz might make an offer for Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos and Ritz crackers

Shares of Mondelez, and those of companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup that had been seen as potential targets, fell on Friday in part because of disappointment over news of the Unilever bid. Shares of Kraft Heinz surged nearly 11 percent.

The Brazilian principals of 3G have led a buying spree over two decades to become a global force in food and beverages. In doing so, they have won the admiration of no less a business eminence than Mr. Buffett. They took a small Brazilian brewing company and eventually transformed it into Anheuser-Busch InBev, the 800-pound gorilla of beer.

Kraft Consolidation Consumer goods are consolidating as companies push for more space in the public’s shopping carts.

They moved into fast food by buying Burger King, then merging it with Tim Hortons, Canada’s foremost purveyor of coffee and doughnuts.

And with Mr. Buffett’s help, they bought Heinz in 2013, transforming a staid American ketchup legend into a lean maker of condiments and canned soups. Two years later, in 2015, they bought Kraft to become even bigger.

Now — almost two years after the Kraft deal — 3G and Kraft Heinz are casting their eyes on Unilever, which is the fourth-biggest seller of packaged food worldwide and the second-largest consumer-goods maker behind Procter & Gamble.

Unilever, which is based in London and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has embraced sustainability measures aimed at reducing the company’s environmental impact and improving customers’ health. It has also moved to update its products with younger, hipper names by buying start-ups like Dollar Shave Club and the cleaning products maker Seventh Generation.

And the company has built an important presence in developing countries, which now account for some 58 percent of its revenue.

Still, Unilever has been weighed down by slowing sales in the last year, prompting some analysts to call for additional cost cuts. Combining with Kraft Heinz would leave the company in the hands of masters of cost-cutting, who have won praise from Mr. Buffett.

At Burger King, for example, 3G-installed executives disposed of luxurious corporate offices, the corporate jet and even workers’ personal printers.

At Kraft Heinz, that approach has helped lead to profit margins of about 30 percent, compared with roughly 15 percent at Unilever.

Unilever said that Kraft Heinz’s bid was valued at roughly $50 a share, for an 18 percent premium to the target company’s closing price on Thursday. The offer consists of $30.23 a share in cash and 0.222 in shares in the combined company.

Under British takeover rules, Kraft would have until March 17 to announce its firm intention to make an offer for Unilever or it would have to walk away.

Shares of Unilever jumped in Friday trading in London after The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog reported the offer.

A deal for Unilever would be expensive by any measure, particularly because Kraft Heinz already has nearly $30 billion in long-term debt on its books. But Kraft Heinz has argued in private that it has healthy cash flows that could easily service the additional debt that would help finance the bid.

Potentially further bolstering Kraft Heinz’s firepower is Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which helped finance 3G’s $23 billion purchase of Heinz and its merger with Kraft.

Some analysts, however, were cautious on the prospects of a Unilever sale. Raphael Moreau, an analyst with Euromonitor in London, said that Unilever might ultimately be willing to pursue a smaller deal with Kraft to offload some of its food brands.

“While creating synergies in sauces and soups could be a rationale for such a deal, a combination of Heinz and Hellmann’s in mayonnaise could struggle to be given approval by competition authorities,” Mr. Moreau said.

And some British lawmakers have already criticized Kraft Heinz’s approach, pointing to Brexit and the decline in the pound as paving the way for “fire sales” of British companies.

Tried to install as labor secretary someone who violated labor laws, wants to replace workers with robots and doesn’t believe burger-flippers have the right to a living wage. In announcing a new pick, after the first nominee withdrew, the president bragged about his Electoral College win.

You slap yourself. You douse your head with water. The incompetence, the leaking, the daily indignities. What country is this? Is this behavior normalized? There’s more.

As the first month was coming to a close, he held a news conference and bragged about his Electoral College win while lying about the margin’s place in history. His administration, he said, is a smooth-running machine. “There’s zero chaos.” He spent the majority of his time ranting about the press, then predicted the response: “Tomorrow, they’ll be saying, ‘Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.’ I’m not ranting and raving.”

Through it all, he did manage one truth:

“I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done.”With the House proposal’s rollback of Medicaid payments to the states, it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller.

House Republican leaders asserted in a document describing their plan that they would not “pull the rug out from anyone who received care under states’ Medicaid expansions.”

But Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, expressed alarm, saying the proposals would “put a huge amount of pressure on state budgets and put many Americans at risk of losing health care coverage.”

Sketchy as the outline was, it envisions major changes.

It would fundamentally remake Medicaid, a Great Society program that provides health care to more than 70 million Americans, not just the poor, but also middle-class people who have run out of money and need nursing home care. Under the plan, Medicaid, an open-ended entitlement program designed to cover all health care needs, would be put on a budget.

The Affordable Care Act’s subsidies, which expand as incomes decline, giving the poorer people more help, would be replaced by fixed tax credits to help people purchase insurance policies. The tax credits would increase with a person’s age, but would not vary with a person’s income.

And new incentives for consumers to establish savings accounts to pay medical expenses still assume that workers would have money at the end of a pay period to sock away.

The House Republican plan would also make it easier for consumers to buy health insurance from companies licensed in other states, an idea long promoted by Republicans in Congress and championed by President Trump in his campaign last year.

After the recess, Mr. Ryan said: “We intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. It has become increasingly clear that this law is collapsing. People’s premiums are getting higher and higher. Their deductibles are soaring, and their choices are dwindling.”

Mr. Price told House Republicans that Mr. Trump “is all in on this.”

Mr. Ryan’s presentation on Thursday was meant to generate a sense of momentum for the Republicans’ campaign to eviscerate President Barack Obama’s health care law — a campaign that has been plagued by apprehensions, doubts and divisions among Republicans in the last few weeks.

It was not clear whether the plan as outlined would get Republicans much closer to resolution. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, said that he and other Senate committee chairmen were working with their House counterparts, with the goal of developing a “consensus document.” The House, he said, will probably act first but “will have the input of senators and the president.”

House conservatives are saying that any plan must begin with a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement that looks nothing like it. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, said Republicans needed to talk about replacement measures “in specific terms, not in aspirational terms.”

“We believe that it’s time that we make some very difficult decisions and move forward,” Mr. Meadows said.

Any plan that can satisfy House conservatives would face great uncertainty in the more moderate Senate.

The plan unveiled on Thursday by House Republican leaders would make huge changes in Medicaid. It would eventually undo the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary. As an alternative, they said, a state could receive a lump sum of federal money for all of its Medicaid program, or a block grant.

In either case, the federal government would gradually reduce the extra payments it makes to states that have expanded Medicaid under the 2010 health care law. States could continue providing Medicaid to the newly eligible beneficiaries, but the federal share of the costs would decline to the regular federal share of Medicaid costs for other beneficiaries.

The federal government now pays more than 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries in states that expanded Medicaid. Under the House Republican plan, the federal share would decline to 50 percent in states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, resulting in a significant loss of federal revenue.

In a number of states that have expanded Medicaid, Republican governors and Republican members of Congress have made clear that they do not like the idea of a block grant or a per-beneficiary allotment.

The Congressional Budget Office says that 12 million people have insurance because they became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and it estimates that federal spending for this group will be $70 billion this year.

The House Republican plan would immediately eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have insurance and employers that do not offer it.

It would also eliminate taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the 2010 health care law. These include fees collected from health insurance companies and manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and an excise tax on makers of medical devices.

House Republicans have repeatedly said that they would continue providing some protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions. But the document describing their proposal does not say how they would do that.

Mr. Ryan said the tax credits envisioned by House Republicans were different from those provided in the Affordable Care Act.

Under that law, the tax credits are available only for insurance products that meet detailed federal standards and are purchased through an insurance exchange like HealthCare.gov.

By contrast, Mr. Ryan said, with the Republican version of tax credits, people can “buy the health insurance plan of their choosing,” which could cost less and have less generous coverage than the plans now available.

“You get the freedom to do what you want and buy what you need,” Mr. Ryan said.

During a transition period, House Republicans would continue “Obamacare subsidies,” but they would provide a little more assistance to young people and a little less to older Americans.

The House Republican plan would provide an unspecified amount of money for “innovation grants,” which states could use to help defray consumers’ out-of-pocket costs or to establish “high-risk pools” for people with serious chronic conditions.Photo

By slotting its new “Crashing” right after “Girls” on Sunday night, HBO seems to be hoping for some carry-over synergy, what with both series bearing the Judd Apatow fingerprint. But the contrast is what stands out, and not in a good way.

“Girls,” with the distinctive voice and perspective of Lena Dunham, seemed fresh and surprising when it first hit the air. “Crashing” feels like just another sad-clown story centered on a white male comic.

The show stars the comedian Pete Holmes playing a comedian named Pete — yes, you can insert the obligatory “fictional version of himself” phrase here. The dual-purpose title refers to the fact that as the show opens, his life is crashing down around him, which eventually forces Pete to crash at a series of fellow comedians’ apartments.

The couch-hopping gimmick is moderately amusing. The premiere finds Pete bunking with Artie Lange; T. J. Miller and Sarah Silverman are among those who put him up later. All play themselves, real comics mentoring, in a way, the fictional Pete.

But a gimmick doesn’t get you very far if your main character is as drab as Pete. He’s without a home because, minutes into the episode, he walks in on his wife, Jess (Lauren Lapkus), while she’s in bed with another man (George Basil). End of marriage. (Mr. Holmes, who in reality is a thriving stand-up comic, has said he drew on his own failed marriage in creating the show.)

The more you learn about Pete, the more you understand Jess’s interest in extracurricular activity. He’s another example of the character that TV and films find inexplicably fascinating: the man-boy, in this case one who appears to have never had a job. He went straight from his mama’s knee into an early marriage with Jess, who has been supporting him while he tries to break into stand-up comedy.

If nothing else, “Crashing” may perform a public service by discouraging other would-be comics from pursuing this already overcrowded career, since Pete’s ordeals on the club circuit are painful to watch. It doesn’t help that he’s a terrible comic, at least until the show needs him to be a better one — in Episode 6, he suddenly finds a groove at an opportune moment. It’s an amusing episode (it’s the one with Ms. Silverman) but also feels disingenuous given what has come before.

Pete is unusual in a business full of potty mouths in that he has a Christian background and works clean, which could be interesting. But it’s an attribute that the show doesn’t so much explore as merely mention from time to time. In truth, the show doesn’t explore much of anything; it, like its central character, just meanders along.

“Crashing” is yet another comedy that is less interested in jokes than in wringing laughs out of awkward or humiliating situations, but it feels primitive compared with shows like, say, the FX series “Baskets.” As for fashioning a TV series out of the stand-up life, it’s not nearly as sophisticated as “Louie” or “Seinfeld” or most of the others. It’s pleasant enough, with enjoyable guest stars, but it comes too late in the evolution of this genre to make much of an impression.Unilever said it had spurned the offer, which it said “fundamentally undervalues” the British-Dutch company.

And some British lawmakers have already criticized Kraft Heinz’s approach, pointing to Brexit and the decline in the pound as paving the way for “fire sales” of British companies.

The chairman of Parliament’s business committee, Iain Wright, said on Friday that “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality.”“What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane,” he said, as the audience guffawed.

Mr. Trump, fresh off his raucous news conference in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, seemed thrilled to escape the marble political prison of the executive complex — and to break free from a narrative of chaos and infighting that has characterized his rocky and eventful presidential debut.

He left Washington after a week of humbling setbacks that included the forced withdrawal of his choice for labor secretary and the firing of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, in the wake of reports that Mr. Flynn misled investigators and Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to Washington.

The president’s trip came hours after the man he chose to replace Mr. Flynn, retired Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward, turned him down. He has plans to meet with other candidates this weekend in Florida.

Mr. Trump’s appearance at the manufacturing complex, in a state he won by 15 points in November, vividly illustrated the second side of his split-screen presidency. It was a disciplined drumbeat of events, including meetings with labor and business leaders intended to demonstrate his commitment to ensuring working-class economic security. That was the pledge that moved skeptical swing state voters to his cause.

“There’s the palace intrigue story about them not being very well coordinated, that the White House isn’t ready for prime time, that he’s still setting things up,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and frequent Trump critic. “There’s a lot of cracks in the armor. And then you have the whole Flynn situation.”

“But you have a very disciplined president when it comes to economic messaging,” said Mr. Graham, who was in Washington on Friday with the Senate in session. “How can that be? I just think he’s more comfortable talking about how we are going to make America a better place for jobs than he is at articulating foreign policy.”

Mr. Trump, a president obsessed with optics, could not have chosen a more impressive backdrop to emphasize his commitment to preserving jobs. His staff spent about a week prepping for his visit to the facility here, a six-story factory hangar with four massive Dreamliners under construction, cowlings peeled back to expose the inner workings of the engines, signs affixed to their bodies to indicate their purchasers — in one case, Aeroméxico.

The visit came two days after Boeing workers in the state rejected an attempt by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to unionize the production line.

South Carolina is a so-called right-to-work state, with a low level of union participation. Since it began production here in 2009, Boeing has hired 7,500 employees spread around several facilities, investing more than $2 billion in land and infrastructure, while spending about $355 million each year on local suppliers and vendors, according to the company.

“This is our house, and our house is going to remain union free!” said Joan Robinson-Berry, one of plant’s managers, to the applause of about 2,000 employees and local officials who gathered for the president’s visit.

But that was about it for substance or controversy.

Mr. Trump has criticized Boeing for what he suggested was an overpriced Air Force One replacement. On Friday, he repeated that “the price is too high” but also noted that “we’re negotiating.” Referring to one of Boeing’s major competitors, he said: “We love Lockheed. Great partner.”

The president also said more explicitly than before that the Pentagon would consider buying more Boeing F/A-18 fighters in place of some of the Lockheed Martin F-35s that it had planned to order if Lockheed does not keep lowering the price of the F-35. “If the price doesn’t come down, we would,” he said. Now that Boeing has made it somewhat stealthier, he said, “The F-18’s a great plane.”

Some in the president’s own party, including Mr. Graham, had hoped he would use the trip to announce his support for the embattled Export-Import Bank, a financing partner for Boeing and other companies battling foreign-based competitors. He did not.

The bank is a New Deal-era institution that helps American companies operating overseas arrange and guarantee loans for international customers. It has jokingly been called “the Bank of Boeing,” because the Chicago-based aerospace giant has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the bank’s efforts, with as much of a third of Ex-Im financing deals being steered to help the company win contracts against competitors like Europe’s Airbus.

Mr. Trump, who promised to drain the Washington “swamp,” did not stake out a position on the bank during the 2016 campaign. But he joined the chorus of conservatives and progressive Democrats — ranging from Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, to Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont — who have described the bank as corporate welfare. In one campaign appearance, Mr. Trump called some of the bank’s deals “featherbedding.”

But the president has softened his stance considerably since the inauguration, as he has moved his focus from assuaging his party’s base to fulfilling big campaign promises on jobs, trade and manufacturing. In the last few weeks, he told pro-bank senators that he was leaning toward the appointment of new board members, breaking an impasse that has frozen lending and deal-making for more than a year.

“The comments that he did make during the campaign were critical of the bank, and the signal I got was that he was not a supporter,” said Diane Katz, a fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has worked closely with Mr. Trump’s team but opposes the bank as a government intrusion into free markets.

“Since taking office, he has emphasized the refashioning of trade deals to benefit U.S. workers and retaining manufacturing, so there seems to be a change,” she said. “I hope he’s not backtracking. Boeing, the primary beneficiary of the bank, has a market cap of almost $150 billion. They don’t need any more corporate welfare.”“You can make it go fast, and you can make it be cheap — but not if you adhere to the standard of care that we do,” said Mark Cooper of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, referring to the United States regulatory body, which is considered one of the most meticulous in the world. “Nuclear safety always undermines nuclear economics. Inherently, it’s a technology whose time never comes.”

In the process, the United States could lose considerable influence over standards governing safety and waste management, nuclear experts say. And the world may show less willingness to move toward potentially safer designs.

“I’m concerned that if the U.S. is not seen as a big player, and doesn’t have that kind of market presence, that we won’t be in a competitive position to bring those standards back up,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia. “If you’ve got more lax safety standards worldwide, I think that’s a problem from an industry perspective as well as just a human standard.”

This may be an advantage for state-owned nuclear industries worldwide. Often they benefit from long-term national policies in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

By contrast, the Toshiba-Westinghouse withdrawal from nuclear construction shows how daunting it can be for the private sector to build these plants, even with generous government subsidies like loan guarantees and tax credits. Projects take decades to complete. Safety concerns change along the way, leading to new regulations, thousands of design alterations, delays and spiraling costs for every element.

In one case, even the dirt used to backfill excavated holes at the Westinghouse project in Georgia became a point of contention when it did not measure up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, leading to increased costs and a lawsuit.

Thus far in the United States, only the Tennessee Valley Authority, itself a government corporation, has been able to bring a new nuclear reactor into operation in the last 20 years.

Of the dozens of new reactors once up for licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only four are actively under construction. Two are at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, and two at the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Both projects, which plan to use a novel reactor from Westinghouse, have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, some stemming, paradoxically, from an untested regulatory system intended to simplify and accelerate their development.

The projects, more than three years late and billions over budget, are what pushed Westinghouse — one of the last private companies building nuclear reactors — and its parent, Toshiba, to the brink of financial ruin, resulting in Toshiba’s chairman stepping down.

The company has said that Westinghouse will complete the reactors for the projects it already has underway, including two in China. But the fate of other projects in the United States and abroad that plan to use the Westinghouse reactor, known as the AP1000, are in doubt, along with the role of the United States in the future of nuclear energy. It is also unclear how President Trump will approach nuclear energy development, which has broad and overlapping implications for tax and trade policies, economic development and national security.

The AP1000 is considered one of the world’s most advanced reactors, with simplified structures and safety equipment which were intended to make it easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. It has been designed with an improved ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima.

The industry has lurched through boom and bust cycles before.

Nuclear construction had all but disappeared in the United States, particularly after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Concerns over climate change led to renewed interest in building new plants under the administration of George W. Bush, however. The Bush-era energy policy acts authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees, plus tax credits like those available for wind and solar.

Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and ’80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process.

Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly.

In the meantime, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric were developing a new generation of reactors intended to operate more safely. With the AP1000, for instance, emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces, like gravity, to propel the coolant, rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity. The problem is that electricity can fail, as it did at Fukushima, which can lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design.

In addition, Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components of the plants could be made in sections at factories, then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site. In theory, this approach would save money and time, requiring far less skilled labor than the old, bespoke approach, in which workers assembled more parts onsite.

By 2008, Westinghouse had deals to expand two existing plants with the electric utilities Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric & Gas. Little went as hoped.

Because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components, like the 300-ton reactor vessels. Instead, they were manufactured overseas, adding to expense and delays.

One reactor vessel, headed for Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant from the Port of Savannah, almost slipped off a specialized rail car. That led to a weekslong delay before a second attempt was made to deliver it.

And, in a separate snafu, while working on the plant’s basement contractors installed 1,200 tons of steel reinforcing bar in a way that differed from the approved design. That triggered a seven-and-a-half month delay to get a license amendment.

To some extent, the unexpected delays were to be, well, expected, given the novelty of the design and the fact that builders were decades out of practice. Any large undertaking involving so many first-of-a-kind complexities would be likely get tripped up somewhere, said Daniel S. Lipman, vice president of supplier and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry.

“Whether you’re building a nuclear power plant or providing a new locomotive or a new fighter jet complex for the Defense Department, the first of a kind almost always takes longer to be deployed,” he said.

And then there was Fukushima, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out both grid and backup emergency power at the plant, disabling its cooling systems and leading to the meltdown of three reactors. The plant remains shut down, and the decommissioning and cleanup process is projected to take as long as 40 years.

The Japan disaster prompted regulators to revisit safety standards, slowing approval of the Westinghouse designs and resulting in new requirements even after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the go-ahead for the Georgia and South Carolina projects. That led to more costly delays as manufacturing orders had to be changed.

As all of that unfolded, Westinghouse was having troubles with the contractor it chose to complete the projects, a company that struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of still-unresolved disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction.

Toshiba, which would like to sell all or part of its controlling interest in Westinghouse, has said it will continue to look into Westinghouse’s handling of the purchase.

“Certainly they underestimated the amount of liability or cost overruns that these projects were in,” Robert Norfleet, a managing director at Alembic Global Advisors who has followed the machinations, said of Westinghouse. “I don’t really know how they can’t take the blame for that. That’s something within their own due diligence that they needed to do.”

In the meantime, the main stage for nuclear development will move overseas to places like China, Russia, India, Korea and a handful of countries in the Middle East, where Westinghouse will have to find partners to build its designs.

In China, plants using an earlier model of the AP1000 are moving toward completion. If they are successful, that may stir up more interest in the technology, and future installations may go more smoothly. But Toshiba’s ambitions of installing 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030 no longer look feasible.

Indeed, despite the much-ballyhooed ingenuity of a new generation of reactors designed by the likes of Westinghouse and G.E., countries may stick with older technologies that they can produce and install more quickly and cheaply. “Until several of these new designs — including the AP1000 from Westinghouse — come online on time and on budget,” said Brent Wanner, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, “it will be an uphill battle.”President Trump spoke about his executive orders, the economy and his polls. We checked the facts.Photo

It’s with a whiff of desperation that President Trump insists these days that he’s the chief executive Washington needs, the decisive dealmaker who, as he said during the campaign, “alone can fix it.” What America has seen so far is an inept White House led by a celebrity apprentice.

This president did not inherit “a mess” from Barack Obama, as he likes to say, but a nation recovered from recession and with strong alliances abroad. Mr. Trump is well on his way to creating a mess of his own, weakening national security and even risking the delivery of basic government services. Most of the top thousand jobs in the administration remain vacant. Career public servants are clashing with inexperienced “beachhead” teams appointed by the White House to run federal agencies until permanent staff members arrive.

Mr. Trump lost his national security adviser this week in a scandal involving ties to Russian intelligence. Robert Harward, a retired vice admiral, refused the job on Thursday, rattled by a dysfunctional National Security Council and a president who has alienated Mexico, Australia and even the British royal family, while cozying up to Moscow.

When Mr. Trump’s assistants can keep the edge of panic out of their voices, they insist that Mr. Trump has gotten more done in the early going than most presidents. And Mr. Trump is so adept at creating smoke that Americans might be forgiven for thinking that’s true. But at this point in the Obama presidency, which did inherit a mess, Congress had passed laws aimed at dragging the economy back from the brink of depression while committing $800 billion in Recovery Act spending to projects ranging from housing to roads to advanced energy technologies.

Mr. Trump’s vaunted $1 trillion infrastructure spending program, by contrast, doesn’t yet exist, because the president confuses executive orders with achievements. Orders are dashed off without input from Congress and the government officials who would implement them. The White House is a toxic mix of ideology, inexperience and rivalries; insiders say tantrums are nearly as common as the spelling errors in the press office’s news releases. Steve Bannon writes the president’s script, and Reince Priebus, the embattled chief of staff, crashes meetings to which he has not been invited.

Mr. Trump complains about the slow pace of congressional confirmation of his appointees, but the obstacle is at his end. His staff doesn’t bother to vet nominees in advance. His pick for labor secretary failed in part because no one in authority seemed to know that the nominee had employed an undocumented immigrant and had been accused of abusing his ex-wife.

“Everything he rolls out is done so badly,” Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, marveled recently. “They’re just releasing comments, tweets and policies willy-nilly.”

If there is any upside here, it is that the administration’s ineptitude has so far spared the nation from a wholesale dismantling of major laws, including the Affordable Care Act, though he may yet kill the law through malign neglect. In the meantime, however, as Mr. Harward’s retreat on Thursday suggests, the chaos carries other risks. A Navy SEAL turned corporate executive, Mr. Harward cited family and financial considerations for refusing the national security job, but privately he was reported to be worried about the effect of a mercurial president on national security decision making. As Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, said this week: “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon, because we’re a nation at war.”

The most damaging downside to the administration’s stumbles could be an exodus of talent from the broader government; scientists, lawyers and policy specialists at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, are openly disheartened at the prospect of working for Scott Pruitt, whose nomination as the agency’s new boss was approved by the Senate on Friday. And if others follow Mr. Hayward’s lead, capable people may be reluctant to come on board and fix things. That would leave the White House further isolated, particularly on foreign policy.

Indeed, unless Mr. Trump can bring some semblance of order to his official household and governing style, the only element of his famous campaign pledge that may prove accurate is the “alone” part.Photo

When the chef Meriko Gubeladze opened Shavi Lomi, she recalled that Tbilisi was “starving for small, homey restaurants with good food.” That was 2011, and the quality of Georgian cuisine — known for its lavish use of spices and aromatic herbs influenced by travelers along the Silk Road — wasn’t the problem, but the uninviting establishments and menu selections — hangovers from the cookie-cutter days of the Soviet era — were. Artery-clogging khachapuri, the cheesy bread often likened to pizza, still tempted. But at every meal? How often could a person eat walnut-paste-stuffed vegetables and a lamb stew called chakapuli, a favorite dish of Stalin. Four years after Shavi Lomi updated these seasonal family recipes, serving them in a cozy atmosphere, other restaurants soon followed suit.

Photo

Tbilisi today has a reimagined dining scene. Instead of the same standard-issue 10 dishes, post-Soviet restaurants are bringing a humble magic to dining in Georgia’s capital city, with a focus on all things organic.

If sumptuous flavors and a living-room-like setting with bright carpets and heirloom batik tablecloths were Shavi Lomi’s contributions, promoting organic food and natural wine was the province of Vino Underground, a popular natural-wine bar and salon just around the corner.

Photo

Between those two pioneering forces, a peaceful culinary revolution began. More than a half-dozen homey restaurants have opened with prideful Georgian menus proclaiming organic status for both food and wine. With the current exchange rate, the experience is not only exciting, but also often a bargain.

This culinary fever also has spread from the traditional tourist area, the sandstone crumbling Old City, to Tbilisi’s more contemporary quarters across the Kura River. Now bargain hunters heading to the Dry Bridge Market, an enclave to buy drinking horns and Soviet memorabilia, can reward their appetite without compromise. Shavi Lomi has relocated there. Another hot spot is Barbarestan, housed in an old butcher shop with meat hooks still visible and caged singing canaries. Family-owned, the restaurant drew its menu from Georgia’s beloved 19th-century cookbook by Barbare Jorjadze, who celebrated the Silk Road influence of her country’s cuisine. While her cookbook remains a strong influence on other local dining spots too, Barbarestan’s fare shows fealty in all details. Ghee, clarified butter, is used exclusively. The nadugi — a typical fresh cheese spread and stuffing — gets a vegan spin when substituting Ms. Jorjadze’s recipe for pumpkinseed milk.

Photo

But the culinary action has especially taken hold in the heart of the Old City. There, behind the gilded and imposing St. George statue in Freedom Square, three restaurants have opened. Strolling the quiet streets, this visitor was pleasantly surprised to come across Ezo, tucked in a residential courtyard. Ezo, its name meaning yard, opened two years ago, and while it’s rustic, don’t be fooled. One can feast like the 12th-century Queen Tamara there for $25 per person. Many of the flavorful organic ingredients are from the owners’ farm.

Proletariat options like the salt-cured jonjoli (bladdernut flowers), staples on any Georgian table, get an unusual twist with familiar walnut garlic sauce. Tender veal in herbs is a customer magnet. Wash it down with glugs of family chacha (grappa) for an authentic accent. Walk another few minutes, on uneven cobblestones and broken sidewalks, past unmarked boutiques and fruit stalls that never seem to shut, and you will find the more upscale Azarphesha, now four years old. With walls of museum-worthy displays showcasing ancient drinking vessels, the restaurant remains of the moment. Yet with its mix of traditional tablecloths and fresh wild posies, the room couldn’t feel less pretentious, especially when a table spontaneously burst out in the traditional, emotional polyphonic village songs, as often happens.

Husband and wife Nino and Luarsab Togonidze joined with a friend, the American expatriate painter and winemaker John Wurdeman, and fashioned a fascinating Georgian fusion menu. Their riff on the country’s strong pickle culture is emblematic; take the kimchee-like banana peppers with local-toasted sunflower-seed oil. Even with its hints of Peru or Mexico, it tastes of home. From its geek-worthy wine list, all organic and natural, to its foraged juniper gins, the philosophy is uncompromising.

In December, the three opened a new restaurant, Poliphonia, considered one of the best eating spots in town.

Reflecting on the city’s restaurant renaissance, Mr. Togonidze said the country’s recent political calm was only part of the story: “Compounded with a new generation who have grown up in freedom with the excitement about natural wine, how could that energy not spill over to the table?” he said. “After all, in Georgia, wine and food have always been intertwined.”Several people at the conference instantly took note on Twitter of Ms. Von der Leyen’s phrasing, including Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

Vice President Mike Pence, who arrived in Munich on Friday night; Mr. Mattis; Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, a few miles up the road in Bonn — have all spent much of the week soothing European ears, presenting traditional Republican national security orthodoxy of confronting Russia, supporting NATO and backing democratic institutions.

But every time they seemed to be getting traction in convincing skittish diplomats that Mr. Trump was not about to abandon decades of American national security policy, their boss did something in Washington that undercut their work.

The result has been confusion among global leaders about whom to believe when it comes to the direction of American national security.

The reassuring message Mr. Trump’s subordinates have sought to convey has been further undermined by some of his own Republican critics.

Senator John McCain, whose disdain for Mr. Trump is well known, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the Munich conference that Michael T. Flynn’s resignation as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser over his Russia liaisons was “something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do.”

The contradictions have abounded. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed to abandon a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, asserting that he was not committed to a two-state solution. Twenty-four hours later, his United Nations envoy said, “We absolutely support a two-state solution,” adding that the administration simply wanted a “thinking out of the box” approach about resolving one of the world’s intractable conflicts.

The same day that Mr. Trump questioned the two-state approach, Mr. Mattis was at NATO headquarters telling allies that the commitment of the United States to NATO remained firm. But Mr. Mattis also echoed his boss when he warned that the United States might “moderate” its support if other member countries did not spend more on the military.

Photo

The next day, still at NATO, Mr. Mattis was back to saying that the American commitment to NATO was unshakable. He said the Trump administration’s “commitment to Article 5 remains solid,” referring to NATO’s principle that an attack on one is an attack on all.

European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief again, until Mr. Trump held a prolonged and chaotic news conference a few hours later in Washington.

“Let’s put it this way, the discrepancy between the president’s news conference and the way his cabinet is trying to reassure Europeans couldn’t be wider,” said Michael Werz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who was at the Munich conference.

Volker Perthes, the head of SWP, a policy research group based in Germany, said: “Mattis speaks of ‘defending the rules-based international order.’ I hope he can explain this to his boss.”

What appeared to rattle people the most about Mr. Trump’s news conference on Thursday were his attacks on members of the news media assembled before him. Several diplomats said they worried that Mr. Trump was trying to discredit a tenet of American democracy — a free press — and in so doing, might embolden despots around the world into further challenges to freedom of the press.

Struggling to explain how to assess the seeming chaos coming out of Washington, Michael Fallon, Britain’s defense minister, told reporters, “You know, new administrations, you know, can take time to settle down.”

In the crowded lounges and refined tearooms of Munich’s Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where leaders and top officials were mingling, much of the talk on Friday was not about the panels on issues like “the future of the European Union: united or divided,” or “the future of the West: downfall or comeback?”

Instead, it was about Mr. Trump’s Thursday news conference, which appeared to deeply unnerve a number of officials. Overheard conversations included one in which one European official said that the United States was now on the list of “risk factors” for Europe, echoing a concern expressed two weeks earlier by Donald Tusk, head of the European Council. German officials joked that American diplomats and civil service organizations could now qualify for German democracy funding — money designated for countries with struggling democratic institutions.

Several people seemed on edge awaiting what Mr. Mattis would say when he addressed the conference. When he finally approached the lectern, he sounded exactly like numerous other American chiefs who have preceded him.

“The trans-Atlantic bond remains our strongest bulwark against instability and violence,” he said. “I am confident that we will strengthen our partnerships, confronting those who choose to attack innocent people or our democratic processes and freedoms.”

Mr. Mattis, Mr. Nasr said after the speech, “is the one island of stability.” But, he added, “the key is that nobody knows the extent of his influence. Right now, we’re tight with trans-Atlantic unity, but who knows what to believe?”

Ms. Von der Leyen, the German defense minister, used her time at the lectern before Mr. Mattis spoke to deliver a warning to the Trump administration about putting cooperation with Russia ahead of its alliances in Europe — or even on the same footing for that matter.

“Our American friends know well that your tone on Europe and NATO has a direct impact on the cohesion of our continent,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “There cannot be a policy of equidistance to allies and to those who openly question our values, our borders and international law.”

Ms. Von der Leyen also criticized Mr. Trump’s efforts to close American borders to refugees from around the world and suspend immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. (Those efforts have been blocked by American courts.)

“We should be careful that this fight does not become a front against Islam and Muslims,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “Otherwise, we run the risk of digging ourselves into a deeper grave in which violence and terror only grow further.”I do not often blush while sitting in the darkness of an opera house. But when Massenet’s “Werther” opened at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday evening and the tenor Vittorio Grigolo declared his love for the young, respectable Charlotte, artfully weaving and fervently flinging vocal lines at and around her, I’m not embarrassed to admit I found myself getting flushed.

“My entire soul is in these lines,” Werther cries during one of his many fits of passion. When Mr. Grigolo sings the role, you believe it. Both brazen and intimate, his muscular voice crinkling with emotion, he may be the most galvanically convincing singer in the world today.

Mr. Grigolo, who sings “Werther” four more times through March 4, does blood and guts, but stylishly. He understands that opera is a careful calibration of explosion and control, and he manipulates that balance to leave you — as you’re left when watching all the best operatic performances — in a state of both satisfied delight and sustained, agonizing tension.

Video

As Werther, a sensitive poet who falls for the sweet, responsible Charlotte (Isabel Leonard) even though she has promised to marry another man, Mr. Grigolo restlessly stalks the picturesquely askew sets of Richard Eyre’s production. On Thursday both his movements and his arias seemed like sudden, spontaneous decisions, eruptions out of repression.

Early on, some soft, hovering phrases felt faked and toneless: The role ideally calls for more evenness and refinement than Mr. Grigolo can summon in the crucial transitional space — called, in French, the “voix mixte,” or mixed voice — between a singer’s high, airy “head voice” and his fuller, brawnier “chest voice.” But if Mr. Grigolo moves through the different parts of his instrument more like a bulldozer than a cat, he is always earnest and involving, his heart on his sleeve and his energy unflagging.

Photo

He was matched, effusion for effusion, in the orchestra pit. Massenet’s lush scores can easily wilt, but on Thursday, Edward Gardner led a performance that was sumptuous without ever slogging — not grandly imposing but straightforward and sincere. Lyrical expansion never stinted on forward-moving vigor, right up to the slashing grimaces in the low strings at the very end.

Photo

The coolly elegant Ms. Leonard was a Charlotte more sophisticated than humble, but she was superbly polished, her voice smooth and supple. If she sometimes seemed to be waiting, prettily and patiently, for another, more patrician Werther — as far as classic Met comparisons go, Mr. Grigolo was likely closer to fiery Franco Corelli than discreet Alfredo Kraus — her silvery grace was a foil to his heat. While the two made an exceptionally handsome couple, they only seemed truly on the same page when their longstanding attempts to deny their love went seriously south near the end of the opera, prompting — spoiler alert — Werther’s prolonged death scene. (They have a stage kiss you won’t soon forget.)

In the thankless role of Albert, the pleasantly dull fellow Charlotte marries instead of Werther, David Bizic was pleasantly, robustly dull. Maurizio Muraro sang with jocular heartiness, and a lovely helping of tenderness, as the Bailiff, Charlotte’s father, and Anna Christy was perky if wiry-toned as Sophie, her kid sister.

The Met has done well by Massenet of late: “Manon” in 2015, with Mr. Grigolo and his best partner, Diana Damrau, as a combustible central couple; this lovingly revived “Werther”; and, next season, both the Cinderella opera “Cendrillon,” starring the radiant Joyce DiDonato, and the exotic “Thaïs,” thoughtfully cast with Ailyn Pérez, Jean-François Borras and Gerald Finley.

But the situation has not always been so impressive. When Mr. Eyre’s “Werther” staging had its premiere in 2014, with Jonas Kaufmann and Sophie Koch as the star-crossed couple, it felt mannered and detached. This new revival could not be more different, and if there is very little gentility about it, nor much of the poised stylization of traditional French style, it has a vitality that is utterly arresting. This is a fully Italianate Massenet: A Grigolo has crashed Paris.

And if he was irresistible as an impulsively romantic, eventually suicidal young man in the Met’s “Roméo et Juliette” last month, he is just as unmissable as the impulsively romantic, eventually suicidal young Werther.The most recent Gallup survey, the first conducted entirely after the resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser, has Mr. Trump’s approval rating down to 38 percent, with 56 percent disapproving (a differential of minus 18).

Mr. Trump’s ratings aren’t just bad for an incoming president. They’re bad for a president at any point in a term.

Here’s what it took for past presidents to reach an approval rating differential of minus 15 or worse:

■ Harry Truman reached it in September 1946, after serving in office for more than a year. His ratings had been slipping since the end of World War II, in part because of the pain of demobilization and a wave of labor strikes. His party lost 55 seats in the midterm elections that year.

■ Dwight Eisenhower’s approval rating and differential never fell as low as Mr. Trump’s current ones. Neither did John Kennedy’s.

■ Lyndon Johnson had already decided not to run for re-election, and his approval rating dropped beneath 40 percent, with a differential of minus 18, in an August 1968 poll. He was facing strong criticism over the war in Vietnam.

■ In the midst of the Watergate scandal in July 1973, Richard Nixon refused to turn over White House tapes. By mid-August, Gallup registered Mr. Nixon at a differential of minus 18 and an approval rating of 36 percent. Leading up to his resignation a year later, his ratings were mired in the 20s.

■ Gerald Ford didn’t win re-election, and his ratings were often weak — he fell into the upper 30s — but a majority of Americans never disapproved of his performance in Gallup surveys, and he didn’t come close to reaching minus 15.

■ Jimmy Carter was dragged down to differentials greater than minus 20 by midsummer of 1979, after the Iranian revolution brought a new round of oil shocks.

■ A recession with 10 percent unemployment was enough to drag Ronald Reagan’s approval rating to 35 percent by early 1983, with a minus-21 differential, although that level of unpopularity didn’t last long.

■ A weak economy cost George H.W. Bush in early 1992. The unemployment rate peaked at 7.8 percent, and he was facing a third-party challenge from Ross Perot. In June of that year, his differential was greater than minus 15.

■ Bill Clinton’s ratings fell into the upper 30s in June 1993, as the debate over whether to allow gays in the military peaked in Congress, but his disapproval rating didn’t go over 50 percent in that period. He fell to around a minus-15 differential in Gallup polls in September 1994, just after his attempt at health care reform was declared dead. Two months later, the Democrats lost control of Congress.

■ Hurricane Katrina reached Category 5 status on Aug. 28, 2005. A few days before, Gallup released a survey showing George W. Bush’s approval rating down to 39 percent, with a differential of minus 16. The Iraq War and high oil prices had already taken a toll on his standing.

■ Mr. Obama’s approval rating finally fell beneath 40 percent in August 2011, with differentials of around minus 15 and slightly worse. It was when the economy was still staggered after the Great Recession, just after the debt-ceiling crisis and well after the Democrats lost control of Congress.

So no, not great company. It is especially striking how low Mr. Trump’s ratings are given the state of the national economy.

In many of those examples, this level of approval presaged a disaster for a president’s party in the midterm elections. FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten pointed out that a 40 percent approval rating would put the president’s party on track to lose around 40 seats in the House. The Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House next year.

But there are at least a few reasons for Mr. Trump and the Republicans to think things aren’t quite as bleak as Gallup, Pew and the history of presidential approval ratings might suggest.

For one, there are reputable polls with more favorable findings for Mr. Trump. A recent Fox News poll of registered voters gave Mr. Trump a 48 percent approval rating. Registered voters are whiter and older than all adults, which explains part of why Mr. Trump fared better in the Fox poll. But it doesn’t explain it all; the Pew Research survey gave Mr. Trump a 42 percent rating among registered voters.

Similarly, online surveys have consistently shown Mr. Trump with a higher approval rating than those conducted by telephone. On average, Mr. Trump’s ratings have been 10 points better in online polls.

It’s not the first time that live interview and online surveys have split over Mr. Trump’s popularity. He did better in online surveys throughout the Republican primary, leading many to speculate that there was a hidden Trump vote of poll respondents who were afraid to admit their support to a live interviewer — a phenomenon known as social desirability bias.

But the results didn’t quite back up the theory in the end. Mr. Trump won the primaries by the comfortable margin predicted by live interview telephone surveys, not the landslide implied by online polls. And the gap between online and live interview pollsters faded during the general election. Mr. Trump actually fared better in the final live interview polls than the final online polls. The live interview polls also came closer to the mark in the national popular vote.

Does that mean the live interview polls are right this time? Not necessarily. In general, taking an average of polls is a safer way to go. By that measure, Mr. Trump’s approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s.

The Republicans can also breathe easier about congressional control because so many are safely ensconced in reliably Republican districts. The Republican grip on the House is so strong that it gives the party a much better chance to ride out a president’s weak approval ratings than in the past.

Here’s one way to think about it: Democrats might not take the chamber with a victory on the scale of their huge win in 2006, when they gained 30 seats, or on the scale of the Republican sweep in 2010, which garnered 63 seats. With so many Republican seats safely out of play, a similarly impressive win might still leave the Democrats short of House control.

In 2006 and 2010, Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama had approval ratings near or above 40 percent on Election Day. So if you had to make a rough guess, you would probably say that Mr. Trump’s approval rating would probably need to be even lower for House control to become a true tossup.

Let’s imagine a rough model of congressional elections since 2002, based on recent presidential election results by congressional district and the president’s approval rating. You would guess that Mr. Trump’s approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average heading into the midterm election would need to be around 35 percent for the Democrats to be an even-money bet for a House takeover. You should note that the pre-election approval polls are often polls of likely voters, an even whiter and older group of voters than registered voters, so Mr. Trump’s rating among all adults would probably need to be a bit lower.

But really, what’s striking is that we’re even having this conversation at all at this time. In general, a president’s approval rating is at its peak in the first month. Mr. Trump could easily slip further. If his ratings average falls into the mid-to-low 30s, the Republicans could be in serious trouble.They were living in Washington, D.C., at the time, but Ms. Martin had just landed a job at a nonprofit in Manhattan. The plan was that Mr. Hamilton, a philosophy Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland who dreamed of being a writer, would join her once he was done teaching that semester.

The room they moved into was barely 100 square feet, and they had to sneak around so the hotel’s then-manager, Stanley Bard, wouldn’t find out they were subletting (though he did soon enough). They also had to leave every few months when the musician came back to maintain his tenancy.

“We were so happy to get in this place,” said Mr. Hamilton. “Everyone was an artist or a writer or a musician of some sort. When we moved in, we lived next to a punk rocker, an old blues guy and a violinist. There was an unspoken rule that you could just wander into whatever party you wanted to. It was a very accepting place.”

A year and a half later, Mr. Bard offered them an upgrade to a 220-square-foot room on the eighth-floor, also an S.R.O. They have lived there ever since — their stabilized rent now runs $1,100 a month.

The room, which has high ceilings, two large wood-framed windows and tatty wall-to-wall carpeting, is densely packed with books and papers and clothes. Mr. Hamilton sold his philosophy collection — hundreds of volumes — when he moved to New York, but they both admit to a weakness for book buying.

“I really regret having to sell my philosophy books,” said Mr. Hamilton. He did, however, get to keep his foosball table, though he gave up competitive foosball some years ago.

Names: Ed Hamilton and Debbie Martin Ages: 56 and 57. Rent: $1,100 a month, plus an additional $200 a month for an off-site storage locker. Occupation: Writer and nonprofit researcher. Kitchen facilities: A sink, an electric teakettle and a mini-fridge. The first room they sublet had “more of a cooking setup: an electric skillet and a toaster,” Ms. Martin said. Favorite places to eat: Whole Foods salad bar, the Lime Jungle, Rocco’s Pizza, Lucky Burger. The bodega around the corner for sandwiches. Why they love living in the hotel: “It allowed us to live the bohemian life. The whole time I’ve lived here, I’ve been filled with ideas,” Mr. Hamilton said. Regrets: “I’d get a cat if we had more indoor space, but it feels too confining,” he said. What they’d like to see happen to the Chelsea: “The best case for the hotel is that they would in some sense open it as a hotel again, even if it was a fancy hotel for the rich. Maybe it would be a theme hotel, but they’d see who wanted to stay here and maybe it would revert back to what it was,” Mr. Hamilton said.

“Sometimes I’m like, ‘Maybe we could sell the foosball table?’” Ms. Martin said. “But you can see his blood pressure go up.”

Their room is now one of only two S.R.O.s left in the building, which has been undergoing interior demolition for the past decade, following Mr. Bard’s 2007 ouster by the hotel’s board of directors. Since then, the Chelsea has traded hands a number of times, shifting between various partnerships — there’s been talk of a boutique hotel, luxury condos and some combination of the two.

Only some 50 rent-regulated rooms remain in the building — there were about 150 rentals and 100 hotel rooms in 2007. Many tenants have taken up temporary residence elsewhere as construction drags on, frustrated by the plastic sheeting they must pass to get to their apartments and the omnipresent dust that seeps in from cracks in the walls. It’s noisy during the day and eerily quiet at night when workers go home.

Photo

“It feels like a tomb,” said Mr. Hamilton, who, along with Ms. Martin, has chronicled the saga of the Chelsea’s latest chapter on their blog “Living with Legends.”

Mr. Hamilton, who credits the Chelsea Hotel with inspiring his fiction, has also written a book about the hotel’s history, “Legends of the Chelsea Hotel.” His recent book of short stories, “The Chintz Age,” deals with artists and hyper-gentrification.

Much as they miss their neighbors, there is one silver lining to the current state of affairs: Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Martin have the bathroom they once shared with four other rooms all to themselves.

They’re perfectly content without an en-suite: Besides the convenience of having the bathroom stocked and cleaned by someone else, they believe in the S.R.O. model.

“It’s a matter of principle,” said Mr. Hamilton. “It’s an affordable way to live.”

It has, however, become less affordable living without a kitchen in a neighborhood where the inexpensive dining options have all but disappeared.

“There used to be a lot of places where we could both eat for under $10,” Ms. Martin said. “There was a place called Donuts Sandwiches where you could get a burger and fries for $2.95.”

They have, they admitted, considered leaving at times.

“But what do you do if you leave?” Mr. Hamilton asked. “It’s such a beautiful building, like a sanctuary from the real world. It would be very hard to let go of the dream. That it would be what it was, rather than a regular apartment building.”Things seemed different as recently as December, when the Blackstone Group’s chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, announced the formation of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, whose members would “meet with the president frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge,” as Mr. Schwarzman put it at the time.

Then, executives were clamoring to make the cut, even those who had been cool or in some cases hostile to Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Well over 100 chief executives approached Mr. Schwarzman and the Trump transition team angling to be included.

Only two people declined, citing time pressures: Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

The final list of 16 included such business luminaries as Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric; Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Bob Iger of Disney; Mary Barra of General Motors; and Virginia Rometty of IBM.

Soon after, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Travis Kalanick of Uber and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo were added, buttressing the group’s expertise in technology and consumer products.

Then Mr. Trump was inaugurated and in short order unleashed his divisive immigration order, leading to chaos at airports and nationwide protests. Exactly one week later, on relatively short notice, he convened the first meeting of the forum, with live television coverage from the State Dining Room of the White House.

Even though nearly every company represented in the forum issued a statement that to varying degrees distanced it from the immigration order or even denounced it, the images of the meeting risked looking like an endorsement of the Trump administration and its policies.

Images of Mrs. Nooyi, an immigrant born in India (and now a citizen), who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman and within camera range of Mr. Trump, seemed especially incongruous.

And all of this was before the abrupt resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and renewed questions about the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russians.

Mr. Kalanick was the first on the forum to feel the wrath of consumers. Protesters accused Uber of “collaborating” with Mr. Trump and chained themselves to the doors of the company’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Soon after, the hashtag #DeleteUber trended on Twitter. Within four days of the immigration order, 200,000 users had deleted the Uber app, and one of the company’s rivals, Lyft, reported that downloads of its own app had more than doubled.

In an effort to quell the protest, Mr. Kalanick resigned from the forum the day before its first meeting. The “implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are,” he said in a memo to employees.

When I contacted him this week, Mr. Kalanick said: “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration, but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.”

Protest flared and a social media boycott campaign took root after the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, joined Mr. Trump’s 28-member Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, announced in January, and then praised the president’s pro-business policies on CNBC.

This week, in an open letter published as an advertisement in The Baltimore Sun (Under Armour’s headquarters is in Baltimore), Mr. Plank said, “I personally believe that immigration is the foundation of our country’s exceptionalism,” and “in a time of division, we aspire to be a force of unity, growth and optimism for our city and our country.” He pledged to oppose “any new actions that negatively impact our team, our neighbors or their families.”

Some Disney employees organized demonstrations in three cities this week, demanding that Mr. Iger resign from the forum, even though he didn’t attend the first meeting because of a conflict with a long-scheduled company board meeting. The demonstrations drew about 120 protesters, the company said.

At the same time, Out & Equal, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, praised Mr. Iger’s membership in the forum in a letter to the company, citing his support for workplace equality and ability to influence the president.

Mr. Schwarzman himself received some criticism from a few Schwarzman scholars, who receive support under a program he established for study in China. In a letter to the scholars explaining his role in advising Mr. Trump, Mr. Schwarzman wrote: “In life you’ll often find that having influence and providing sound advice is a good thing, even if it attracts criticism or requires some sacrifice. However, I have always believed one’s obligation is to work for the common good.”

As the Uber experience suggests, the risks of engaging with Mr. Trump are highest for companies with direct exposure to consumers, especially those who can easily switch to a competitor less identified with the Trump brand. General Motors and PepsiCo could face more consumer reaction; the banks and money managers less so; and industrial concerns like General Electric even less.

At the same time, the benefits of being part of the forum and gaining the ear of the president are obvious: Virtually every Fortune 500 corporation has vitally important interests affected by the federal government, from antitrust, labor and trade policies, to tax reform and bank regulation, including changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.

Underscoring the value of access, the president singled out Mr. Dimon, whom the Trump campaign had courted as a potential Treasury secretary, saying at the meeting, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie.”

The comment seemed to underscore the degree to which Mr. Trump has turned regulation of Wall Street over to the bankers he railed against during the campaign. (Curiously, given Mr. Trump’s stated hostility to Dodd-Frank, Mr. Dimon is on record as supporting many aspects of the legislation, saying it has made the banking system safer but has also made it more difficult for smaller banks to compete.)

A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.

And refusing Mr. Trump’s invitations risks a presidential Twitter broadside, something that is unprecedented in American political and business history and whose impact is still being assessed. Yahoo Finance last week said it had sifted through more than 34,000 Trump tweets and identified attacks on 62 businesses, including at least two represented in the forum, General Motors and Boeing.

(I asked the White House on Thursday for comment on its interaction with business leaders, but received no response.)

Optics aside, Mr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said the president’s overtures to executives represented a welcome change from the Obama administration, which largely ignored big business and summoned bankers to Washington to browbeat them publicly over the financial crisis. By comparison, Mr. Trump embraced members of his business forum as “the best and the brightest” and said he welcomed their ideas.

“There’s always the danger that chief executives will be used as photo ops,” Mr. Sonnenfeld acknowledged. But he praised Mr. Trump’s decision “to give chief executives a seat at the table” and said he had talked to at least half of the participants since the meeting. “They’re telling me they found him very receptive to their ideas and willing to listen,” he said. “They’ve said they’re holding each other accountable to be truthful and candid and to raise key issues with him.”

Mr. Sonnenfeld has met with Mr. Trump since the election and offered advice. “He’s very charming and open to new ideas,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “I’ve seen business executives melt in his presence.”

Charles Elson, a professor and expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, also praised the president for reaching out to business leaders. He said he disagreed with Mr. Kalanick’s decision to resign.

“When the president calls, you should go to see him, regardless of your political persuasion, out of respect for the office,” Mr. Elson said. “As a chief executive with a duty to your shareholders, it’s your obligation to do so, like him or not.”

Mr. Schwarzman’s office made a similar point when I inquired this week. “Steve has advised presidents from both parties in the past and feels a duty to help any administration that calls on him if he’s able to do so for the good of the country,” Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman, said.

Still, everyone I spoke to agreed that there were lines they wouldn’t cross. “You don’t have to agree” with the president, Mr. Elson said. “If he asks you to take a political position, you can say no. And if he asks you to endorse something where you have a deep philosophical objection, you shouldn’t do it.”Several people at the conference instantly took note on Twitter of Ms. Von der Leyen’s phrasing, including Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

Vice President Mike Pence, who arrived in Munich on Friday night; Mr. Mattis; Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, a few miles up the road in Bonn — have all spent much of the week soothing European ears, presenting traditional Republican national security orthodoxy of confronting Russia, supporting NATO and backing democratic institutions.

But every time they seemed to be getting traction in convincing skittish diplomats that Mr. Trump was not about to abandon decades of American national security policy, their boss did something in Washington that undercut their work.

The result has been confusion among global leaders about whom to believe when it comes to the direction of American national security.

The reassuring message Mr. Trump’s subordinates have sought to convey has been further undermined by some of his own Republican critics.

Senator John McCain, whose disdain for Mr. Trump is well known, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the Munich conference that Michael T. Flynn’s resignation as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser over his Russia liaisons was “something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do.”

The contradictions have abounded. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed to abandon a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, asserting that he was not committed to a two-state solution. Twenty-four hours later, his United Nations envoy said, “We absolutely support a two-state solution,” adding that the administration simply wanted a “thinking out of the box” approach about resolving one of the world’s intractable conflicts.

The same day that Mr. Trump questioned the two-state approach, Mr. Mattis was at NATO headquarters telling allies that the commitment of the United States to NATO remained firm. But Mr. Mattis also echoed his boss when he warned that the United States might “moderate” its support if other member countries did not spend more on the military.

The next day, still at NATO, Mr. Mattis was back to saying that the American commitment to NATO was unshakable. He said the Trump administration’s “commitment to Article 5 remains solid,” referring to NATO’s principle that an attack on one is an attack on all.

European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief again, until Mr. Trump held a prolonged and chaotic news conference a few hours later in Washington.

“Let’s put it this way, the discrepancy between the president’s news conference and the way his cabinet is trying to reassure Europeans couldn’t be wider,” said Michael Werz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who was at the Munich conference.

Volker Perthes, the head of SWP, a policy research group based in Germany, said: “Mattis speaks of ‘defending the rules-based international order.’ I hope he can explain this to his boss.”

What appeared to rattle people the most about Mr. Trump’s news conference on Thursday were his attacks on members of the news media assembled before him. Several diplomats said they worried that Mr. Trump was trying to discredit a tenet of American democracy — a free press — and in so doing, might embolden despots around the world into further challenges to freedom of the press.

Struggling to explain how to assess the seeming chaos coming out of Washington, Michael Fallon, Britain’s defense minister, told reporters, “You know, new administrations, you know, can take time to settle down.”

In the crowded lounges and refined tearooms of Munich’s Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where leaders and top officials were mingling, much of the talk on Friday was not about the panels on issues like “the future of the European Union: united or divided,” or “the future of the West: downfall or comeback?”

Instead, it was about Mr. Trump’s Thursday news conference, which appeared to deeply unnerve a number of officials. Overheard conversations included one in which one European official said that the United States was now on the list of “risk factors” for Europe, echoing a concern expressed two weeks earlier by Donald Tusk, head of the European Council. German officials joked that American diplomats and civil service organizations could now qualify for German democracy funding — money designated for countries with struggling democratic institutions.

Several people seemed on edge awaiting what Mr. Mattis would say when he addressed the conference. When he finally approached the lectern, he sounded exactly like numerous other American chiefs who have preceded him.

“The trans-Atlantic bond remains our strongest bulwark against instability and violence,” he said. “I am confident that we will strengthen our partnerships, confronting those who choose to attack innocent people or our democratic processes and freedoms.”

Mr. Mattis, Mr. Nasr said after the speech, “is the one island of stability.” But, he added, “the key is that nobody knows the extent of his influence. Right now, we’re tight with trans-Atlantic unity, but who knows what to believe?”

Ms. Von der Leyen, the German defense minister, used her time at the lectern before Mr. Mattis spoke to deliver a warning to the Trump administration about putting cooperation with Russia ahead of its alliances in Europe — or even on the same footing for that matter.

“Our American friends know well that your tone on Europe and NATO has a direct impact on the cohesion of our continent,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “There cannot be a policy of equidistance to allies and to those who openly question our values, our borders and international law.”

Ms. Von der Leyen also criticized Mr. Trump’s efforts to close American borders to refugees from around the world and suspend immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. (Those efforts have been blocked by American courts.)

“We should be careful that this fight does not become a front against Islam and Muslims,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “Otherwise, we run the risk of digging ourselves into a deeper grave in which violence and terror only grow further.”Only the AfD, whose populism puts it far outside of mainstream political norms, is openly promising to fulfill a desire for patriotism that would be routine in most other countries.

The result is that a social and political norm intended to stifle the far right is now empowering it. That focus on identity has allowed the AfD, even if it is unlikely to win enough votes to govern, to shape the national conversation to its advantage, and to present itself as the champion of ordinary Germans.

The search for identity

The AfD rally in a snowy square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, was scheduled to last precisely 30 minutes. It started promptly, ran like clockwork and ended with an instruction to the crowd to pick up any litter on the ground.

Such respect for rules and punctuality is something Germans are good at, said several attendees, who clustered in the glow of the small stage, stomping their feet against the numbing cold.

But mostly the mood was one of frustration. A woman in a shearling coat, who asked not to be named out of fear of anti-right-wing discrimination, said that she hoped the AfD would help heal Germany’s “broken self-confidence.”

A chemist with a doctorate, she personified the way that Germany’s identity gap has allowed the AfD to extend its appeal beyond the far-right fringe and into the middle-class mainstream.

“Only in Germany, I found it very strange, people don’t want to say ‘I am German,’ ” she said. Because the party was the only one willing to challenge that taboo, it was the AfD’s message she absorbed.

Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig who studies group identity formation, said, “There has never been a positive definition of German identity since the Nazi era.”

“It is easier to say what you are against than what you are for,” he said. “And this might be more true in Germany, where the national identity was built on ‘never again.’ ”

For decades, German politicians worked to layer any sense of Germanness beneath a European identity.

“Germany has negotiated the European part very well, but the casualty has been Germanness,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who specializes in the legacy of European fascism.

That smoothed the country’s path back into the community of nations after World War II. But Germans are increasingly concerned about the costs. A July 2016 Pew poll found that half of Germans had an unfavorable view of the European Union. As Euroskepticism rises, a growing minority of Germans are chafing at what they see as pressure to place European identity before national identity.

The influx of refugees into the country in recent years has caused particular stress, Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “In Germany, you’re not even allowed to say you’re proud to be German. You have to say you’re European,” she said. “So when these people come in, what are they left with?”

The power of challenging a taboo

When people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to a group identity, and also become more interested in making their group more powerful, Professor Fritsche said he had found in his research. Germany’s traditional political parties have been reluctant to indulge that desire because of political taboos. But the AfD has proved adept at exploiting it.

That strategy was on full display the night of Jan. 17 at a beer hall in Dresden, ground zero for Germany’s far-right movement. Hundreds of AfD supporters had gathered for a speech by Björn Höcke, one of the party’s fastest-rising figures.

Addressing the crowd, Mr. Höcke looked every inch the ordinary German politician, besuited and with a white-toothed grin and an unseasonable tan. But what he said went far beyond the norms of German politics.

Germans are “the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,” he said, a thinly veiled reference to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Germans had “the mentality of a totally vanquished people,” he argued, but it was time for the country to re-embrace its history and develop a positive relationship with its identity.

The crowd’s applause shook the floors, a noisy manifestation of how thrilling transgression can feel in a rule-bound society.

“The foundation of being able to move forward is identity,” Mr. Höcke later elaborated in an interview. “There is no people that has given more to humanity than Germany. It is a great and old people, and it would be sad if it were to sink.”

Mr. Höcke is an extreme figure within his own party, and his speech provoked a backlash from AfD’s national leadership. But his message demonstrates how the party has broadened its appeal: by telling Germans they should have a proud national identity, a message that in Germany could come only from the political fringes.

That has resonated with middle-class supporters like Julian Wälder, 21, a law student who had helped to organize the event in Dresden. He said that his journey to the AfD began with his frustration at the identity taboo.

“The definition we have right now of tolerance in the German political landscape is self-deprecating to a degree that it’s actually self-destructive,” Mr. Wälder said. “Everything will be tolerated except for being a German.”

Focusing on identity allows the AfD to present itself as a protector of ordinary people — punching up against the nation’s political elite, rather than attacking vulnerable refugees portrayed by the party as a threat to the nation.

That approach, accusing the elite of stifling debate over German history and culture, could be especially appealing to Germans desperate to restore a sense of control over their country.

“This will be very attractive to people who perceive their own lives as without control,” Professor Fritsche said.

A minority, but influencing the conversation

The AfD, despite its rapid growth, remains a minority party. Its support reached a high of 15 percent according to a survey by Ipsos in late 2016, but slipped to 12 percent in a Feb. 7 poll by the same firm.

But as mainstream parties become more focused on defending against the far-right upstarts, the AfD’s populist agenda is trickling into their policies and messaging — raising the possibility that the party’s political influence could outpace its electoral gains.

Frauke Petry, the party’s national chairwoman, said that the AfD’s ideas were already shaping the national conversation, even if they were not yet able to shape national legislation.

Professor Fritsche’s research suggests that Ms. Petry could be correct, as right-wing parties become more visible. “What would really be dangerous is to have a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in which people feel a likely right-wing shift, and this leads to a perceived norm shift,” he said.

There are signs that is already happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her re-election bid in December by announcing a more populist agenda. She took a harder line on immigration and called for a ban on Islamic veils that cover the full face, saying they “do not belong to us” and should be “forbidden wherever that is legally possible.”

And although she did not name the AfD directly, she expressly tried to reclaim the identity issue, saying that who “the people” are was something for all to decide, “not just a few, no matter how loud they are.”

Mr. Höcke was unmoved by her rightward shift. He called Mrs. Merkel a “chancellor-dictator” who had broken German law by opening the country’s borders to refugees, and he demanded an end to her “regime.”

“We Germans have to be self-aware,” he said in the interview. “We can see our state falling apart; it’s falling apart before our eyes. It’s about survival.”Photo

When President Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning travel from seven majority Muslim countries, he hurled us back to one of the darkest and most shameful chapters of American history. Executive orders that go after specific groups under the guise of protecting the American people are not only unconstitutional, but morally wrong. My father, and so many other Americans of Japanese descent, were targets of just such an order during World War II.

Seventy-five years ago on Sunday, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, all people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast were forced to leave their homes and report to incarceration camps. Two-thirds were American citizens. Fred Korematsu, my father, then 23, refused to go. A proud and loyal citizen, he had tried to enlist in the National Guard but was rejected and was wrongly fired from his job as a welder in an Oakland, Calif., shipyard He was arrested and tried for defying the executive order. Upon conviction, he was held in a horse stall at a hastily converted racetrack until he and his family were moved to a desolate camp in Topaz, Utah. My father told me later that jail was better than the camp.

He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. In his case, and in cases brought by Minoru Yasui and Gordon Hirabayashi — among the most infamous cases in American legal history — the court in 1944 upheld the executive order. Justice Frank Murphy vehemently opposed the majority decision, writing in a dissenting opinion, “Racial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life.” In the hysteria of war and racialized propaganda, my father’s citizenship did not protect him. For him and the 120,000 other Japanese-Americans incarcerated during World War II, there was no attempt to sort the loyal from the disloyal.

In 1982, almost 40 years after my father’s conviction, evidence was discovered proving that the wartime government suppressed, altered and destroyed material evidence while arguing my father’s, Yasui’s and Hirabayashi’s cases before the Supreme Court. The government’s claims that people of Japanese descent had engaged in espionage and that mass incarceration was necessary to protect the country were not only false, but had even been refuted by the government’s own agencies, including the Office of Naval Intelligence, the F.B.I. and the Federal Communications Commission.

With that evidence, my father reopened his case. In November 1983, he stood before a Federal District Court judge, Marilyn Hall Patel, and said, “As long as my record stands in federal court, any American citizen can be held in prison or concentration camps without a trial or a hearing.” Judge Patel overturned my father’s conviction, declaring that his case “stands as a caution that in times of distress the shield of military necessity and national security must not be used to protect governmental actions from close scrutiny and accountability.”

Around that time, the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians declared that the Korematsu case had been “overruled in the court of history” and found that my father’s incarceration was based on “race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.”

Although his conviction was vacated, my father was keenly aware that his case was never formally overturned, even though it was widely discredited by scholars and even the courts. He was a quiet, soft-spoken man, but he spent the rest of his life speaking around the country about the government misconduct that led to incarceration, in hopes of preventing it from occurring again. In 1998, President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for the brave stand he took against an unjust government action.

In 1991, President George H. W. Bush declared, “The internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry was a great injustice, and it will never be repeated.” But it can happen again. Since my father’s death in 2005, I have taken on his work to remind Americans what happens when our Constitution is ignored in the name of national security. We need to scrutinize Mr. Trump’s executive orders and any other attempts to single out groups for repression. Let us come together to reject discrimination based on religion, race or national origin, and to oppose the mass deportation of people who look or pray differently from the majority of Americans.

“Stand up for what is right,” my father said. “Protest, but not with violence. Don’t be afraid to speak up. One person can make a difference, even if it takes 40 years.”“The fact that in all the 11 championships I’ve never been asked this question says something about where we are” as a country, Mr. Auriemma said. “Forget the answer. The fact that I’ve never been asked means there’s something going on that isn’t normal.”

UConn has won 100 consecutive games since 2014. And while the Huskies are not a lock to win a 12th title, they are favored again to cut down the nets in triumph at the Final Four in Dallas. Now coaches, current players and the team’s former stars are wrestling with the issue of whether UConn should visit the White House in celebration.

The Huskies’ players are amateurs, some still teenagers, not professionals with agents, union protection and multimillion-dollar contracts. They have kept up with the current political situation, and the responses by other athletes, through social media and classroom discussions. Their own reactions were nuanced and considered.

Even before Mr. Trump was elected, UConn players jokingly told one another, “We’re not going if he wins,” the sophomore forward Napheesa Collier said. “Now that it’s actually happened, if we win, I don’t know what everyone’s going to do.”

Ms. Stewart and Maya Moore, another former UConn star, said they expected that whatever decision the team made, it would be done collectively. Gabby Williams, a junior forward, agreed.

“That’s just what we’ve built here,” Ms. Williams, the team’s most complete player, said. “We don’t have guys that do their own thing. Whatever we do, it’ll be a unified decision.”

If some players did not want to attend a White House celebration, Ms. Collier said, “I really don’t know what I would do in that position; I guess we have to get there first.”

Mr. Auriemma, who will turn 63 during the N.C.A.A. tournament, said the dilemma for him was reconciling respect for the office of the presidency with the possibility that some players might object to meeting Mr. Trump, feeling unwelcome at the White House because of the president’s statements and positions on women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims.

“If we’re fortunate enough to win it, and your players walk in and go, ‘Listen, I’m not going,’ we’ve never had to deal with that before,” Mr. Auriemma said.

“What are you going to do as a coach?” he continued. “It’s not like I can look it up and go, ‘What did other people do?’ We’re in a world that very few of us could have conceived five years ago.”

What would he do?

“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s a good question.”

There is no pressing need for an answer now, he understands, no need to cross a point of no return. The national championship game is not until April 2, and there is no guarantee that UConn will be playing or winning.

“I’m not crossing the Rubicon,” Mr. Auriemma said. “That’s Caesar. Once your army crosses that river, you are an enemy of the state.”

Mr. Auriemma is no supporter of Mr. Trump. He made that clear last summer in Rio de Janeiro while coaching the American women’s team to a second consecutive Olympic gold medal under him and sixth in a row over all. Asked whether dominance by the United States was good for women’s basketball, he told reporters, “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s O.K. to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex.”

He later expressed shock that Mr. Trump had been elected president.

But Mr. Auriemma is also the most visible representative of Connecticut’s flagship public university. And he has lived a classic immigrant success story, having been born in Italy and then moving to suburban Philadelphia as a boy, winning a record number of N.C.A.A. basketball titles and becoming wealthy in the process. He speaks reverently of the presidency as a symbol of “the most that this country can represent.”

He tells of his mother, Marsiella, being overcome with tears when she shook hands and took a photograph with President Obama. And how boosters accompanying the team have variously complained about the policies of President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Obama on trips to Washington, yet “once they get down there, he puts his hand out and he says, ‘Welcome to the White House,’ and they just melt.”

“Because it’s the president of the United States,” he said.

One should not easily dismiss an opportunity to meet any president, Mr. Auriemma said. “In order to do that,” he said, “you’ve got to have some pretty strong convictions. And we’ve got some pretty socially activist players on our team.”

Sue Bird, the former UConn point guard who won two N.C.A.A. titles and two of her four Olympic gold medals while playing for Mr. Auriemma, said that if some players felt unwelcome at the White House, he would surely take that into consideration.

“I think he’s somebody that understands where he is in this world and what he represents and the platform he has,” Ms. Bird said. “And I don’t think he’s shy about speaking out on his feelings. And with that, I wouldn’t be surprised, to be honest, if they didn’t go.”

Ms. Bird stressed that she was speaking about her own observations, not about any impression that Mr. Auriemma had directly given her. Any decision, she said, would be a “tough call” and would be made by the coach with the intent of protecting his players.

“Because, in reality, they’re kids,” Ms. Bird said. “So it’s hard to know what to do.”

The Huskies are a diverse team ethnically and culturally, and as with any team, there are varied political opinions, players said.

“I don’t think the entire team wouldn’t go,” said Kia Nurse, a junior guard from Hamilton, Ontario. “It would be an interesting thing.”

Forward Batouly Camara, a native of Manhattan and a transfer from Kentucky who is practicing with UConn but not playing this season, is a Muslim whose parents immigrated from the West African nation Guinea.

Her mother, who holds dual citizenship, has been reluctant to travel back to Guinea, where she runs an orphanage, Ms. Camara said, even though Mr. Trump’s travel ban does not target the country. But she added, “I don’t feel anything harsh or anything at all” toward the president.

Ms. Camara said she had received “an overwhelming amount of support” from teammates, coaches and others in the UConn community, for which she was grateful.

She said she expected the team to stick together in making a decision about the White House. “If we decided to go and do something there,” Ms. Camara said, “that could be a platform for us.”

The family of Ms. Collier, the sophomore forward, has a history of political involvement. Her paternal grandfather, Gershon Collier, was a diplomat in the West African nation Sierra Leone who helped secure the country’s independence from Britain in 1961. He later became its ambassador to the United States and chief justice.

“I think it’s a really touchy subject,” Ms. Collier said of a potential visit to the White House. “For me, personally, I don’t really support Trump, but I would still go out of respect for my team. But I don’t know how everybody else feels about it.”

She added, “We kind of try to stay away from politics a little bit, especially because it’s getting so heated.”

Ms. Williams, UConn’s best player, said her personal view would be to visit the White House.

“It shows, despite my feelings, or anyone’s feelings, that’s just kind of the respectful thing to do,” she said, adding that it “kind of makes you look like the bigger person, too.”

But, she said, “to each his own, and people are free to make their own decisions.”Photo

When you think about it, a “big, fat juicy pork chop” is kind of an oxymoron. Double-thick pork chops always sound good and look impressive, but unless they are cooked perfectly, they are apt to be dry.

With large, thick chops — and that is basically what you will find at most meat counters — it’s a good idea to give them an overnight cure or a couple of days in brine if you want moist, tender results.

But for my money, I’d rather have a thinner chop. Skinny chops cooked over high heat on the stovetop are guaranteed to come out juicy. They are a breeze to cook and are done in mere minutes, beautifully browned and crisped. And though it’s not strictly necessary, I let them have a short soak in a simple, quickly made brine. Just a one-hour bath is enough time to give skinny chops all the seasoning they need.

Sometimes skinny chops are called breakfast chops. You see them in supermarkets — a dozen slices, bone-in, packaged in foam trays and advertised as family packs. Those will work fine, but they are most likely from pigs raised by large commercial operations (factory farmed, so to speak), from lean hog breeds that grow quickly, flavor being a secondary concern.

Better to visit a butcher who is dedicated to the noble ethos of nose-to-tail eating, if you can, someone who will offer you locally sourced meat. The chops from slower-growing heritage pork breeds are blessed with meat that is marbled, and therefore tastier and more succulent. Heritage breeds have marvelous names, too: Duroc, Gloucestershire Od Spot, Tamworth, Red Wattle, Berkshire.

Photo

At your butcher shop, or at one of the supermarket meat departments that now carry this virtuous and delicious pork, ask for bone-in chops about three-quarters of an inch thick, four to five ounces each, preferably from the rib end. Most butchers are happy to cut them to order. Heritage costs a bit more, but that’s why skinny pork chops make such a lot of sense. Besides, two chops are plenty for a serving (though it can be difficult not to reach for a third one).

Stack them on a platter hot from the pan and serve them with a pile of lemony herb salad. And it’s O.K. to eat with your fingers — recommended, in fact.

Recipe: Thin Pan-Seared Pork ChopsPhoto

When the chef Meriko Gubeladze opened Shavi Lomi, she recalled that Tbilisi was “starving for small, homey restaurants with good food.” That was 2011, and the quality of Georgian cuisine — known for its lavish use of spices and aromatic herbs influenced by travelers along the Silk Road — wasn’t the problem, but the uninviting establishments and menu selections — hangovers from the cookie-cutter days of the Soviet era — were. Artery-clogging khachapuri, the cheesy bread often likened to pizza, still tempted. But at every meal? How often could a person eat walnut-paste-stuffed vegetables and a lamb stew called chakapuli, a favorite dish of Stalin. Four years after Shavi Lomi updated these seasonal family recipes, serving them in a cozy atmosphere, other restaurants soon followed suit.

Photo

Tbilisi today has a reimagined dining scene. Instead of the same standard-issue 10 dishes, post-Soviet restaurants are bringing a humble magic to dining in Georgia’s capital city, with a focus on all things organic.

If sumptuous flavors and a living-room-like setting with bright carpets and heirloom batik tablecloths were Shavi Lomi’s contributions, promoting organic food and natural wine was the province of Vino Underground, a popular natural-wine bar and salon just around the corner.

Photo

Between those two pioneering forces, a peaceful culinary revolution began. More than a half-dozen homey restaurants have opened with prideful Georgian menus proclaiming organic status for both food and wine. With the current exchange rate, the experience is not only exciting, but also often a bargain.

This culinary fever also has spread from the traditional tourist area, the sandstone crumbling Old City, to Tbilisi’s more contemporary quarters across the Kura River. Now bargain hunters heading to the Dry Bridge Market, an enclave to buy drinking horns and Soviet memorabilia, can reward their appetite without compromise. Shavi Lomi has relocated there. Another hot spot is Barbarestan, housed in an old butcher shop with meat hooks still visible and caged singing canaries. Family-owned, the restaurant drew its menu from Georgia’s beloved 19th-century cookbook by Barbare Jorjadze, who celebrated the Silk Road influence of her country’s cuisine. While her cookbook remains a strong influence on other local dining spots too, Barbarestan’s fare shows fealty in all details. Ghee, clarified butter, is used exclusively. The nadugi — a typical fresh cheese spread and stuffing — gets a vegan spin when substituting Ms. Jorjadze’s recipe for pumpkinseed milk.

Photo

But the culinary action has especially taken hold in the heart of the Old City. There, behind the gilded and imposing St. George statue in Freedom Square, three restaurants have opened. Strolling the quiet streets, this visitor was pleasantly surprised to come across Ezo, tucked in a residential courtyard. Ezo, its name meaning yard, opened two years ago, and while it’s rustic, don’t be fooled. One can feast like the 12th-century Queen Tamara there for $25 per person. Many of the flavorful organic ingredients are from the owners’ farm.

Proletariat options like the salt-cured jonjoli (bladdernut flowers), staples on any Georgian table, get an unusual twist with familiar walnut garlic sauce. Tender veal in herbs is a customer magnet. Wash it down with glugs of family chacha (grappa) for an authentic accent. Walk another few minutes, on uneven cobblestones and broken sidewalks, past unmarked boutiques and fruit stalls that never seem to shut, and you will find the more upscale Azarphesha, now four years old. With walls of museum-worthy displays showcasing ancient drinking vessels, the restaurant remains of the moment. Yet with its mix of traditional tablecloths and fresh wild posies, the room couldn’t feel less pretentious, especially when a table spontaneously burst out in the traditional, emotional polyphonic village songs, as often happens.

Husband and wife Nino and Luarsab Togonidze joined with a friend, the American expatriate painter and winemaker John Wurdeman, and fashioned a fascinating Georgian fusion menu. Their riff on the country’s strong pickle culture is emblematic; take the kimchee-like banana peppers with local-toasted sunflower-seed oil. Even with its hints of Peru or Mexico, it tastes of home. From its geek-worthy wine list, all organic and natural, to its foraged juniper gins, the philosophy is uncompromising.

In December, the three opened a new restaurant, Poliphonia, considered one of the best eating spots in town.

Reflecting on the city’s restaurant renaissance, Mr. Togonidze said the country’s recent political calm was only part of the story: “Compounded with a new generation who have grown up in freedom with the excitement about natural wine, how could that energy not spill over to the table?” he said. “After all, in Georgia, wine and food have always been intertwined.”Attendees wanted to know what would happen if they were deported. Would they have access to their money in banks? Should they set up a power of attorney for their children? They also had questions about how to deal with subway harassment and school bullying. “The mood was a bit tense at first,” said Ms. Meyer, 32. “It’s a little awkward to go to a stranger’s house. But as the evening went on, people relaxed.” On the way out, some attendees hugged.

The dinners have also helped forge closer bonds among neighbors, like the one that has blossomed between Ms. Meyer and her next-door neighbor, Reba Frankel, 37, after the two hosted a December dinner with their spouses in their Sunset Park co-op. “We had traded bread recipes and they cat-sat for us when we went out of town,” Ms. Meyer said. “Now we are going to protests together and organizing together and email every day.”

Even the youngest participants have noticed a change. “Our children are bonding,” said Ms. Castillo, who has two young daughters. “My daughter said to me, ‘The only good thing about Trump winning is that you formed Love Trumps Hate and I get to make all these new friends.’”

In late January, Ms. Khan-Cullors, a founder of Black Lives Matter, and about a dozen other activists held an emergency meeting in a two-bedroom house in Santa Monica, after protesting the immigration executive order at Los Angeles International Airport all day. In a gathering that lasted until midnight and grew to 40 people, a legal adviser broke down the implications of the order for the guests. “I need to be with people right now,” Ms. Khan-Cullors, 33, said in a telephone interview. “I need to know that we have each other’s back. We’re not just going to live online in the social media world.”

For a younger generation that has come of age in an era of telecommuting, a living room makes for a more natural venue than a sterile office conference room or a church basement. In the early days of Black Lives Matter, Ms. Khan-Cullors hosted many gatherings at her home in St. Elmo Village, an artists’ community in Los Angeles, where she lived until 2015. “Many of us in this generation are not interested in having our thoughts, our intellectual property or our organization inside of traditional building spaces,” she said. The home is “where we’re generating a lot of ideas.”

“It’s where we’re producing the next iteration of where the movement is going,” she said.

There is also a long history of political organizing in the home. Fledgling groups often do not have the resources to rent office space, so living rooms make viable alternatives. At the consciousness-raising groups of the late 1960s, for example, women gathered in one another’s homes in New York and around the country to discuss feminism.

“To the extent that women have power, it tends to be in the home,” Gloria Steinem, a founder of Ms. magazine, said in a telephone interview. “The goddess of the hearth is a woman, for God’s sake.”

Certainly, women have figured prominently in the months since Hillary Clinton lost what would have been a historic election of the first female president. The women’s marches that took place around the country the day after the inauguration drew as many as five million protesters, by some estimates, making it among the largest marches in American history.

“I think what you’re seeing is that the resistance is being led by women,” said Rebecca Traister, the author of “All the Single Ladies” (Simon and Schuster, 2016).

Consider Solidarity Sundays. Three mothers in Alameda, Calif., started the Facebook group a year ago, rattled by the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and the shooting in nearby San Bernardino, Calif. For a year, the group, with about 800 members, gathered monthly at two of the organizers’ homes to eat, drink and contact elected officials about specific policy concerns, like police violence. Babysitters would watch the children. Most of the members are women or identify as women.

Photo

And then the election happened. Three days later, the group held an emergency meeting at the home of Kate Schatz, one of the founders. The gathering, with 100 attendees crammed into a living room, was “super intense,” said Ms. Schatz, 38, the author of “Rad American Women A-Z” (City Lights, 2015). “We spent the whole time brainstorming.” Now the group has 12,000 members, with about 100 chapters meeting in 27 states. Manhattan has four chapters, Queens one and Brooklyn six.

On the second Sunday of every month, guests who have signed up through Facebook arrive at a neighbor’s home. Last Sunday, Rachel Thieme hosted her third event in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. She held the first two in her railroad-style apartment; the third one she co-hosted at the apartment of Artineh Havan, also in Greenpoint.

Many of the attendees have never been politically active before, she said. For Ms. Thieme, 36, these monthly gatherings have served as a political awakening, a chance to flex a long-dormant political muscle. As her neighbors made phone calls, she refilled their cocktail glasses. “I don’t even know what’s going to be happening in the world,” she said. “But what I can count on is that there is going to be a ton of rad women in my house who want to take action.”

Chapters have also opened in more conservative parts of the country, like at the home of Kathryn Mahaney in Bay Saint Louis, on the Gulf coast of Mississippi. Last Sunday, she hosted her first event, with around a dozen guests drinking bourbon and eating king cake, a traditional Mardi Gras dessert. While other chapters focused on political actions, Ms. Mahaney, 33, saw hers as a way for politically progressive neighbors to find allies in a deeply conservative community.

By opening her home, Ms. Mahaney hopes to make liberals feel less isolated. “Many of them feel that they have to hide,” she said. “They are afraid to signal their political beliefs because of the fear of retribution from friends and family, as well as from strangers.”In a rambling news conference on Thursday, the president said his administration had undertaken “the most substantial border security measures in a generation,” and he said that efforts to find and deport “criminal aliens” would make the United States safer.

“Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised: ‘Oh, he is having strong borders.’ Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.”

But his early efforts to translate all of that talk into action are already running into the reality of governing in Washington, where legal constraints on taking action — and debates about paying for it — are legendary.

Mr. Trump has promised to hire 15,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of a larger deportation force that can remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, something he repeatedly promised to do during the campaign.

But hiring such a large number of agents in a short period of time would be nearly impossible, according to John F. Kelly, the former general whom Mr. Trump chose to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

“I don’t believe we’re going to get 10,000 and 5,000 on board within the next couple of years,” Mr. Kelly told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this month, explaining that stringent hiring standards and training regimens slow down the process.

“I’d rather have fewer and make sure that they’re high-quality people that are already serving in those organizations, already well trained, but I will not skimp on the training and the standards,” Mr. Kelly said.

One of the problems that Mr. Kelly faces is a polygraph test that prospective agents, including those seeking to work for the Border Patrol, must take. According to a former senior homeland security official, nearly 60 percent of applicants fail it.

The test was first put in place after another surge in hiring during the George W. Bush administration. Thousands of people were hired without being properly vetted, which resulted in dozens of corruption cases involving Border Patrol and other agents, who were accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.

The former senior homeland security official, James Tomsheck, who was the assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, office of internal affairs, said in several cases many of the new hires were members of the cartels.

“The corruption and excessive use of force that plague the agency is a direct result of a hiring mandate to hire too many people too rapidly without the proper vetting,” said Mr. Tomsheck, who was removed from his position after, he said, he was accused of being too aggressive in pursuing excessive use-of-force cases.

It is unclear how Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly plan to solve the manpower problem.

One option, swiftly denied on Friday by the White House, was a plan to use as many as 100,000 National Guard troops as part of a nationwide deportation force that would help to augment federal agents and local authorities newly deputized to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

The idea emerged in a draft memorandum, first reported by The Associated Press, which asserted that National Guard troops, under the direction of governors in border states, are “particularly well suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by Department components.”

Gillian M. Christensen, the acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the memorandum was a “very early, pre-decisional draft that never made it to the secretary and was never seriously considered by the department.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Friday morning that the report by The Associated Press was “100 percent not true.”

But advocates for immigrants reacted with alarm.

“The administration wants to put on a show,” said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York. “Their intent is to create fear, to create an environment in which people either self-deport or hide in the shadows.”

The proposal to deploy 100,000 troops would be a stark increase in the size and scope of National Guard involvement in border security, but it is not unprecedented.

Several presidents, including George Bush and Barack Obama, called up thousands of National Guard troops to bolster border patrol operations. While they mostly acted as extra eyes to spot illegal border crossings, at times they carried weapons and assisted in drug arrests.

In 1916, in response to cross-border raids by Mexican bandits and what The New York Times described as a “prairie fire of anti-American sentiment that has been sweeping northern Mexico,” President Woodrow Wilson deployed more than 100,000 guardsmen to the border to reinforce regular Army units.

More recently, in July 2014, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to its border with Mexico in an effort to bolster his border-security credentials as he prepared to start his presidential campaign.

The deployment has been costly, controversial and continues to this day. The troops live in hotels along the border during their deployments, and the estimate of the costs in 2014 were $12 million a month.

Mr. Perry’s efforts coincided with an influx of undocumented Central American immigrants coming across the border, including unaccompanied children and teenagers. Experts expect another surge in arrivals this spring.

In Mr. Trump’s executive order calling for an end to “catch and release,” he also directed Mr. Kelly to do everything possible to “construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.” Immigration experts said that will be costly and take time.

“The bottom line is,” Mr. Appleby said, “they’re doing everything they can legally do until they’re told not to by the courts to expand their capacity to deport as many people as possible.”Students have long found ways to make it through school more quickly to save money. But there is increasing momentum to formalize the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt — while N.Y.U. is expensive, many other private universities cost $60,000 or more a year.

Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, pushed to make it easier for students in his state to graduate from public colleges early by allowing more credits from high school or technical programs. Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, included in his budget proposal this month that schools in the University of Wisconsin system should create a three-year degree for 60 percent of its programs by the summer of 2020. Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., which is a state school, has also been experimenting with three-year degree options.

Among elite private institutions, official programs remain rare, though Wesleyan University, the Connecticut liberal arts school, announced a formalized three-year track about five years ago.

N.Y.U.’s “acceleration” effort relies on a few shifts. For example, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of two-credit courses it offers.

It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer — in the past, this has been allowed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their three-year goal.

But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices.

Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy at Temple University, said that shaving time off college as a way to make it more affordable could raise some troubling questions. In college, she said, there is academic learning, but there are also important experiences outside the classroom, like the social networks students build, study abroad programs and internships — assuming students do not have to hold down jobs that crowd out those things in the first place.

While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr. Goldrick-Rab said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things.

“We agree that the price of college is a problem,” she said. But she questioned whether the solution was “to essentially have less college, or less time in college.”

“It’s interesting,” she said of accelerated schedules, “but it worries me.”

Michael S. Roth, the Wesleyan president disputed the idea that there was something uniquely effective about an eight-semester undergraduate education.

“I don’t think there’s anything magical about eight semesters, or six, or 10, for example,” he said. “ I think it’s just a convention.”

Photo

The sped-up tracks are not always popular, however. Mr Roth estimated that about 20 Wesleyan students annually graduate in three years, up from roughly three a year before they made the option official. As of this May, Purdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014.

“So far, we haven’t had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.”

Indeed, many American students take six years to graduate from college.

Ashley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like hip-hop dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid.

Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work.

But this track is not for everyone, she said. Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears, who describes herself as a planner, said she knew she wanted to be an English major when she was a junior in high school. Students who need time to to figure that out, as most do, would be better served taking their time, she said.

“I definitely think this is a way to ease the burden for now, but I don’t think it’s a long-term solution” to the cost of college, Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said. “It doesn’t take into account every type of student, and every type of student should have the ability to make college affordable to themselves.”

Professor Schall agreed that this solution was not for everyone, nor did it suffice on its own. The affordability committee, which was convened by N.Y.U.’s president, Andrew Hamilton, is experimenting with a variety of ways to cut down on costs and give students a financial lift. There are small-ticket items — Facebook can alert students if there is food left over after staff meetings — and those that are much larger. The university froze the cost of room and board this school year for the first time in decades. Tuition increased this year, but Professor Schall said it was the lowest percentage increase in 20 years.

Couldn’t N.Y.U. and other colleges solve the problem just by cutting how much they charge? Professor Schall said there was a constant pressure on universities to increase their capacity to teach and do research, “and those things are expensive.”

“There is no silver bullet,” she continued. “If we could triple our endowment, that would be lovely, but short of that, we’re looking at everything from the price of books to the use of temporary employees,” she said. “We’re trying to be as creative as we can.”The crowds are brutal, making it tougher for comedians to test their material. The audiences are made up almost entirely of fellow comedians. They are often scribbling their own jokes and running through their own sets mentally rather than paying attention to the stage. Sometimes, they’re just not interested in laughing. They want to be the funniest guy in the room.

“A crowd of comedians is tough just because we’re kind of jaded,” said John Donovan, 26, who attends up to 15 shows a week. “I see comedy two or three times a day already. Most of it is at an open-mike level. So you’re not expecting it to be that good.”

We took a tour of some open mikes in Manhattan one evening in the same way some comics do every day, and found ourselves in a dark world of therapeutic passion, discomfort and, sometimes, unbridled joy.

4:15 p.m.: Klimat Lounge

In the East Village, the Klimat Lounge was empty — except for about 10 people who were milling about, waiting to head into the basement of the bar. It was the size of a small living room. In fact, it could be a living room, just with a microphone stand at the front. There were two couches on opposite ends and four small circular tables in the center.

Eventually the group filed down to the dimly lit room and took seats, notepads and beers in hand. It had a distinct first-day-of-school feel. Some regulars were eagerly discussing, in hushed tones, a “loony” and “incisive” comic one of them had seen recently.

One of the hosts bounded onstage. Bursting with energy, she sternly laid out ground rules: Keep the sets to five minutes. Comics could look at their notes onstage but should not look at them when off — a rule that was broken frequently.

The jokes were often unpolished. Many were unprintable. The comedians would frequently read off notes or talk through premises. And regularly, the punch lines would land on silence or faint chuckles. Every comedian seemed to have a version of “Is this thing on?”

Mark Benjamin, 31, joked about coming out of the closet.

“The most difficult part about it wasn’t telling my dad that I’m gay,” Mr. Benjamin said. “It was telling him what household objects I experimented with.”

Then came a riff expressing bewilderment at realizing he was gay.

“I don’t have any jokes for that yet.”

5:55 p.m.: ‘Who goes to open mikes to have fun?’

Sadiq Samani, 34, a partner at a technology company, took the microphone.

“I’ve been doing this for six years, and finally I feel good onstage,” Mr. Samani said during his set.

He was born in Pakistan and raised in Chicago. For a long period, he said, he was an undocumented immigrant because his family members had overstayed their visas.

“My parents have been living in America for 30 years, and they have learned nothing. Just like real Americans.”

One chuckle.

“And it annoys me,” he continued. “Like their accents, and their old immigrant ways annoy me. Sometimes I feel like an elitist. Just like a real American.”

Silence.

After another round of jokes about Islamophobia fell flat, Mr. Samani said, “These jokes might work better if I didn’t do them in front of white people.”

Afterward, he called the process “grueling.”

“Did you try the new bit?” another comic asked.

“The ‘real American’ one, I need to twist the words around,” Mr. Samani answered. “I’m going to play around with it. There’s something there in all of them.”

But it was how Mr. Samani closed his set that got the loudest laugh. It was the only thing that every single comic in the room could understand.

“Who goes to open mikes to have fun? I go to Six Flags to have fun. I go to open mikes because I have the audacity to believe that I’ll be better than Louis C.K.”

7 p.m.: Metropolitan Room

“I call it the meltdown,” Teresa Dagaetano, 34, said. “They start positive, and you just see them deconstruct.”

Ms. Dagaetano, a comic for seven years, was seating about a dozen comedians for the open mike she hosts in the basement of the Metropolitan Room, a cabaret and jazz club in the Flatiron district.

This space was even smaller than the one at Klimat Lounge. Next to the microphone stand, an upright piano collected dust. Behind a partition was the club’s kitchen, so while comedians performed, waiters wove in and out carrying plates to attendees of a jazz show upstairs. The comedians kept their volume down.

“You guys remember after the election all the New Yorkers wrote their feelings down on Post-it notes and stuck them in the subway?” said Mr. Donovan, a technology auditor who started his pursuit of full-time comedy almost three years ago. “Since when did all New Yorkers become passive-aggressive roommates?”

A follow-up to this punch line didn’t quite work, prompting Mr. Donovan to say: “Not a great tag. Can’t make that joke longer. I struck gold for two lines.”

That got the loudest laugh of all.

When Corey Reppond, 36, took the microphone, he acknowledged a harsh truth. He has performed for eight years and was easily one of the most experienced in the room.

“Most of us don’t even want to be here,” Mr. Reppond said.

9 p.m.: Beauty Bar

After his set, Mr. Reppond, a systems administrator, rushed to Beauty Bar on East 14th Street. He tries to do multiple sets every day.

“As you get a little bit further into it, you realize it’s very hard to make a living just doing stand-up comedy,” he said.

The comedians here didn’t need to go downstairs. They just had to walk to the back, past the manicures being given in the front to match the bar’s 1950s beauty-parlor décor. This brightly lit room was a rarity for open mikes. The comics could perform in front of a real audience. Curious patrons sauntered in to see if the comedians had anything funny to say.

Open mikes are often places where comedians touch on subjects they wouldn’t otherwise. Mr. Reppond joked about receiving a spam email with the subject line: “Your friend raped me.”

“Which is genius,” he said. “Who is going to say, ‘I’m going to see what Groupon has for me first?’”

He had tried this joke earlier. It worked much better here. The crowd was friendlier. His delivery was crisper.

“If you think it’s funny, chances are it’s probably funny,” Mr. Reppond said. “You just need to figure out a way to relay the thing that makes it funny.”

Sometimes, given the difficulty of getting laughs, it’s not really about that, as Reid Wittman, 30, pointed out.

“I ain’t trying to be funny,” Mr. Wittman said. “A lot of this is therapeutic for me.”After four uneven weeks on Capitol Hill since President Trump’s inauguration, lawmakers are heading home. Their constituents will be waiting.

At a series of town hall meetings scheduled during the coming recess, members of Congress are expected to encounter pointed questions, blistering protests and, maybe occasionally, small gestures of gratitude for agreeing to appear in the first place.

■ Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, will take questions from constituents in Mount Pleasant, near Charleston. Senator Tim Scott, also a Republican, will join him. The Times correspondent Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg) will report from the scene.

■ Democrats are vowing strong protests against Representative Tom Reed, a Republican from western New York. Our Facebook Live crew and The Times’s Thomas Kaplan (@thomaskaplan) will be there, so check back for updates.

Here is what to expect on Saturday:

Double billing in South Carolina

Mr. Sanford found an unusual partner for his town hall event in Mount Pleasant: a group called Indivisible Charleston, the local chapter of a national organization founded on the stated goal of “resisting the Trump agenda.” The group, organized by former congressional staff members, has helped to galvanize opponents of the president who might otherwise be disinclined to attend town hall meetings with their representatives.

Mr. Sanford, whose office worked with Indivisible to plan the event, has been among the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump, having taken issue with the president’s refusal to release his tax returns and his willingness to traffic in misinformation, among other concerns.

The event’s other headliner is Mr. Scott, who has, so far, been far less eager to criticize Mr. Trump.

A Bronx cheer in upstate New York?

Mr. Reed did not have to seek out any protesters. They will surely find him.

Organizers from the Indivisible group are also expected to make their presence known at Mr. Reed’s series of town halls, as The Buffalo News reported. Though he represents a district that has been viewed as safely Republican, the congressman, who was a vice chairman on Mr. Trump’s transition team, is likely to face considerable blowback from left-leaning locals who oppose the president.

Repeal, replace, repeat

By now, Republicans have grown accustomed to voicing their desire to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — a talking point that has lasted several election cycles. But as the effort proceeds in fits and starts in Washington, voters seem to be losing patience.

Answering questions about the health care law is perhaps the thorniest task that Republicans face. The reason: They are taking heat from both sides. Defenders of the law often confront lawmakers with wrenching personal stories of the law’s effects and argue that the measure has been a force for good on balance. Opponents, on the other hand, have listened for years as Republicans pledged to turn back the law and are wondering what is taking so long after the party seized the White House to go along with its majorities in both congressional chambers.

The tweetable moment

Not every town hall has one. But when it arrives, a lawmaker seems to know.

Already this year, there have been constituent confrontations that rippled across social media. Perhaps most memorably, Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was serenaded with chants of “Do your job!” as he strained to quell the anger at a recent forum. Mr. Chaffetz has faced criticism for not seeking aggressive investigations of assorted Trump-related controversies, including possible connections between the president’s orbit and Russian intelligence.

Then there was Representative Tom McClintock of California, who had to be escorted away by police officers after protests at an event earlier this month.

Before the recess, House Republicans had been advised on security precautions in the event of overwhelming protests.Ms. Smith is but one of many Texans and former Texans named Texas. It’s not their nickname but the formal name given to them by their parents that appears on their birth certificates, IDs and, in some cases, obituaries. Texas Elmer Jones, for example, was born in Anona, Tex., fought in World War II and later moved from his namesake state to South Carolina, where he died in 2013 at age 89.

Texas is a powerful word, and its power is magnified within the state. Attaching those two syllables to all manner of things — and people and creatures — lends them a certain authenticity and Texas-ness.

That slice of bread isn’t just toast. It’s Texas Toast. That song on the radio isn’t just country. It’s Texas Country. That creature isn’t just a toad. It’s a Texas Toad, also known by its not-as-catchy scientific name, Anaxyrus speciosus. That lavender plant isn’t just a shrub. It’s a Texas vervain.

None of the other states I’ve lived in had such a hold on its residents that people felt compelled to name their children after it. People like Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith are proof that the mythology of Texas has a very real influence on Texans’ lives, shaping their identities in ways that few states could ever claim.

“Why not give a baby the ultimate name?” said W.F. Strong, an expert on Texas folklore and a professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Brownsville. “After all, what do Texans admire and cherish more than Texas herself? If I ever have another son I think I will name him Texas: Texas Strong. There would be a lot of fun in normal parenting. ‘Texas, why can’t you behave?’ I can hear the kid saying, ‘Have you read my history?’ ”

I wanted to get to know Texas, so I invited Ms. Smith to lunch.

We met one recent afternoon at Elmo’s Grill in West Columbia, Tex., a short drive from her home in nearby Sweeny, a town nearly 70 miles south of Houston. One of the first things I wanted to know was whether it actually said Texas on her driver’s license. She seemed to expect the question, and quickly displayed a Texas license that read “Smith, Texas June.” When your first name is Texas, it turns out, you get used to pulling out ID.

“When I was younger, I don’t know how many times I’ve been called a liar,” said Ms. Smith, who lived years ago in Massachusetts. “People were very rude, especially when I was up North. My husband was in the service and every time I would go to a doctor’s appointment or something like that, they’d say, ‘Your last name?’ And I’d say, ‘Parker,’ at that time. And they’d say, ‘Your first name?’ ‘Texas.’ ‘Lady, I want your first name, not the state you’re from.’ ‘Sir, my first name is Texas.’ And they would just argue with me like I’m lying to them. I would get so frustrated that I would just pull out my ID and lay it on the counter and say, ‘Would you just take it off here?’ ”

Ms. Smith has short reddish-brown hair, a slight raspy twang and, appropriately enough, a no-nonsense approach to life. The doctor who suggested the name, the late Dr. S. Braswell Locker, a native Texan himself, would no doubt have been proud.

Ms. Smith calls herself a country girl. She was raised on a farming ranch and started driving a pickup truck at the age of 5 or 6, using the blocks her father put on the pedals so her feet could reach. “I’d pick up Daddy’s .22 and I’d go hunting by myself, or I’d pick up the old cane pole and I’d go fishing,” she said of her childhood. “I’m me and that’s all you’re ever going to make out of me. I am who I am.”

At one point in her life, when she was in her 20s, Ms. Smith considered changing her first name. But she never seriously pursued it. “I would never disrespect my mother,” she said. “She gave me that name. The doctor gave me that name. I’m not changing my name. I got to go with it.”

Ms. Smith, who is now widowed, had a total of eight children. “When I was in Massachusetts, I was pregnant,” she recalled. “My sister, she was living here in the state of Texas, and she said, ‘Can I name the baby if it’s a girl?’ I wrote her back and I said no. J.C., my brother, was going to name the baby. And she said, ‘OK, but I got to tell you what I got picked out. If it’s a girl, I want you to name her Massachusetts July.’ I thought, ‘Oh, my God.’ ”The president noted, in his preferred pointed-playful quasi-Mafioso style, “Both sides will have to make compromises.” He said he’d like to see Netanyahu “hold back on settlements for a little bit.” (So now they are an impediment to peace, after all. Duh.) He went into kick-the-can mode on the incendiary issue of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.

Reality, in the form of conversations with Arab leaders, has bitten. Real estate in the Holy Land is different; it’s dynamite.

Predictably, the Israeli right — I mean the far right beyond Netanyahu — celebrated Trump’s shift. Naftali Bennett, the education minister, announced a “new era.” He tweeted that there was no need for a “third Palestinian state beyond Jordan and Gaza.” The Palestinians were incensed.

But beyond that noise, the reality of simmering stalemate is unchanged. Israel will not annex the West Bank because adding 2.5 million Palestinian citizens would undo the Jewish state. It prefers to oppress and humiliate 2.5 million nonvoting noncitizens. Settlement growth will continue, as it has for almost 50 years, and the more than 400,000 settlers in the West Bank will convey better than words what Israel really thinks of Palestinian statehood. The Palestinian Authority, headed by Mahmoud Abbas, will remain a monument to impotence. Palestinian fury will periodically erupt.

Netanyahu was explicit. He wants a Jewish state that retains “the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.” That, he claimed, was what he’s been saying for years. Wrong. When he first reluctantly admitted the possibility of two states in 2009, he insisted Palestine be “demilitarized.” That’s not the same as total Israeli security control. Netanyahu is now close to Bennett’s position: Some form of Palestinian self-rule (and they can call it what they like) on whatever disjointed fragments of the West Bank remain once Israel has satisfied its security needs.

As Daniel Shapiro, the former American ambassador to Israel, told me: “A two-state solution must assure Israel’s security. But it must also pass the laugh test of a sovereign Palestinian state.” Netanyahu’s proposal does not pass the test of what Palestinians will ever accept.

Enter the la-la-land of the “outside-in” regional approach to peace, whereby Israel’s “newfound Arab partners,” in Netanyahu’s words, unlock the impasse by pressuring Palestinians to compromise. Sure, bound by shared anti-Iranian concerns, some Arab states have found intelligence cooperation with Israel useful, but their sympathy ends where Palestinian humiliation begins.

Netanyahu is going to have to put something on the table: a halt to settlement growth; Palestinian economic development in the large Israeli-controlled West Bank area known as “Area C”; agreement on borders at the pre-1967 lines with agreed territorial swaps. Something! Arabs, whatever millennial loathing they harbor for Iran, have not suddenly swooned into Israel’s arms.

A sickly arrogance pervaded the Trump-Netanyahu love fest. Their shared contempt for the Palestinian people is obvious. The Trump administration has just blocked the appointment of Salam Fayyad to head the U.N. mission in Libya on the grounds that, well, he’s a Palestinian.

No matter that he’s a widely respected, American-educated, former Palestinian prime minister who has been a tireless and innovative seeker of a two-state peace. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the U.N., said, “The United States does not currently recognize a Palestinian state or support the signal this appointment would send.” What signal, pray? Trump should lift the American objection to Fayyad right now if he’s serious about a deal.

This is prejudice as policy, the worst of Trump (with his grotesque deflection of a question about anti-Semitism into a celebration of his victory not far behind). It suggests his interesting one-state two-state provocation will lead nowhere.Photo

Given the increased political power Republicans won in the last elections, from Washington to red-state legislatures, voters might expect the party to feel that the nation’s voting procedures are working quite well. Yet this is far from the case, as triumphant Republicans are using their enhanced clout to continue their campaign playing up the mythical threat that voter fraud abounds in the nation.

The newest and loudest zealot in this cause is, of course, President Trump, with his scurrilous claim that millions of illegal ballots cost him a popular vote majority. His baseless claim only encourages the renewed efforts at voter suppression reported to be underway in a score of Republican-dominated statehouses intent on making it harder for citizens to register or vote.

Mr. Trump is trying to sell the false idea that he was fraudulently denied a clear mandate. Republican state legislators, in turn, are no more convincing but just as cynical in insisting that elaborate new ballot protections are needed — protections that effectively target poor people, minorities and students, who tend to favor Democratic candidates.

These include proposals requiring voters to produce new or tighter voter identification documentation and photos at the polls. Other measures would eliminate the convenience of Election Day registration, which invites more turnout. Some measures make it more difficult for college students to claim residency to vote near their colleges; others shorten early voting periods that encourage greater participation.

These are the sorts of hurdles federal courts struck down in some states before the last election as transparent voter suppression. In North Carolina, the courts found the Republican Legislature had blatantly used racial data to deny African-American voters their franchise with a regressive program of “almost surgical precision.”

Fourteen states had new registration and voting restrictions in effect last year, pushing a conservative agenda devised to secure and protect Republican incumbency. They were encouraged by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act requiring some states to obtain Justice Department approval before changing election laws.

With this vital protection gone and President Trump inveighing against nonexistent voter fraud, the threat to voter confidence in ballot integrity is considerable.

The new state attempts at voter suppression are underway in a political environment that has drastically changed. Jeff Sessions, the new attorney general, is hardly likely to be as proactive as the Obama administration was in investigating complaints of voter suppression by the states. Mr. Sessions is on record as finding the Voting Rights Act “intrusive.” In 1986, the Senate rejected Mr. Sessions as a nominee for the federal bench, based on past racially offensive comments and his role in prosecuting a voter fraud case against black civil rights activists in Alabama.

Research shows voter fraud is a minuscule occurrence — with an incident rate at no higher than 0.0025 percent at worst, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice. For all their concern about voter fraud, House Republicans are attempting to terminate the Election Assistance Commission, which was created to protect ballot integrity after the 2000 presidential election’s hanging-chad fiasco. President Trump has cried fraud in his obsession with undermining the fact that Hillary Clinton proved more popular in the total vote. He is citing as an authority the ruminations of a discredited right-wing conspiracy theorist. Offering no real evidence, he has called for a sweeping federal inquiry into his suspicions, to be led by Vice President Mike Pence.

President Trump’s postelection concern should be with the government intelligence finding that Russian hackers interfered with the election campaign, apparently in favor of him. But he is narcissistically concerned with his own vote tally. Instead of looking into the threat of foreign foul play, he would rather join the Republican chorus that is undermining vital respect for democracy.Several admirers of the play spoke recently about why “The Skin of Our Teeth” endures, what makes it problematic and why this could be a ripe time for its resurgence. Here are edited excerpts from those interviews.

Carey Perloff

The artistic director of American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco directed “The Skin of Our Teeth” at Classic Stage Company in New York in 1986 — a production that, according to Mr. Gussow’s review in The Times, included the refugees in Act I singing a chorus of “Tomorrow,” from “Annie.” Ms. Perloff laughed as she said she didn’t recall much about that long-ago detail, but she was very clear on the play’s current resonance.

All of us who are running theaters now are in this strange position of thinking: What is the appropriate response to the chaos and uncertainty of this moment, and how do you think about that theatrically? It was very prescient of Jeffrey to program this.

I think the reason this one keeps coming back is that it is an allegory, so it has those deep biblical roots and kind of archaeological references. It’s a very profound play to rehearse, because those epic questions come up as you work: Is humanity resilient? It’s a really dystopian look at the American experiment, and I think that’s what we’re all kind of waking up to. We assumed we would be inheritors of this great ideal, and now we realize how completely fragile it is.

There are great things in the play, and there are really frustrating things in the play. As with many great theatrical artifacts, you sort of wish you could take it apart and recombine it somehow. Sometimes I think we should give ourselves permission to do important plays even if they don’t really work.

Paula Vogel

“The Skin of Our Teeth” is the first play that the playwright (“Indecent”) ever saw, at her public high school in Maryland in the 1960s. A self-described “huge fanatic about Thornton Wilder,” she regards it as an example of near perfection and said it has been deeply influential on emerging writers over the past 40 years. Ms. Vogel, a Pulitzer Prize winner, considers the play — with its reverence for books and great thinkers, represented by Mr. Antrobus’s cherished personal library — a defense of Western humanism.

In my life, I’ve only seen two productions of it. One of the difficulties is that commercial and mainstream American drama has eschewed Wilder’s more global, abstract, philosophical voice for a kind of nitty-gritty naturalism, which doesn’t critique American society the same way that Wilder does. What I think happens is that there is a critical reprimand for choosing mythic elements and allegorical elements in American theater.

It’s an extraordinary time to be producing this play. We’re in this moment in time where we are thinking again very apocalyptically. A, we’re having extreme climate change; B, we’re having floods; C, we’re having refugees; and D, we’re actually facing the extinction of animals on our planet, and then hanging over us is the perpetual warfare. Everything in the play is pretty much upon us.

Obviously he’s writing on the brink of huge apocalypse, of World War II and Hitler, and he’s saying: “Let’s look at the resistance. Let’s look at the fact that we are going to get through this, and let’s look at what we need to get through it. What we need are our books.”

Arin Arbus

Ms. Arbus first encountered “The Skin of Our Teeth” in 2002, when the nation was still reeling from 9/11, and immediately wanted to direct it. “I thought, If I don’t do it soon, it just won’t be relevant anymore,” she said, and laughed with what sounded like ruefulness. She agrees with Wilder that the play comes alive in times of crisis, but she believes it is staged as rarely as it is partly because of its complex requirements, including a large cast and the need to balance multiple theatrical styles while leaving room for Wilder’s humor.



One of the challenges and the thrills of it is the slippery style of the play: We go kind of without transition from a Brechtian theater, in which the emotional climax of the scene is broken and commented upon, into absurdist drama with lines like “Have you milked the mammoth?” into this dark domestic family tragedy. Unlocking that is hard.

He was writing it as the world was descending into chaos. I think everybody was wondering: “Will we get through this? And if we do, what then? Will we learn anything? Will we grow or change or do it better the next time?” Although the characters do grow and they survive, they are not transformed. Evil — quote-unquote evil — remains within the nation and within the family and within the home.

Things keep falling apart, and these characters have to go through it over and over and over and over again. That’s what it’s about. The characters are continually hitting rock bottom and then finding a way — and it’s usually with the help of other people — to have the hope to move forward, despite the catastrophic situation that is facing them in that immediate moment.

Bartlett Sher

The Tony-winning director, whose “Oslo” opens on Broadway this spring, has immersed himself twice in the Wilder play: first as an assistant to the director Robert Woodruff on a Guthrie Theater production in Minneapolis in 1990, then on his own Intiman Theater staging in Seattle in 2007. He cast the deaf actor Howie Seago in the role of Mr. Antrobus — in part, Mr. Sher said, to add “another layer of Joycean logic” to the play. He has great affection for Wilder, for both his experimental nature and his capacious heart, but that didn’t make staging the play any easier.



It’s a hard, hard, hard, hard show. It’s all based on “Finnegans Wake.” He was reaching for a kind of narrative in the structure that he put together that’s incredibly interesting but which I’m not sure he was totally successful at accomplishing. It’s one of those things that everybody’s really drawn to, how much they can’t wait to do it, and then they find out how hard it’s going to be.

It has a comforting and profound view of time. It makes you think of time over a very long arc. Right now we’re all freaking out and exploding over the particular kind of time that 2017 appears to be. But if you cycle way back, you think: “Well, yes, we’re going through an incredibly bumpy period in the republic, but it’s not impossible that the institutions will survive and come out reinvigorated.”

The primary job of interpreting the classics — absolutely primary job — is to discover the immediate significance of the work in the time you’re doing it. It’s interesting that Arin is doing it now, because I tend to think these works come around when you need them. It may be one of those things where this particular time requires a good “Skin of Our Teeth” to help make sense of it.“Why are we O.K. with this?” Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. “Complacency is killing us.”

Part of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing.

They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers’ eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist.

“It’s not just talking on the phone that’s a problem today,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “You now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones.”

Government officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures.

A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense — meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense — drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations.

“It’s still the same things that are killing drivers — belts, booze and speed,” Mr. Adkins said.

About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government’s main auto-safety agency.

In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state’s 103,000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama’s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state’s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving high-speed crashes.

“Total crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,” he said in an interview. “I think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there’s no one there to deter it.”

In some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1,500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher.

In the fall, the N.H.T.S.A., the National Transportation Safety Board and several nongovernmental organizations, including the National Safety Council, began the Road to Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities within 30 years. The effort places heavy emphasis on the promise of autonomous vehicles.

But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. “The way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the nuts-and-bolts measures, not self-driving cars,” the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October.

Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring rear-seat occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking.

In presenting its 2016 fatality estimates, the National Safety Council endorsed those ideas and also called for bans on all use of smartphones by drivers, even if they use hands-free calling or messaging.

The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired.

The safety council’s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N.H.T.S.A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.Photo

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A man from North Korea has been arrested in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Malaysian police announced Saturday.

The man, identified as Ri Jong Chol, 46, was arrested Friday evening, the police said, but they provided no further details.

The police had been searching for four men, including at least one North Korean, who they believed had been involved in the attack on Mr. Kim on Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

Two women suspected of being involved in the attack, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, were arrested earlier in the week. A Malaysian man, described as the boyfriend of the Indonesian woman, was arrested and is said to be assisting the police in the investigation.

On Friday, North Korea broke its silence on Mr. Kim’s assassination, demanding that the Malaysian authorities surrender the body and vowing to reject any post-mortem they conducted.

The response to the assassination, in a statement by the North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, also accused the Malaysians of plotting to “besmirch” the North over the killing, heightening tensions between the two countries.

The statement was read to reporters outside a Kuala Lumpur hospital where the body of Mr. Kim, 46, has been held since he was attacked on Monday at the airport.

The police believe that the assassination was carried out by two women who struck Mr. Kim with a poisoned needle and wiped quick-acting poison on his face as he awaited a flight to Macau, where he lives with his family.

Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said Friday that the Indonesian suspect, Siti Aishah, told the Malaysian police that she had thought she was engaged in a prank and had been paid a small amount for her participation. She told the police that she had not realized it was an assassination, he said.

South Korean officials have said they suspect that the assassination was ordered by Kim Jong-un, 33, as part of his effort to consolidate power in the reclusive country, run by his family for nearly seven decades.

Malaysian news media on Thursday quoted officials as saying that the North Korean government had requested the body.

The ambassador’s statement on Friday did not identify the body as that of Kim Jong-nam.

But the statement, quoted by news agencies at the scene, said that the “Malaysian side forced the post-mortem without our permission and witnessing” and that “we will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance.”

Channel NewsAsia, in its account of the ambassador’s response, quoted him as saying, “We will respond strongly to the moves of the hostile forces towards us with their intent to besmirch the image of our republic by politicizing this incident.”

No relatives of Kim Jong-nam have come forward from Macau to claim the body. The South China Morning Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported on Friday that the relatives had been placed under police protection in Macau, fearing for their safety.Photo

Outside of a sushi context, I don’t usually spend much time thinking about eels, but “A Cure for Wellness” gave me no choice. Ever since the screening, I’ve been wondering about those slithery creatures, which you may have noticed in the trailers and the posters, where a bunch of them share a bathtub with Mia Goth, one of the movie’s stars.

Not wondering in the “What does it mean?” sense, mind you. Anyone who has even a slight acquaintance with Freudian theory or Japanese erotica will grasp the psychosexual significance of those eels, who live in the aquifer underneath an Alpine spa and occasionally make their way into the plumbing and beyond. My questions are of a more basic nature: How did they get down there in the first place? Are they an invasive species or part of the native ecosystem? What evolutionary process might account for their curiously symbiotic relationship with the spa’s human residents?

It would be unfair to blame the director, Gore Verbinski, or the screenwriter, Justin Haythe, for declining to provide a thorough explanation. “A Cure for Wellness” defiantly and splendidly flouts the tenets of plausibility and coherence, which have never interested Mr. Verbinski very much. His résumé, after all, includes “The Lone Ranger” (also written by Mr. Haythe), “Rango” and, most notably, the first three “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies. He comes by his knack for enjoyable nonsense as honestly as his taste for aquatic fauna.

The eels may be the key to the puzzle posed by his latest project, or they may be (forgive me) a red herring. Maybe it would be best to drop the piscatory metaphors altogether. “A Cure for Wellness” is a lustrous box of genre candy, the self-revealing work of an auteur who has laid bare not so much his psyche as his online streaming queue. To watch this movie is, above all, to make a list of all the other movies it evokes, sometimes with a literalness that treads the boundary between homage and outright plagiarism.What’s your favorite book no one else has heard of?

While researching my novel I came across two quirky, powerful books on Lincoln, both consummate labors of love: “The Physical Lincoln,” by John G. Sotos, M.D., is a catalog of every description of every part of Lincoln’s body ever recorded. “The Unpopular Mr. Lincoln,” by Larry Tagg, lists all of the many negative, hateful and/or threatening things ever written about Lincoln. These had the effect of destabilizing my view of history, underscoring the notion that any history is just a selective sampling, and that reality is always eluding our attempts to reduce it. Edmund Wilson’s “Patriotic Gore” is a real mind-rearranger re the Civil War: sobering to think that such intelligent, literary people could get themselves into such a blood bath. While I don’t think it’s accurate to say that “no one has heard of” the poetry of Hayden Carruth, I think it deserves a lot more attention than it gets — never fails to speak to me and alter my mind-set for the better.

How do you organize your books?

I like to leave them lying around half read, go to another city, buy a new copy, leave that somewhere, come home, be unable to relocate that first copy, then buy a third copy, which I then spill some coffee on.

Tell us about your favorite short stories.

Some stories that are really alive for me right now are “The Stone Boy,” by Gina Berriault; “A Thousand and One Knives,” by Hassan Blasim (from his wonderful collection, “The Corpse Exhibition and Other Stories of Iraq”); “Gooseberries,” by Anton Chekhov; “Hunters in the Snow,” by Tobias Wolff; “The Gilded Six-Bits,” by Zora Neale Hurston; “Doctor Jack-o’-Lantern,” by Richard Yates. I’m also excited about the work of two new writers: Will Mackin, who had an unforgettable story called “Kattekoppen” in The New Yorker a few years back, about the war in Afghanistan, and Mariana Enriquez and her collection “Things We Lost in the Fire.”

What moves you most in a work of literature?

Depictions of goodness that are not fraudulent or sentimental.

What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?

I love reading anything about gigantic animate blobs of molten iron who secretly long to be concert pianists. It’s not a particularly well-populated genre, but in particular I’d mention, “Grog, Who Loved Chopin,” as well as the somewhat derivative “Clom, Big Fan of Mozart.”

What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift?

When I was in third grade, a nun on whom I had a crush (hi, Sister Lynette!) lent me a library copy of “Johnny Tremain,” by Esther Forbes. That was the first time I’d ever noticed style as a thing in itself — the thing that made the fictive world seem more real.

Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?

I like the first-person narrator of Isaac Babel’s classic story about class, “In the Basement,” who, at the end of the story, completely humiliated, tries to drown himself in a rain barrel, but is saved by his grandfather, who tells him: “Grandson, I go now to take castor oil, so I’ll have something to lay on your grave.” A really upbeat family story. As an antihero, I think I’d take Edward Casaubon, from “Middlemarch,” who, if he’s “bad,” is bad in the way real people are bad; i.e., starts out himself and then is perfectly content to stay that way, no matter what happens around him or how miserable he’s making everyone.

What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?

I read a lot of popular books about baseball and war, that shared a sort of upbeat “can-do” ethos. Shortstops and fighter pilots were always gritting their teeth in order to come from behind and so on, after which they would modestly deflect the credit toward someone else. A great life lesson! If you’re a pilot or a shortstop. I was also a big “Peanuts” fan, and believed for a time that the “Mr. Magoo” version of “A Christmas Carol” was the original, and that Dickens had been “riffing off of” the TV special.

If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

I’d recommend that 18th-century classic on political strategy by the Count deRinchy, called “A Tim’ly Resignation Doth Suit a Gentleman Well.” There is also his lesser-known classic, “Labor Thee Always to Not Insult or Afright Those Thou Wouldst Leadeth.” DeRinchy also was a poet of some repute, and his little volume “The Truth Remains True, Even Amongst a Sea of Deliberate Falsehoods” is a timeless classic.

But the president is a busy man, so I might just have him read this, from “A Christmas Carol,” in a spooky Jacob Marley voice: “Business! Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!”

You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?

I’d game this one by inviting Julia Child and Anthony Bourdain, putting them in charge of the menu, the cooking, the serving and the cleanup, then naming myself as the third writer.

Whom would you want to write your life story?

Me, as a memoir, on the occasion of my 300th birthday.

What do you plan to read next?

I’ve been saving “The Underground Railroad,” by Colson Whitehead, in order to read it just before our event in New York City in February. “The Reluctant Fundamentalist” and “Exit West,” by Mohsin Hamid; “10:04,” by Ben Lerner; “Big Machine,” by Victor LaValle; “Sweetbitter,” by Stephanie Danler; “The Girls,” by Emma Cline; “The Strange Case of Rachel K,” by Rachel Kushner; “Zinky Boys,” by Svetlana Alexievich; “A Manual for Cleaning Women,” by Lucia Berlin; “The Sellout,” by Paul Beatty; and “Blessed Are the Peacemakers: Christ’s Teachings About Love, Compassion and Forgiveness,” by Wendell Berry, for a shot of clarity and hope.Unilever said it had spurned the offer, which it said “fundamentally undervalues” the British-Dutch company.

Still, that is not expected to end the matter. Pressed by growing competition from upstarts and changing consumer habits, food and consumer-goods giants will have little choice but to seek deals.

And 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that bought Heinz, then Kraft just two years ago, has the resources and the good will of Wall Street to continue to pursue Unilever. It also has the support of Warren E. Buffett, who has previously collaborated with 3G and is expected to provide financing in any deal with Unilever.

A combination of Kraft Heinz and Unilever would create an empire of hundreds of household names, with more than $82 billion in sales. Kraft Heinz’s geographic strength in North American packaged-food sales would complement Unilever’s stronger sales in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia.

Kraft Heinz executives have “said they really want to develop and have an international platform for those Kraft Heinz brands,” said Brittany Weissman, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think Unilever would give them that international platform to get those brands out overseas.”

But a merger would be certain to draw antitrust reviews by regulators from many countries.

“Market power would be much increased, as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,” John Colley, a professor of practice in strategy and leadership at Warwick Business School in Coventry, England.

Kraft Heinz approached Unilever about a potential deal in the last few weeks, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations.

Among its pitches, these people said, was that the combined company would maintain headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. That could prove important amid rising nationalist sentiment, given Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and an election approaching in the Netherlands.

Kraft Heinz, with 3G behind the wheel, has long been considered the most likely to drive a wave of consolidation in the food industry. Friday’s disclosure followed speculation late last year that Kraft Heinz might make an offer for Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos and Ritz crackers

Shares of Mondelez, and those of companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup that had been seen as potential targets, fell on Friday in part because of disappointment over news of the Unilever bid. Shares of Kraft Heinz surged nearly 11 percent.

The Brazilian principals of 3G have led a buying spree over two decades to become a global force in food and beverages. In doing so, they have won the admiration of no less a business eminence than Mr. Buffett. They took a small Brazilian brewing company and eventually transformed it into Anheuser-Busch InBev, the 800-pound gorilla of beer.

Kraft Consolidation Consumer goods are consolidating as companies push for more space in the public’s shopping carts.

They moved into fast food by buying Burger King, then merging it with Tim Hortons, Canada’s foremost purveyor of coffee and doughnuts.

And with Mr. Buffett’s help, they bought Heinz in 2013, transforming a staid American ketchup legend into a lean maker of condiments and canned soups. Two years later, in 2015, they bought Kraft to become even bigger.

Now — almost two years after the Kraft deal — 3G and Kraft Heinz are casting their eyes on Unilever, which is the fourth-biggest seller of packaged food worldwide and the second-largest consumer-goods maker behind Procter & Gamble.

Unilever, which is based in London and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has embraced sustainability measures aimed at reducing the company’s environmental impact and improving customers’ health. It has also moved to update its products with younger, hipper names by buying start-ups like Dollar Shave Club and the cleaning products maker Seventh Generation.

And the company has built an important presence in developing countries, which now account for some 58 percent of its revenue.

Still, Unilever has been weighed down by slowing sales in the last year, prompting some analysts to call for additional cost cuts. Combining with Kraft Heinz would leave the company in the hands of masters of cost-cutting, who have won praise from Mr. Buffett.

At Burger King, for example, 3G-installed executives disposed of luxurious corporate offices, the corporate jet and even workers’ personal printers.

At Kraft Heinz, that approach has helped lead to profit margins of about 30 percent, compared with roughly 15 percent at Unilever.

Unilever said that Kraft Heinz’s bid was valued at roughly $50 a share, for an 18 percent premium to the target company’s closing price on Thursday. The offer consists of $30.23 a share in cash and 0.222 in shares in the combined company.

Under British takeover rules, Kraft would have until March 17 to announce its firm intention to make an offer for Unilever or it would have to walk away.

Shares of Unilever jumped in Friday trading in London after The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog reported the offer.

A deal for Unilever would be expensive by any measure, particularly because Kraft Heinz already has nearly $30 billion in long-term debt on its books. But Kraft Heinz has argued in private that it has healthy cash flows that could easily service the additional debt that would help finance the bid.

Potentially further bolstering Kraft Heinz’s firepower is Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which helped finance 3G’s $23 billion purchase of Heinz and its merger with Kraft.

Some analysts, however, were cautious on the prospects of a Unilever sale. Raphael Moreau, an analyst with Euromonitor in London, said that Unilever might ultimately be willing to pursue a smaller deal with Kraft to offload some of its food brands.

“While creating synergies in sauces and soups could be a rationale for such a deal, a combination of Heinz and Hellmann’s in mayonnaise could struggle to be given approval by competition authorities,” Mr. Moreau said.

And some British lawmakers have already criticized Kraft Heinz’s approach, pointing to Brexit and the decline in the pound as paving the way for “fire sales” of British companies.

The chairman of Parliament’s business committee, Iain Wright, said on Friday that “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality.”Times journalists around the world bring you a new 360 video every day.Cooking an entire meal on one rimmed baking pan — the so-called sheet pan supper — has become its own category of cooking, the oven analogue of the one-pot meal.

I was an early adopter of the sheet pan supper. You can’t beat the ease, especially when what you end up with is not only simpler than most other dinners, but also better — at least if you like your food to have some crunch.

Photo

That’s the benefit of a sheet pan. Spreading out all your ingredients in one layer and exposing them to the oven’s high heat allows them to truly crisp and brown, more so than with any other cooking method short of frying. And if whatever you’re making isn’t quite brown enough, a quick stint under the broiler will take you there.

In this recipe, I give spicy broccoli pasta the sheet pan treatment. It’s a particularly convenient dish to make. You roast some broccoli on a sheet pan, then toss everything else on top before returning it to the broiler.

You do have to boil the pasta in a pot before adding it to the sheet pan, so this recipe doesn’t technically qualify as a one-pan meal. But it comes pretty close, and that extra pot is well worth the washing for such a satisfying meatless main course.

The combination of ingredients — broccoli, pasta, fresh ricotta and Parmesan — could also be piled into a casserole dish and baked. You’ll end up with something more discretely golden on top, and soft in the middle.

Photo

But here I was going for maximum browning. I wanted the broccoli florets to be audibly crisp. I wanted the pasta to nearly burn at its edges. I even wanted the usually silky ricotta cheese to burnish and caramelize. And just for good measure, I added a thin coating of Parmesan-spiked bread crumbs to fill in the nooks and crannies.

All of those assertive textures call for bold flavors. So I added whole cumin seed and chile flakes to the broccoli, and then some grated lemon zest to the bread-crumb topping. A squeeze of lemon juice at the end adds just enough brightness to bring everything together.

After making this dish once, you can use it as a template for future sheet pan suppers with pasta, swapping in vegetables like brussels sprouts, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, zucchini, eggplant and cauliflower for the broccoli, and other soft cheeses — perhaps goat cheese or Camembert — for the ricotta.

Just keep the high heat and the bread crumbs. You want to get that crunch.

One of the deciding factors was New York City. The fact that I get to stay at home and sleep in my own bed is such a luxury after working all over the world. And the character of Scottie is unpredictable in a way that I like. She can take a detour and start talking about her insecurities and anxieties in the middle of an interrogation.

You’re known for playing formidable women. Was that a deliberate choice?

The big thing that put me on the map was the Bond movie, and it catapulted me in a very specific direction. I worked very hard against that for years on independent films with Woody Allen and Robert Altman, only to come back to the “X-Men” series to play Jean Grey. So my career has been defined by these very big, strong, powerful women. I thought, well, if I just am going to go against type, it will pay off over time. Whether it really has or not, I don’t know.

You eventually wrote and directed a movie, “Bringing Up Bobby” (2012).

I actually thought for a while that I didn’t want to act and started taking steps to go in different directions because I didn’t feel that I could express myself in the right way in that profession anymore. I also really didn’t want to be a woman who had to battle her age for that long. We all know what that’s like in this business.

You’ve spoken out about age and sexism in Hollywood, especially after you weren’t asked to return as the older version of Jean Grey in the “X-Men” series, unlike the characters played by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. What’s the solution?

People like Geena Davis [who in 2007 founded the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media] are doing incredible things to bring awareness to how we can start changing things by simply putting more women or girls in the background, or by changing the lead from a male lead into a female lead. You need to start somewhere. I think it’s just going to take time and a lot more women behind the camera. But each and every one of us can never give up. We have to continue to fight for our rights as women in the film business.

So how old are you?

Do we want to put that in there? I’m 52. The reason why I’m saying that is because I never had a problem with my age. I’ve been very open about it, never lied about it. [But] you don’t talk about Denzel Washington and say how old he is. It’s not attached to his name. With women, they always do it, but then they don’t say she looks [younger], so she could play [younger]. They say she’s that age, so she can’t play anything else. So it really hurts us in the end, and it shouldn’t be that way.The photographer behind “Vista Manhattan: Views From New York City’s Finest Residences” on what it’s like to shoot what most people never get to see.Photo

LOS ANGELES — A lawyer for Roman Polanski has asked a judge here to unseal testimony from a former deputy district attorney who handled his case from the 1970s.

Harold Braun, Mr. Polanski’s lawyer, said the testimony was essential to proving that Mr. Polanski had already served the time necessary after a 1977 guilty plea to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl.

Mr. Polanski, now 83, fled the United States in 1978 when he thought the judge in the case was withdrawing a plea bargain and would sentence him to up to 50 years in prison.

The California court has ruled that Mr. Polanski — who has remained abroad, in Switzerland, Poland and elsewhere — must return to Los Angeles to resolve his case. Despite repeated requests from prosecutors, foreign courts have ruled that they would not extradite him.

Mr. Braun said that the 2010 testimony from Roger Gunson, the deputy district attorney who had handled the case since the 1970s, would bolster the argument that Mr. Polanski has already served his time by spending more than 300 days in jail and house arrest in Switzerland.

Though no recent cataloging has been done, Ms. Brewer believes the problem remains largely the same.

“While some of the specific corridors that were missing many building numbers in 2010 may have improved,’’ she said, “everyone I’ve talked to about this bill has their own recent frustrating story, and I have plenty of my own. It seems like every New Yorker’s been forced to look for a building without a number.”

The new bill, which would have to be signed into law by Mayor Bill de Blasio, was introduced by Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and is chairman of the Council’s housing committee. “I think in certain places, it might be chic, I guess, not to have an address,” Mr. Williams said. “You start backing up and do a bird’s-eye view, and see how much of a problem it can cause for the community.”

While it is unclear how the problem of a city full of address-free addresses got started, it has been vexing New Yorkers for some time. A 1929 article in The New York Times bemoaned the situation: “After a search, the modern knight errant may find the store or office he seeks, but chances are he will not find the number that is supposed to be displayed to identify the location of the building.” And that was 17 years after a law was in place requiring addresses, according to the article.

Vlad Rudolf, the chief estimator at a Queens-based company that makes custom awnings, said he routinely received requests for awnings with building names, not numbers, perhaps because it somehow seems more upscale. “They tried to sort of pimp it up,” he said. “‘Louisiana,’ for example, is better than 123.”

Under the old law, fines were relatively modest: $25 a day for the first offense, and $5 a day for every day until it was rectified. Now the fines would rise to $250 for the first offense and $50 a day until an address number was installed. Enforcement for residential buildings has long been handled by the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, but enforcement for commercial buildings is not defined, so a second bill is being drafted to determine which agency will assume that responsibility.

While missing numbers have annoyed New Yorkers forced to follow a glowing GPS dot on a phone’s screen, the law’s proponents say the most pressing reason for the law is safety. “Address information is critically important to help our firefighters, E.M.T.s and paramedics ascertain — as quickly as possible — the location of a reported medical emergency, fire or other life-threatening call for help,” the city’s fire commissioner, Daniel A. Nigro, said in a statement.

Absent address numbers have carried a financial cost for Thomas Mabry, who with his brother delivers for Zucker’s Bagels and Smoked Fish on the Upper West Side. Food can get cold while they are searching for an address. “It reduces your tip,” Mr. Mabry said. “Customers are saying to themselves, you’re lollygagging. But us delivery personnel cannot find the location because the numbers are not visible.”

The front of the building at 17 West 70th Street has been address-free for as long as Alan Sugarman, a lawyer who has lived there for about three decades, can remember. When he takes a taxi home, Mr. Sugarman always gives the driver the address on the opposite side of the street.

Takeout, he said, is not a problem. His favorite restaurants know what to do, he said: “You just subtract two from the building next door.”

Bill Yorgan, a real estate broker who represents 17 West 70th Street, says h believes the City Council bill is nothing more than a way for the city to make money. With the ubiquity of GPS and Manhattan’s grid plan topography in particular, he feels addresses are practically unnecessary. “It’s just a little island,” he said. “The city is mapped out like a tray of baklava!”Students have long found ways to make it through school more quickly to save money. But there is increasing momentum to formalize the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt — while N.Y.U. is expensive, many other private universities cost $60,000 or more a year.

Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, pushed to make it easier for students in his state to graduate from public colleges early by allowing more credits from high school or technical programs. Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, included in his budget proposal this month that schools in the University of Wisconsin system should create a three-year degree for 60 percent of its programs by the summer of 2020. Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., which is a state school, has also been experimenting with three-year degree options.

Among elite private institutions, official programs remain rare, though Wesleyan University, the Connecticut liberal arts school, announced a formalized three-year track about five years ago.

N.Y.U.’s “acceleration” effort relies on a few shifts. For example, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of two-credit courses it offers.

It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer — in the past, this has been allowed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their three-year goal.

But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices.

Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy at Temple University, said that shaving time off college as a way to make it more affordable could raise some troubling questions. In college, she said, there is academic learning, but there are also important experiences outside the classroom, like the social networks students build, study abroad programs and internships — assuming students do not have to hold down jobs that crowd out those things in the first place.

While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr. Goldrick-Rab said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things.

“We agree that the price of college is a problem,” she said. But she questioned whether the solution was “to essentially have less college, or less time in college.”

“It’s interesting,” she said of accelerated schedules, “but it worries me.”

Michael S. Roth, the Wesleyan president disputed the idea that there was something uniquely effective about an eight-semester undergraduate education.

“I don’t think there’s anything magical about eight semesters, or six, or 10, for example,” he said. “ I think it’s just a convention.”

The sped-up tracks are not always popular, however. Mr Roth estimated that about 20 Wesleyan students annually graduate in three years, up from roughly three a year before they made the option official. As of this May, Purdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014.

“So far, we haven’t had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.”

Indeed, many American students take six years to graduate from college.

Ashley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like hip-hop dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid.

Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work.

But this track is not for everyone, she said. Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears, who describes herself as a planner, said she knew she wanted to be an English major when she was a junior in high school. Students who need time to to figure that out, as most do, would be better served taking their time, she said.

“I definitely think this is a way to ease the burden for now, but I don’t think it’s a long-term solution” to the cost of college, Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said. “It doesn’t take into account every type of student, and every type of student should have the ability to make college affordable to themselves.”

Professor Schall agreed that this solution was not for everyone, nor did it suffice on its own. The affordability committee, which was convened by N.Y.U.’s president, Andrew Hamilton, is experimenting with a variety of ways to cut down on costs and give students a financial lift. There are small-ticket items — Facebook can alert students if there is food left over after staff meetings — and those that are much larger. The university froze the cost of room and board this school year for the first time in decades. Tuition increased this year, but Professor Schall said it was the lowest percentage increase in 20 years.

Couldn’t N.Y.U. and other colleges solve the problem just by cutting how much they charge? Professor Schall said there was a constant pressure on universities to increase their capacity to teach and do research, “and those things are expensive.”

“There is no silver bullet,” she continued. “If we could triple our endowment, that would be lovely, but short of that, we’re looking at everything from the price of books to the use of temporary employees,” she said. “We’re trying to be as creative as we can.”Photo

The story so far: A foreign dictator intervened on behalf of a U.S. presidential candidate — and that candidate won. Close associates of the new president were in contact with the dictator’s espionage officials during the campaign, and his national security adviser was forced out over improper calls to that country’s ambassador — but not until the press reported it; the president learned about his actions weeks earlier, but took no action.

Meanwhile, the president seems oddly solicitous of the dictator’s interests, and rumors swirl about his personal financial connections to the country in question. Is there anything to those rumors? Nobody knows, in part because the president refuses to release his tax returns.

Maybe there’s nothing wrong here, and it’s all perfectly innocent. But if it’s not innocent, it’s very bad indeed. So what do Republicans in Congress, who have the power to investigate the situation, believe should be done?

Nothing.

Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, says that Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador were “entirely appropriate.”

Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, angrily dismissed calls for a select committee to investigate contacts during the campaign: “There is absolutely not going to be one.”

Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House oversight committee — who hounded Hillary Clinton endlessly over Benghazi — declared that the “situation has taken care of itself.”

Just the other day Republicans were hot in pursuit of potential scandal, and posed as ultrapatriots. Now they’re indifferent to actual subversion and the real possibility that we are being governed by people who take their cues from Moscow. Why?

Well, Senator Rand Paul explained it all: “We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans.” Does anyone doubt that he was speaking for his whole party?

The point is that you can’t understand the mess we’re in without appreciating not just the potential corruption of the president, but the unmistakable corruption of his party — a party so intent on cutting taxes for the wealthy, deregulating banks and polluters and dismantling social programs that accepting foreign subversion is, apparently, a small price to pay.

Put it this way: I’ve been seeing comparisons between the emerging information on the Trump-Putin connection and the Watergate affair, which brought down a previous president. But while the potential scandal here is far worse than Watergate — Richard Nixon was sinister and scary, but nobody imagined that he might be taking instructions from a foreign power — it’s very hard to imagine today’s Republicans standing up for the Constitution the way their predecessors did.

It’s not simply that these days there are more moral midgets in Congress, although that, too. Watergate took place before Republicans began their long march to the political right, so Congress was far less polarized than it is now. There was widespread agreement between the parties on basic economic ideas, and a fair amount of ideological crossover; this meant that Republicans didn’t worry so much that holding a lawless president accountable would derail their hard-line agenda.

The polarization of the electorate also undermines Congress’s role as a check on the president: Most Republicans are in safe districts, where their main fear is of primary challengers to their right. And the Republican base has suddenly become remarkably pro-Russian. Funny how that works.

So how does this crisis end?

It’s not a constitutional crisis — yet. But Donald Trump is facing a clear crisis of legitimacy. His popular-vote-losing win was already suspect given the F.B.I.’s last-minute intervention on his behalf. Now we know that even as the F.B.I. was creating the false appearance of scandal around his opponent, it was sitting on evidence suggesting alarmingly close relations between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. And nothing he has done since the inauguration allays fears that he is in effect a Putin puppet.

How can a leader under such a cloud send American soldiers to die? How can he be granted the right to shape the Supreme Court for a generation?

Again, a thorough, nonpartisan, unrestricted investigation could conceivably clear the air. But Republicans in Congress, who have the power to make such an investigation happen, are dead set against it.

The thing is, this nightmare could be ended by a handful of Republican legislators willing to make common cause with Democrats to demand the truth. And maybe there are enough people of conscience left in the G.O.P.

But there probably aren’t. And that’s a problem that’s even scarier than the Trump-Putin axis.Times journalists around the world bring you a new 360 video every day.For one thing, like their fathers in World War II, many had volunteered. Countless shared the view of an Arizona veteran I interviewed: “ They didn’t have to draft us. It was a part of what we were supposed to do.” As he saw it, “It was part of my duty as a man.”

Others found themselves ensnared by the draft. As one veteran noted, “The Selective Service sword of Damocles had been hanging over our head since we all turned 18.” Still, a large majority of those drafted in 1967 answered their country’s call: Only 7,234 of the 298,559 men who were drafted failed to report for duty that year. “I guess I just accepted it and figured, ‘Hey, let’s go give it a shot — make the best of it,’ ” one veteran told me.

Wherever the men were coming from, they either boarded crowded troop ships (many from World War II) or left on planes; in the latter case, in less than 24 hours, they went from home to a war zone. One soldier said that upon arriving in Vietnam, he “felt like Alice stepping through the looking glass.” The heavy odor of jet fuel and feeling like being in a “very smelly sauna” took his breath away. As he stepped off the plane, a stewardess mouthed “good luck.” “I knew my life would never be the same from this moment on,” he recalled. “This was the initiation into my rites of passage.”

The experiences of service members in Vietnam often differed depending on location, type of service and, above all, timing. Some rarely left the relatively safe confines of the major bases, working as clerks, accountants and mechanics. Others were thrown into combat; an astounding 997 men were killed on their first day in Vietnam.

Vietnam ’67 Historians, veterans and journalists recall 1967 in Vietnam, a year that changed the war and changed America.

While 2.3 million men and women served in the Vietnam theater, the hard fighting fell on a relatively small percentage of those men, primarily the infantry and close support, like artillerymen, tank crews and pilots. And it’s true that many of those men experienced psychological and emotional difficulties. A veteran admitted crying “for the suffering, the pain, and for the fear that invades you because you don’t know when you’re going to die.” But few of them broke; most conquered the fear (and often the boredom) of searching for an elusive guerrilla enemy in the South, or fighting pitched battles in the northern war zones against hardened North Vietnamese Army regulars.

Where men did sometimes break, and where they were most liable to commit war crimes, was in the South. Being unable to identify the enemy created overwhelming stress. A barber or laundress on base or a peasant working in the fields during the day might lay booby traps at night. This led to atrocities: Rogue members of the anti-guerrilla Tiger Force killed hundreds of civilians; in March 1968, American soldiers killed hundreds more at the South Vietnamese village of My Lai.

But war crimes were very far from common. Indeed, for each atrocity, there were many more acts of kindness toward civilians and bravery in combat. Soldiers rebuilt schools, homes and roads, often on their own initiative; 244 Americans received the Medal of Honor, more than in World War I and Korea combined.

Most men, wherever they were, just wanted to go home. Few had any illusions about how the war would shape the rest of their lives, but they also pined for their old normal existence, and a return to their families and hometowns. Few veterans can forget the day they left Vietnam, most walking up the steps of a “Freedom Bird” airliner for the trip home. One recalled, “Boy, everybody stood up and cheered when the pilot announced we were crossing into the United States.”

But those returning received few parades or recognition, and often felt isolated from their countrymen. One remembered his sister asking, “Who are you fighting for, the North Vietnamese or the other guys?” He lamented: “I knew that nobody back here understood what was happening. Because if my own family didn’t know, what hope did I have with somebody who even know me?”

The disconnection and boredom of life stateside led some to return to Vietnam for another tour. Nonetheless, the majority persevered back home. As one said: “Most of the veterans returned home reasonably whole, as whole as returning veterans from earlier wars. The majority were not dopers, did not beat their wives or children, did not commit suicide, did not haunt the unemployment offices, and did not boozily sink into despair and futility.”

They hid their emotional scars, just as their fathers had after World War II, though they bore the added injury of an angry, often disrespectful America. They were forced to carry the weight of political and military decisions, to answer for Johnson and William Westmoreland, whether they agreed with them or not. This, in a way, is where the stereotype of the fragile veteran finds some truth — not in the war itself, but in the reception, back home. As the writer Tim O’Brien noted, “Some vets, more than a decade later, have not yet recovered, and some never will.”

Still, polls show that a vast majority of Vietnam veterans are proud of their service and sacrifice.

This isn’t to say that Vietnam veterans were no different from those of other wars; the unique experiences of that war created unique challenges at home. Thousands suffered the long-term effects of Agent Orange; thousands more, especially those who served later in the war, came home with drug and alcohol problems, or later developed them as coping mechanisms.

But lost in that stereotype is the strength of the response from the veteran community. Veteran activists revolutionized the Veterans Administration health system, demanding — and winning — better care. Others, like Bob Kerrey, Max Cleland, Chuck Hagel and John McCain, moved into politics, where they worked on behalf of fellow veterans. And they built the Wall — the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Founded by veterans and funded through private donations, the wall gave veterans a place to heal, not just themselves, but their often frayed bonds with their fellow Americans.

Of the 298,559 men who entered service in 1967, 11,363 did not return from Vietnam. Most veterans understand the feelings of an anonymous author who said: “War drew us from our homeland in the sunlit springtime of our youth. Those who did not come back alive remain in perpetual springtime, forever young, and a part of them is with us always.”“This is probably more math-y black and Hispanic kids than I’ve seen in my whole career,” said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. “That’s why I’m here.”

The extreme racial homogeneity in the rarefied realm of young math wizards has drawn little attention in a nation where racial equality in the basic institutions of civic life — schools, housing, health care, policing — remains elusive. But it has become an increasing source of consternation for some mathematicians, educators and business leaders, who see it directly linked to the striking underrepresentation of blacks and Latinos in high-paying, high-status jobs in finance, science and technology. As those occupations increasingly propel our society, they fear that enrichment programs for mathematically gifted children, while rooted in meritocratic ideals, have become a particularly potent means of reinforcing privilege.

Even as movie audiences celebrate “Hidden Figures,” the story of black women who overcame legally sanctioned discrimination to perform critical calculations in the race to put a man on the moon, educators say that new, subtler obstacles to higher-level math education have arisen. These have had an outsize influence on racial prejudice, they contend, because math prowess factors so heavily in the popular conception of intelligence — a concern that recently provoked the creation of “Mathematically Gifted and Black” and “Latin@s and Hispanics in Mathematical Sciences,” websites featuring math professionals from underrepresented backgrounds.

“Fundamentally, this is a question about power in society,” said Daniel Zaharopol, BEAM’s director. “Not just financial power, but who is respected, whose views are listened to, who is assumed to be what kind of person.”

BEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program’s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph.D.’s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative problem-solving that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline.

And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM 6-ers with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders — a mix of hedge-fund millionaires and professional mathematicians — was to hook them enough to want to keep at it.

A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against.

By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of well-off parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges.

“When I was 6, my dad taught me to use the abacus and do mental math,” one student at a selective program called MathPath wrote on the application form.

By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where “math is not in the air,” Dr. Bernstein said.

The parents of the boy at the snack cart, Jonathan Jackson, do not have degrees in math or science. His school, Kipp STAR, is a well-regarded charter school in Harlem, but does not have a math team. And like many of the other students at BEAM, Jonathan, who is African-American, seemed to have already internalized the racial stereotypes about math that, studies have shown, shape self-image among young Americans of all backgrounds.

“They did a study that shows white kids have more chances,” he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, “I don’t know if it’s really true.”

A Subway Ritual Begins

Tracing Jonathan’s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures.

Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program’s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school.

When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. “You need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,” she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.

She was all the more certain on the Friday before the program started, when the world awakened to a Facebook Live video of an unarmed black cafeteria worker in Minnesota, Philando Castile, bleeding to death in his car after being shot by a police officer.

She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: “Just do what he says, and like, don’t try to resist,” he recited.

She thought of math as a field that “usually Asians dominate,’’ she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison.

“But it could act as a buffer,” she remembers thinking.

Ms. Ashburn, a postal clerk who graduated last year with a business degree from Monroe College in the Bronx, left before dawn for work on the first day of camp. Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, a year older than him, was headed to summer school after dropping off their younger brothers at karate camp. Jonathan walked himself around the corner at 7 a.m. to meet his subway group in what would become a daily routine.

Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. “Hello,” he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. “I am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school.”

Thays Garcia, also 11, was the group’s third member.

“I love math,” she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems.

Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony.

Now an account manager at Coca-Cola, Mr. Rincon had several years earlier set Thays up with Khan Academy, a widely used service with free online math lessons.

As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: “Calculator.”

But Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not “the theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,” as he put it in his email to BEAM. “I want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see.”

A “Supersize” Math Education?

Jonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not.

He had also placed above grade level on New York’s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city’s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black.

He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created.

But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to high-performing minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level.

Others voiced perceptions that reflect common stereotypes — including the idea that Asians are naturally better at math than anyone else. Sociologists say that misconception exists in part because a high proportion of Asian immigrants to the United States already possess a math-related degree. They are, in turn, better equipped to steer children toward advanced math programs, as are native-born scientists and engineers, who are disproportionately white.

In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns.

Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups.

“We don’t see many applications from blacks and Latinos,” said Glenn Stevens, the director of Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists, a summer math camp for high school students based at Boston University.

“I wish I could tell you it was improving,” said Elaine Hansen, the director of the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. “I don’t see that it is.”

African-Americans, about 15 percent of the working-age population under 45, obtained about 2 percent of the Ph.D.’s in the fields of math, engineering and physical sciences awarded in 2015, compared to 18.7 percent in social work and 7.3 percent of doctoral degrees in all fields, according to the National Science Foundation. (A total of 20 black graduate students received Ph.D’s in math and statistics, out of 1,802). Hispanics were only marginally better represented.

That means whites and Asian-Americans are the near-exclusive recipients of the tens of billions of dollars in public funding devoted to research in those fields. It also affects private-sector employment: Both Google and Facebook reported last year that Hispanic and black employees together account for only 4 percent of their technical work force.

There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides poorer-quality education to many minority students.

But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don’t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of enrichment-math experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology.

“How do you even know a whole bunch of students are supersizing their education and you’re just doing your homework and getting A’s in your A.P. calculus classes?” said Quinton McArthur, M.I.T.’s associate dean of admissions. “It’s exacerbated the gap and no one even realizes.”

BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been “swimming in a culture of math’’ from an early age.

But BEAM’s selective camp for students from low-income backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results.

“Although our students make tremendous progress,” Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, “it is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential.”

BEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: “We need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,’’ he said.

At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic.

“Mathematicians love the struggle,” one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. “When you feel uncomfortable, you’re learning.”

But whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate.

In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students’ progress. “I can’t get them to stop doing math,” said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side.

But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated.

“I find they’re not very good at self-advocating when they’re lost or bored,” said another teacher, Marcelle Good. “I guess they’re used to being lost or bored.”

During the program’s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations.

“How do you get kids who haven’t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?” Dr. Bernstein lamented.

“He’s engageable,” said Michael Pershan, who teaches middle-school math at St. Ann’s, a private school in Brooklyn Heights. “I vote for upping the mathiness.”

“I’m open to suggestions for how to reach him,” said another. “He’s a pretty big distraction in my class.”

Beyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math.

A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived.

“Hey, Thays,” he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner.

He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a close-up picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train.

“You going to try it?” she asked, nodding toward the problem. They both knew she had already solved it. (See how she did it in this quiz; it’s question No. 5.)

He shrugged, looking sideways at her.

“Maybe,” he said.

By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another’s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition; Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go.

But they didn’t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer.

His friends did not know that Jonathan’s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school.

Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school.

But one day on the subway that week, they talked about Black Lives Matter, a subject that held an emotional resonance, at least for Thays and Jonathan. When it came up, it seemed at first that Emyr had not been able to hear the thread of Thays and Jonathan’s conversation over the subway din.

Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it.

Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: “There was a kid in the back of the car,” he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile.

Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr’s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican.

“No,” Emyr said. “But it’s true.”

Jonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in.

“How can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?” he demanded. “It’s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop.”

Seeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day.

Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her “Codes Codes Codes” class: “I’m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions.”

Then Thays added the problem’s final complication: “How many questions does it take if I’m allowed to lie once?”

As they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the error-correcting codes that underlie digital storage and communications.

“There’s also something called binary,” Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr.

The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. “What about you guys?”

“Of course I’m going to BEAM 7,” Emyr said.

“J. J.?” she prodded. But he was peering into his phone.

A Counselor Assist

That Jonathan was one of just a few African-American boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young African-American males, even in elementary school.

BEAM relies on the schools with whom it partners to select which students to take its admissions test, and teachers, studies have shown, pass over qualified black students for gifted programs at higher rates than for whites and Hispanics. Black boys, said Danny Martin, an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, are most subject to the classroom dynamic he calls “Learning Mathematics While Black.’’

Along with incarceration rates that are higher for young black men than for any other group, that dynamic may contribute to why black women receive a higher share of bachelor’s degrees in math, chemistry and physics, fields in which men of other ethnicities outnumber women.

Whatever the reason, many of the college-age counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan.

One of them was Christian Henderson, an African-American accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N.Y. “It’s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,” he said, “so they know in their head they’re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that’s true.”

Jonathan’s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics.

A straight-A student at a Harlem high school where the majority of his fellow students were deemed unprepared for college, Mr. Pineda had taken A.P. calculus and secured admission to Amherst with the help of an organization called QuestBridge aimed at matching underrepresented minority students with top-tier colleges.

By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the “summer math nerds,” as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead.

“You should look at this, J. J.,” Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM’s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. “I think you’d like it.”

Thays’s Absence

The following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train.

Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911.

Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room.

When she didn’t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays’s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. “Thays! I know you’re just at home watching TV!”

He also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns.

BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you’re trying to make a triangle.

For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you’ll need 3 pennies total; if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies; for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10.

So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin.

After nearly a week away, Thays returned — her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery — to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared.

At home on one of the final days, Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes.

“How’s that camp going?” she asked. “Are you still behind in your math?”

He was silent for a moment.

“You know, I’m not at that camp because I’m bad at math,” he said finally. “I’m there because I’m good at math.”

The Last Subway Ride

On the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan.

Mr. Zaharopol made a final plug for the online pre-algebra class he hoped they would take, which started a few weeks after the beginning of school. Each student received a sheet of paper with information about how to log on. BEAM would cover the cost.

They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year.

Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up.

A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays’s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own.

“She wants to go home with her regular group,” he said, shrugging.

On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar; then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character.

“You made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,” he noted. “Their eyes are supposed to be black on white.”

“Where’s my present?” Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. “Come on, Thays.”

Thays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope.

“Oh special, special JJ,” she had written. “You are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7.”

Jonathan paused for a moment before looking up.

“Now if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,” he said, and put his arm around her.

The three exchanged phone numbers.

Doubts and the Power of Math

Photo

A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. “I want to get a Ph.D. in math,” one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: “I learned math they don’t teach me at school.”

The teachers, though, wondered how much they’d really been able to achieve.

“They’re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,” Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. “But how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?”

As police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan’s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. “It’s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,” she said of the new president.

She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt.

Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online pre-algebra class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons.

“I might not be able to do it for a few weeks,” he told me. “I have homework.”

But Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home.

And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again.

“Hey,” he typed into his phone.

“Who is this?” came the reply.

“Jonathan from BEAM,” he replied.

“J. J.??!!”

Her phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn’t received his texts.

They traded messages, until Jonathan’s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended.

“I am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,” he typed quickly.

When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? “I want to get into Bronx Science!” Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city’s most selective public high schools. “I mean who doesn’t?” Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? “To see my BEAM peers,” wrote Emyr, in addition to “challenging my brain.”

Jonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn’t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn’t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM’s key lesson: “I find proportion problems interesting because I’ll always be confused,” he wrote, “but I figure out the answer anyways.”

On Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.

PhotoPutting emotions aside for a moment, there is indeed a problem — one recognized by both major political parties for decades — involving the need for incentives to get the level and tone of regulation right. Mr. Trump’s executive order builds on a deregulation movement that gained considerable momentum with Milton Friedman’s book “Capitalism and Freedom” in 1962 and the beginnings of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution in the 1980s.

Mr. Friedman underscored problems of asymmetry in regulation: People who especially benefit from a particular regulation will be inclined to lobby or bribe government officials for it. On the other hand, members of the general public, who might suffer from such regulations, will not be attentive to the many rules that affect them, each in a small way. And once regulations are imposed, government officials may have little interest in deleting those that are mistakes. In short, government regulators may not always be properly incentivized to make sure the accumulated body of rules is actually benefiting the public, not just specific interest groups.

In reaction to a growing clamor for deregulation, Congress passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act, with bipartisan support, more than 30 years ago. Signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 and still ensconced in the United States Code, it calls on agencies to periodically review, and prune, existing regulations. Critics have charged that regulators have not been giving them thoughtful reviews, have suffered from “willful blindness” and have just allowed the regulations to pile up. There are a number of bills in Congress now that seek to correct the problem.

Mr. Trump’s two-for one executive order might be considered an application of behavioral economics to deal with an intractable dilemma. Tying the culling of old regulations to the imposition of new ones can be seen as a strategy for forcing regulators to overcome their inability to see problems created by past regulations that remain in force. The order might motivate them to divert time and energy away from their presumed enthusiasm for creating new regulations, using it to clean up the errors their predecessors left behind.

But translating this attentional device into good regulatory policy will be difficult if not impossible, because the issues intrinsic to regulation are so subtle.

As I argued with George Akerlof in a 2015 book, “Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception,” regulators must steer around a minefield of complex deceptions and subterfuges set up by special interests, distortions that become accepted as an everyday reality, to the detriment of consumers. Assuming a reflexive pro-business bias — assuming that businessmen can do no wrong and that regulations can be pared back mechanically — is inconsistent with making difficult judgments about subtle deceptions.

The United States has historically wavered in its views of regulation and we are in danger of taking a wild swing once again. In the 19th century, for example, they were minimal. The first major federal regulator, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was created in 1887 to control fares charged by railroads. It was the beginning of the Progressive movement, which favored increasing regulations to protect the interests of the general public, sometimes irking the wealthy elite.

By the Roaring Twenties, during the presidency of Calvin Coolidge, Progressivism was in retreat and regulations were in disfavor. Mr. Coolidge generally opposed government intervention in the economy on libertarian grounds, and some of his policies have a certain resonance in the Trump era: After all, Coolidge cut taxes on high-income people; appointed a very wealthy man, Andrew Mellon, as Treasury secretary; and restricted immigration by region of origin.

In some respects, Coolidge was nothing like President Trump. Coolidge was a bland speaker, for example, who upheld decorum and traditional, even puritanical, values as the nation enjoyed a burst of personal and sexual liberation and extravagance. But he professed a faith in American business similar to that of the current president’s, a tendency to think that not only could business do no wrong, but also that businessmen were the only people who matter.

Coolidge, for example, spoke reassuringly about the burgeoning brokers’ loans that helped to fuel the stock market boom in the 1920s, and said that America’s business outlook was tremendous, building public confidence — until the crash came, and confidence collapsed.

There was a swing back to a much stronger regulatory regime in the 1930s, with far tighter controls over banks and securities firms, and we still benefit from many of those changes. After further zigzags, we are now facing what could be a dangerously anti-regulatory environment.

But we must remember that government needs to step in where private markets cannot function fairly on their own. Regulation is in the public interest in dozens of areas. Of course, we need to listen to aggrieved parties who feel that they are hurt by over-regulation and, when they have a good case, we should do something about it. But we shouldn’t make the mistake of abandoning trust in the good works of regulators.

The real solution to the problems that are the focus of the two-for-one rule is to provide better rewards, making government regulation a more attractive and respected career. The world is far too complex to make it possible to count up regulations meaningfully and impose a two-for-one rule.This is disappointing. At the same time, the show doesn’t lack for political content; there’s plenty, however discreetly framed. And there are advantages to having no ironbound curatorial concept in play: At least the 30 or so artists get equal time with their varied voices, some mild, some strong, several new to New York.

Still, some thematic structuring would have been a help, even at the risk of reinforcing stereotypes of tropical exoticism, revolutionary fervor, etc. One obvious theme is the presence of nature, a universally loaded one in the age of climate crisis. It’s everywhere here. The performance artist Glenda Léon notates music and dance scores with images of raindrops. The Cuban-American conceptualist Maria Elena González punches holes in photographs of palm trees.

Humberto Díaz, currently an artist-in-residence at the Bronx Museum, extends the active life of fallen tree branches he scavenges from the city’s parks by attaching industrial brooms to their tips. For a long-unseen installation from the early 1990s, the artist Alexis Leiva Machado, known as Kcho, transforms a set of palm saplings into what look like giant oars, a reminder of earlier waves of exodus from the island by boat to escape political persecution.

The Cuban-born Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) was part of that refugee generation and came to the United States as a child. Her attachment to Cuba remained profound, often expressed as an intimate, sacrificial identification with the natural world. In a series of works called “Siluetas,” she virtually merged with it, buried herself, by tracing and burning the shape of her body into the earth, as documented in a dozen photographs from her art school years at the University of Iowa in the 1970s.

Photo

In such images, Ms. Mendieta was indirectly referring to a specific aspect of Cuban cultural history: the forced mass migration that was the Atlantic slave trade. Beginning in the 16th century, hundreds of thousands of slaves were shipped from Africa to Spanish colonial Cuba to work on sugar plantations, bringing their languages, arts and spiritual lives with them.

The spirit of Afro-Caribbean religions that developed on the island was central to much of Ms. Mendieta’s work, and to that of several other artists in the show. In the 1980s, José Bedia became a priest of Palo Monte, a religion with roots in the Kongo kingdom of Central Africa, home to many New World slaves. Belkis Ayón, who took her own life in Havana in 1999 at age 32, was inspired by Abakuá, an all-male, Nigerian-derived secret society that she, heretically, infuses with female energy in a magnificent body of black-and-white figurative prints.

These hybrid faiths, and others, are still widely practiced. And skin color continues to be, even in a country that once made utopian claims to colorblindness, a social and economic determinant. This is a reality that the artist María Magdalena Campos-Pons has been addressing for years in ritualistic whiteface performances — one took place, unannounced, in Piazza San Marco during the 2013 Venice Biennale — and in role-playing photographic self-portraits, like the ones in the show.

The Cuban Revolution is itself a state religion and its gods inevitably find a place in the show, though as objects of ambivalent devotion. A cigar-puffing Fidel Castro makes an early appearance, surrounded by peasant soldiers and patriotic kids, in a 1969 painting by the political Pop artist Raúl Martínez. José Angel Toirac and Meira Marrero depict Fidel Castro as an absurdly towering titan, while Carlos Garaicoa emblazons his name above a photograph of a headless sculptural angel shot in an upscale Havana hotel.

Ezekiel Suárez, who with the artist Sandra Ceballos founded Havana’s oldest alternative space, Espacio Aglutinador, was hounded by censors in the 1990s. In response, he took to writing secret, tweet-size messages to Castro on the reverse side of his abstract embroideries, literally hiding subversive content in his art.

For decades, to the outside world, Cuban art meant propaganda. Portraits of Castro and Che Guevara were best sellers because that’s all that was on the market. The curators of “Wild Noise” put an antic spin on this phenomenon, without abandoning it. But they also include some genuinely moving political work. In 1996, Mr. Toirac and Ms. Marrero did a series of 12 portraits, from news photos, of corpses found in a city morgue after the Cuban president, Fulgencio Batista, had been overthrown by the Revolution in 1959. Who these people were, and why and how they died, is unrecorded. The military has memorials to unknown soldiers; these are unknown citizens. The artists treat them with reverence, painting their features with wine and gold leaf.

Photo

They take a refined, even delicate approach to a large subject. There are other examples. Diana Fonseca Quiñones distills the texture of a crumbling Havana in small abstract collages made of paint scraps harvested from building exteriors. Pedro Pablo Oliva portrays José Martí, the apostle of Cuban independence, as a slumbering saint in dapper tropical whites. And the conceptualist Wilfredo Prieto sketches, in the faintest of ink lines on a long paper scroll, images of every project he has completed in a prolific career.

In the end, Ms. Bruguera’s resistance to a show that she found to be too unprotestingly in line with the Cuban government’s dictatorial control of art is well taken. And this leads to a natural question: If work from the permanent collection of the National Museum in Havana had traveled, would it be any more radical than what we see here?

In short, “Wild Noise” maybe as good as we could expect considering the official sources and compromises involved. We may find a bolder take on truth-in-history in a larger show, “Adiós Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950,” which opens at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, on March 5. In terms of point of view, the title alone speaks volumes.He told you he’d make history! Trump is running for re-election before he can find the bathroom switch in the White House.

I know some of you are worried that the president is losing his mind. Perhaps you think that he’s depressed over the fact that his first four weeks in power have been marked by a disastrous attempt at immigration control, the axing of the national security adviser, the ignominious retreat of a nominee for labor secretary and a failed military raid in Yemen.

No. “I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done,” Trump said at his press conference. Remember, this is not a man who does self-deprecating irony.

The now-famous press conference did give us a whole new vision of what the Trump Era is going to entail. Beginning when he called in reporters to announce a new nominee for secretary of labor and then gave the topic only 100 words in the next hour and a quarter.

You may have been unnerved by the president’s description of Obamacare. (“I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.”)

And perhaps his riff about Russia weirded you out. (“… probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I’m different from those people.”)

Stop this. We’re trying to think positive. The good news is all this was not actually evidence the president is suffering a mental collapse. He’s always been like that.

We’ll take any cheering up we can get. Earlier in the week, Trump invited Chris Christie to a lunch at the White House. While everybody else at the table got to pick what they wanted to eat, the president made Christie order meatloaf. “It’s emasculating!” cried a talk-show host to whom the governor of New Jersey — for some reason — reported the tale.

“No it’s not,” Christie responded, rather weakly. “It is the president.… And the meatloaf was good.” It’s been a while since we’ve had a chance to contemplate the fall, humiliation and political ruination the governor suffered at the hands of his alleged friend Donald. But every time it happens, there’s a little sunbeam.

Right now the administration is such a mess that after national security adviser Mike Flynn was pushed out of office, Trump’s next pick claimed he couldn’t take the job because he needed to spend more time with his family. That’s bad. On the other hand, the president did promise to create jobs. And the way we’re going, sooner or later everybody in the country is going to get an offer to serve in a top White House position.

En route to Florida for his re-election rally, the president stopped off at a Boeing plant in South Carolina, and supporters who had worried that the administration was going off the rails were heartened when he read his speech like a normal person. There were only a couple of off-the-cuff remarks about what a winner he is, and only one sort of strange moment, when he was talking about Air Force One. “What can look so beautiful at 30?” Trump demanded. “An airplane.”

Meanwhile, at the James Buchanan house, Patrick Clarke declined to offer any personal opinion on whether Trump could send Buchanan up a notch in the ratings. But he did provide an excellent example of thinking positive: “You know, if my guy wasn’t rated worst — if he fell smack dab in the middle — he’d be lost.”

Hold that thought. Whatever else happens you can take comfort in the realization that we’re not going to spend the next four years stuck with some boring mediocrity. We’re going nowhere near the middle.Bighorn Sheep Hunting Permits Fund Conservation

Not Everyone Loves ‘La La Land’

9. I thought it was fine. Enjoyable, but not fantastic. At the end, the entire theater just kind of was sitting there — not in awe, but in a kind of “meh — did not live up to expectations” way.

On the other hand, when I saw “Hidden Figures,” at the end the entire audience applauded, and was chattering on about the movie when leaving the theater. “La La Land” left me kind of cold and uninspired, whereas “Hidden Figures” did just the opposite. I’m hoping “Hidden Figures” is the upset winner for the Oscar. The country needs to feel good right now.

It’s Not Drinking Alone If the Cat’s Home

10. At least my cat doesn’t talk about politics. It’s a nice break from reality.

— Timothy Harden on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about two start-ups competing to provide feline oenophiles with their very own (nonalcoholic, catnip-infused) happy hour bottles.President Trump, in an extraordinary rebuke of the nation’s press organizations, wrote on Twitter on Friday that the nation’s news media “is the enemy of the American people.”

Even by the standards of a president who routinely castigates journalists — and who on Thursday devoted much of a 77-minute news conference to criticizing his press coverage — Mr. Trump’s tweet was a striking escalation in his attacks.

At 4:32 p.m., shortly after arriving at his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Trump took to Twitter to write:

The message was swiftly deleted, but 16 minutes later Mr. Trump posted a revised version. Restricted to 140 characters, he removed the word “sick,” and added two other television networks — ABC and CBS — to his list of offending organizations.

The president has referred to the media as the “opposition party” to his administration, and he has blamed news organizations for stymieing his agenda. But the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent.

“Oh boy,” Carl Bernstein, the journalist who helped to uncover the Watergate scandal, said on Friday, after a reporter read him Mr. Trump’s tweet.

“Donald Trump is demonstrating an authoritarian attitude and inclination that shows no understanding of the role of the free press,” he added.

Historians pointed out similarities between Mr. Trump and Richard M. Nixon, who in 1972 told his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, “The press is the enemy.”

Mr. Bernstein said the president’s language “may be more insidious and dangerous than Richard Nixon’s attacks on the press.”

“But there is a similarity in trying to divide the country, and make the conduct of the press the issue, instead of the conduct of the president,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his top advisers strongly believe that an elitist news media lost its credibility by failing to anticipate his political rise.

Still, the notion of the news media as an enemy of the public — especially when voiced by a sitting president — went a step beyond Mr. Trump’s usual rhetorical turns.

Mr. Trump’s tactic of pitting the press against the public was mirrored in a survey distributed by the president’s team on Thursday, which urged Trump supporters “to do your part to fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions.”

Survey questions included, “Do you believe that the mainstream media has reported unfairly on our movement?” and “On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing Republicans? (Select as many that apply.)”

Mr. Trump has deleted tweets in the past, sometimes to correct for typos or to refine his message, and publications are keeping track of these fleeting missives.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his distaste for journalists in more populist terms, saying, “much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests.”

“The public doesn’t believe you people anymore,” Mr. Trump added. “Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you.”Photo

If you are reading this hunched over your desk or smartphone, take this moment to loosen up your neck. Move it up and down. Now side to side. Roll it around clockwise and counterclockwise. Now retract it into your shell. Oh wait, you can’t do that — you are not a turtle. But have you ever wondered how these reptiles evolved to have such an interesting trick?

Scientists have, and now after studying the cervical bones of a 150-million-year-old turtle fossil, a team of researchers thinks that most turtles developed the ability first as a way to spring their head forward quickly to snatch prey, rather than as a means of protection, as was previously thought. The ability further evolved in some turtles to become a crucial part of their defenses. The researchers published their study Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.

The earliest known turtle ancestors were unable to retract their necks, but today’s modern species can. To understand turtle necks, however, you must first understand the two main types of turtles: cryptodires and pleurodires. Both turtle groups can retract their necks, but they do it differently.

Cryptodires include tortoises as well as most turtles: box turtles, sea turtles and alligator snapping turtles. They retract their necks straight back into their shells by folding the muscles vertically. Pleurodires include species that are mostly found in South America, Australia and Africa, like the matamata and snake-neck turtles. They bend their muscles horizontally to pull their necks back to the side and tuck it next to their shoulder.

Jérémy Anquetin, a paleontologist from the Jurassica Museum in Switzerland and the lead author, and his colleagues studied a 150-million-year-old turtle fossil that had some strange characteristics. The turtle, known as Platychelys oberndorferi, was from the Late Jurassic period and lived in what is today Germany and Switzerland. From its shell and skeleton the team could clearly tell that it belonged to the pleurodira group. But the shape of its two cervical bones suggested that it pulled its neck back vertically as cryptodires do, not horizontally. The neck also appeared to be unable to fully fold into the shell.

“Why did it have this neck retraction mechanism? This turtle is very peculiar,” Dr. Anquetin said. “Our fossil cannot retract it completely. It brings no value for protection, so we had to find an explanation for that.”

The team homed in on the creature’s other features for clues. Its appearance was similar to modern bottom-dwelling turtles, suggesting that it was an ambush predator like the matamata turtle or the common snapping turtle. The two modern species are distantly related, but they hunt using similar tactics. They both lurk among the plants that shroud the floors of ponds, swamps and shallow lakes. Once an unsuspecting fish gets close enough, they strike.

“We can expect that our turtle was behaving the same way,” Dr. Anquetin said. He and his team report that the neck mechanisms seen in their extinct turtle and in modern-day cryptodires is an example of convergent evolution, meaning that both P. oberndorferi and present-day cryptodires evolved the ability independently of each other because of the evolutionary advantages that it offered them in their environments. The method of retracting their necks straight back allowed them to rapidly shoot out their heads and catch darting prey more easily.

More Reporting on Paleontology

The researchers acknowledge that their hypothesis needs further testing and that it does not offer an explanation for why pleurodira turtles evolved to pull their necks in sideways.

James Parham, an assistant professor of geological sciences at California State University, Fullerton, who has done research on turtles and lizards but was not involved in the study, said in an email the paper showed that the evolution of neck retraction in early turtles was more complex than the binary of folding the neck to the side versus bending it in vertically that we have ascribed to the reptiles today. He added that the team did a good job showing the similarities between the fossil turtle and modern-day ambush turtles, but he agreed that the authors’ hypothesis needed further study.

“They set the stage for some interesting new studies and force us to look at the evolution of these fossils in an entirely new light,” he said.Ms. Krauss is a connoisseur of songs, not a songwriter, and her enchantment with the compositions she has culled ordinarily sets the tone of her self-produced albums. This time, though, she chose to pursue a partnership that could yield a particular vibe. She lent her voice to a wistful duet version of “Make the World Go Away” on Jamey Johnson’s 2012 collection of classic Hank Cochran country songs, and the elegant shuffle echoed easeful studio performances of the Nashville Sound era. She zeroed in on the project’s seasoned producer, Buddy Cannon, who had a low-key way of drawing her out at the microphone.

“When I sang for him,” she said, “I noticed that there was such a desire to perform for him, and that doesn’t always come so much. Usually you’re kind of searching your own navel all the time for your inspiration.”

When Ms. Krauss and Mr. Cannon began sifting through potential songs on his office computer, she stipulated that they steer clear of go-to country standards. “I’m just one big B-side,” she quipped, referring to songs that take a back seat to the more popular tracks on records. Drawing heavily from the ’50s and ’60s catalogs of country and bluegrass stylists like Willie Nelson, Mac Wiseman, Brenda Lee, Glen Campbell and Eddy Arnold, Ms. Krauss and Mr. Cannon rounded out their selections with a couple of songs that were actually from her lifetime, one of which, “Dream of Me,” she recalled hearing at a bluegrass festival in her youth but didn’t realize that Mr. Cannon had written.

Photo

In language and chord structure, the vintage selections seem simple next to the bulk of Ms. Krauss’s repertoire. “There’s a certain feeling, a mystery about songs that are older than you, and I love that,” Ms. Krauss said. The sentiment isn’t confined to music; her two-story house, built in 1918, is full of antiques. To protect an old table from drink rings, she wryly offered her closed laptop: “Go ahead and use this coaster.”

The recording process began smoothly enough: “I just get great players in there and sit back and listen to what they do,” Mr. Cannon said. Ms. Krauss requested horns like those that Merle Haggard sometimes used, and for once, her fiddle fills are dwarfed by the frequent, pillowy flourishes of a string section.

The trouble arose when it came time to record Ms. Krauss’s vocals. “One day she’d come in to sing, and if she wasn’t hearing it the way she wanted to hear it, she’d say, ‘Today’s not the day,’” Mr. Cannon recalled. “We went in a lot of days and worked for 30 minutes and knocked off because she just said, ‘I don’t have it today.’ To me, she sounded wonderful. I mean, on her worst days, she sounds better than everybody.”

Ms. Krauss explained the recurring vocal issue was “a stress reaction”: “Your voice box just kind of, brrp, just closes up. It tightens up, and you have to loosen it up.” She turned to physical therapy, then visited the noted voice coach Ron Browning, who suggested she “stop striving and just be.” “I felt like I was 17 again,” she marveled. “It was amazing! I’ve given people lessons with him as gifts.”

As a young singer, Ms. Krauss tended to use the full force of her rarefied instrument, but by the time she scored a mid-90s country breakthrough with “When You Say Nothing at All,” she was artfully recalibrating her approach, softening her attack, applying beguiling, breathy shading. “I was talking to Jerry Douglas about this,” she said, referring to the Dobro player in Union Station, “and we were like, ‘Remember when you first started playing, and it was so much fun, and you didn’t think about anything, and you just did what you did? And then you got really wrapped up in watching what you would do to refine what you do?’”

She summarized, “I think you go from being mindless to being self-conscious, and then you want to end up being mindless again.”

Along the way, Ms. Krauss came to embody a particular feminine vocal archetype. “There’s something about how clear her tone is and how much control she has and restraint she uses,” said the country-pop singer-songwriter Cam. “She can sing bluegrass, Americana, country, across all those genres, and she can reach so many people that don’t even listen to those genres normally.”

The eight million or so who bought the T Bone Burnett-produced soundtrack to “O Brother, Where Art Thou” heard Ms. Krauss sing the folk hymn “Down to the River to Pray” a cappella, with impossibly delicate vibrato; one could imagine her floating above the fleshly realm, an otherworldly vessel for earthy music. People invariably describe her as an “angel,” a word that has no room for the sort of cheeky, blues-tinged note bending she does at times on this album.

“Well, obviously, they don’t know me,” she said, swiftly brushing the perception aside. “But what a compliment.”

Contradictions are at the heart of Ms. Krauss’s sensibilities: the juxtaposition of the exquisiteness of her singing and the brawniness of the male vocal partners she chooses (in this case, Mr. Johnson, Hank Williams Jr. and others); contrasts between notions of naturalness and refinement; the tension between mastering a well-mapped musical lineage and embracing a broad-minded, pop-attuned versatility.

On the title track of the new album, Ms. Krauss displays an empathetic grasp of a longstanding country theme: anxiety about how exposure to cosmopolitanism can change a person. “He came to you, big city, from our little country town,” she frets, “and every step he takes with you is down/You’re as cold and heartless as the chilling winds that blow/Before you freeze his heart, please let him go.”

Her reading of “River in the Rain,” from Roger Miller’s Huckleberry Finn-inspired musical “Big River,” conveys melancholy admiration of forceful, unfettered freedom. She accentuates the inner dialogue of “You Don’t Know Me,” her singing burdened with quiet resignation to keep hidden romantic desires hidden. Hinting at feelings just beneath the surface is a Krauss specialty, and such “one-sided conversations” are her “favorite subject.” “A lot of times, women, their strength has been judged by their ability to hide emotion,” she mused.

Ms. Krauss will go only so far in analyzing her gifts and inclinations before retreating to modesty or comic relief. Asked how conscious she is of her image, she offered a goofy anecdote: Many years ago, when she was just beginning to be recognized in public, she wanted so badly to go for a swim on tour that she bought a maternity swimsuit at a garage sale, despite not being pregnant, and was, of course, spotted wearing the ill-fitting thing.

“That’s the only kind of awareness — like, ‘Oh man, I wish I would have cleaned up,’” she said, sounding far more amused than embarrassed. “But really, otherwise, you’re just doing your gig.”Photo

HONG KONG — In South Korea, it’s all in the family.

South Korean officials on Friday arrested Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman of Samsung and the scion of an immensely wealthy and powerful family. Mr. Lee — known as Jay Y. Lee in the West — was accused of paying bribes to a confidante of South Korea’s embattled president. Samsung has defended Mr. Lee, and it said on Friday that it would work to ensure “that the truth is revealed.”

Mr. Lee has been widely considered Samsung’s de facto leader since his father, Lee Kun-hee, Samsung’s 75-year-old chairman, had a heart attack in 2014. That put the younger Mr. Lee at the helm of a sprawling business empire that encompasses gadgets, appliances, engineering, construction, shipbuilding, insurance and credit cards. Samsung Electronics — the maker of televisions and smartphones used around the world, including the doomed Galaxy Note 7 smartphone — by itself accounts for one-fifth of South Korea’s exports.

Samsung is only one of a handful of family-controlled companies, called chaebol, that dominate economic life in South Korea. Some, like Hyundai, LG and Samsung, are well known outside their home country. But domestically, they all wield immense power — and are coming under increasing scrutiny.

What are chaebol?

The word comes from the combination of the characters for “rich” and “clan.” It applies to large groups of interconnected companies that are usually dominated by a wealthy family. South Korea has several, but the best known outside the country are Hyundai, LG and Samsung. Others include Hanjin, Kumho, Lotte and SK Group.

Chaebol are generally conglomerates of affiliated companies. LG, for example, makes smartphones, televisions, electronic components, chemicals and fertilizer. It also owns Korean baseball and basketball teams. Hyundai, which makes the Hyundai and Kia cars that are popular in the United States and other countries, also makes elevators, provides logistics services, and runs hotels and department stores.

How did chaebol come to power?

They rose from the ashes of the Korean War. After the conflict ended, officials steered relief funds and cheap loans to businessmen who promised to rebuild the country. The government also protected homegrown industries from foreign competition to help them develop. The recipe proved to be potent: Chaebol played a major role in South Korea’s rise as an industrial giant in the following decades.

But the recipe also created imbalances, a number of economists have argued. Money meant for the common people often ended up in the hands of the wealthy families, creating resentment that lingers to this day. And government protection and crackdowns on the labor movement allowed these families to expand their business empires into new areas with little to fear from potential foreign competition or costly failures.

As a result, chaebol became sprawling businesses that held a nearly two-thirds market share in South Korean manufacturing by the end of the 1990s, according to the World Trade Organization. But there is a deep-seated belief among many South Koreans that their immense wealth was accumulated at the expense of the public. To those people, recurring chaebol scandals are particularly galling.

How did they get political power?

South Korea’s recipe for growth also fostered tight ties between the government and businesses.

Take the example of Park Chung-hee, a general and the father of the current president, who took power in South Korea after a 1961 coup. He led an effort to rev up the South Korean economy — and he used many of the companies that became chaebol to do it. His government steered money to companies that chased his economic goals, such as emphasizing exports.

The dynamic shifted somewhat as South Korea transitioned to a democracy in the 1980s. By then, the chaebol had become so economically powerful that they held considerable political sway. Politicians began to rely on the companies’ political and financial support to get elected.

Are chaebol under threat?

They are. But time will tell whether it will result in change.

Public support of chaebol has gradually waned. The Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s stirred worries that the cozy relationship between chaebol member companies could lead to severe damage across multiple businesses if one failed. As the economy has matured and created a nation of consumers, an increasing number of South Koreans worry about the political power and corruption of the chaebol, with many now saying white-collar crime is a major issue.

Despite those concerns, chaebol executives are widely believed to be treated with kid gloves. The elder Mr. Lee, Samsung’s chairman, has been pardoned twice after being convicted of white-collar crimes, with the potential impact to South Korea’s economy given as the reason.The young New York designer Michael Halpern remembers the precise moment he realized he wanted to go into fashion: when he saw a black and white photograph from the late 1960s, of his mother staring into the middle distance in a dark jumpsuit, her eyebrows bleached, an expression of insouciant cool on her face. “That image is incredibly important to me,” Halpern says. “It’s more than the clothes but it’s her attitude. For me, that was the start of it.”

The picture hangs alongside those of Bianca Jagger, Linda Evangelista and Cher (in a sequined Bob Mackie number) on a mood board in Halpern’s matchbox-size East London studio. “It’s not just what they looked like,” says Halpern, 29, who, in contrast with his sequined goddesses, is dressed entirely in black. “But there was such grace, confidence and poise.” After all, a woman would need all those qualities in spades to pull off Halpern’s after-dark aesthetic — a high-wire balancing act between disco glitz and couture-grade finish. His standout Central Saint Martins MA show last year won him his dream job designing couture for Atelier Versace as a consultant; he already counts Beyoncé as a fan; he has an impressive list of stockists, including Bergdorfs and matchesfashion.com; and he’s accomplished all this before he’s even staged his first official show, which will take place this weekend in London.

Halpern was born in upstate New York. His father was a nuclear mechanical engineer and his mother a bank teller. He remembers his mother and her friends telling him about dancing at Studio 54 or at the bar at the St. Regis Hotel. Those stories inspired his ongoing love affair with the hedonism of the ’70s. “There were less constraints and oppression back then,” he says. “It wasn’t so correct.” After graduating with a women’s wear degree from Parsons in 2010, Halpern went on to hold design jobs at both J. Mendel and Oscar de la Renta, where he honed classical skills of plissé, draping and hand-pleating. But it wasn’t until he moved to London to do an MA at Central Saint Martins that he learned to embrace his love of both “trash,” as he calls it, and elegance.

That dichotomy was in evidence in his MA collection, which was inspired by the “glamour and showmanship” of horse diving: Models came down the runway looking like glamorous creatures of the night in sequined polo necks worn over flares and satin bustier-and-miniskirt combos with asymmetrical trains. The collection was a study of contrasts — with Halpern sourcing “horrific, disgusting” fabrics from Shepherd’s Bush and Walthamstow markets and elevating them by pairing them with delicately hand-sewn paillettes and luxurious silks and satins. Despite his technical skill, Halpern revels in imperfections in his work: seams that overlap, paillettes that don’t quite match, a corset with exposed darts in the lining. “If it’s too pristine and too perfect — it’s not believable,” he says. “I like having everything a bit off and moved — it makes it cooler. I want you to be able to move and breathe in my clothes but still feel glam.”

The collection caught the eye of Sarah Mower, chief fashion critic for U.S. Vogue and the British Fashion Council’s Ambassador for Emerging Talent, who introduced Halpern to Donatella Versace. The designer recruited Halpern to work for Atelier Versace, her couture division, only a few days after he graduated from the MA. “When I saw Michael’s work, I immediately picked up the phone to get in touch with him,” Versace told T. “I never saw anything like it before. His sense of color is brilliant; his craftsmanship is incredible.” The admiration was mutual: “I’ve loved Versace for so long,” Halpern says. “She’s incredible and has a point of view. She lives the brand and knows exactly who Versace is. It’s really exciting to see someone like that work.”

With star collaborators (the stylist Patti Wilson and the hairstylist Sam McKnight) on hand for his debut showing this weekend, expectations are high, but Mower is confident that he will remain grounded in the process. “It is alarming that a star can be born before he even has his first selling collection on a runway in these insta-times, but I am very hopeful Michael’s character means he will be able to go slowly and size his business the way he wants it to be,” she says. Gone are the “horrific fabrics” from the markets in his MA collection — replaced by more recognizably luxe materials like tulle, organza and duchesse satin. His two seasons working at Atelier Versace have also translated into an increased sense of refinement in his own work. “You learn techniques and see things being done there that don’t exist elsewhere,” he says. Perhaps most of all, he is seeking to return to a spirit of loucheness and decadence of the disco years. He would love it if fashion could return to a more innocent, joyful time; he recalls watching a Christian Lacroix show in his teenage years “where the models would be smoking, smiling, laughing. It was so exciting and so pure in a way. That escapism is important in really dark times.”In a rambling news conference on Thursday, the president said his administration had undertaken “the most substantial border security measures in a generation,” and he said that efforts to find and deport “criminal aliens” would make the United States safer.

“Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised: ‘Oh, he is having strong borders.’ Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.”

But his early efforts to translate all of that talk into action are already running into the reality of governing in Washington, where legal constraints on taking action — and debates about paying for it — are legendary.

Mr. Trump has promised to hire 15,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of a larger deportation force that can remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, something he repeatedly promised to do during the campaign.

But hiring such a large number of agents in a short period of time would be nearly impossible, according to John F. Kelly, the former general whom Mr. Trump chose to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

“I don’t believe we’re going to get 10,000 and 5,000 on board within the next couple of years,” Mr. Kelly told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this month, explaining that stringent hiring standards and training regimens slow down the process.

“I’d rather have fewer and make sure that they’re high-quality people that are already serving in those organizations, already well trained, but I will not skimp on the training and the standards,” Mr. Kelly said.

One of the problems that Mr. Kelly faces is a polygraph test that prospective agents, including those seeking to work for the Border Patrol, must take. According to a former senior homeland security official, nearly 60 percent of applicants fail it.

The test was first put in place after another surge in hiring during the George W. Bush administration. Thousands of people were hired without being properly vetted, which resulted in dozens of corruption cases involving Border Patrol and other agents, who were accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.

The former senior homeland security official, James Tomsheck, who was the assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, office of internal affairs, said in several cases many of the new hires were members of the cartels.

“The corruption and excessive use of force that plague the agency is a direct result of a hiring mandate to hire too many people too rapidly without the proper vetting,” said Mr. Tomsheck, who was removed from his position after, he said, he was accused of being too aggressive in pursuing excessive use-of-force cases.

It is unclear how Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly plan to solve the manpower problem.

One option, swiftly denied on Friday by the White House, was a plan to use as many as 100,000 National Guard troops as part of a nationwide deportation force that would help to augment federal agents and local authorities newly deputized to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

The idea emerged in a draft memorandum, first reported by The Associated Press, which asserted that National Guard troops, under the direction of governors in border states, are “particularly well suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by Department components.”

Gillian M. Christensen, the acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the memorandum was a “very early, pre-decisional draft that never made it to the secretary and was never seriously considered by the department.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Friday morning that the report by The Associated Press was “100 percent not true.”

But advocates for immigrants reacted with alarm.

“The administration wants to put on a show,” said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York. “Their intent is to create fear, to create an environment in which people either self-deport or hide in the shadows.”

The proposal to deploy 100,000 troops would be a stark increase in the size and scope of National Guard involvement in border security, but it is not unprecedented.

Several presidents, including George Bush and Barack Obama, called up thousands of National Guard troops to bolster border patrol operations. While they mostly acted as extra eyes to spot illegal border crossings, at times they carried weapons and assisted in drug arrests.

In 1916, in response to cross-border raids by Mexican bandits and what The New York Times described as a “prairie fire of anti-American sentiment that has been sweeping northern Mexico,” President Woodrow Wilson deployed more than 100,000 guardsmen to the border to reinforce regular Army units.

More recently, in July 2014, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to its border with Mexico in an effort to bolster his border-security credentials as he prepared to start his presidential campaign.

The deployment has been costly, controversial and continues to this day. The troops live in hotels along the border during their deployments, and the estimate of the costs in 2014 were $12 million a month.

Mr. Perry’s efforts coincided with an influx of undocumented Central American immigrants coming across the border, including unaccompanied children and teenagers. Experts expect another surge in arrivals this spring.

In Mr. Trump’s executive order calling for an end to “catch and release,” he also directed Mr. Kelly to do everything possible to “construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.” Immigration experts said that will be costly and take time.

“The bottom line is,” Mr. Appleby said, “they’re doing everything they can legally do until they’re told not to by the courts to expand their capacity to deport as many people as possible.”The plan is to give money, resources and training to the Libyans to keep the migrants there, an idea somewhat similar to the European Union’s deal with Turkey, only this one is with a country run by competing militias and multiple weak governments.

It is not the first time Italy has forged an agreement with Libya to stem the flow of migration. But the most effective attempt was before Libya descended into chaos with the collapse of its government in 2011.

Libya has since become the prime launching point for many of the 180,000 migrants who reached Italy last year, when more than 5,000 people died trying to make the Mediterranean crossing.

Even previous agreements met criticism for the sometimes brutal tactics that North African countries used to hold back migrants. Embryonic as it is, this latest plan to stem the flow is already being criticized as both potentially unworkable and inhumane.

Some international experts are skeptical about the scope of the operation, and human rights groups fear the plan is the equivalent of throwing the migrants back into the frying pan of Libya, where many are fleeing dangers and dire conditions.

The internationally backed Libyan government the European Union is dealing with has barely a toehold in the fragmented, violence-plagued country, and may even be verging on collapse. Much of the Libyan coast remains in the hands of criminal and rebel groups.

“It’s a first step taken with an interim government that doesn’t really control the country, but it’s a first step,” said Natalino Ronzitti, professor emeritus of international law and an adviser at the Institute for International Affairs in Italy.

“We need to see whether it complies with human rights and whether Europe will open identification centers for migrants in Libya, or will help Libya do so, but we know little about that at present,” Ms. Ronzitti said.

The pilot program is the first of its kind within Operation Sophia, the European Union’s anti-immigrant trafficking operation, and is part of an effort that European leaders agreed to this month at their summit meeting in Malta, where they pledged “sustainable and predictable” funding to train the Libyan Coast Guard.

The day before the Malta meeting, Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, signed an agreement with the Libyan premier, Fayez Serraj, to curb migrant trafficking from Libyan shores.

In exchange, Italy will provide money, technology, medicine and training to set up migrant holding centers in the country, which it ruled as a colony between 1911 and 1943.

Italian Embassy officials were the last European delegation to leave Tripoli in 2015, and last month became the first to return to their original compound.

This week, Italy’s Interior Ministry hosted a meeting in Rome with 10 Libyan mayors from the southern region of Fezzan, the main gateway for migrants into Libya, to underscore Italy’s intention to help them control the border.

“We can’t expect such a large phenomenon to have an immediate solution,” Roberta Pinotti, Italy’s defense minister, acknowledged one recent morning aboard the aircraft carrier stationed in Valletta’s harbor.

“But it’s a phenomenon that we want to be able to govern,” she said, citing the thousands of weekly arrivals in Italy, even in winter.

Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, echoed the sentiment. “The training didn’t take place because there is a crisis, but to try to prevent a crisis,” he said.

The migrant holding centers are among the most contentious components of the plan.

Hussein Thwadi, the mayor of the western coastal city of Sabratha, Libya, the busiest departure point for Mediterranean crossings, has said that keeping migrants in Libya is a “dangerous step” because the country does not have the resources to deal with them.

Huge numbers of migrants are already in Libya, and they face constant threats, humanitarian groups point out.

Last year, Doctors Without Borders highlighted the “alarming levels of violence” against migrants and refugees in Libya, including sexual attacks and killings, not only from smugglers, but also from myriad armed groups and individuals.

Migrants reported being detained by militiamen for months in dire conditions. Others were kept in a form of slavery by private individuals who forced them into labor, often in exchange for scarce food.

“As Libya is not a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and is itself emerging from a humanitarian crisis, E.U. countries cannot assume that these rights are granted,” Doctors Without Borders said last year, referring to the United Nations treaty that outlines the rights of the displaced. “E.U. countries, therefore, should not deny people the chance of reaching Europe.”

Anything that stems the flow of migrants in Libya also runs the danger of running up against the interests of the powerful armed groups that control the trade. In a country racked by conflict, migrant smuggling has become a lucrative business for a bewildering array of criminal gangs and associated militias.

European leaders concede that Libya’s instability and widespread violence were causes of concern.

“The young men who received this training, when they return to their country, will face enormous pressure from criminal gangs and smugglers who have an influx of millions of euros a week,” Mr. Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, acknowledged.

Most smugglers’ boats depart from remote beaches along a 230-mile stretch of coastline in the west of the country, between Misurata and the border with Tunisia.

Theoretically, this territory is controlled by the U.N.-backed unity government led by Mr. Serraj, which installed itself in Tripoli last March with backing from the United States and other Western countries.

In reality, much of the coastline, as well as the desert towns through which the migrants pass, is controlled by a network of criminal and militia groups with a vested financial interest in the continuation of the trade.

Few believe the unity government has the military muscle, political clout or money to stop the trade, given that it barely controls even the capital, Tripoli.

Its forces control the city port and a handful of government ministries, but otherwise compete for turf with a rival administration led by a coalition of Islamists and militants from Misurata.

Gunmen from dueling factions frequently clash on the city streets in violence that has intensified in recent weeks, prompting warnings from Western officials that the unity government is in danger of being completely marginalized, if not worse.

The U.N.-backed administration is also under pressure from rivals in the east of the country, where forces led by the strongman Gen. Khalifa Hifter have taken near-complete control of the country’s second-largest city, Benghazi.

General Hifter has consolidated his forces, with backing from Egypt and Russia, and has shunned the unity government. During an Egyptian-led effort to broker peace between rival Libyan factions in Cairo this week, Mr. Serraj and Mr. Hifter refused to meet.

The Italian plan to train the Libyan Coast Guard has already run afoul of Libya’s fractious political scene after the San Giorgio, an Italian Navy vessel participating in the program, docked in western Libya last month.

In an indication of the potential pitfalls ahead, leaders in the east of Libya accused the Italians of illegally entering the country.“You can make it go fast, and you can make it be cheap — but not if you adhere to the standard of care that we do,” said Mark Cooper of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, referring to the United States regulatory body, which is considered one of the most meticulous in the world. “Nuclear safety always undermines nuclear economics. Inherently, it’s a technology whose time never comes.”

In the process, the United States could lose considerable influence over standards governing safety and waste management, nuclear experts say. And the world may show less willingness to move toward potentially safer designs.

“I’m concerned that if the U.S. is not seen as a big player, and doesn’t have that kind of market presence, that we won’t be in a competitive position to bring those standards back up,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia. “If you’ve got more lax safety standards worldwide, I think that’s a problem from an industry perspective as well as just a human standard.”

This may be an advantage for state-owned nuclear industries worldwide. Often they benefit from long-term national policies in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

By contrast, the Toshiba-Westinghouse withdrawal from nuclear construction shows how daunting it can be for the private sector to build these plants, even with generous government subsidies like loan guarantees and tax credits. Projects take decades to complete. Safety concerns change along the way, leading to new regulations, thousands of design alterations, delays and spiraling costs for every element.

In one case, even the dirt used to backfill excavated holes at the Westinghouse project in Georgia became a point of contention when it did not measure up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, leading to increased costs and a lawsuit.

Thus far in the United States, only the Tennessee Valley Authority, itself a government corporation, has been able to bring a new nuclear reactor into operation in the last 20 years.

Of the dozens of new reactors once up for licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only four are actively under construction. Two are at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, and two at the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Both projects, which plan to use a novel reactor from Westinghouse, have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, some stemming, paradoxically, from an untested regulatory system intended to simplify and accelerate their development.

The projects, more than three years late and billions over budget, are what pushed Westinghouse — one of the last private companies building nuclear reactors — and its parent, Toshiba, to the brink of financial ruin, resulting in Toshiba’s chairman stepping down.

The company has said that Westinghouse will complete the reactors for the projects it already has underway, including two in China. But the fate of other projects in the United States and abroad that plan to use the Westinghouse reactor, known as the AP1000, are in doubt, along with the role of the United States in the future of nuclear energy. It is also unclear how President Trump will approach nuclear energy development, which has broad and overlapping implications for tax and trade policies, economic development and national security.

The AP1000 is considered one of the world’s most advanced reactors, with simplified structures and safety equipment which were intended to make it easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. It has been designed with an improved ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima.

The industry has lurched through boom and bust cycles before.

Nuclear construction had all but disappeared in the United States, particularly after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Concerns over climate change led to renewed interest in building new plants under the administration of George W. Bush, however. The Bush-era energy policy acts authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees, plus tax credits like those available for wind and solar.

Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and ’80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process.

Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly.

In the meantime, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric were developing a new generation of reactors intended to operate more safely. With the AP1000, for instance, emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces, like gravity, to propel the coolant, rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity. The problem is that electricity can fail, as it did at Fukushima, which can lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design.

In addition, Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components of the plants could be made in sections at factories, then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site. In theory, this approach would save money and time, requiring far less skilled labor than the old, bespoke approach, in which workers assembled more parts onsite.

By 2008, Westinghouse had deals to expand two existing plants with the electric utilities Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric & Gas. Little went as hoped.

Because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components, like the 300-ton reactor vessels. Instead, they were manufactured overseas, adding to expense and delays.

One reactor vessel, headed for Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant from the Port of Savannah, almost slipped off a specialized rail car. That led to a weekslong delay before a second attempt was made to deliver it.

And, in a separate snafu, while working on the plant’s basement contractors installed 1,200 tons of steel reinforcing bar in a way that differed from the approved design. That triggered a seven-and-a-half month delay to get a license amendment.

To some extent, the unexpected delays were to be, well, expected, given the novelty of the design and the fact that builders were decades out of practice. Any large undertaking involving so many first-of-a-kind complexities would be likely get tripped up somewhere, said Daniel S. Lipman, vice president of supplier and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry.

“Whether you’re building a nuclear power plant or providing a new locomotive or a new fighter jet complex for the Defense Department, the first of a kind almost always takes longer to be deployed,” he said.

And then there was Fukushima, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out both grid and backup emergency power at the plant, disabling its cooling systems and leading to the meltdown of three reactors. The plant remains shut down, and the decommissioning and cleanup process is projected to take as long as 40 years.

The Japan disaster prompted regulators to revisit safety standards, slowing approval of the Westinghouse designs and resulting in new requirements even after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the go-ahead for the Georgia and South Carolina projects. That led to more costly delays as manufacturing orders had to be changed.

As all of that unfolded, Westinghouse was having troubles with the contractor it chose to complete the projects, a company that struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of still-unresolved disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction.

Toshiba, which would like to sell all or part of its controlling interest in Westinghouse, has said it will continue to look into Westinghouse’s handling of the purchase.

“Certainly they underestimated the amount of liability or cost overruns that these projects were in,” Robert Norfleet, a managing director at Alembic Global Advisors who has followed the machinations, said of Westinghouse. “I don’t really know how they can’t take the blame for that. That’s something within their own due diligence that they needed to do.”

In the meantime, the main stage for nuclear development will move overseas to places like China, Russia, India, Korea and a handful of countries in the Middle East, where Westinghouse will have to find partners to build its designs.

In China, plants using an earlier model of the AP1000 are moving toward completion. If they are successful, that may stir up more interest in the technology, and future installations may go more smoothly. But Toshiba’s ambitions of installing 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030 no longer look feasible.

Indeed, despite the much-ballyhooed ingenuity of a new generation of reactors designed by the likes of Westinghouse and G.E., countries may stick with older technologies that they can produce and install more quickly and cheaply. “Until several of these new designs — including the AP1000 from Westinghouse — come online on time and on budget,” said Brent Wanner, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, “it will be an uphill battle.”President Trump spoke about his executive orders, the economy and his polls.

As Mr. Trump campaigned, his consistent affection for Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and apparent defense of Russian intervention in Ukraine raised further concerns. In December 2015, on “Morning Joe,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin, “He’s running his country and at least he’s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.” He also equated Mr. Putin’s murderous regime with the American government: “Our country does plenty of killing, also” — a remark he has repeated as president.

Suspect public comments like these led one senior Republican leader to dolefully inform his peers that he thought Mr. Trump was on the Kremlin’s payroll, suggesting that Mr. Trump had been compromised by Russian intelligence. Other leaders were surprised by their colleague’s frank assessment, but did not dispute it.

As Mr. Trump prevailed in state after state, the leaders came to terms with the possibility, then the likelihood, that he would win the nomination. During the process, most leaders had not endorsed a candidate and hoped that Mr. Trump would be stopped. By early May 2016, however, his victory appeared a fait accompli, placing them in an unenviable position. As senior leaders, opposing the outcome of the party contest was unthinkable.

Eventually, one by one, they all committed to supporting Mr. Trump, often simply saying they would support the nominee, conspicuously avoiding uttering Mr. Trump’s name. In a fascinating political metamorphosis, some even found reason to be excited about Mr. Trump.

They were understandably anxious to win back the White House to advance policy priorities and appoint conservative Supreme Court justices. Some believed that, despite his faults, Mr. Trump could bring the dramatic disruption they thought Washington needed. Others saw career opportunities in supporting Mr. Trump, who had yet to select a running mate and, if elected, would also make cabinet appointments.

Shockingly, some of the leaders most concerned about Russian subversion and Mr. Trump’s possible compromise were his first and most vocal supporters among congressional leaders — some publicly, some privately. It was an inauspicious trade of national security for political self-preservation and partisan ambition.

Now the leaders’ worst fears seem validated. Mr. Flynn has become the third Trump team member to step down over Russia-related issues, following the campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This plotline is unlikely to improve of its own accord, and America’s security is now at stake. For Republican leaders in Congress, there is no more room for cognitive dissonance. Instead, it is urgent that they recommit to patriotic prudence. They should demand that Attorney General Jeff Sessions appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Russia’s assault on American democracy and Mr. Trump’s possible collusion with the Kremlin.

At a minimum, they must establish a bipartisan special select committee with subpoena power in the House or the Senate for the same purpose. This job is too big and significant to be entrusted to the standing intelligence committees, which have critical tasks and limited staff. The nation must have accountability — including public hearings where possible — on these matters.

After their grand bargain to back Mr. Trump’s Moscow-assisted victory, congressional Republicans are now responsible for protecting the nation from its dangers.None carry guns.

These images are part of a battlefield video that was shared with The New York Times on Friday and that, thanks to Congolese human rights activists, has begun to make the rounds on Facebook and other social media.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Several analysts said that the footage revealed a government-sponsored massacre of civilians and that the video could be used as evidence of war crimes.

Human Rights Watch, Western diplomats and United Nations officials said they were investigating the video, which was consistent with United Nations reports this week of Congolese government soldiers ruthlessly crushing a local militia in the Kasaï-Central Province.

“The video shows shocking footage of killings and executions of civilians by uniformed personnel,” said a statement by the United Nations peacekeeping department. Peacekeeping officials said they were trying to verify the source of the video and whether it was linked to the recent clashes in the Kasaï area.

Congo has a sordid history of government-led atrocities, including gang rapes and the slaughtering of civilians. The country is nearly lawless, and the government forces are known to be wild, brutal, underpaid and among the most dreaded.

But it is rare to have such powerful, graphic evidence of the blasé taking of human life.

“Look, they are dying,” the soldiers said in Lingala, the language of central Congo, as they blasted the civilians. “Watch how they get killed like animals.”

Human rights activists said that the video was filmed by a Congolese government soldier who was part of the execution squad and that the soldier may have felt bad about what happened and leaked it to assuage his conscience. The camera was right behind the soldiers as they raised their rifles.

The soldiers did not even take cover when they opened fire. Analysts said it was clear that the soldiers knew that their targets posed no threat. At least 13 bodies could be seen in the video.

The unrest in Kasaï is only one of many self-inflicted crises that the Congolese government faces. A religious cult in the west of the country is seeking to revive an ancient kingdom.

The commodities-based economy continues to nose-dive.

And great uncertainty hangs over the teeming, beleaguered capital, Kinshasa, as Congo’s president, Joseph Kabila, seems to retreat deeper into the corner he has put himself in, with no plan to leave.

Just this week, the government announced that it did not have the money to hold an election in 2017, after the ruling party agreed a few weeks ago to do just that. Under Congo’s Constitution, Mr. Kabila should not even be in office now. His second and final term was over in December. He is deeply unpopular, increasingly isolated and suspected of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through fraudulent mining deals.

“None of these conflicts are directly related to each other, but they are proliferating around the country because the government is weak and contested,” said Jason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group, a research project based at New York University.

“The government is also paranoid, which is why it feels it needs to take a hard line toward any movements,” he added.

The video appears to have been filmed within the past 10 days, analysts said, during the government’s military operations to quash the Kamuina Nsapu militia. The militia is an offshoot of a local movement in Kasaï whose followers have challenged the government over local autonomy. Some of the group’s followers believe in traditional magic.

It seems the video was filmed as the government soldiers were approaching about a dozen Kamuina Nsapu followers who were standing together in a rural road, chanting.

“They are not scared to die, so we will show them,” one of the soldiers says.

Several of the victims were wearing garlands of leaves. Analysts said they might have believed the leaves — or the chanting — would protect them from bullets. That may be one reason the people did not run or dive into the bushes when the first gunshots rang out.

This week, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Liz Throssell, said as many as 101 people, including 39 women, may have been killed in clashes in the Kasaï area.

“We are deeply concerned at the reported high number of deaths, which if confirmed would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers,” the statement said.

Lambert Mende, Congo’s information minister, said the video was not filmed in Congo, but possibly another African country, and that it was an attempt by nongovernmental organizations “to destroy the image of the D.R.C.”In a rambling news conference on Thursday, the president said his administration had undertaken “the most substantial border security measures in a generation,” and he said that efforts to find and deport “criminal aliens” would make the United States safer.

“Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised: ‘Oh, he is having strong borders.’ Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.”

But his early efforts to translate all of that talk into action are already running into the reality of governing in Washington, where legal constraints on taking action — and debates about paying for it — are legendary.

Mr. Trump has promised to hire 15,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of a larger deportation force that can remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, something he repeatedly promised to do during the campaign.

But hiring such a large number of agents in a short period of time would be nearly impossible, according to John F. Kelly, the former general whom Mr. Trump chose to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

“I don’t believe we’re going to get 10,000 and 5,000 on board within the next couple of years,” Mr. Kelly told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this month, explaining that stringent hiring standards and training regimens slow down the process.

“I’d rather have fewer and make sure that they’re high-quality people that are already serving in those organizations, already well trained, but I will not skimp on the training and the standards,” Mr. Kelly said.

One of the problems that Mr. Kelly faces is a polygraph test that prospective agents, including those seeking to work for the Border Patrol, must take. According to a former senior homeland security official, nearly 60 percent of applicants fail it.

The test was first put in place after another surge in hiring during the George W. Bush administration. Thousands of people were hired without being properly vetted, which resulted in dozens of corruption cases involving Border Patrol and other agents, who were accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.

The former senior homeland security official, James Tomsheck, who was the assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, office of internal affairs, said in several cases many of the new hires were members of the cartels.

“The corruption and excessive use of force that plague the agency is a direct result of a hiring mandate to hire too many people too rapidly without the proper vetting,” said Mr. Tomsheck, who was removed from his position after, he said, he was accused of being too aggressive in pursuing excessive use-of-force cases.

It is unclear how Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly plan to solve the manpower problem.

One option, swiftly denied on Friday by the White House, was a plan to use as many as 100,000 National Guard troops as part of a nationwide deportation force that would help to augment federal agents and local authorities newly deputized to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

The idea emerged in a draft memorandum, first reported by The Associated Press, which asserted that National Guard troops, under the direction of governors in border states, are “particularly well suited to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law and augment border security operations by Department components.”

Gillian M. Christensen, the acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the memorandum was a “very early, pre-decisional draft that never made it to the secretary and was never seriously considered by the department.” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Friday morning that the report by The Associated Press was “100 percent not true.”

But advocates for immigrants reacted with alarm.

“The administration wants to put on a show,” said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York. “Their intent is to create fear, to create an environment in which people either self-deport or hide in the shadows.”

The proposal to deploy 100,000 troops would be a stark increase in the size and scope of National Guard involvement in border security, but it is not unprecedented.

Several presidents, including George Bush and Barack Obama, called up thousands of National Guard troops to bolster border patrol operations. While they mostly acted as extra eyes to spot illegal border crossings, at times they carried weapons and assisted in drug arrests.

In 1916, in response to cross-border raids by Mexican bandits and what The New York Times described as a “prairie fire of anti-American sentiment that has been sweeping northern Mexico,” President Woodrow Wilson deployed more than 100,000 guardsmen to the border to reinforce regular Army units.

More recently, in July 2014, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to its border with Mexico in an effort to bolster his border-security credentials as he prepared to start his presidential campaign.

The deployment has been costly, controversial and continues to this day. The troops live in hotels along the border during their deployments, and the estimate of the costs in 2014 were $12 million a month.

Mr. Perry’s efforts coincided with an influx of undocumented Central American immigrants coming across the border, including unaccompanied children and teenagers. Experts expect another surge in arrivals this spring.

In Mr. Trump’s executive order calling for an end to “catch and release,” he also directed Mr. Kelly to do everything possible to “construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.” Immigration experts said that will be costly and take time.

“The bottom line is,” Mr. Appleby said, “they’re doing everything they can legally do until they’re told not to by the courts to expand their capacity to deport as many people as possible.”And consulates are moving quickly to help. As official representatives of the Mexican government in the United States, the consulates can provide legal guidance and resources for people and families dealing with immigration issues. Mexicans make up about half of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The relationship between Mexico and the United States is at its lowest point in years. After a 35-year-old mother of two American citizens was deported in Arizona last week, the Mexican government warned their citizens living in the United States of a “new reality.” It urged “the entire Mexican community” to “take precautions” and be in touch with the nearest consulate.

Mexican officials say they are eager to keep families already living in the United States together. There are economic concerns too: Mexicans living abroad send more than $25 billion back home, with most of the money coming from the United States, according to Mexico’s central bank.

Perhaps nobody is as busy as Carlos García de Alba, the consul general in Los Angeles, one of the largest offices in the country. He has begun to train nearly every employee in basic legal services and expects to bring in many more immigration lawyers. Still, in recent months, Mr. García has felt torn between his efforts to increase services to worried constituents and trying to calm their nerves.

“We don’t want to provoke and feed a kind of paranoia among our nationals here,” Mr. García said in an interview. “There is a kind of psychosis, people are really scared. Up to now we haven’t seen anything that is really different than the last several years, but the environment is making people panic and they are completely fearful. They want to know what is going to happen and how to protect themselves.”

In the last week, the Mexican government has created a 24-hour hotline to help answer any questions for Mexicans in the United States. Last month, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced that he would spend $50 million to pay for lawyers at every consulate to help people facing deportations. And consulates have been distributing fliers detailing what to do if someone is approached by deportation agents — advising them not to open their doors without proof of a warrant or speak to officers without a lawyer.

Foreign service officers who have spent decades in the United States said in interviews that they had all encountered increased anxiety among undocumented immigrants, as several states have passed their own laws to deal with illegal immigration. But they said this was the most hostile national atmosphere for Mexicans in recent memory, making their jobs both more difficult and more urgent.

Scared by rumors and rhetoric, some consulates have heard of immigrants taking drastic steps to avoid the authorities, like keeping their children home from school, quitting their jobs or selling their homes for cash. And many immigrants may not immediately consider turning to the Mexican government for help.

“There is an inherent feeling of vulnerability that comes with being undocumented in this country, and that vulnerability moves you to get away of anything that is official government,” said Carlos González Gutiérrez, the consul general in Austin, Tex., who estimates that about half of the 200,000 Mexicans living in the region are undocumented. “The first challenge for us is to make sure that immigrants understand that the consulate is a safe place where they can get accurate information.”

Like other consuls, Mr. González has tried to assuage fears by appearing frequently on Spanish-language television and radio, offering information that American officials may not be willing to share. He has been careful to emphasize that the operations appeared to be targeted, not widespread raids as some feared, but also pointed out that several people without criminal records had also been arrested.

Many of the consulates’ most pressing concerns now are defensive. In several cases last week, immigration agents were “unwilling to provide our nationals with the option to talk with our consulate and the obligation to notify us,” said one Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue was still under investigation. Under the Vienna Convention, a 1963 international treaty, any citizen of another country should be offered a chance to speak with their consulate.

Felipe Carrera oversees the department of protection in the Los Angeles consulate, where dozens of lawyers assist with immigration cases. For years, the office has sent a lawyer to the federal immigration center daily, monitoring who is taken in and talking to as many as 15 people a day. Minutes after he heard reports of dozens of arrests last week, several lawyers went there to talk with as many Mexicans as they could.

“Our main purpose is to find out if there have been violations of due process,” Mr. Carrera said. “People need to know they have constitutional rights. We want them to know about the Fifth Amendment and make sure they are properly advised about what happens if they plead guilty.”

Claudia Franco, the consul general in Phoenix, said much of her time these days was spent offering a kind of psychological support to immigrants, answering basic questions and calmly listening to their fears. “We want people to consider worst-case scenarios, to be prepared and have a plan,” she said. The round-the-clock national hotline, based in Tucson, received more than 1,500 calls one day this week, more than double than the average number of calls before Mr. Trump was inaugurated.

Consulates throughout the country said requests for legal assistance had also spiked in the last two months — some come from people who received deportation orders years ago that were never enforced. Others have criminal convictions for using fake Social Security cards; still others may be eligible for special visas because they were victims of domestic abuse or other crimes.

“Most people do not understand what their legal options are,” said Javier Díaz de León, the consul general in Atlanta. “There are a number of people who don’t really have a legal recourse, but it’s much more preferable to know that before you get detained so you can make a wise decision.”

While many people are looking for advice have plans to stay here, many parents of American-born children are now registering them for Mexican citizenship — a kind of insurance in case they are deported and want their children to join them. The Mexican government has offered this kind of dual citizenship for more than a decade. Before the election, Mr. Díaz said, the office handled about 15 applications a day, now they receive double that.

Other offices have experienced similar increases. Monica Sanchez, 26, came to Los Angeles from Morelia, Mexico, more than 10 years ago. Although she has stayed out of legal trouble, she said she was constantly worried that things would change quickly and she would be forced to move back.

“I want to do something, whatever I can do to feel safer and less scared,” she said. “We all want help to take the control we can get, to have some power.”The plants also draw fertilizer runoff and other pollutants out of the water, locking them safely away in meadow soil. Scientists have estimated that an acre of seagrass provides more than $11,000 worth of filtering every year.

These services alone would make seagrass meadows among the most economically valuable ecosystems on Earth. But now Dr. Harvell, Dr. Lamb and their colleagues have found that these plants may help us in another way: by wiping out pathogens.

Their new study, published in the journal Science, began with a scuba diving trip in Indonesia. The scientists were inspecting coral reefs for infections with bacteria and fungi; some reefs are increasingly falling prey to these diseases.

“By the end of the four-day workshop, we all came down with amoebic dysentery,” recalled Dr. Harvell. “One scientist developed typhoid, and we had to ship her out.”

The experience left Dr. Harvell wondering if the illnesses of the scientists might somehow be connected to those of the reefs. “It just got me thinking about human health and environmental health and how they’re linked,” she said.

She discussed the idea with Dr. Lamb, who began to investigate.

Seagrass meadows can release so much oxygen that the surrounding water fizzes like champagne. That oxygen might be able to kill pathogens, Dr. Lamb realized. The plants also host fungi, which are known to producing bacteria-killing compounds.

Dr. Lamb and her colleagues decided to study sites around four islands in Indonesia with and without nearby seagrass. The scientists devised two strategies to search for pathogens.

In one survey, they collected seawater and put it in petri dishes to see if colonies of disease-causing bacteria known as Enterococcus grew from the samples. Levels of the bacteria in water from seagrass meadows, they found, were a third of the levels in water from other sites.

In a second search, the scientists grabbed fragments of DNA floating in seawater. By examining the sequences, they identified 18 kinds of disease-causing bacteria. Water from the seagrass meadows had only half the level of this DNA, compared with water collected at other sites.

The scientists next turned their attention to coral reefs around the islands. Reefs next to seagrass meadows, they found, were half as diseased as those without meadows.

Thorsten B. Reusch, a marine ecologist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Germany who was not involved in the study, called it “truly fascinating and innovative.” He also warned that “it remains to be seen what the exact mechanisms of the pathogen removal are.”And consulates are moving quickly to help. As official representatives of the Mexican government in the United States, the consulates can provide legal guidance and resources for people and families dealing with immigration issues. Mexicans make up about half of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.

The relationship between Mexico and the United States is at its lowest point in years. After a 35-year-old mother of two American citizens was deported in Arizona last week, the Mexican government warned their citizens living in the United States of a “new reality.” It urged “the entire Mexican community” to “take precautions” and be in touch with the nearest consulate.

Mexican officials say they are eager to keep families already living in the United States together. There are economic concerns too: Mexicans living abroad send more than $25 billion back home, with most of the money coming from the United States, according to Mexico’s central bank.

Perhaps nobody is as busy as Carlos García de Alba, the consul general in Los Angeles, one of the largest offices in the country. He has begun to train nearly every employee in basic legal services and expects to bring in many more immigration lawyers. Still, in recent months, Mr. García has felt torn between his efforts to increase services to worried constituents and trying to calm their nerves.

“We don’t want to provoke and feed a kind of paranoia among our nationals here,” Mr. García said in an interview. “There is a kind of psychosis, people are really scared. Up to now we haven’t seen anything that is really different than the last several years, but the environment is making people panic and they are completely fearful. They want to know what is going to happen and how to protect themselves.”

In the last week, the Mexican government has created a 24-hour hotline to help answer any questions for Mexicans in the United States. Last month, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced that he would spend $50 million to pay for lawyers at every consulate to help people facing deportations. And consulates have been distributing fliers detailing what to do if someone is approached by deportation agents — advising them not to open their doors without proof of a warrant or speak to officers without a lawyer.

Foreign service officers who have spent decades in the United States said in interviews that they had all encountered increased anxiety among undocumented immigrants, as several states have passed their own laws to deal with illegal immigration. But they said this was the most hostile national atmosphere for Mexicans in recent memory, making their jobs both more difficult and more urgent.

Scared by rumors and rhetoric, some consulates have heard of immigrants taking drastic steps to avoid the authorities, like keeping their children home from school, quitting their jobs or selling their homes for cash. And many immigrants may not immediately consider turning to the Mexican government for help.

“There is an inherent feeling of vulnerability that comes with being undocumented in this country, and that vulnerability moves you to get away of anything that is official government,” said Carlos González Gutiérrez, the consul general in Austin, Tex., who estimates that about half of the 200,000 Mexicans living in the region are undocumented. “The first challenge for us is to make sure that immigrants understand that the consulate is a safe place where they can get accurate information.”

Like other consuls, Mr. González has tried to assuage fears by appearing frequently on Spanish-language television and radio, offering information that American officials may not be willing to share. He has been careful to emphasize that the operations appeared to be targeted, not widespread raids as some feared, but also pointed out that several people without criminal records had also been arrested.

Many of the consulates’ most pressing concerns now are defensive. In several cases last week, immigration agents were “unwilling to provide our nationals with the option to talk with our consulate and the obligation to notify us,” said one Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue was still under investigation. Under the Vienna Convention, a 1963 international treaty, any citizen of another country should be offered a chance to speak with their consulate.

Felipe Carrera oversees the department of protection in the Los Angeles consulate, where dozens of lawyers assist with immigration cases. For years, the office has sent a lawyer to the federal immigration center daily, monitoring who is taken in and talking to as many as 15 people a day. Minutes after he heard reports of dozens of arrests last week, several lawyers went there to talk with as many Mexicans as they could.

“Our main purpose is to find out if there have been violations of due process,” Mr. Carrera said. “People need to know they have constitutional rights. We want them to know about the Fifth Amendment and make sure they are properly advised about what happens if they plead guilty.”

Claudia Franco, the consul general in Phoenix, said much of her time these days was spent offering a kind of psychological support to immigrants, answering basic questions and calmly listening to their fears. “We want people to consider worst-case scenarios, to be prepared and have a plan,” she said. The round-the-clock national hotline, based in Tucson, received more than 1,500 calls one day this week, more than double than the average number of calls before Mr. Trump was inaugurated.

Consulates throughout the country said requests for legal assistance had also spiked in the last two months — some come from people who received deportation orders years ago that were never enforced. Others have criminal convictions for using fake Social Security cards; still others may be eligible for special visas because they were victims of domestic abuse or other crimes.

“Most people do not understand what their legal options are,” said Javier Díaz de León, the consul general in Atlanta. “There are a number of people who don’t really have a legal recourse, but it’s much more preferable to know that before you get detained so you can make a wise decision.”

While many people are looking for advice have plans to stay here, many parents of American-born children are now registering them for Mexican citizenship — a kind of insurance in case they are deported and want their children to join them. The Mexican government has offered this kind of dual citizenship for more than a decade.

From The New York Times: Today in Our Picks, we’ve got more great stories that have absolutely nothing to do with politics. We’re reading about a pregnant woman who decides to hunt down a mountain lion in Hollywood, watching a hockey team of Orthodox Jewish students, and listening to the origin story of the hosiery brand Spanx. — Anna Dubenko, Senior Digital Strategist

_____MUNICH — Vice President Mike Pence vowed Saturday that the United States will "hold Russia accountable" even as President Donald Trump searches for new common ground with Moscow at the start of his presidency.

Pence, in an address to the Munich Security Conference, also offered assurances to European allies that the U.S. "strongly supports" NATO. He said the U.S. would be "unwavering" in its commitment to trans-Atlantic institutions like NATO.

In his first overseas trip as vice president, Pence sought to calm nervous European allies who remain concerned about Russian aggression and have been alarmed by Trump's positive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin. The address to foreign diplomats and security officials also sought to reassure international partners who worry that Trump may pursue isolationist tendencies.

Pence said the U.S. would demand that Russia honor a 2015 peace deal agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, to end violence in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists.

"Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground which as you know President Trump believes can be found," Pence said.

Pence met afterward with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who addressed the conference just before the vice president. Merkel stressed the need to maintain international alliances and told the audience, with Pence seated a few feet away, that NATO is "in the American interest."

European countries along Russia's border are rattled by the prospect of deeper U.S.-Russia ties after Trump suggested sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in exchange for a nuclear weapons deal, and after the president referred to NATO as "obsolete" in an interview before his inauguration. Trump has since tempered his language, stressing the importance of the NATO alliance during his telephone conversations with foreign leaders.

Pence also scheduled meetings Saturday with the leaders of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — countries dealing with the threat of Russian incursion. Pence also planned to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.

The visit, which includes a stop in Brussels on Sunday and Monday, comes amid worries in Europe about Russian aggression, Trump's relationship with Putin and whether the new president may promote isolationist tendencies through his "America First" mantra.

"The vice president has sent reassuring messages through his own engagement but that hasn't been enough to dispel the concerns that you see in many parts of Europe," says Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There are such grave challenges that the U.S. and Europe faces that it only heightens the desire for additional clarity from Washington."

Pence's stature within the administration was also under scrutiny because of the recent dismissal of Trump's national security adviser, retired Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign Monday following reports he misled Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat. The vice president learned that he had been misled through media accounts about two weeks after the president was informed.

Pence is also expected to meet with the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. is embroiled in two separate wars. Trump has made clear his intention to defeat the Islamic State group. But he also said the U.S. may get a second chance to take Iraqi oil as compensation for its efforts in the war-torn country, a notion rebuffed by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who will be meeting with the vice president.

Trump's immigration and refugee ban has ruffled feathers with a number of Muslim-majority countries affected by the order currently tied up in court, including Iraq — a close ally in the fight against IS.

In Munich, the American allies were searching for clues from Pence as to how the Trump administration plans to deal with Russia in the aftermath of Flynn's departure, U.S. inquiries into Russia's involvement in the presidential election and Trump's past praise for Putin.

In his remarks, Pence also reinforced the Trump administration's message that NATO members must spend more on defense.

NATO's 28-member countries committed in 2014 to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. But only the U.S. and four other members of the post-World War II military coalition are meeting the standard, Pence said.

Failure to meet the commitment, he said, "erodes the very foundation of our alliance."

"Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment and, for most, that means the time has come to do more," Pence said.

__UNF News is not a television network or a radio network, for that matter. UNF, or Universal News Forever, is the baby, identity, passion and obsession of Kyle Mazza, 19, who posed the question about Mrs. Trump.

The question, which was mocked a little on social media, will most likely end up as a footnote about Mr. Trump’s dealings with the news media. But Mr. Mazza’s unlikely path to the White House is a strange tale befitting these strange times.

UNF News, Mr. Mazza said in an interview on Friday, was his “own news station that I started when I was 8 years old.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

If Mr. Trump were to start paying attention to UNF News, it would be a start: The network has neither advertisers nor subscribers.

Yet in an era of fake news, overheated partisanship and general rancor, Mr. Mazza seems unfailingly earnest and without an agenda — aside from trying to become a reporter, with his own notion of what that means.

After forming WUNF, Mr. Mazza would write articles about events in his hometown, Fair Lawn, N.J. A few years later, he obtained press credentials from a local cable access channel, Fair Lawn TV, giving him access to courts and other official events.

By the time Mr. Mazza got his driver’s license two years ago, he had seven police scanners and three weather radios.

“I always used to monitor the storms and the police reports,” he said. “It was extremely interesting.”

After graduating from high school, Mr. Mazza took classes at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting’s campus in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., while continuing to pursue his passion.

Mr. Mazza’s parents, he said, supported and helped pay for his journalistic ambitions. Once he could drive, he aimed his sights on Manhattan.

“I covered one of the mayor’s press conferences,” he said of Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. “After I did that I got on the list to get advisories from the mayor, so I said, ‘Why not go to City Hall and get myself known there?’”

He soon discovered that in addition to Room 9, where the City Hall press corps works, there was an annex room for reporters in the basement, Room 4a.

Mr. Mazza asked the mayor’s office if he could work from that room. The answer was yes, and for the past couple of years, he has become a semiregular in the City Hall press corps. He said he mostly covers politics, breaking news and entertainment, but allowed that he really covered whatever struck his fancy.

Other reporters had mostly kind things to say about Mr. Mazza, even if they said his approach reflected his age and experience.

Mr. Mazza’s work has, at times, created some unease at home. He recalled when, during a State of the City speech by the mayor in 2016, there was a shooting of two police officers in the Bronx, and he wanted to go with the rest of the press corps with the mayor to the hospital.

“My mom was calling me; she was like, ‘Go home, go home, go home,’” Mr. Mazza said. “She was very nervous, and I went home. But after that, I always went to shootings and now she understands that it is my job.”

But even his mother was shocked when she saw him on national television Thursday.

Mr. Mazza had been going to the White House since the election, and said he had gone to four press briefings conducted by Sean M. Spicer, the press secretary, first securing a daily credential, and then weekly passes. He happened to be in Washington on Thursday when Mr. Trump announced that he was going to hold an impromptu news conference.

“I was prepared,” Mr. Mazza said, explaining that he had a news release from the White House about the first lady opening the visitors office, “and I said to myself, ‘There has not been a lot of coverage about this,’ and I thought it could be interesting.”

Despite the tension during the combative news conference, Mr. Mazza said he was not nervous, saying to himself, “If he doesn’t like my question, he doesn’t like my question. I am just going to ask my question.”

He was not concerned if some people might view his question as a softball.

“I was really honored that he appreciated my question,” Mr. Mazza said. “And I was appreciative he answered my question. The president took the time out of his day to answer my question.”The plan is to give money, resources and training to the Libyans to keep the migrants there, an idea somewhat similar to the European Union’s deal with Turkey, only this one is with a country run by competing militias and multiple weak governments.

It is not the first time Italy has forged an agreement with Libya to stem the flow of migration. But the most effective attempt was before Libya descended into chaos with the collapse of its government in 2011.

Libya has since become the prime launching point for many of the 180,000 migrants who reached Italy last year, when more than 5,000 people died trying to make the Mediterranean crossing.

Even previous agreements met criticism for the sometimes brutal tactics that North African countries used to hold back migrants. Embryonic as it is, this latest plan to stem the flow is already being criticized as both potentially unworkable and inhumane.

Some international experts are skeptical about the scope of the operation, and human rights groups fear the plan is the equivalent of throwing the migrants back into the frying pan of Libya, where many are fleeing dangers and dire conditions.

The internationally backed Libyan government the European Union is dealing with has barely a toehold in the fragmented, violence-plagued country, and may even be verging on collapse. Much of the Libyan coast remains in the hands of criminal and rebel groups.

“It’s a first step taken with an interim government that doesn’t really control the country, but it’s a first step,” said Natalino Ronzitti, professor emeritus of international law and an adviser at the Institute for International Affairs in Italy.

“We need to see whether it complies with human rights and whether Europe will open identification centers for migrants in Libya, or will help Libya do so, but we know little about that at present,” Ms. Ronzitti said.

The pilot program is the first of its kind within Operation Sophia, the European Union’s anti-immigrant trafficking operation, and is part of an effort that European leaders agreed to this month at their summit meeting in Malta, where they pledged “sustainable and predictable” funding to train the Libyan Coast Guard.

The day before the Malta meeting, Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, signed an agreement with the Libyan premier, Fayez Serraj, to curb migrant trafficking from Libyan shores.

In exchange, Italy will provide money, technology, medicine and training to set up migrant holding centers in the country, which it ruled as a colony between 1911 and 1943.

Italian Embassy officials were the last European delegation to leave Tripoli in 2015, and last month became the first to return to their original compound.

This week, Italy’s Interior Ministry hosted a meeting in Rome with 10 Libyan mayors from the southern region of Fezzan, the main gateway for migrants into Libya, to underscore Italy’s intention to help them control the border.

“We can’t expect such a large phenomenon to have an immediate solution,” Roberta Pinotti, Italy’s defense minister, acknowledged one recent morning aboard the aircraft carrier stationed in Valletta’s harbor.

“But it’s a phenomenon that we want to be able to govern,” she said, citing the thousands of weekly arrivals in Italy, even in winter.

Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, echoed the sentiment. “The training didn’t take place because there is a crisis, but to try to prevent a crisis,” he said.

The migrant holding centers are among the most contentious components of the plan.

Hussein Thwadi, the mayor of the western coastal city of Sabratha, Libya, the busiest departure point for Mediterranean crossings, has said that keeping migrants in Libya is a “dangerous step” because the country does not have the resources to deal with them.

Huge numbers of migrants are already in Libya, and they face constant threats, humanitarian groups point out.

Last year, Doctors Without Borders highlighted the “alarming levels of violence” against migrants and refugees in Libya, including sexual attacks and killings, not only from smugglers, but also from myriad armed groups and individuals.

Migrants reported being detained by militiamen for months in dire conditions. Others were kept in a form of slavery by private individuals who forced them into labor, often in exchange for scarce food.

“As Libya is not a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and is itself emerging from a humanitarian crisis, E.U. countries cannot assume that these rights are granted,” Doctors Without Borders said last year, referring to the United Nations treaty that outlines the rights of the displaced. “E.U. countries, therefore, should not deny people the chance of reaching Europe.”

Anything that stems the flow of migrants in Libya also runs the danger of running up against the interests of the powerful armed groups that control the trade. In a country racked by conflict, migrant smuggling has become a lucrative business for a bewildering array of criminal gangs and associated militias.

European leaders concede that Libya’s instability and widespread violence were causes of concern.

“The young men who received this training, when they return to their country, will face enormous pressure from criminal gangs and smugglers who have an influx of millions of euros a week,” Mr. Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, acknowledged.

Most smugglers’ boats depart from remote beaches along a 230-mile stretch of coastline in the west of the country, between Misurata and the border with Tunisia.

Theoretically, this territory is controlled by the U.N.-backed unity government led by Mr. Serraj, which installed itself in Tripoli last March with backing from the United States and other Western countries.

Photo

In reality, much of the coastline, as well as the desert towns through which the migrants pass, is controlled by a network of criminal and militia groups with a vested financial interest in the continuation of the trade.

Few believe the unity government has the military muscle, political clout or money to stop the trade, given that it barely controls even the capital, Tripoli.

Its forces control the city port and a handful of government ministries, but otherwise compete for turf with a rival administration led by a coalition of Islamists and militants from Misurata.

Gunmen from dueling factions frequently clash on the city streets in violence that has intensified in recent weeks, prompting warnings from Western officials that the unity government is in danger of being completely marginalized, if not worse.

The U.N.-backed administration is also under pressure from rivals in the east of the country, where forces led by the strongman Gen. Khalifa Hifter have taken near-complete control of the country’s second-largest city, Benghazi.

General Hifter has consolidated his forces, with backing from Egypt and Russia, and has shunned the unity government. During an Egyptian-led effort to broker peace between rival Libyan factions in Cairo this week, Mr. Serraj and Mr. Hifter refused to meet.

The Italian plan to train the Libyan Coast Guard has already run afoul of Libya’s fractious political scene after the San Giorgio, an Italian Navy vessel participating in the program, docked in western Libya last month.

In an indication of the potential pitfalls ahead, leaders in the east of Libya accused the Italians of illegally entering the country.While the total amount of annual savings of roughly $2.5 billion would be comparatively small, administration officials want to highlight the agencies in their coming budget proposal as examples of misuse of taxpayer dollars. An internal memo circulated within the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday, and obtained by The New York Times, notes that the list could change. Proposals for more extensive cuts in cabinet-level agencies are expected to follow.

During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised large but unspecified cuts to rein in the deficit, even as he promised to protect programs for his working-class voters and to drastically expand spending on the military, roads, bridges and airports. While the memo in no way resolves that contradiction, it suggests that he could lean toward a small-government philosophy that conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney have fiercely advocated.

The Office of Management and Budget is currently operating with a skeleton staff; Mr. Mulvaney was only confirmed on Thursday. Still, officials there plan to ask agencies targeted for elimination for their responses by next Friday and to finalize the list by March 13, according to a person familiar with the process.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed cuts. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this month that the administration would release a detailed budget in the next few weeks. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has spoken about government spending only in general terms.

“A balanced budget is fine,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. “But sometimes you have to fuel the well in order to really get the economy going.”

He added: “I want a balanced budget eventually. But I want to have a strong military.”

The president’s hope to increase military spending, shared by many Republicans, will probably be at the center of the looming budget battle in Congress. Funding for the current fiscal year is set to expire on April 28. The administration is expected to make a supplemental request before then for money to go to the military — and possibly a wall on the Mexican border.

But under the Budget Control Act of 2011, spending on defense and domestic programs is capped. Democrats will demand that any lifting of those caps for the military be matched by a higher ceiling for domestic programs, setting the stage for a legislative logjam or a showdown over whether to preserve the parliamentary stalling tactic known as the Senate filibuster.

Steve Bell, a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the programs identified in the memo are standard targets for Republican budget-cutters but of little significance in the government’s financial picture.

“It’s sad in a way because those programs aren’t causing the deficit,” Mr. Bell said. “These programs don’t amount to a hill of beans.”

One surprise for some close watchers of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is the inclusion of the Export-Import Bank on the O.M.B.’s list. Other Republican candidates had promised to eliminate the bank, a favorite target of House conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney. Conservatives, led by the billionaire Koch brothers, have run a multimillion-dollar campaign to kill the bank, which guarantees loans for overseas customers of American corporations, by denouncing it as “crony capitalism.”

But Mr. Trump was more circumspect during the campaign, saying he favored programs to promote American exports. The biggest recipient of the bank’s assistance — and its biggest booster — is the aerospace giant Boeing, which President Trump visited on Friday and lavishly praised.

But the president has stacked his White House with budget hawks. Stephen Miller, one of Mr. Trump’s most senior advisers, was a top aide to Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general and spent much of his Senate career trying to rein in government spending.

For director of budget policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council, Mr. Trump chose Paul Winfree, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. In its own proposed budget blueprint, the Heritage Foundation recommended eliminating virtually the same programs listed in the Office of Management and Budget memo, along with a long list of others.

Many of those programs have been attacked by conservatives since the Republican “revolution” of 1994. Led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, the House of Representatives at the time repeatedly went after funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose supporters dragged Big Bird and Kermit the Frog to Capitol Hill to make their case.

The Appalachian Regional Commission, a Depression-era independent agency aimed at developing some of the poorest parts of the country, has also been a target.

These agencies have managed to survive partly because of powerful patrons in the Senate, including the late Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. Even now, with 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats have considerable leverage to save popular programs.

Backers of the National Endowment for the Arts are likely to put up a particularly vigorous fight.

“The public wants to see agencies like the N.E.A. continue,” said Robert L. Lynch, head of Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit organization. “There is always a debate, but there has been agreement among Republicans and Democrats that funding for the arts is a good thing, and it has been kept in place.”

Other agencies on the budget office’s list of cuts include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Corporation for National and Community Service, which finances programs run by AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps. The memo also proposed reducing funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development.

Stephen Moore, another Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign, acknowledged that powerful constituencies were behind many of the programs that are on the chopping block. But he said now that Republicans are finally in control of the government, they must make a valiant effort to fulfill the promises they have been making to voters for years.

“I think it’s an important endeavor to try to get rid of things that are unnecessary,” Mr. Moore said. “The American public has a lot of contempt for how government is run in Washington, in no small part because there is so much waste.”“You can make it go fast, and you can make it be cheap — but not if you adhere to the standard of care that we do,” said Mark Cooper of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, referring to the United States regulatory body, which is considered one of the most meticulous in the world. “Nuclear safety always undermines nuclear economics. Inherently, it’s a technology whose time never comes.”

In the process, the United States could lose considerable influence over standards governing safety and waste management, nuclear experts say. And the world may show less willingness to move toward potentially safer designs.

“I’m concerned that if the U.S. is not seen as a big player, and doesn’t have that kind of market presence, that we won’t be in a competitive position to bring those standards back up,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia. “If you’ve got more lax safety standards worldwide, I think that’s a problem from an industry perspective as well as just a human standard.”

This may be an advantage for state-owned nuclear industries worldwide. Often they benefit from long-term national policies in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

By contrast, the Toshiba-Westinghouse withdrawal from nuclear construction shows how daunting it can be for the private sector to build these plants, even with generous government subsidies like loan guarantees and tax credits. Projects take decades to complete. Safety concerns change along the way, leading to new regulations, thousands of design alterations, delays and spiraling costs for every element.

In one case, even the dirt used to backfill excavated holes at the Westinghouse project in Georgia became a point of contention when it did not measure up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, leading to increased costs and a lawsuit.

Thus far in the United States, only the Tennessee Valley Authority, itself a government corporation, has been able to bring a new nuclear reactor into operation in the last 20 years.

Of the dozens of new reactors once up for licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only four are actively under construction. Two are at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, and two at the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Both projects, which plan to use a novel reactor from Westinghouse, have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, some stemming, paradoxically, from an untested regulatory system intended to simplify and accelerate their development.

The projects, more than three years late and billions over budget, are what pushed Westinghouse — one of the last private companies building nuclear reactors — and its parent, Toshiba, to the brink of financial ruin, resulting in Toshiba’s chairman stepping down.

The company has said that Westinghouse will complete the reactors for the projects it already has underway, including two in China. But the fate of other projects in the United States and abroad that plan to use the Westinghouse reactor, known as the AP1000, are in doubt, along with the role of the United States in the future of nuclear energy. It is also unclear how President Trump will approach nuclear energy development, which has broad and overlapping implications for tax and trade policies, economic development and national security.

The AP1000 is considered one of the world’s most advanced reactors, with simplified structures and safety equipment which were intended to make it easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. It has been designed with an improved ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima.

The industry has lurched through boom and bust cycles before.

Nuclear construction had all but disappeared in the United States, particularly after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Concerns over climate change led to renewed interest in building new plants under the administration of George W. Bush, however. The Bush-era energy policy acts authorized $18.5 billion in loan guarantees, plus tax credits like those available for wind and solar.

Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and ’80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process.

Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly.

In the meantime, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric were developing a new generation of reactors intended to operate more safely. With the AP1000, for instance, emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces, like gravity, to propel the coolant, rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity. The problem is that electricity can fail, as it did at Fukushima, which can lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design.

In addition, Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components of the plants could be made in sections at factories, then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site. In theory, this approach would save money and time, requiring far less skilled labor than the old, bespoke approach, in which workers assembled more parts onsite.

By 2008, Westinghouse had deals to expand two existing plants with the electric utilities Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric & Gas. Little went as hoped.

Because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components, like the 300-ton reactor vessels. Instead, they were manufactured overseas, adding to expense and delays.

One reactor vessel, headed for Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant from the Port of Savannah, almost slipped off a specialized rail car. That led to a weekslong delay before a second attempt was made to deliver it.

And, in a separate snafu, while working on the plant’s basement contractors installed 1,200 tons of steel reinforcing bar in a way that differed from the approved design. That triggered a seven-and-a-half month delay to get a license amendment.

To some extent, the unexpected delays were to be, well, expected, given the novelty of the design and the fact that builders were decades out of practice. Any large undertaking involving so many first-of-a-kind complexities would be likely get tripped up somewhere, said Daniel S. Lipman, vice president of supplier and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry.

“Whether you’re building a nuclear power plant or providing a new locomotive or a new fighter jet complex for the Defense Department, the first of a kind almost always takes longer to be deployed,” he said.

And then there was Fukushima, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out both grid and backup emergency power at the plant, disabling its cooling systems and leading to the meltdown of three reactors. The plant remains shut down, and the decommissioning and cleanup process is projected to take as long as 40 years.

The Japan disaster prompted regulators to revisit safety standards, slowing approval of the Westinghouse designs and resulting in new requirements even after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the go-ahead for the Georgia and South Carolina projects. That led to more costly delays as manufacturing orders had to be changed.

As all of that unfolded, Westinghouse was having troubles with the contractor it chose to complete the projects, a company that struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of still-unresolved disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction.

Toshiba, which would like to sell all or part of its controlling interest in Westinghouse, has said it will continue to look into Westinghouse’s handling of the purchase.

“Certainly they underestimated the amount of liability or cost overruns that these projects were in,” Robert Norfleet, a managing director at Alembic Global Advisors who has followed the machinations, said of Westinghouse. “I don’t really know how they can’t take the blame for that. That’s something within their own due diligence that they needed to do.”

In the meantime, the main stage for nuclear development will move overseas to places like China, Russia, India, Korea and a handful of countries in the Middle East, where Westinghouse will have to find partners to build its designs.

In China, plants using an earlier model of the AP1000 are moving toward completion. If they are successful, that may stir up more interest in the technology, and future installations may go more smoothly. But Toshiba’s ambitions of installing 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030 no longer look feasible.

Indeed, despite the much-ballyhooed ingenuity of a new generation of reactors designed by the likes of Westinghouse and G.E., countries may stick with older technologies that they can produce and install more quickly and cheaply. “Until several of these new designs — including the AP1000 from Westinghouse — come online on time and on budget,” said Brent Wanner, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, “it will be an uphill battle.”“The fact that in all the 11 championships I’ve never been asked this question says something about where we are” as a country, Mr. Auriemma said. “Forget the answer. The fact that I’ve never been asked means there’s something going on that isn’t normal.”

UConn has won 100 consecutive games since 2014. And while the Huskies are not a lock to win a 12th title, they are favored again to cut down the nets in triumph at the Final Four in Dallas. Now coaches, current players and the team’s former stars are wrestling with the issue of whether UConn should visit the White House in celebration.

The Huskies’ players are amateurs, some still teenagers, not professionals with agents, union protection and multimillion-dollar contracts. They have kept up with the current political situation, and the responses by other athletes, through social media and classroom discussions. Their own reactions were nuanced and considered.

Even before Mr. Trump was elected, UConn players jokingly told one another, “We’re not going if he wins,” the sophomore forward Napheesa Collier said. “Now that it’s actually happened, if we win, I don’t know what everyone’s going to do.”

Ms. Stewart and Maya Moore, another former UConn star, said they expected that whatever decision the team made, it would be done collectively. Gabby Williams, a junior forward, agreed.

“That’s just what we’ve built here,” Ms. Williams, the team’s most complete player, said. “We don’t have guys that do their own thing. Whatever we do, it’ll be a unified decision.”

If some players did not want to attend a White House celebration, Ms. Collier said, “I really don’t know what I would do in that position; I guess we have to get there first.”

Mr. Auriemma, who will turn 63 during the N.C.A.A. tournament, said the dilemma for him was reconciling respect for the office of the presidency with the possibility that some players might object to meeting Mr. Trump, feeling unwelcome at the White House because of the president’s statements and positions on women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims.

“If we’re fortunate enough to win it, and your players walk in and go, ‘Listen, I’m not going,’ we’ve never had to deal with that before,” Mr. Auriemma said.

“What are you going to do as a coach?” he continued. “It’s not like I can look it up and go, ‘What did other people do?’ We’re in a world that very few of us could have conceived five years ago.”

What would he do?

“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s a good question.”

There is no pressing need for an answer now, he understands, no need to cross a point of no return. The national championship game is not until April 2, and there is no guarantee that UConn will be playing or winning.

“I’m not crossing the Rubicon,” Mr. Auriemma said. “That’s Caesar. Once your army crosses that river, you are an enemy of the state.”

Mr. Auriemma is no supporter of Mr. Trump. He made that clear last summer in Rio de Janeiro while coaching the American women’s team to a second consecutive Olympic gold medal under him and sixth in a row over all. Asked whether dominance by the United States was good for women’s basketball, he told reporters, “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s O.K. to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex.”

He later expressed shock that Mr. Trump had been elected president.

But Mr. Auriemma is also the most visible representative of Connecticut’s flagship public university. And he has lived a classic immigrant success story, having been born in Italy and then moving to suburban Philadelphia as a boy, winning a record number of N.C.A.A. basketball titles and becoming wealthy in the process. He speaks reverently of the presidency as a symbol of “the most that this country can represent.”

He tells of his mother, Marsiella, being overcome with tears when she shook hands and took a photograph with President Obama. And how boosters accompanying the team have variously complained about the policies of President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Obama on trips to Washington, yet “once they get down there, he puts his hand out and he says, ‘Welcome to the White House,’ and they just melt.”

“Because it’s the president of the United States,” he said.

One should not easily dismiss an opportunity to meet any president, Mr. Auriemma said. “In order to do that,” he said, “you’ve got to have some pretty strong convictions. And we’ve got some pretty socially activist players on our team.”

Sue Bird, the former UConn point guard who won two N.C.A.A. titles and two of her four Olympic gold medals while playing for Mr. Auriemma, said that if some players felt unwelcome at the White House, he would surely take that into consideration.

“I think he’s somebody that understands where he is in this world and what he represents and the platform he has,” Ms. Bird said. “And I don’t think he’s shy about speaking out on his feelings. And with that, I wouldn’t be surprised, to be honest, if they didn’t go.”

Ms. Bird stressed that she was speaking about her own observations, not about any impression that Mr. Auriemma had directly given her. Any decision, she said, would be a “tough call” and would be made by the coach with the intent of protecting his players.

“Because, in reality, they’re kids,” Ms. Bird said. “So it’s hard to know what to do.”

The Huskies are a diverse team ethnically and culturally, and as with any team, there are varied political opinions, players said.

“I don’t think the entire team wouldn’t go,” said Kia Nurse, a junior guard from Hamilton, Ontario. “It would be an interesting thing.”

Forward Batouly Camara, a native of Manhattan and a transfer from Kentucky who is practicing with UConn but not playing this season, is a Muslim whose parents immigrated from the West African nation Guinea.

Her mother, who holds dual citizenship, has been reluctant to travel back to Guinea, where she runs an orphanage, Ms. Camara said, even though Mr. Trump’s travel ban does not target the country. But she added, “I don’t feel anything harsh or anything at all” toward the president.

Ms. Camara said she had received “an overwhelming amount of support” from teammates, coaches and others in the UConn community, for which she was grateful.

She said she expected the team to stick together in making a decision about the White House. “If we decided to go and do something there,” Ms. Camara said, “that could be a platform for us.”

The family of Ms. Collier, the sophomore forward, has a history of political involvement. Her paternal grandfather, Gershon Collier, was a diplomat in the West African nation Sierra Leone who helped secure the country’s independence from Britain in 1961. He later became its ambassador to the United States and chief justice.

“I think it’s a really touchy subject,” Ms. Collier said of a potential visit to the White House. “For me, personally, I don’t really support Trump, but I would still go out of respect for my team. But I don’t know how everybody else feels about it.”

She added, “We kind of try to stay away from politics a little bit, especially because it’s getting so heated.”

Ms. Williams, UConn’s best player, said her personal view would be to visit the White House.

“It shows, despite my feelings, or anyone’s feelings, that’s just kind of the respectful thing to do,” she said, adding that it “kind of makes you look like the bigger person, too.”

But, she said, “to each his own, and people are free to make their own decisions.”Only the AfD, whose populism puts it far outside of mainstream political norms, is openly promising to fulfill a desire for patriotism that would be routine in most other countries.

The result is that a social and political norm intended to stifle the far right is now empowering it. That focus on identity has allowed the AfD, even if it is unlikely to win enough votes to govern, to shape the national conversation to its advantage, and to present itself as the champion of ordinary Germans.

The search for identity

The AfD rally in a snowy square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, was scheduled to last precisely 30 minutes. It started promptly, ran like clockwork and ended with an instruction to the crowd to pick up any litter on the ground.

Such respect for rules and punctuality is something Germans are good at, said several attendees, who clustered in the glow of the small stage, stomping their feet against the numbing cold.

But mostly the mood was one of frustration. A woman in a shearling coat, who asked not to be named out of fear of anti-right-wing discrimination, said that she hoped the AfD would help heal Germany’s “broken self-confidence.”

A chemist with a doctorate, she personified the way that Germany’s identity gap has allowed the AfD to extend its appeal beyond the far-right fringe and into the middle-class mainstream.

“Only in Germany, I found it very strange, people don’t want to say ‘I am German,’ ” she said. Because the party was the only one willing to challenge that taboo, it was the AfD’s message she absorbed.

Immo Fritsche, a professor at the University of Leipzig who studies group identity formation, said, “There has never been a positive definition of German identity since the Nazi era.”

“It is easier to say what you are against than what you are for,” he said. “And this might be more true in Germany, where the national identity was built on ‘never again.’ ”

For decades, German politicians worked to layer any sense of Germanness beneath a European identity.

“Germany has negotiated the European part very well, but the casualty has been Germanness,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who specializes in the legacy of European fascism.

That smoothed the country’s path back into the community of nations after World War II. But Germans are increasingly concerned about the costs. A July 2016 Pew poll found that half of Germans had an unfavorable view of the European Union. As Euroskepticism rises, a growing minority of Germans are chafing at what they see as pressure to place European identity before national identity.

The influx of refugees into the country in recent years has caused particular stress, Professor Ben-Ghiat said. “In Germany, you’re not even allowed to say you’re proud to be German. You have to say you’re European,” she said. “So when these people come in, what are they left with?”

The power of challenging a taboo

When people feel a loss of control, they seek a stronger connection to a group identity, and also become more interested in making their group more powerful, Professor Fritsche said he had found in his research. Germany’s traditional political parties have been reluctant to indulge that desire because of political taboos. But the AfD has proved adept at exploiting it.

That strategy was on full display the night of Jan. 17 at a beer hall in Dresden, ground zero for Germany’s far-right movement. Hundreds of AfD supporters had gathered for a speech by Björn Höcke, one of the party’s fastest-rising figures.

Addressing the crowd, Mr. Höcke looked every inch the ordinary German politician, besuited and with a white-toothed grin and an unseasonable tan. But what he said went far beyond the norms of German politics.

Germans are “the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital,” he said, a thinly veiled reference to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin. Germans had “the mentality of a totally vanquished people,” he argued, but it was time for the country to re-embrace its history and develop a positive relationship with its identity.

The crowd’s applause shook the floors, a noisy manifestation of how thrilling transgression can feel in a rule-bound society.

“The foundation of being able to move forward is identity,” Mr. Höcke later elaborated in an interview. “There is no people that has given more to humanity than Germany. It is a great and old people, and it would be sad if it were to sink.”

Mr. Höcke is an extreme figure within his own party, and his speech provoked a backlash from AfD’s national leadership. But his message demonstrates how the party has broadened its appeal: by telling Germans they should have a proud national identity, a message that in Germany could come only from the political fringes.

That has resonated with middle-class supporters like Julian Wälder, 21, a law student who had helped to organize the event in Dresden. He said that his journey to the AfD began with his frustration at the identity taboo.

“The definition we have right now of tolerance in the German political landscape is self-deprecating to a degree that it’s actually self-destructive,” Mr. Wälder said. “Everything will be tolerated except for being a German.”

Focusing on identity allows the AfD to present itself as a protector of ordinary people — punching up against the nation’s political elite, rather than attacking vulnerable refugees portrayed by the party as a threat to the nation.

That approach, accusing the elite of stifling debate over German history and culture, could be especially appealing to Germans desperate to restore a sense of control over their country.

“This will be very attractive to people who perceive their own lives as without control,” Professor Fritsche said.

A minority, but influencing the conversation

The AfD, despite its rapid growth, remains a minority party. Its support reached a high of 15 percent according to a survey by Ipsos in late 2016, but slipped to 12 percent in a Feb. 7 poll by the same firm.

But as mainstream parties become more focused on defending against the far-right upstarts, the AfD’s populist agenda is trickling into their policies and messaging — raising the possibility that the party’s political influence could outpace its electoral gains.

Frauke Petry, the party’s national chairwoman, said that the AfD’s ideas were already shaping the national conversation, even if they were not yet able to shape national legislation.

Professor Fritsche’s research suggests that Ms. Petry could be correct, as right-wing parties become more visible. “What would really be dangerous is to have a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in which people feel a likely right-wing shift, and this leads to a perceived norm shift,” he said.

There are signs that is already happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel opened her re-election bid in December by announcing a more populist agenda. She took a harder line on immigration and called for a ban on Islamic veils that cover the full face, saying they “do not belong to us” and should be “forbidden wherever that is legally possible.”

And although she did not name the AfD directly, she expressly tried to reclaim the identity issue, saying that who “the people” are was something for all to decide, “not just a few, no matter how loud they are.”

Mr. Höcke was unmoved by her rightward shift. He called Mrs. Merkel a “chancellor-dictator” who had broken German law by opening the country’s borders to refugees, and he demanded an end to her “regime.”

“We Germans have to be self-aware,” he said in the interview. “We can see our state falling apart; it’s falling apart before our eyes. It’s about survival.”He did. And the party has problems, underscored by its general inability to be as succinct and blunt as Trump is. Even Buttigieg’s alliterative bouquet of nouns lacked the muscle of “Make America great again,” a darkly coded, dopily elementary slogan that nonetheless did the trick.

Have Democrats learned and implemented all the right lessons from Trump’s victory and from the party’s brutal fade during Barack Obama’s presidency? As the race for the D.N.C. chairmanship lurches toward its conclusion later this month and as Democratic lawmakers sweat the smartest strategy against Trump, I wonder. I worry.

The good news is that there’s an outrage among Democrats that’s commensurate with the outrageousness of Trump’s behavior. You saw this at the Women’s March. You see it in the way that protesters storm the town-hall meetings that Republican lawmakers hold in their home districts.

You see it in the unprecedented volume of “no” votes against Trump’s cabinet nominees by Democratic senators, whose opposition reflects a flood of impassioned appeals from constituents. You see it in Elizabeth Warren, who is taking full-throated advantage of the gift that Mitch McConnell handed her last week.

But the bad news — or, rather, the danger — is that this doesn’t automatically translate into successful opposition. It’s no guarantee that Trump will be contained and, after four years at most, forced to live out the balance of his fuming, fibbing days in the lavishly marbled cloisters of Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago.

Yelling has an impact, but it takes you only so far if you don’t choose your battles, marshal your fiercest energy for ones that can yield concrete results, and buckle down to the nitty-gritty of electing legislators who can actually vote against Trump’s worst initiatives in numbers that exceed those of his abettors.

Betsy DeVos has already been confirmed, heaven help us; I’m not sure what good protesters did by blocking her entry into a Washington public school on Friday. It was cathartic, theatrical and less important than blocking any unwise legislation hatched at her bidding. Save the fire for that.

Practicality is crucial. Proportionality, too. When you treat every last tweet of Trump’s as if it’s the botched operation in Yemen, voters lose sight of the botched operation in Yemen.

Trump provokes ire by the minute, but the response needs to be fashioned by the day or even week, lest everything blur. Resistance is a dish best served with discernment. Too much salt and you can’t taste the food itself.

That’s the trap with Trump, and Democrats fell into it during the presidential election, either not realizing how thoroughly he became the reference point for every conversation or not figuring out a way to mitigate that. Opposition to him crowded out support for anything else. Every negative moment came at the expense of a positive one.

“The Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton pretty much communicated what was bad about Trump but failed to communicate what was great about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party,” said Sally Boynton Brown, the executive director of the Democratic Party in Idaho. She, too, is running for the top job at the D.N.C., and we spoke in late January in Houston, the site of another of the candidate forums.

I also caught up there with former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, one of her rivals for the post. “What voters heard from Clinton,” he told me, “was not ‘I feel your pain’ but ‘Vote for me because he’s crazy,’ and that’s not a message.”

By the time of the Houston event, the field of contenders for the D.N.C. chairmanship was up to 10. I sat down with more than half of them, and noticed a contradiction between their rightful worry about focusing too much on Trump and their continued focus on … Trump.

That dynamic was reflected in a recent poll showing that while 41 percent of Democrats were unfamiliar with their party’s Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, only 29 percent were unfamiliar with Trump’s apocalyptic guru, Steve Bannon. Democrats at all levels are clearer on their enemies than on their agenda.

And they’re constantly swerving from vision to process: It’s a tic they can’t control. In Houston I was told that the party needed a more transparent presidential nominating system. And better voter-registration drives. And increased coordination between the D.N.C., the D.C.C.C. and the D.S.C.C. I supped on an alphabet soup.

“We didn’t make house calls,” said Perez.

“We abandoned the 50-state strategy,” said Keith Ellison, a Minnesota congressman also running for the chairmanship.

All of that’s true. But none of it gets at larger challenges that were much less frequently mentioned, if at all: the necessity of grooming and rallying behind candidates who can forge an emotional connection with voters and are in sync with the moment; the imperative of studying the map, identifying every Senate and House seat that could possibly swing to Democrats in 2018 and playing a ruthlessly pragmatic game of chess; the articulation of a down-to-earth, visceral message that resonates with as many voters as possible. “I’m with her” didn’t cut it.

Another of the D.N.C. candidates, Raymond Buckley, the chairman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, acknowledged to me, “Sometimes we try to impress ourselves too much by talking about issues that are overly complex when the populace really wants you to boil it down to a much more simplistic message.”

What might that message be? “Hope and opportunity,” he said. That’s Obama’s old mantra, with “change” swapped out for a word with more syllables.

And what about change? Voters in 2016 made clear their hunger for it, and then the top three Democrats in the House — Nancy Pelosi, 76, Steny Hoyer, 77, and James Clyburn, 76 — stayed put in their positions.

Three weeks after the election, I happened to attend a meeting of Democratic up-and-comers from around the country in Washington. Hoyer addressed them, using his remarks to wander through a dense fog of economic statistics that, he said, proved the superiority of Democrats in managing the American economy. It was the antithesis of a Trump speech, and even his audience of political nerds fidgeted.

Listening to him that night and to the D.N.C. candidates over the following months, I found myself thinking that maybe Democrats didn’t do badly enough in 2016. They routinely remind me and reassure themselves that Clinton won the popular vote and that if you subtract James Comey, Julian Assange and Vladimir Putin, she might have triumphed as well in the Electoral College, where Trump prevailed by just 77,000 votes.

“That’s an operational failure rather than a message failure or a candidate failure,” said Jaime Harrison, the chairman of South Carolina’s Democratic Party and another contender to lead the D.N.C.

But it’s all of the above, because someone as preposterous as Trump should have been too far behind to benefit from tiny margins and lucky breaks. And operational failures alone can’t explain the Democratic disadvantages in the Senate, House, governor’s offices and statehouses.

This is no moment for mere tinkering, and the party can’t afford the internal divisions on display in the D.N.C. race. After Joe Biden endorsed Perez last week, Bernie Sanders, who supports Ellison, shot back, “Do we stay with a failed status quo approach or do we go forward with a fundamental restructuring?”

You don’t wage 2016 all over again. That’s what brought us 2017, a year that — so far — I don’t care to repeat.“No one at the time thought of the consequences of increased nitrogen dioxide emissions from diesel, and the policy of incentivizing diesel was so successful that an awful lot of people bought diesel cars,” said Anna Heslop, a lawyer at ClientEarth, an environmental law firm that last year forced the British government to produce a better plan to improve air quality.

Air pollution is a more significant public health hazard in China, India and Eastern Europe, where the average annual levels of PM2.5 pollution, the fine soot particles and molecules that pose the greatest danger to health, are up to 10 times as high as in London.

But in mid-January in Brixton, the area in south London where Ms. Carey lives, hourly mean levels of PM2.5 were higher than in Beijing. And over just five days in January, Brixton exceeded the European Union’s nitrogen dioxide legal limit for the entire year.

London last month was put on a “very high” pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold air and a stationary weather pattern failed to clear the toxic air caused by diesel traffic, as well as by the high use of open fires, which contribute to about 10 percent of pollutants in winter months.

“The time will come when we’ll start wearing masks like in China,” Ray Hussain, 73, said as he waited for his bus on Brixton Road one recent morning. At nearly any point during the rush, 16 double-decker buses lined the road. Traffic was snarled, and whiffs of acrid air stung the eyes.

Mr. Hussain checked Airvisual, an air pollution tracking app on his smartphone. Brixton’s air quality that day was called “Good,” in green lettering. Just below, Hyderabad, a city in India, had a red “Unhealthy” label and a picture of a person wearing a face mask.

The local authorities are scrambling to defuse what many consider a ticking time bomb for public health.

Some schools are considering handing out gas masks to pupils, saying children’s lungs are in danger of being stunted. More than 440 schools are in areas exceeding legal air quality levels, according to Mayor Sadiq Khan of London.

Earlier this month, London’s Metropolitan Police announced a plan to introduce about 300 environmentally friendly cars, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hybrid electric cars, as part of a fleet overhaul.

On Friday, Mr. Khan, who has adult-onset asthma, announced that in October he would introduce in central London a toxicity charge, a $12-a-day tax for the most polluting vehicles, typically diesel- and gasoline-powered automobiles registered before 2006.Day’s conversation with Woods provided the subtext for subsequent comments at last month’s Tournament of Champions, where Day raised eyebrows by saying he was not interested in speeding up his game.

“I’ve got to get back to what makes me good,” he said. “If that means I have to back off five times, I’m going to back off five times before I have to actually hit the shot.”

Bubba Watson, one of the faster players on the PGA Tour and a good friend of Day’s, said he jokingly told him, “I don’t know how you can go back to your slow ways when you never sped up.”

John Wooden, who coached the U.C.L.A. men’s basketball team to 10 N.C.A.A. titles in a 12-year period beginning in the early 1960s, popularized the mantra, “Be quick, but don’t hurry.” Day said he understood what Wooden meant and took exception to those who equate being deliberate with being slow.

A thesaurus may list the two words as synonyms, but Day does not consider them interchangeable.

“Deliberate is not slow,” Day said. “Being deliberate is being 100 percent in my process of actually hitting the shot. Being slow is getting out of position, and I understand that. If you’re out of position, quicken up. Being deliberate is making sure I don’t miss information that I need to hit the right shot.”

As one of the longer hitters, Day often cannot walk up to his ball and collect all the information he needs to hit the right shot until after the players behind him have hit.

“It’s going to appear that we take maybe a fraction longer,” said Day’s caddie and coach, Colin Swatton.

The rules allow 40 seconds to hit, with an extra 10 seconds given to the player in a group who is the first to hit an approach or a putt, or a tee shot on a par-3 hole.

Last season, when Day won three times and posted top-10 finishes in three of the four majors, he was put on the clock twice but never penalized. At his news conference ahead of this week’s Genesis Open, he said: “I would like to think that everyone in this room would take just a little bit longer if they had a million dollars on their mind. You just can’t get out there and just hit it just because that’s what everyone thinks.”

Day added, “Last year, I felt that I had a lot more peer pressure, and I’m like, ‘I’ve got to speed up play,’ but why would I need to do that when I played such great golf?”

The criticism of Spieth’s pace bothered him enough that he consciously tried to speed up during the second half of the season, occasionally hitting before he felt comfortable over the ball. He was struggling with his swing, which exacerbated the situation.

“I’ve tried to anticipate when I’m hitting this year a bit more, and therefore, just be ready,” Spieth said. “Even if I spend the same amount of time over the ball, I’m at least ahead of the time getting the numbers and getting that kind of, that time, out of the way.”

Jay Monahan, who succeeded Tim Finchem as the PGA Tour’s commissioner on Jan. 1, was one of three amateurs grouped with Spieth in the Wednesday pro-am. Their group played Riviera Country Club’s front nine in a little more than two hours. (Friday’s second round will take two days for most of the field; play was suspended at midday because of high winds and heavy rain.)

The movement to speed up the game is driven by the fear that it will not appeal to today’s youth with their increasingly short attention spans or older golfers with limited free time for recreational pursuits. “Is there a way to take 25 minutes off the average round, and is that necessarily going to make for a better product or presentation?” Monahan asked. “It’s not apparent.”

He noted that events not affected by weather delays or extra holes were being completed within the telecast window, which, like airline flight schedules, is padded to allow for lag time.

“So much of the beauty of what you see week in and week out is what a player faces and how they deal with that,” Monahan added. “Do they change their mannerisms? Do they change their preshot routine? How are they handling that situation?”

Spieth said he was making an effort to become a quicker player. He said he had been put on the clock only once this season, and that was after he lingered at the par-3 16th hole at the Phoenix Open to hand out hats and balls to the crowd gathered there.

“I felt it was better for me to become a quicker player and a more reaction player as long as I put the work in on my swing to be comfortable enough, and that’s kind of where we’ve been this year,” Spieth said. “I feel like I’ve played quicker, and I’ve felt like I’ve been in a better rhythm.”I first visited Massawa in 1993, just after Eritrea formally declared its independence, as Africa bureau chief for Newsweek, then returned three years later, when the media and Western donors were still touting the country as a success story. I hired a dive boat and a guide and for two days explored the pristine reefs of the Dahlak Archipelago, then just beginning to attract tourists.

Two decades later, on a return visit last July, I again ventured to the coast, curious to see how Massawa had fared under Eritrea’s harsh dictatorship, and what was left of the diving industry that, in the 1990s, had seemed poised to grow.

I started my journey in Asmara, the 7,628-foot-high capital, a charming, faded city filled with crumbling Art Deco movie theaters and cappuccino bars that date to Italy’s 50-year colonization of Eritrea. (The British threw out the Italians in 1941.) A permit is needed to visit Massawa, obtainable at a hole-in-the-wall office on Harnet Avenue, Asmara’s main drag. There, I met a guide named Thomas, who was trying to secure permission for a dozen Chinese road engineers.

As we waited for the office to open, he lamented Eritrea’s ravaged economy and the open-ended conscription program. “The prime years of people’s lives are being lost,” he told me. He had used his connections to secure a dead-end posting in a ministry instead of army service, but still dreamed of fleeing. “I think about escaping, every day, but now I realize I missed my chance,” he said, as an official showed up on his moped two hours late and unlocked the door. “It’s too late. The walls have gone up.”

I hired a taxi at a downtown stand, and at 8:30 the next morning, the driver, Zaki, picked me up at my hotel. It was Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, and the streets of this small city were deserted. We drove past the Ethiopian war cemetery, fields of cactus and a herd of camels, and then the Asmara escarpment came into view: a barrier of acacia-speckled mountains that extends almost to the Red Sea. Cyclists clad in red-and-white Lycra worked their way around the hairpin turns; the pop music of Mahmoud Ahmed, an Amharic singer from Ethiopia, blared from Zaki’s CD player. After two hours — and a drop of nearly 8,000 feet — we reached the sandy coastal plain. A quintet of captured Ethiopian tanks marked the entrance to Massawa.

We crossed a causeway and arrived at the Dahlak Hotel, an Italian-owned colossus that decades ago was considered Massawa’s finest. Now it was deserted. The marble-tile staircases, Ottoman-style doorways and palatial salons hinted at the hotel’s 1970s-era grandeur. But my $88-a-night second-floor room — overlooking the bombed-out seaside palace of the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie — had corroding fixtures, a sagging mattress and a broken toilet seat. Entering the saltwater pool, I slipped on the thick layers of algae that covered the steps and nearly lacerated my feet kicking off the barnacle-encrusted wall. The pool floor was a moonscape of ripped up tiles and exposed mud underneath.

Late that afternoon the hotel clerk put me in touch with Abdullah, a grizzled boat captain who spoke some Italian but no English. A friendly English-speaking Eritrean from Asmara who was sitting at the outdoor cafe offered to help me make the deal. The logistics, I quickly learned, had grown complicated. Dahlak Kebir Island, the archipelago’s main attraction, was now off limits to tourists, Abdullah said. Instead he proposed a daylong scuba-diving trip to Dessie Island, not far from Dahlak, for 16,000 nakfas, or $1,020, about five times what I had paid two decades earlier.

“I have no business,” Abdullah explained, pointing to five scuttled dive boats moored across Massawa harbor that had constituted his fleet during better times. “Everything is gone.” Abdullah was open to negotiation, but instead I opted for a half-day snorkeling and beach trip around Green Island, just beyond the harbor. The cost was a far more reasonable $200.

The next morning, with the temperature pushing 95 degrees, I met Abdullah on the dock. Two Eritreans to whom I had been introduced the day before — Lydia, my taxi driver Zaki’s sister, and her boyfriend, Berhane, a Massawa-born émigré living in Norway who returns home several times a year — joined me for the adventure. They had packed an ice chest with cold Asmara beers, which we loaded onto the skiff.

As we puttered past the loading docks and cranes of the silent port, Berhane added his voice to the many others I had heard lamenting the country’s collapse. “There are no enterprises and no construction. The government makes it impossible for you, so what else can you do but leave?” he told me. Ten of his 12 siblings had fled abroad. “For many, drowning in the sea is a better option them staying here.” Yet Massawa was his home, he said, and Lydia lived here with her two young sons — and so he felt obliged to return.

Ten minutes after leaving the pier, Abdullah cast the anchor overboard. I strapped on my mask, snorkel and fins, and leapt off the boat. Instantly the harsh realities of Eritrea dissolved in a swirl of color and motion. The water was warm and clear, and I hovered above an extensive coral garden — a “Finding Nemo” tableau. Long-beaked parrotfish, big-eyed squirrelfish, translucent blue disc-shaped surgeonfish, and huge angelfish in a dozen patterns nibbled on brightly colored coral and darted through sea anemones. Schools of tetras and black mollies swept past. I chased a blue-spotted stingray, keeping a safe distance, until it darted beneath a rock, only its poisonous spine protruding from its sanctuary. After an hour spent exploring several of these coral gardens, I climbed back aboard the boat, and we headed toward Green Island. The Asmara escarpment — barren and dun colored — rose just beyond the shore. I walked along a beach alive with hermit crabs. The entire beach seemed to be in motion, tiny white conch shells skittering across the sand.

At dusk that evening I walked by myself down a causeway into Massawa’s Old City. I had been here 20 years before, and remembered jostling with crowds in a square filled with fish restaurants and outdoor tables. Now, wandering down deserted alleys, past mosques and crumbling archways, I searched in vain for the square. Two young couples sat on stools in the dirt courtyard of a private home. One of the women, who spoke some English, invited me to join them. I asked where all the people had gone. “They have all left — for Europe,” she replied. “Do you want to go, too?” I asked. “The boys do, because they are both in the army, but I don’t know,” she said.

She directed me to one of a handful of restaurants still open: Salam, on a dirt square opposite a liquor shop that was illuminated by a string of orange lights for Eid al-Fitr. Two Eritrean diaspora families visiting from the United States — 20 in each group — sat at tables in front.

I ordered the sea bass, and it came quickly to my table, butterflied and grilled with paprika, served with flaky and charred flat bread. It was crisp, spicy and utterly delicious. I paid the bill and walked through the now-darkened streets, past splashes of light from a couple of grocery stores. Then I reached the causeway, and followed a set of abandoned railway tracks back to the Dahlak Hotel.

Kygo feat. Selena Gomez, ‘It Ain’t Me’

Don’t be deceived by the modest, folky guitar picking that opens this regretful but righteous kiss-off. The crescendo and dance-floor thump arrive soon, as Selena Gomez chides an ex who was drinking and partying too often (insert tabloid speculation here). “Who’s waking up to drive you home/when you’re drunk and all alone?” she sings, with choir-like reinforcements. “It ain’t me.” Kygo’s production isn’t overbearing; sometimes a fingersnap is louder than the kick drum. Nor is it repetitive. Guitars and pianos swirl in and out, and Ms. Gomez’s vocals are chopped up to join the percussion, flinging well-chosen syllables — a recurring “whiskey neat” — at the offending ex. JON PARELES

Fat Joe and Remy Ma feat. Kent Jones, ‘Swear to God’

In a post ricocheting around Twitter yesterday, @DashRomero put up four closed-captioned stills of a video interview given by the rapper couple Papoose and Remy Ma. Papoose is talking about first impressions: “She was like rude to everybody in the room. And I was like oh, I really like her.”

This pugnacity was key to Remy Ma’s appeal as a member of the Terror Squad (see her star turn on the remix of M.O.P.’s “Ante Up”) up until her arrest in 2007 on assault and weapons charges, and her subsequent prison term, which ended in 2014.

Thanks to “All the Way Up,” her hit with former Terror Squad macher Fat Joe, Remy Ma is more in the spotlight than ever. The two have just released a solid collaborative album, “Plata o Plomo,” on which she handily out-raps her partner on every track, and on “Dreamin,” the album finale, she talks about how prison didn’t calm her down, it made her more aggressive. That she still packs punch is clearest on “Swear to God,” one sock to the jaw after another, but with whimsical wordplay that shows off just how light her heavy burdens are:

Say something, said something or mentioned my name, ho

Put a bullet in the brain of the mane on your Polo

You could get this work for free, it’s pro bono

I put funds on your bundles, mad dough on your Afro

Guap on your top, green on your bean

Dubs on your mug, a new bag on your do-rag

JON CARAMANICA

Romeo Santos, ‘Héroe Favorito’

The new Romeo Santos single is bachata in its most schlocky, high-gloss form, with fits of smooth jazz mixed in for bad measure, not that it matters. His voice is as piercing as ever, with vowels fired off like tiny firecrackers. It’s sweet enough to render a song about all the superheroes you wish you could become to win over the woman you crave something more than a gimmick. Mr. Santos is also at the absurdist stage of his celebrity, when all that is left is to turn a song about wishing one were a superhero in the eyes of the woman you crave into a video in which you become a superhero — several different ones, as a matter of fact — with the power to sweep your intended off her feet, and also crawl down the outside of her building to grab a kiss. J.C.

Mary. J. Blige, ‘U + Me (Love Lesson)’

There’s blame for everyone in “U + Me (Love Lesson),” Mary J. Blige’s latest exercise in surviving love gone wrong. “Must have been crazy to think that you loved me/I saw all the signs,” she declares. In lines that tumble out so quickly they sometimes overlap, she calls out her own self-deceptions and fears of being alone as well as her ex’s lies and obliviousness. The beat is slow but the arrangement builds nervous energy with quick percussion, insistent strings and backing voices appearing from all directions. Ms. Blige, of course, will get through: “Gotta keep on pushing/And love myself through the hard times,” she resolves. J.P.

Blac Youngsta feat. Lil Yachty, ‘Hip Hopper’

For a long time, proclaiming “I’m not a rapper” was one of the most effective rap boasts possible. It implied that rapping was art, a day job, an inconvenience — the real money was being made elsewhere. The recent generation-and-age-gap Cold War essentially boils down to those who wish their rappers identified as such vs. rappers who feel no need to do so. This track by Blac Youngsta and the bête noire of traditionalists, Lil Yachty, is comic and relentless. Both are rapping well, but neither dwells on it, especially Blac Youngsta, owner of one of the most free-spirited social media presences in hip-hop who raps like he might bust out giggling at any moment. J.C.

Linkin Park feat. Kiiara, ‘Heavy’

This is an Owl City song. C’mon, Linkin Park. Circa 2000 Linkin Park would stuff this song in a locker — and circa 2000 Linkin Park was already stuffed in the locker. J.C.

Oumou Sangare, ‘Yere Faga’

Oumou Sangare emerged as a force in traditional-style Malian music, bringing the style of her home region, Wassoulou, to national and then international renown. She also took on the age-old role of the West African singer as a societal memory conscience, offering virtuous advice. Then she started collaborating with musicians worldwide, transporting the sound of Wassoulou along multiple avenues of funk. “Yere Faga” gently but urgently counsels against suicide using a groove from the great Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, in an ancient-future mix: traditional balafons (marimbas), hearty call-and-response vocals and clouds of sustained female voices, deep bass lines and jabs of guitar noise, making the song at once rooted and unearthly. J.P.

Thundercat, ‘Friend Zone’

Funk redeems frustration in “Friend Zone,” a droll complaint from a guy who’d rather play Mortal Kombat than field another Platonic heart-to-heart late-night phone call from his unrequited crush. “The next time you call me I’m gonna sit and stare at the screen/Waiting for the call to end.” A squishy P-Funk groove, electropop arpeggios, slippery polytonal harmonies and vocals in an aggrieved-nerd falsetto add up to a song that’s funny with a grudge. J.P.

Omar Sosa and Seckou Keita, ‘Dary’

This crystalline, shimmering instrumental, at once animated and serene, comes from an international coalition: the Cuban pianist Omar Sosa, the Senegalese kora player Seckou Keita and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. (“Transparent Water,” the album it comes from, will be released next week; it also includes guests from China and Japan.) The harmonies are soothing, consonant major chords; Mr. Sosa and Mr. Keita take turns offering patterns to underpin one another’s solos. And Mr. Ovalles, on a sensitively changing series of instruments, pinpoints every shift of syncopation as the three players move through kaleidoscopic permutations of what a six-beat rhythm can do. J.P.

Dawes, ‘Roll With the Punches’

The patiently chugging roots-rock of “Roll With the Punches” is the sound of sorrow turning to numb pragmatism. It’s a song about coping with both the material and emotional aftermath of a breakup. Taylor Goldsmith, Dawes’ songwriter and singer, deploys vocabulary with precision, building verses around “symmetrical,” “collateral,” “negotiable” and other four-syllable words. “The separation was logistical/deciding what belongs to whom/how dying love manifests in a rug or a chest/the decorations of a room,” Taylor Goldsmith sings. The video has a rueful, Solomonic conceit: the way that many objects, divided precisely in half, become useless. J.P.And so has Teresa, Fran’s childhood friend, now painfully dying from asbestos poisoning. Teresa possesses what Fran does not: her Roman Catholic belief — yet what is the spiritual meaning of having stuck a thumbtack into a wall, thereby releasing its lethal fibers? Reunited after a separation of decades, Fran and Teresa remember how, as precocious little girls, they had talked of the evils of the world and whether or not God existed. Teresa for many years has been devoted to the needs of children in peril, but now, dependent on morphine for relief, she no longer leaves the precincts of her couch. She too, despite the promise of faith, is terminally housed.

What sort of house shall I die in? is Drabble’s unyielding question. Its veneer is serviceable — lever rather than screw — but its intent is not. Its intent is scriptural, invoking Ecclesiastes; or Socratic, wooing the examined life; or both at once. Whatever the domicile, the query is the same: the transcendent nature of human purpose, and how it will reveal itself. Poppet, Fran’s oddly austere daughter, is possessed by such a purpose. Impassioned by ecological guardianship, she resides on a flood plain in a solitary little cottage close to a canal, following on her computer the condition of ice caps, coal emissions, quake tremors, pollution in Mongolia. She lives in expectation of inundation.

Christopher, her brother, is far more sociable and worldly, yet unanchored and adrift. His career as co-producer of a television arts program, once promising, is now stalled, partly on his own account, but mainly because of the sudden death of Sara, with whom he had been collaborating on a human rights mission. Not unlike Poppet, Sara is stirred to the marrow by the fearful displacements of inundation. She hopes to produce a documentary that will expose the travail of the human flood of migrants from Africa — oppressed, unhoused, destitute — who are washing up on the several coasts of the Canary Islands, halfway between the continents. And there, on Lanzarote, a sunny volcanic outcropping where elderly British retirees are not uncommon, Sara, in the glory of her confident youth and with her lover looking on, eats a joyful dinner of limpets. But mortality is no respecter even of the young. A fatal deluge of cancerous cells has already condemned her, and soon after, in the wake of an emergency flight to England, she will quickly succumb.

Bereft, the documentary scheme now defunct, Christopher is taken up by Bennett and Ivor, a gay couple who have long been resident on the island. Indulgent, sybaritic, tourist-crowded Lanzarote is nothing like Fran’s damp and dour England, with its mundane social conscience. Bennett has settled here for the mild weather and its benefit to his declining health. And more: for the sake of a house “almost unnaturally beautiful,” ideal for a man “who struggled for breath climbing stairs, . . . complete with pool, sun terrace, a well-planted euphorbia garden of many colors, a fish pool, a tennis court” and an unstinting view of the sea. He is favored as a local celebrity — a cultural historian, author of a number of original studies, lately drawn to art history. Even now he has his work. The handsome and much younger Ivor has none, except to look after Bennett, and to worry over his own accelerating wrinkles. At 17, strikingly golden-haired, he was “a pinup boy, a collector’s item,” collected by Bennett and dependent on him ever since. They are both aging, but Bennett is frail, susceptible to dangerous missteps. One day, cautious as always, he slips or trips on the familiar grounds of his beautiful house, while far away on her flood plain Poppet notes a slight volcanic tremor in the Canaries. Ivor, practiced in melancholy wisdom, accepts that he must return to England when Bennett dies. And when we last catch sight of him, a helper in a West Country monastic care home is pushing Ivor’s wheelchair.

Drabble has Fran tot it all up, not omitting the worst: Evolving models of residential care . . . infinitely clever and complex and inhumane delays and devices we create to avoid and deny death, to avoid fulfilling our destiny and arriving at our destination. . . . We arrive there . . . senseless, incontinent, demented, medicated into amnesia, aphasia, indignity. In the end, when the dark flood rises to cover these evolving models, however helpfully they have been updated (lever not screw, sun terrace and pool), their old people are anyhow all drowned.

“The Dark Flood Rises” (the title is taken from a poem by D.H. Lawrence) is not a therapeutic, eschatological, sociological, political or even philosophical novel. Never mind that it can be mistaken for any or all of these. In one way, it is a hymn to an inherited England, to its highways, gardens, streets, hotels, neighborhoods, landscapes, parking lots, stoneworks, cottages, secluded and public spaces. Fran is “in love with England, with the length and breadth of England. . . . She wants to see it all before she dies.”

But this humane and masterly novel by one of Britain’s most dazzling writers is something else as well, deeper than mere philosophy: a praisesong for the tragical human predicament exactly as it has been ordained on Earth, our terminal house.Several people at the conference instantly took note on Twitter of Ms. Von der Leyen’s phrasing, including Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

Vice President Mike Pence, who arrived in Munich on Friday night; Mr. Mattis; Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, a few miles up the road in Bonn — have all spent much of the week soothing European ears, presenting traditional Republican national security orthodoxy of confronting Russia, supporting NATO and backing democratic institutions.

But every time they seemed to be getting traction in convincing skittish diplomats that Mr. Trump was not about to abandon decades of American national security policy, their boss did something in Washington that undercut their work.

The result has been confusion among global leaders about whom to believe when it comes to the direction of American national security.

The reassuring message Mr. Trump’s subordinates have sought to convey has been further undermined by some of his own Republican critics.

Senator John McCain, whose disdain for Mr. Trump is well known, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the Munich conference that Michael T. Flynn’s resignation as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser over his Russia liaisons was “something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do.”

The contradictions have abounded. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed to abandon a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, asserting that he was not committed to a two-state solution. Twenty-four hours later, his United Nations envoy said, “We absolutely support a two-state solution,” adding that the administration simply wanted a “thinking out of the box” approach about resolving one of the world’s intractable conflicts.

The same day that Mr. Trump questioned the two-state approach, Mr. Mattis was at NATO headquarters telling allies that the commitment of the United States to NATO remained firm. But Mr. Mattis also echoed his boss when he warned that the United States might “moderate” its support if other member countries did not spend more on the military.

The next day, still at NATO, Mr. Mattis was back to saying that the American commitment to NATO was unshakable. He said the Trump administration’s “commitment to Article 5 remains solid,” referring to NATO’s principle that an attack on one is an attack on all.

European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief again, until Mr. Trump held a prolonged and chaotic news conference a few hours later in Washington.

“Let’s put it this way, the discrepancy between the president’s news conference and the way his cabinet is trying to reassure Europeans couldn’t be wider,” said Michael Werz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who was at the Munich conference.

Volker Perthes, the head of SWP, a policy research group based in Germany, said: “Mattis speaks of ‘defending the rules-based international order.’ I hope he can explain this to his boss.”

What appeared to rattle people the most about Mr. Trump’s news conference on Thursday were his attacks on members of the news media assembled before him. Several diplomats said they worried that Mr. Trump was trying to discredit a tenet of American democracy — a free press — and in so doing, might embolden despots around the world into further challenges to freedom of the press.

Struggling to explain how to assess the seeming chaos coming out of Washington, Michael Fallon, Britain’s defense minister, told reporters, “You know, new administrations, you know, can take time to settle down.”

In the crowded lounges and refined tearooms of Munich’s Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where leaders and top officials were mingling, much of the talk on Friday was not about the panels on issues like “the future of the European Union: united or divided,” or “the future of the West: downfall or comeback?”

Instead, it was about Mr. Trump’s Thursday news conference, which appeared to deeply unnerve a number of officials. Overheard conversations included one in which one European official said that the United States was now on the list of “risk factors” for Europe, echoing a concern expressed two weeks earlier by Donald Tusk, head of the European Council. German officials joked that American diplomats and civil service organizations could now qualify for German democracy funding — money designated for countries with struggling democratic institutions.

Several people seemed on edge awaiting what Mr. Mattis would say when he addressed the conference. When he finally approached the lectern, he sounded exactly like numerous other American chiefs who have preceded him.

“The trans-Atlantic bond remains our strongest bulwark against instability and violence,” he said. “I am confident that we will strengthen our partnerships, confronting those who choose to attack innocent people or our democratic processes and freedoms.”

Mr. Mattis, Mr. Nasr said after the speech, “is the one island of stability.” But, he added, “the key is that nobody knows the extent of his influence. Right now, we’re tight with trans-Atlantic unity, but who knows what to believe?”

Ms. Von der Leyen, the German defense minister, used her time at the lectern before Mr. Mattis spoke to deliver a warning to the Trump administration about putting cooperation with Russia ahead of its alliances in Europe — or even on the same footing for that matter.

“Our American friends know well that your tone on Europe and NATO has a direct impact on the cohesion of our continent,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “There cannot be a policy of equidistance to allies and to those who openly question our values, our borders and international law.”

Ms. Von der Leyen also criticized Mr. Trump’s efforts to close American borders to refugees from around the world and suspend immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. (Those efforts have been blocked by American courts.)

“We should be careful that this fight does not become a front against Islam and Muslims,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “Otherwise, we run the risk of digging ourselves into a deeper grave in which violence and terror only grow further.”Photo

I like a good prune. I mean, when it’s soft and sweaty like a candy bar on a hot day. When it’s a sinister Disney-villain shade of brownish purple, and it tastes of nothing but honey and caramel, what’s not to like? It’s the word that no one likes, the word that indicates, to so many Americans, constipated octogenarians praying on spoonfuls of paste.

I don’t blame the California Prune Board for its rebranding efforts. In the early 2000s, it officially changed its name to the California Dried Plum Board, hoping to avoid the association entirely. “We thought maybe the stigma was too much of a challenge for us to overcome,” Donn Zea, the board’s director, told me. And “dried plum” was an accurate description: “It’s a plum. It grows on a tree. We dry them.”

Most of America’s prune-producing plum trees grow in California, in the Sacramento Valley, not too far from where they were first planted in 1856. That’s when Pierre Pellier came back to California from a trip to France with cuttings of la petite pruneau d’Agen, the plum tree requested by his brother Louis Pellier, who’d failed to make much money during the Gold Rush. The plants had been stuck in potatoes to keep them moist, ready to grow, and they thrived in what is now Silicon Valley.

Plums are harvested in August, when the fruit is soft enough, and laid out on wooden trays, where they’re dehydrated for about 18 hours in tunnel dryers. In that time, the fruit’s sugar and flavor are slowly, deeply concentrated, until it’s an inky, wrinkled violet, left with only about 20 percent of its moisture. The fruit may be rehydrated industrially with steam, or at home in hot water or tea. It may be revived and plumped, juiced or processed, but there’s no going back to what it was: It’s a prune now, and it’s delicious.

“Why don’t Americans like prunes?” I asked around. But almost every person I asked told me that this was the wrong question to be asking, or that they were the wrong person to be answering it, because they really did like prunes. And the more I investigated, the more prune lovers I found.

Jessica Koslow, the chef and owner of Sqirl in Los Angeles, told me she’d tasted hummus on a recent trip to Krakow, Poland, topped with smoked prunes that were almost meaty. And now she’d been smoking prunes herself, using the chopped fruit as a cookie mix-in. Liz Prueitt, the pastry chef and owner of San Francisco’s Tartine Manufactory, was serving them warm, in a puddle of good whiskey, under softly whipped cream. On the bus, I spent a long time staring at the photo she posted of the dish on Instagram: The prunes were black and glossy. They made me want to rush back home and bake something.

In most parts of the world, including the small town east of Paris where I lived as a kid, prunes were never a punch line. Good prunes were considered a serious craft, a worthy, occasional expense, a perfectly conventional thing to love. They’d be simmered with game, whipped into a boozy mousse or slipped into baggies to eat as a snack. They’d disintegrate into a lamb tagine, or be sliced almost all the way open and filled with cold foie-gras terrine on New Year’s Eve. But my favorite way to have prunes was in a tart full of frangipane, the sweet, buttery almond cream that goes very nearly chewy when it cools.

Plum trees generally bloom in March, and every tiny flower on their branches is a promise of fruit — a nice fat prune in the making. But last year, plum growers in California noticed weird weather around bloom season. And what with the thunderstorms, hail and high winds, a lot of bees decided they were better off staying inside where it was warm, putting off the work of pollinating the trees. The crop turned out to be just half the size of what it was the year before, and one of the smallest recorded in a hundred years.

When I inquired about this, Zea assured me that it wasn’t as devastating as it sounded, that there were plenty of prunes from the previous season and that we wouldn’t be experiencing any kind of prune crisis. Still, I didn’t want to waste any more time: I rushed home to bake something.

Recipe: Frangipane-Prune TartYou might think this portrayal would have even more impact than it did two decades ago. The United States of 2017, in case you hadn’t noticed, is in a highly apprehensive mood, with the “N” word — “Nazi” — being invoked with alarmed abandon.

Yet while it provides plenty of bitter food for thought, “Talk House” never achieves the dramatic power of “The Designated Mourner.” That’s partly a matter of form. “Mourner” was written as a series of monologues, in which the title character exposes, by self-flagellating degrees, his own craven passivity and complicity in a corrupt world. By the end, you felt you had crawled right under his skin, and it wasn’t anywhere you wanted to admit to having been.

“Talk House” is a group portrait, which allows its audiences to sustain a greater distance and to discern more clearly the play’s polemical machinery. The grim, all-implicating ironies feel easier and less personal to us. This despite a staging by Mr. Elliott (with a comfy, clubby set by Derek McLane) that suggests that we, too, are members of this club.

On arriving, theatergoers are offered mysteriously colored drinks and sugary snacks, proffered on silver platters by servers whom you’ve seen probably seen before, and not waiting tables. One of them is Jill Eikenberry (remember “L.A. Law”?) and the other is Annapurna Sriram, who was so piquant in the New Group production of Jesse Eisenberg’s “The Spoils.”

The schmoozers who mingle among the audience include Mr. Shawn (sporting facial bruises, pajamas and a tweed jacket), Mr. Broderick, John Epperson (best known as the creator of the chanteuse Lypsinka), Larry Pine, Claudia Shear and Michael Tucker. They encourage us to keep talking right until the lights go down.

Except the lights never do go down entirely. We remain exposed and, it is implied, a part of the creepy conversation.

Mr. Broderick is our guide to the time, place and people of “Talk House,” though his slippery character would probably prefer that we not attribute any such responsibility to him. That’s Robert, a writer whose fantasy historical drama “Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars” opened exactly 10 years earlier. Hence the reunion in its participants’ former boîte of choice, the no longer fashionable Talk House.

“Midnight” seems to have been the last play by Robert, who now writes a television comedy starring the dashing Tom (the dashing Mr. Pine). It also seems to have been one of the last plays to have been performed, period. Theater is now an all but vanished art, which leaves many of its former practitioners in need of a job.

I won’t go into detail about what those forms of employment turn out to be. Suffice it to say that unspeakable crimes against humanity (against “people who would like to harm us”) are described as if they were temporary telemarketing gigs.

Those who have managed to stay in what’s left of showbiz — Robert, Tom and Bill (Mr. Tucker), a producer — profess to know little of such activities. Should we believe them? As Robert muses in his opening monologue, “To ‘know someone well’ — I mean, that’s a phrase from another time.”

That’s a resonant thought for a dystopian tomorrow. (Or a dystopian yesterday: I found myself thinking of show business in the McCarthy era.) And Mr. Shawn, a writer of acerbic eloquence, comes up with other descriptions that have the antiseptic chill of iced vodka. Here’s Robert on the mood swings of his country’s capricious (and evidently all-powerful) leader: “How do these personal traits translate into nationwide happiness or unhappiness, or do they?”

The insiderly conflation of theater-world superficiality and the depths of institutionalized evil can feel forced and gimmicky, though. And the ensemble hasn’t yet fallen into the natural common groove that might mitigate that impression.

Of the supporting players, Ms. Shear (of “Dirty Blonde”) stands out as a fraying embodiment of the defensive desperation to which much of her world has been reduced. Ms. Sriram, on the other hand, seems a bit too fresh to credibly deliver the climactic confessions of her damaged character.

Mr. Shawn is as good a resentful, hapless victim as he was a resentful, hapless victimizer in “The Designated Mourner.” And Mr. Broderick, whose default acting mode of sly timidity has seldom been better used, is first-rate. His soft-spoken, side-glancing, tentatively smiling Robert is a natural-born survivor. Of course, in the world of “Talk House,” that’s a dubious honor.Photo

George Steele, a gruff, green-tongued fighter who, as the Animal, was one of wrestling’s wildest and most-hated villains for almost two decades, has died, World Wrestling Entertainment, the professional wrestling organization, said on Friday. He was 79.

The organization announced his death without specifying the cause, time or location. Eric Simms, a wrestling agent, said in a social media post Thursday that he had spoken to Mr. Steele’s wife, who said Mr. Steele had been in a hospice.

Mr. Steele, whose real name was William James Myers, was born in Madison Heights, Mich., on April 16, 1937, according to “WWE Legends,” a book by Brian Solomon. He gained fame in the 1970s and ’80s as the Animal, a hairy, grunting brute of few words. But he had little in common with that persona outside the ring.

Mr. Steele, who had dyslexia, earned a master’s degree from Central Michigan University and went on to teach high school in the Detroit area, where he moonlighted in sports-entertainment promotions, according to World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation. Mr. Steele, who is in the organization’s Hall of Fame, started appearing in W.W.F. in 1967, when he launched into a bitter rivalry with the champion Bruno Sammartino.

Mr. Steele was known for his unpredictable behavior and a signature habit of stuffing his mouth with the inner padding of the turnbuckles located at the corners of the ring.

He was a protégé of several wrestlers who subsequently became members of the WWE Hall of Fame, including Harry Fujiwara, also known as Mr. Fuji, who died last summer, and flirted many times with winning the organization’s championship.

In 1985, his career shifted course, according to WWE. Mr. Steele went from being among the most reviled figures in wrestling to one of its most loved, when, after being abandoned during a six-man match by his partners, he wound up under the guidance of the then-popular Capt. Lou Albano.

Throughout much of his career, he continued to teach high school and coach football in Madison Heights, Mich., where he would return for Monday practices after weekend appearances at Madison Square Garden.

He retired from wrestling in the late 1980s after learning that he had Crohn’s disease and devoted much of his life after that to motivational speaking, spiritual testimony and promoting awareness of the disease. He later resettled in Cocoa Beach, Fla.

Mr. Steele was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Michigan High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1996, which noted in an online profile that Mr. Steele coached wrestling, football and track for 28 years.

Information on his survivors was not immediately available.

Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, described Mr. Steele on Twitter as a kind man.

“George Steele was only an animal in the ring,” he said. “He was one of the truly nice men in the world.”“The fact that in all the 11 championships I’ve never been asked this question says something about where we are” as a country, Mr. Auriemma said. “Forget the answer. The fact that I’ve never been asked means there’s something going on that isn’t normal.”

UConn has won 100 consecutive games since 2014. And while the Huskies are not a lock to win a 12th title, they are favored again to cut down the nets in triumph at the Final Four in Dallas. Now coaches, current players and the team’s former stars are wrestling with the issue of whether UConn should visit the White House in celebration.

The Huskies’ players are amateurs, some still teenagers, not professionals with agents, union protection and multimillion-dollar contracts. They have kept up with the current political situation, and the responses by other athletes, through social media and classroom discussions. Their own reactions were nuanced and considered.

Even before Mr. Trump was elected, UConn players jokingly told one another, “We’re not going if he wins,” the sophomore forward Napheesa Collier said. “Now that it’s actually happened, if we win, I don’t know what everyone’s going to do.”

Ms. Stewart and Maya Moore, another former UConn star, said they expected that whatever decision the team made, it would be done collectively. Gabby Williams, a junior forward, agreed.

“That’s just what we’ve built here,” Ms. Williams, the team’s most complete player, said. “We don’t have guys that do their own thing. Whatever we do, it’ll be a unified decision.”

If some players did not want to attend a White House celebration, Ms. Collier said, “I really don’t know what I would do in that position; I guess we have to get there first.”

Mr. Auriemma, who will turn 63 during the N.C.A.A. tournament, said the dilemma for him was reconciling respect for the office of the presidency with the possibility that some players might object to meeting Mr. Trump, feeling unwelcome at the White House because of the president’s statements and positions on women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims.

“If we’re fortunate enough to win it, and your players walk in and go, ‘Listen, I’m not going,’ we’ve never had to deal with that before,” Mr. Auriemma said.

“What are you going to do as a coach?” he continued. “It’s not like I can look it up and go, ‘What did other people do?’ We’re in a world that very few of us could have conceived five years ago.”

What would he do?

“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s a good question.”

There is no pressing need for an answer now, he understands, no need to cross a point of no return. The national championship game is not until April 2, and there is no guarantee that UConn will be playing or winning.

“I’m not crossing the Rubicon,” Mr. Auriemma said. “That’s Caesar. Once your army crosses that river, you are an enemy of the state.”

Mr. Auriemma is no supporter of Mr. Trump. He made that clear last summer in Rio de Janeiro while coaching the American women’s team to a second consecutive Olympic gold medal under him and sixth in a row over all. Asked whether dominance by the United States was good for women’s basketball, he told reporters, “We live in that Trumpian era where it’s O.K. to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they’re the opposite sex.”

He later expressed shock that Mr. Trump had been elected president.

But Mr. Auriemma is also the most visible representative of Connecticut’s flagship public university. And he has lived a classic immigrant success story, having been born in Italy and then moving to suburban Philadelphia as a boy, winning a record number of N.C.A.A. basketball titles and becoming wealthy in the process. He speaks reverently of the presidency as a symbol of “the most that this country can represent.”

He tells of his mother, Marsiella, being overcome with tears when she shook hands and took a photograph with President Obama. And how boosters accompanying the team have variously complained about the policies of President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Obama on trips to Washington, yet “once they get down there, he puts his hand out and he says, ‘Welcome to the White House,’ and they just melt.”

“Because it’s the president of the United States,” he said.

One should not easily dismiss an opportunity to meet any president, Mr. Auriemma said. “In order to do that,” he said, “you’ve got to have some pretty strong convictions. And we’ve got some pretty socially activist players on our team.”

Sue Bird, the former UConn point guard who won two N.C.A.A. titles and two of her four Olympic gold medals while playing for Mr. Auriemma, said that if some players felt unwelcome at the White House, he would surely take that into consideration.

“I think he’s somebody that understands where he is in this world and what he represents and the platform he has,” Ms. Bird said. “And I don’t think he’s shy about speaking out on his feelings. And with that, I wouldn’t be surprised, to be honest, if they didn’t go.”

Ms. Bird stressed that she was speaking about her own observations, not about any impression that Mr. Auriemma had directly given her. Any decision, she said, would be a “tough call” and would be made by the coach with the intent of protecting his players.

“Because, in reality, they’re kids,” Ms. Bird said. “So it’s hard to know what to do.”

The Huskies are a diverse team ethnically and culturally, and as with any team, there are varied political opinions, players said.

“I don’t think the entire team wouldn’t go,” said Kia Nurse, a junior guard from Hamilton, Ontario. “It would be an interesting thing.”

Forward Batouly Camara, a native of Manhattan and a transfer from Kentucky who is practicing with UConn but not playing this season, is a Muslim whose parents immigrated from the West African nation Guinea.

Her mother, who holds dual citizenship, has been reluctant to travel back to Guinea, where she runs an orphanage, Ms. Camara said, even though Mr. Trump’s travel ban does not target the country. But she added, “I don’t feel anything harsh or anything at all” toward the president.

Ms. Camara said she had received “an overwhelming amount of support” from teammates, coaches and others in the UConn community, for which she was grateful.

She said she expected the team to stick together in making a decision about the White House. “If we decided to go and do something there,” Ms. Camara said, “that could be a platform for us.”

The family of Ms. Collier, the sophomore forward, has a history of political involvement. Her paternal grandfather, Gershon Collier, was a diplomat in the West African nation Sierra Leone who helped secure the country’s independence from Britain in 1961. He later became its ambassador to the United States and chief justice.

“I think it’s a really touchy subject,” Ms. Collier said of a potential visit to the White House. “For me, personally, I don’t really support Trump, but I would still go out of respect for my team. But I don’t know how everybody else feels about it.”

She added, “We kind of try to stay away from politics a little bit, especially because it’s getting so heated.”

Ms. Williams, UConn’s best player, said her personal view would be to visit the White House.

“It shows, despite my feelings, or anyone’s feelings, that’s just kind of the respectful thing to do,” she said, adding that it “kind of makes you look like the bigger person, too.”

But, she said, “to each his own, and people are free to make their own decisions.”Photo

Snarling digital monsters, a glowering Matt Damon and battalions of unfaltering Chinese warriors mix it up in “The Great Wall,” a painless, overstuffed spectacle that works overtime as a testament to China’s might. Set once upon a time, the movie spins a legend that never was: Every 60 years, slavering creatures emerge from beyond to sharpen their teeth on human bones and stuff their bellies on meat. The whole thing plays out as if it had been thought up by someone who, while watching “Game of Thrones” and smoking a bowl, started riffing on walls, China and production money.

Video

The threadbare story turns on a swaggering mercenary, William (Mr. Damon), who’s trying to find what he calls “black powder,” a.k.a. gunpowder. He and a sidekick, Tovar (Pedro Pascal, from “Game of Thrones”), end up at the Great Wall, where after some macho posturing and chest thumping, they join forces with the wall’s guardians, including an English-speaking military genius, Lin Mae (Jing Tian); an adviser, Wang (Andy Lau); and an assortment of supporting glowerers (Hanyu Zhang, Eddie Peng Yu-Yen and Ling Gengxin). Willem Dafoe, the whites of his eyes shining, is there, too, slinking around as Ballard, a Western prisoner who long ago also sought the black powder.

That’s about it, plus striking locations (the Rainbow Mountains), digital wizardry and battles between hordes of critters (called Tao Tei) and legions of soldiers. These are distinguished by skill and hue, like the blue-clad Crane Corp, who bungee-jump off the wall with spears. Outside of the bromantic quipping between William and Tovar, the dialogue is aggressively simple (no frills, no poetry) and skews along the lines of “Release the Kraken” or, in this case, bring out the flaming balls of death and so forth. This seems to suit the director, Zhang Yimou (“Hero”), who lavishes much of his attention on the wall, which amusingly suggests a giant Swiss Army knife, scissors included.

Video

Mr. Damon, wearing hair extensions and employing an on-and-off Irish accent, looks uncharacteristically ill at ease during much of this. He may be the headliner, but he’s also just one of this movie’s many, many whirring parts. “The Great Wall” flirts with romance and bleats out a little propagandistic blather about the benefits of bilateral action, but the focus throughout remains on multitudes of shifting, surging bodies — human and beast, digital and not — that, as they ebb and flow, resemble a Chinese military pageant and a lavish Busby Berkeley number. At times the effect brings to mind the German theorist Siegfried Kracauer’s ideas about Berkeley-like revues or, as he wrote in 1927, “indissoluble girl clusters whose movements are demonstrations of mathematics.”

In such formations, bodies are abstracted into larger geometric shapes and people transform into a collective mass ornament. This transformation obviously takes on sinister meaning when such formations are adapted for, say, Nazi propaganda, as demonstrated in the film “ Triumph of the Will.”

In “The Great Wall,” though, the bodies are divided into two distinct, oppositional configurations: the raw and the cooked. On the one side are the monsters that — despite being nicely designed zeros and ones — suggest a wildness that cannot be denied. On the other are the meticulously choreographed warriors, who never seem less human than when joined together.Everything about Trump that appalls 65 percent of America strengthens him with the other 35 percent, and he can ride that group for a while. Even after these horrible four weeks, Republicans on Capitol Hill are not close to abandoning their man.

The likelihood is this: We’re going to have an administration that has morally and politically collapsed, without actually going away.

What does that look like?

First, it means an administration that is passive, full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing. To get anything done, a president depends on the vast machinery of the U.S. government. But Trump doesn’t mesh with that machinery. He is personality-based while it is rule-based. Furthermore, he’s declared war on it. And when you declare war on the establishment, it declares war on you.

The Civil Service has a thousand ways to ignore or sit on any presidential order. The court system has given itself carte blanche to overturn any Trump initiative, even on the flimsiest legal grounds. The intelligence community has only just begun to undermine this president.

President Trump can push all the pretty buttons on the command deck of the Starship Enterprise, but don’t expect anything to actually happen, because they are not attached.

Second, this will probably become a more insular administration. Usually when administrations stumble, they fire a few people and bring in the grown-ups — the James Baker or the David Gergen types. But Trump is anti-grown-up, so it’s hard to imagine Chief of Staff Haley Barbour. Instead, the circle of trust seems to be shrinking to his daughter, her husband and Stephen Bannon.

Bannon has a coherent worldview, which is a huge advantage when all is chaos. It’s interesting how many of Bannon’s rivals have woken up with knives in their backs. Michael Flynn is gone. Reince Priebus has been unmanned by a thousand White House leaks. Rex Tillerson had the potential to be an effective secretary of state, but Bannon neutered him last week by denying him the ability to even select his own deputy.

In an administration in which “promoted beyond his capacity” takes on new meaning, Bannon looms. With each passing day, Trump talks more like Bannon without the background reading.

Third, we are about to enter a decentralized world. For the past 70 years most nations have instinctively looked to the U.S. for leadership, either to follow or oppose. But in capitals around the world, intelligence agencies are drafting memos with advice on how to play Donald Trump.

The first conclusion is obvious. This administration is more like a medieval monarchy than a modern nation-state. It’s more “The Madness of King George” than “The Missiles of October.” The key currency is not power, it’s flattery.

The corollary is that Trump is ripe to be played. Give the boy a lollipop and he won’t notice if you steal his lunch. The Japanese gave Trump a new jobs announcement he could take to the Midwest, and in return they got presidential attention and coddling that other governments would have died for.

If you want to roll the Trump administration, you’ve got to get in line. The Israelis got a possible one-state solution. The Chinese got Trump to flip-flop on the “One China” policy. The Europeans got him to do a 180 on undoing the Iran nuclear deal.

Vladimir Putin was born for a moment such as this. He is always pushing the envelope. After gifting Team Trump with a little campaign help, the Russian state media has suddenly turned on Trump and Russian planes are buzzing U.S. ships. The bear is going to grab what it can.

We’re about to enter a moment in which U.S. economic and military might is strong but U.S. political might is weak. Imagine the Roman Empire governed by Monaco.

That’s scary. The only saving thought is this: The human imagination is vast, but it is not nearly vast enough to encompass the infinitely multitudinous ways Donald Trump can find to get himself disgraced.Organizing for Action, the political nonprofit group that grew out of former President Barack Obama’s election campaign, has created a “Recess Toolkit” with suggestions on how to effectively ask questions at the events. Last week, the group held an online seminar with members of Indivisible, the most prominent activist organization to emerge in response to Mr. Trump’s election, to coach supporters on how to challenge lawmakers — in a “civil and respectful way” advised one strategist, according to a recording of the session.

Planned Parenthood is hoping to flood the sessions with members in pink T-shirts, urging Congress to keep in place the health care law and the organization’s funding.

“It’s going to be intense,” said Emily Tisch Sussman, who leads the political arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. “All every group wants to know is how to find out where the town halls are going to be.”

The recess, traditionally a time for lawmakers to take the temperature of their constituents, comes at a surprisingly vulnerable moment for Republicans. They are struggling to gain traction on a legislative agenda despite controlling both congressional chambers and the White House, as the new administration remains mired in controversy over its targeted travel ban and pre-election contact with Russia, among other issues.

While complaints about the health care act — high premiums in particular — helped elect Mr. Trump, polls show it has become more popular as voters realize that repealing it would mean that an estimated 30 million people lose health insurance.

There are few indications at this point that the conservative base of the Republican Party is mobilizing for action on a large scale during the recess. FreedomWorks, the Washington-based libertarian group that in 2009 nurtured Tea Party groups to rally against the legislation that became the health care act, said it was planning a Washington rally next month to let lawmakers know that there remained significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

But just as the energy after Mr. Obama’s inauguration seemed to be on the right, this year it seems to be on the left. Anti-abortion demonstrations in some cities this month were met with much larger crowds of abortion rights supporters. At a widely viewed town-hall-style meeting held by Representative Gus Bilirakis in Florida, a local Republican Party chairman who declared that the health care act set up “death panels” was shouted down by supporters of the law.

Several Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have dismissed the pro-health care act crowds as “paid protesters,” not constituents. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, without offering evidence, called the protests a “very paid, AstroTurf-type movement,” unlike the Tea Party demonstrations against the drafting of the health care law in 2009, which he characterized as “very organic.”

In fact, some of the most formidable and well-established organizing groups on the left have found themselves scrambling to track all of the local groups sprouting up through social media channels like Facebook and Slack, or in local “huddles” that grew out of the women’s marches across the country the day after the inauguration.

“We’re just constantly being flooded with people asking us, ‘What can we do, where can we go?’” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org, who coined the “dam-bursting level” description. “For politicians to imagine that it’s something that any group could turn on and off like a light switch is a critical miscalculation.”

Ms. Sussman spent much of one morning this week communicating with 1,600 up-and-coming activist groups on a Slack channel that one of them organized.

“It doesn’t work for organizations to bigfoot strategy; it’s not the way organizing happens now,” said Kelley Robinson, the deputy national organizing director for Planned Parenthood, which is fighting the defunding of its health clinics. “There are bigger ideas coming out of the grass roots than the traditional organizations.”

Established groups in Washington are running more traditional campaigns.

The Alliance for Healthcare Security, a coalition of health care worker unions and other groups, is running television and online ads during the recess in five states where it believes Republican senators are either inclined to vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or vulnerable to defeat in re-election bids if they vote for repeal. The ads — in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada and West Virginia — feature constituents with life-threatening diseases telling emotional stories about how the health care law saved their lives.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is keeping track of Republican lawmakers who do not hold town-hall-style meetings. Some events have been canceled, and Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey said he had done so because the meetings have been “hijacked” by groups hostile to Mr. Trump. The committee plans to run internet ads trying to shame lawmakers for not facing their constituents in public since voting last month on a procedural motion aimed at repealing the health law.

Some of the most creative activity is coming from people who are new to political activism. In Plymouth, Minn., Kelly Guncheon, a financial planner who described himself as an independent, has organized a “With Him or Without Him” meeting for Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican who has not scheduled any of his own. A volunteer offered to make 400 cupcakes decorated with a “Where’s Waldo?” picture of Mr. Paulsen’s face, and Mr. Guncheon said he planned to project onto screens legislation that Mr. Paulsen had supported. Participants will be asked to write down questions, which will be delivered, along with a recording of the event, to Mr. Paulsen’s congressional office after the recess.

Mr. Guncheon, like other new activists, said he was not looking to traditional political groups for guidance.

“In this new culture, this new era, we have to figure out new ways to do things,” he said. “There’s certainly no leadership at the head of the Democratic Party, or the state party. Not that I’m a Democrat anyway, but that seems to be the opposition party.”

Other new groups organizing on Facebook have arranged similar events, calling them “no-show” or “empty-chair” meetings, for Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, as well as for Republican lawmakers from California, New Jersey and New York.

In response to Mr. Gardner’s complaints that the people showing up at his office to request town-hall-style meetings were paid protesters from other states, one group showed up at his office with a banner on which members had written their Colorado ZIP codes.

National groups are looking past the recess, to try to keep up the momentum for the local efforts.

Ms. Sussman, at the Center for American Progress, said her group planned a training and planning session in April for new activist leaders. Save My Care, another Washington group, is to begin an online campaign on Monday where people can register to have a hospital wristband sent to their congressional representative. The wristbands, which read “I will lose my health care if you vote to repeal,” will be delivered to Congress after the recess.

Planned Parenthood is signing up “defenders” and holding 90-minute training sessions to help teach new activists how to tell reporters and lawmakers their personal experiences with the group’s health services, and what it would mean to lose them.

The group is planning a rally in Milwaukee on Feb. 25, the last weekend of the recess week, with Planned Parenthood patients from Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s district expected to testify how they would be affected if clinics lost funding. Mr. Ryan has said he would defund Planned Parenthood in any repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Still, said Nicole Safar, the group’s director of government relations in Wisconsin, “This is more about movement-building than targeting Paul Ryan.”

“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” she said. “We’re going to put as much pressure as we can on Paul Ryan during the recess, for sure, but this isn’t going to end any time soon.”This is disappointing. At the same time, the show doesn’t lack for political content; there’s plenty, however discreetly framed. And there are advantages to having no ironbound curatorial concept in play: At least the 30 or so artists get equal time with their varied voices, some mild, some strong, several new to New York.

Still, some thematic structuring would have been a help, even at the risk of reinforcing stereotypes of tropical exoticism, revolutionary fervor, etc. One obvious theme is the presence of nature, a universally loaded one in the age of climate crisis. It’s everywhere here. The performance artist Glenda Léon notates music and dance scores with images of raindrops. The Cuban-American conceptualist Maria Elena González punches holes in photographs of palm trees.

Humberto Díaz, currently an artist-in-residence at the Bronx Museum, extends the active life of fallen tree branches he scavenges from the city’s parks by attaching industrial brooms to their tips. For a long-unseen installation from the early 1990s, the artist Alexis Leiva Machado, known as Kcho, transforms a set of palm saplings into what look like giant oars, a reminder of earlier waves of exodus from the island by boat to escape political persecution.

The Cuban-born Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) was part of that refugee generation and came to the United States as a child. Her attachment to Cuba remained profound, often expressed as an intimate, sacrificial identification with the natural world. In a series of works called “Siluetas,” she virtually merged with it, buried herself, by tracing and burning the shape of her body into the earth, as documented in a dozen photographs from her art school years at the University of Iowa in the 1970s.

Photo

In such images, Ms. Mendieta was indirectly referring to a specific aspect of Cuban cultural history: the forced mass migration that was the Atlantic slave trade. Beginning in the 16th century, hundreds of thousands of slaves were shipped from Africa to Spanish colonial Cuba to work on sugar plantations, bringing their languages, arts and spiritual lives with them.

The spirit of Afro-Caribbean religions that developed on the island was central to much of Ms. Mendieta’s work, and to that of several other artists in the show. In the 1980s, José Bedia became a priest of Palo Monte, a religion with roots in the Kongo kingdom of Central Africa, home to many New World slaves. Belkis Ayón, who took her own life in Havana in 1999 at age 32, was inspired by Abakuá, an all-male, Nigerian-derived secret society that she, heretically, infuses with female energy in a magnificent body of black-and-white figurative prints.

These hybrid faiths, and others, are still widely practiced. And skin color continues to be, even in a country that once made utopian claims to colorblindness, a social and economic determinant. This is a reality that the artist María Magdalena Campos-Pons has been addressing for years in ritualistic whiteface performances — one took place, unannounced, in Piazza San Marco during the 2013 Venice Biennale — and in role-playing photographic self-portraits, like the ones in the show.

Photo

The Cuban Revolution is itself a state religion and its gods inevitably find a place in the show, though as objects of ambivalent devotion. A cigar-puffing Fidel Castro makes an early appearance, surrounded by peasant soldiers and patriotic kids, in a 1969 painting by the political Pop artist Raúl Martínez. José Angel Toirac and Meira Marrero depict Fidel Castro as an absurdly towering titan, while Carlos Garaicoa emblazons his name above a photograph of a headless sculptural angel shot in an upscale Havana hotel.

Ezekiel Suárez, who with the artist Sandra Ceballos founded Havana’s oldest alternative space, Espacio Aglutinador, was hounded by censors in the 1990s. In response, he took to writing secret, tweet-size messages to Castro on the reverse side of his abstract embroideries, literally hiding subversive content in his art.

For decades, to the outside world, Cuban art meant propaganda. Portraits of Castro and Che Guevara were best sellers because that’s all that was on the market. The curators of “Wild Noise” put an antic spin on this phenomenon, without abandoning it. But they also include some genuinely moving political work. In 1996, Mr. Toirac and Ms. Marrero did a series of 12 portraits, from news photos, of corpses found in a city morgue after the Cuban president, Fulgencio Batista, had been overthrown by the Revolution in 1959. Who these people were, and why and how they died, is unrecorded. The military has memorials to unknown soldiers; these are unknown citizens. The artists treat them with reverence, painting their features with wine and gold leaf.

Photo

They take a refined, even delicate approach to a large subject. There are other examples. Diana Fonseca Quiñones distills the texture of a crumbling Havana in small abstract collages made of paint scraps harvested from building exteriors. Pedro Pablo Oliva portrays José Martí, the apostle of Cuban independence, as a slumbering saint in dapper tropical whites. And the conceptualist Wilfredo Prieto sketches, in the faintest of ink lines on a long paper scroll, images of every project he has completed in a prolific career.

In the end, Ms. Bruguera’s resistance to a show that she found to be too unprotestingly in line with the Cuban government’s dictatorial control of art is well taken. And this leads to a natural question: If work from the permanent collection of the National Museum in Havana had traveled, would it be any more radical than what we see here?

In short, “Wild Noise” maybe as good as we could expect considering the official sources and compromises involved. We may find a bolder take on truth-in-history in a larger show, “Adiós Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950,” which opens at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, on March 5. In terms of point of view, the title alone speaks volumes.The Playlist: Selena Gomez Chides an Ex, and Remy Ma Stomps on a Foe

Kygo feat. Selena Gomez, ‘It Ain’t Me’

Don’t be deceived by the modest, folky guitar picking that opens this regretful but righteous kiss-off. The crescendo and dance-floor thump arrive soon, as Selena Gomez chides an ex who was drinking and partying too often (insert tabloid speculation here). “Who’s waking up to drive you home/when you’re drunk and all alone?” she sings, with choir-like reinforcements. “It ain’t me.” Kygo’s production isn’t overbearing; sometimes a fingersnap is louder than the kick drum. Nor is it repetitive. Guitars and pianos swirl in and out, and Ms. Gomez’s vocals are chopped up to join the percussion, flinging well-chosen syllables — a recurring “whiskey neat” — at the offending ex. JON PARELES

Fat Joe and Remy Ma feat. Kent Jones, ‘Swear to God’

In a post ricocheting around Twitter yesterday, @DashRomero put up four closed-captioned stills of a video interview given by the rapper couple Papoose and Remy Ma. Papoose is talking about first impressions: “She was like rude to everybody in the room. And I was like oh, I really like her.”

This pugnacity was key to Remy Ma’s appeal as a member of the Terror Squad (see her star turn on the remix of M.O.P.’s “Ante Up”) up until her arrest in 2007 on assault and weapons charges, and her subsequent prison term, which ended in 2014.

Thanks to “All the Way Up,” her hit with former Terror Squad macher Fat Joe, Remy Ma is more in the spotlight than ever. The two have just released a solid collaborative album, “Plata o Plomo,” on which she handily out-raps her partner on every track, and on “Dreamin,” the album finale, she talks about how prison didn’t calm her down, it made her more aggressive. That she still packs punch is clearest on “Swear to God,” one sock to the jaw after another, but with whimsical wordplay that shows off just how light her heavy burdens are:

Say something, said something or mentioned my name, ho

Put a bullet in the brain of the mane on your Polo

You could get this work for free, it’s pro bono

I put funds on your bundles, mad dough on your Afro

Guap on your top, green on your bean

Dubs on your mug, a new bag on your do-rag

JON CARAMANICA

Romeo Santos, ‘Héroe Favorito’

The new Romeo Santos single is bachata in its most schlocky, high-gloss form, with fits of smooth jazz mixed in for bad measure, not that it matters. His voice is as piercing as ever, with vowels fired off like tiny firecrackers. It’s sweet enough to render a song about all the superheroes you wish you could become to win over the woman you crave something more than a gimmick. Mr. Santos is also at the absurdist stage of his celebrity, when all that is left is to turn a song about wishing one were a superhero in the eyes of the woman you crave into a video in which you become a superhero — several different ones, as a matter of fact — with the power to sweep your intended off her feet, and also crawl down the outside of her building to grab a kiss. J.C.

Mary. J. Blige, ‘U + Me (Love Lesson)’

There’s blame for everyone in “U + Me (Love Lesson),” Mary J. Blige’s latest exercise in surviving love gone wrong. “Must have been crazy to think that you loved me/I saw all the signs,” she declares. In lines that tumble out so quickly they sometimes overlap, she calls out her own self-deceptions and fears of being alone as well as her ex’s lies and obliviousness. The beat is slow but the arrangement builds nervous energy with quick percussion, insistent strings and backing voices appearing from all directions. Ms. Blige, of course, will get through: “Gotta keep on pushing/And love myself through the hard times,” she resolves. J.P.

Blac Youngsta feat. Lil Yachty, ‘Hip Hopper’

For a long time, proclaiming “I’m not a rapper” was one of the most effective rap boasts possible. It implied that rapping was art, a day job, an inconvenience — the real money was being made elsewhere. The recent generation-and-age-gap Cold War essentially boils down to those who wish their rappers identified as such vs. rappers who feel no need to do so. This track by Blac Youngsta and the bête noire of traditionalists, Lil Yachty, is comic and relentless. Both are rapping well, but neither dwells on it, especially Blac Youngsta, owner of one of the most free-spirited social media presences in hip-hop who raps like he might bust out giggling at any moment. J.C.

Linkin Park feat. Kiiara, ‘Heavy’

This is an Owl City song. C’mon, Linkin Park. Circa 2000 Linkin Park would stuff this song in a locker — and circa 2000 Linkin Park was already stuffed in the locker. J.C.

Oumou Sangare, ‘Yere Faga’

Oumou Sangare emerged as a force in traditional-style Malian music, bringing the style of her home region, Wassoulou, to national and then international renown. She also took on the age-old role of the West African singer as a societal memory conscience, offering virtuous advice. Then she started collaborating with musicians worldwide, transporting the sound of Wassoulou along multiple avenues of funk. “Yere Faga” gently but urgently counsels against suicide using a groove from the great Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, in an ancient-future mix: traditional balafons (marimbas), hearty call-and-response vocals and clouds of sustained female voices, deep bass lines and jabs of guitar noise, making the song at once rooted and unearthly. J.P.

Thundercat, ‘Friend Zone’

Funk redeems frustration in “Friend Zone,” a droll complaint from a guy who’d rather play Mortal Kombat than field another Platonic heart-to-heart late-night phone call from his unrequited crush. “The next time you call me I’m gonna sit and stare at the screen/Waiting for the call to end.” A squishy P-Funk groove, electropop arpeggios, slippery polytonal harmonies and vocals in an aggrieved-nerd falsetto add up to a song that’s funny with a grudge. J.P.

Omar Sosa and Seckou Keita, ‘Dary’

This crystalline, shimmering instrumental, at once animated and serene, comes from an international coalition: the Cuban pianist Omar Sosa, the Senegalese kora player Seckou Keita and the Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles. (“Transparent Water,” the album it comes from, will be released next week; it also includes guests from China and Japan.) The harmonies are soothing, consonant major chords; Mr. Sosa and Mr. Keita take turns offering patterns to underpin one another’s solos. And Mr. Ovalles, on a sensitively changing series of instruments, pinpoints every shift of syncopation as the three players move through kaleidoscopic permutations of what a six-beat rhythm can do. J.P.

Dawes, ‘Roll With the Punches’

The patiently chugging roots-rock of “Roll With the Punches” is the sound of sorrow turning to numb pragmatism. It’s a song about coping with both the material and emotional aftermath of a breakup. Taylor Goldsmith, Dawes’ songwriter and singer, deploys vocabulary with precision, building verses around “symmetrical,” “collateral,” “negotiable” and other four-syllable words. “The separation was logistical/deciding what belongs to whom/how dying love manifests in a rug or a chest/the decorations of a room,” Taylor Goldsmith sings. The video has a rueful, Solomonic conceit: the way that many objects, divided precisely in half, become useless. J.P.While the total amount of annual savings of roughly $2.5 billion would be comparatively small, administration officials want to highlight the agencies in their coming budget proposal as examples of misuse of taxpayer dollars. An internal memo circulated within the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday, and obtained by The New York Times, notes that the list could change. Proposals for more extensive cuts in cabinet-level agencies are expected to follow.

During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised large but unspecified cuts to rein in the deficit, even as he promised to protect programs for his working-class voters and to drastically expand spending on the military, roads, bridges and airports. While the memo in no way resolves that contradiction, it suggests that he could lean toward a small-government philosophy that conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney have fiercely advocated.

The Office of Management and Budget is currently operating with a skeleton staff; Mr. Mulvaney was only confirmed on Thursday. Still, officials there plan to ask agencies targeted for elimination for their responses by next Friday and to finalize the list by March 13, according to a person familiar with the process.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed cuts. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this month that the administration would release a detailed budget in the next few weeks. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has spoken about government spending only in general terms.

“A balanced budget is fine,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. “But sometimes you have to fuel the well in order to really get the economy going.”

He added: “I want a balanced budget eventually. But I want to have a strong military.”

The president’s hope to increase military spending, shared by many Republicans, will probably be at the center of the looming budget battle in Congress. Funding for the current fiscal year is set to expire on April 28. The administration is expected to make a supplemental request before then for money to go to the military — and possibly a wall on the Mexican border.

But under the Budget Control Act of 2011, spending on defense and domestic programs is capped. Democrats will demand that any lifting of those caps for the military be matched by a higher ceiling for domestic programs, setting the stage for a legislative logjam or a showdown over whether to preserve the parliamentary stalling tactic known as the Senate filibuster.

Steve Bell, a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee who is now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the programs identified in the memo are standard targets for Republican budget-cutters but of little significance in the government’s financial picture.

“It’s sad in a way because those programs aren’t causing the deficit,” Mr. Bell said. “These programs don’t amount to a hill of beans.”

One surprise for some close watchers of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign is the inclusion of the Export-Import Bank on the O.M.B.’s list. Other Republican candidates had promised to eliminate the bank, a favorite target of House conservatives like Mr. Mulvaney. Conservatives, led by the billionaire Koch brothers, have run a multimillion-dollar campaign to kill the bank, which guarantees loans for overseas customers of American corporations, by denouncing it as “crony capitalism.”

But Mr. Trump was more circumspect during the campaign, saying he favored programs to promote American exports. The biggest recipient of the bank’s assistance — and its biggest booster — is the aerospace giant Boeing, which President Trump visited on Friday and lavishly praised.

But the president has stacked his White House with budget hawks. Stephen Miller, one of Mr. Trump’s most senior advisers, was a top aide to Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general and spent much of his Senate career trying to rein in government spending.

For director of budget policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council, Mr. Trump chose Paul Winfree, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. In its own proposed budget blueprint, the Heritage Foundation recommended eliminating virtually the same programs listed in the Office of Management and Budget memo, along with a long list of others.

Many of those programs have been attacked by conservatives since the Republican “revolution” of 1994. Led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, the House of Representatives at the time repeatedly went after funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose supporters dragged Big Bird and Kermit the Frog to Capitol Hill to make their case.

The Appalachian Regional Commission, a Depression-era independent agency aimed at developing some of the poorest parts of the country, has also been a target.

These agencies have managed to survive partly because of powerful patrons in the Senate, including the late Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. Even now, with 48 seats in the Senate, Democrats have considerable leverage to save popular programs.

Backers of the National Endowment for the Arts are likely to put up a particularly vigorous fight.

“The public wants to see agencies like the N.E.A. continue,” said Robert L. Lynch, head of Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit organization. “There is always a debate, but there has been agreement among Republicans and Democrats that funding for the arts is a good thing, and it has been kept in place.”

Other agencies on the budget office’s list of cuts include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Corporation for National and Community Service, which finances programs run by AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps. The memo also proposed reducing funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development.

Stephen Moore, another Heritage Foundation economist who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign, acknowledged that powerful constituencies were behind many of the programs that are on the chopping block. But he said now that Republicans are finally in control of the government, they must make a valiant effort to fulfill the promises they have been making to voters for years.

“I think it’s an important endeavor to try to get rid of things that are unnecessary,” Mr. Moore said. “The American public has a lot of contempt for how government is run in Washington, in no small part because there is so much waste.”Photo

George Steele, a gruff, green-tongued fighter who, as the Animal, was one of wrestling’s wildest and most-hated villains for almost two decades, has died, World Wrestling Entertainment, the professional wrestling organization, said on Friday. He was 79.

The organization announced his death without specifying the cause, time or location. Eric Simms, a wrestling agent, said in a social media post Thursday that he had spoken to Mr. Steele’s wife, who said Mr. Steele had been in a hospice.

Mr. Steele, whose real name was William James Myers, was born in Madison Heights, Mich., on April 16, 1937, according to “WWE Legends,” a book by Brian Solomon. He gained fame in the 1970s and ’80s as the Animal, a hairy, grunting brute of few words. But he had little in common with that persona outside the ring.

Mr. Steele, who had dyslexia, earned a master’s degree from Central Michigan University and went on to teach high school in the Detroit area, where he moonlighted in sports-entertainment promotions, according to World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation. Mr. Steele, who is in the organization’s Hall of Fame, started appearing in W.W.F. in 1967, when he launched into a bitter rivalry with the champion Bruno Sammartino.

Mr. Steele was known for his unpredictable behavior and a signature habit of stuffing his mouth with the inner padding of the turnbuckles located at the corners of the ring.

He was a protégé of several wrestlers who subsequently became members of the WWE Hall of Fame, including Harry Fujiwara, also known as Mr. Fuji, who died last summer, and flirted many times with winning the organization’s championship.

In 1985, his career shifted course, according to WWE. Mr. Steele went from being among the most reviled figures in wrestling to one of its most loved, when, after being abandoned during a six-man match by his partners, he wound up under the guidance of the then-popular Capt. Lou Albano.

Throughout much of his career, he continued to teach high school and coach football in Madison Heights, Mich., where he would return for Monday practices after weekend appearances at Madison Square Garden.

He retired from wrestling in the late 1980s after learning that he had Crohn’s disease and devoted much of his life after that to motivational speaking, spiritual testimony and promoting awareness of the disease. He later resettled in Cocoa Beach, Fla.

Mr. Steele was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Michigan High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1996, which noted in an online profile that Mr. Steele coached wrestling, football and track for 28 years.

Information on his survivors was not immediately available.

Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, described Mr. Steele on Twitter as a kind man.

“George Steele was only an animal in the ring,” he said. “He was one of the truly nice men in the world.”Mr. Michel, having announced his retirement, was wistful after Election Day. “I feel like the small boy who ate his spinach and his broccoli but leaves the table before his mom brings the strawberry shortcake,” he told a Republican gathering.

In an interview for this obituary in 2008, Mr. Michel said the “most exhilarating time” in his long years in the House had been when he shepherded President Ronald Reagan’s economic program through the House. Though Republicans had picked up seats on Mr. Reagan’s coattails in the 1980 election, they were still 26 short of a majority, and Mr. Michel had to sway enough conservative Democrats to pass tax and spending bills.

Mr. Michel freely called himself the president’s “handmaiden,” but he warned Mr. Reagan off measures that he thought could not pass. One was an administration plan in 1985 to aid right-wing counterrevolutionaries trying to oust the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Mr. Michel told the president that the measure was “dead in the water.”

Photo

He told a reporter: “I don’t serve a president well by telling him only good news. You get in trouble that way.”

For many years, he was known for getting along with Democratic leaders, golfing frequently with Speaker Thomas P. O’Neill of Massachusetts. But younger Republican House members — especially Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the assistant leader, or whip — later began challenging the Democrats constantly and complaining that Mr. Michel was too pliable.

The new breed of Republicans was not much more conservative than Mr. Michel, whose votes were judged 85 percent correct by the American Conservative Union. But they believed that the only way to win control of the House was through confrontation and denunciation.

In 1992, without warning Mr. Michel, Mr. Gingrich told reporters that he would run for House Republican leader in two years — a potential face-off that was averted by Mr. Michel’s retirement.

Photo

A triumphant Mr. Gingrich went on to become House speaker in the wake of the Republican tide of 1994. Afterward, Mr. Michel was critical of the agenda on which Republicans ran that year, which they called a “Contract With America,” saying that its proposed tax cuts and increases in military spending could deepen the budget deficit.

Mr. Michel did not get along with all Democrats. In particular, he had a difficult relationship with Jim Wright, the highly partisan House speaker from Texas who served from 1987 to 1989, when Mr. Gingrich helped force his resignation. But he got along well both with Mr. O’Neill and with Mr. Wright’s successor, Tom Foley of Washington State.

“With Tom and Tip, ye gads, we got along,” Mr. Michel said in the 2008 interview, referring to Mr. O’Neill by his nickname. “Sure, we had our doggone partisan differences; I expect that. You can’t be namby-pamby about it. But when push came to shove, or during a real nitty-gritty situation, why, I always knew that I could talk with either one of them on a simply man-to-man basis and no holds barred. And that’s a good feeling to have.”

He added, “I doubt if any of that goes on like it did in my old days.”

Until he joined the Washington law firm Hogan & Hartson as an adviser in 1995, Mr. Michel’s entire working life had been spent in the House. He had gone to Washington in 1948 as an assistant to Representative Harold Velde right after graduating from Bradley University in Peoria.

Photo

When Mr. Velde retired in 1956, Mr. Michel ran for the seat and won. He was elected minority whip in 1975. He was seriously challenged only in 1982, when recession hit Peoria hard. He still won, with 51.6 percent of the vote.

When President Clinton presented Mr. Michel with the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in 1994, he lauded him as having “served our nation well, choosing the pragmatic but harder course of conciliation more often than the divisive but easier course of confrontation.”

“In the best sense he is a gentleman legislator,” Mr. Clinton said, “who, in spite of the great swings in public opinion from year to year, has remained always true to the Midwestern values he represents so faithfully in the House. He retires at the end of this year, generally regarded by Democrats and Republicans alike as one of the most decent and respected leaders with which any president has had the privilege to work.”

Robert Henry Michel was born in Peoria on March 2, 1923, the son of a French immigrant who had chosen to change the pronunciation of his surname from mee-SHELL. After attending public schools he enlisted in the Army in 1942, landed at Normandy, was wounded by machine gun fire in Germany and won two Bronze Stars along with the Purple Heart. He graduated from Bradley University in 1948.

As a congressman, he wore the ribbon designating his Combat Infantryman’s Badge.

In a statement on Friday, the elder President George Bush called Mr. Michel “a masterful legislator.”

“There were some who thought he was too easygoing with his friends across the aisle,” the statement said, “but no one accused him of being soft after the invasion of Normandy.”

Mr. Michel’s wife of 54 years, the former Corinne Woodruff, whom he met when they sang in the choir at Bradley, died in 2003.

His survivors include three sons, Scott, Bruce and Robin; a daughter, Laurie Michel; a sister, Betty Lou Riggenbach; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

For all his bipartisan instincts, Mr. Michel remained committed to his party, loyally steering the Republican programs of Presidents Reagan and Bush through the House. He especially prized his relationship with Reagan and kept a picture in his office showing them together.

“His inscription on the picture,” he said in the 2008 interview, “is, ‘Bob, I believe you, I believe you, what’s more important I believe in you.’ ”Photo

Mr. Steele, who had dyslexia, earned a master’s degree from Central Michigan University and went on to teach high school in the Detroit area, where he moonlighted in sports-entertainment promotions, according to World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation. Mr. Steele, who is in the organization’s Hall of Fame, started appearing in W.W.F. in 1967, when he launched into a bitter rivalry with the champion Bruno Sammartino.

Mr. Steele was known for his unpredictable behavior and a signature habit of stuffing his mouth with the inner padding of the turnbuckles located at the corners of the ring.

He was a protégé of several wrestlers who subsequently became members of the WWE Hall of Fame, including Harry Fujiwara, also known as Mr. Fuji, who died last summer, and flirted many times with winning the organization’s championship.

In 1985, his career shifted course, according to WWE. Mr. Steele went from being among the most reviled figures in wrestling to one of its most loved, when, after being abandoned during a six-man match by his partners, he wound up under the guidance of the then-popular Capt. Lou Albano.

Throughout much of his career, he continued to teach high school and coach football in Madison Heights, Mich., where he would return for Monday practices after weekend appearances at Madison Square Garden.

He retired from wrestling in the late 1980s after learning that he had Crohn’s disease and devoted much of his life after that to motivational speaking, spiritual testimony and promoting awareness of the disease. He later resettled in Cocoa Beach, Fla.

Mr. Steele was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Michigan High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1996, which noted in an online profile that Mr. Steele coached wrestling, football and track for 28 years.

Information on his survivors was not immediately available.

Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, described Mr. Steele on Twitter as a kind man.

“George Steele was only an animal in the ring,” he said. “He was one of the truly nice men in the world.”Mr. Yiannopoulos had been scheduled to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month, on an invitation from the school’s College Republicans group. But his talk was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused about $100,000 in damages.

In January, when Mr. Yiannopoulos gave a lecture in Seattle at the University of Washington, a man was shot during protests outside the site of the speech. He spoke in December at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks.

When it was announced on Wednesday that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be interviewed on “Real Time,” another scheduled guest, Jeremy Scahill, a journalist for The Intercept, said in a statement on his Twitter account that he was withdrawing from the show.

“He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,” Mr. Scahill said. “There is no value in ‘debating’ him.”

Mr. Maher followed with his own statement that said, “If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims — and he might be — nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night.”

In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as “the party of Lena Dunham,” the creator and star of “Girls.” (Mr. Maher replied: “Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people.”)

Describing himself as “a virtuous troll,” Mr. Yiannopolous said, “I hurt people for a reason.”

He said people “want to police humor” because “they can’t control it.”

“Because the one thing that authoritarians hate is the sound of laughter,” Mr. Yiannopolous said.

Mr. Maher added, “And also, because when people laugh, they know it’s true.”

Mr. Yiannopolous replied, “Nothing annoys people, or amuses people, like the truth.”

They then discussed an incident from last summer, when Mr. Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of “Ghostbusters” and “Saturday Night Live.”

“I didn’t understand, like, the ‘Ghostbusters’ thing,” Mr. Maher said.

Mr. Yiannopoulos answered: “I wrote a bad review of a movie. Am I not entitled to do that?” After repeating some of the insults he had leveled at Ms. Jones, he said, “I simply don’t accept — I do not accept — that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster, that an A-list, mega-celebrity is crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it.”

“What actually hurts people is, like, murder, violence,” Mr. Yiannopoulos added. “That kind of stuff.”

He added that “mean words” don’t “hurt people.”

Mr. Maher said, “Which some people would say you have incited.”

Mr. Yiannopoulos reacted with surprise. “What? How?” he asked.

“I’m just saying, some people would say,” Mr. Maher answered.

Mr. Yiannopoulos replied, “Well, they would be idiots.”

Speaking to his audience, Mr. Maher said, “Stop taking the bait, liberals,” and asked how they could be afraid of someone he described as “little, British, impish” and a slur for gay people. The two men shook hands, and Mr. Maher moved on to his panel discussion.

But in an online-only segment that ran after the HBO broadcast, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that transgender people were “vastly disproportionately involved in sex crime,” drawing jeers, boos and a shout of “liar” from Mr. Maher’s audience.

Mr. Yiannopoulos also clashed with the comedian Larry Wilmore, another guest on the show.

In remarks to Mr. Yiannopoulos that were bookended by an obscene phrase, Mr. Wilmore took offense at his Twitter trolling of Ms. Jones. “She’s a very thoughtful person and very funny,” he said.

Trying to defuse the tension, Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn’t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. “This is the beginning of your career,” Mr. Maher said. “People are only just starting to hate you.”Times journalists around the world bring you a new 360 video every day.I wasn’t a great player, but I recognize greatness when I see it.

This is a story about one of those scouts, Fred. I tell Fred’s story whenever I overhear a fan talking about scouting as a dream job.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When I first met him, in the early 2000s at the World Junior Championships in Pardubice, in the Czech Republic, his scouting career was off to a promising start. He was in his early 30s, in his first N.H.L. gig.

As a player, he was short and, to be polite, stubby. On the ice, he had lived by his wits. Scouts grade prospects on “hockey sense,” an intuitive understanding of the way the game should be played. Scouts, of course, would be helpless without it. As a player and scout, Fred had hockey sense in spades.

Though he never played in an N.H.L. game, Fred believed he had found his niche as a scout, and now wanted to get made, to become a part of the fraternity, to have not just a career but a good career, to be a 25-year, maybe a 30-year hockey man.

We got to where we’d call each other up every couple of weeks or so to swap notes. On more than a couple of occasions, we shared rides to games — braving icy two-lane highways on the banks of the St. Lawrence going into the small-town Quebec. We became friends.

Fred was a good scout, industrious, conscientious, always looking for a certain type of player, like he had a favorite flavor. If you didn’t know better, you’d assume that Fred and others like him recognize their own weaknesses in young players and know to stay away. For example, one former high N.H.L. draft pick was a highly skilled, athletic goalie who had a bad work ethic and a worse attitude — but when he scouts goalies he tends to look for character first and is willing to overlook physical shortcomings. Likewise, Fred focused on big, athletic kids — a short, pudgy kid, no matter how skilled he might be, was the first name crossed off Fred’s list.

One spring, Fred’s team won the Stanley Cup, a three-foot-high piece of silverware. In one of the N.H.L.’s quaintest rituals, players and staff members of the championship team get a day with the Cup in the following summer, a chance to take the grail home to show friends and family. Fred booked his “day with Stanley” in August. He invited me to the block party, but I had to beg off because of a work assignment. I told him his team looked strong enough to win the Cup again, and I’d make it then.

A couple of summers after that Fred called. His team didn’t win the Cup that spring, and there’d been changes at the executive level. The general manager who had hired him was being ousted. His scouting director, whom he called his “best friend,” had taken a job with another organization.

“I’m out,” he said. “I have a year to run on my contract. Can you help me with my résumé?”

I had worked on the résumés of a couple of scouts who had been cut loose by management, and both found new jobs. I thought Fred had a good shot. He had more than 10 years on the job, and his fingerprints were all over a team that won the Stanley Cup. He had networked from Day 1. And he was sure that his former scouting director would have something for him next year. That was his fallback.

“Something will open next July 1,” he said, that being the date when management tenders scouts’ contracts.

Fred’s plan in the interim: He was going to go about his work as if he were still employed by his club. He would travel to the arenas across Canada and the United States on his own dime and write up reports so that he could be seen by others in the business and so that he’d be up to speed on young prospects for those job interviews the next spring.

Fred did all that and more for eight months. We traveled together a couple of times. By spring I could tell his confidence was eroding.

He sent out résumés to 29 N.H.L. clubs. He made follow-up calls. He called in favors. He didn’t get a single interview. His former scouting director, Fred’s last, best hope, didn’t return calls or emails, not even when he was overhauling his staff. Friendship, Fred realized, counts for nothing more in hockey than it does in any other business.

Since then, he’s had a couple of junior-level jobs in minor hockey, well below the pay grade and professional status of a guy who has a Stanley Cup ring. On Jan. 1 he woke up in his own bed, had breakfast with his wife and kicked around the house all day. He’d have been in no mood to watch the world-junior tournament over the holidays. For an N.H.L. scout, there’s really no place like away from home.

I thought about Fred this year at the world juniors. I was able to stay off the road for half the tournament — the opening round was being played in Toronto, my hometown.

I had always thought I understood the scouts’ lives, but I didn’t until it went sideways for Fred, until his job slipped away and he hung on so desperately to hope, until I saw him sitting at games writing reports that no one would read.

Only then did I realize how much scouting meant to him. He had poured his life into hockey, and it was taken away from him twice. Fred locked away his Stanley Cup ring. Wearing it wouldn’t bring back memories of a championship so much as remind him of the work he loved and the job he lost.

I’ve seen other scouts dropped by clubs, sometimes after 10 or even 20 years on a staff, and they too were unable to stay away from the arenas. Almost all of them landed something, if not right away then down the line. Fred’s pain was plain. I worried for him, not just professionally but at a much deeper level. Still do.Being a matchmaker was never my plan. I began volunteering at the shelter to help dogs. Just dogs. And the more time I spent with the dogs, the more my love for my fellow man withered.

At the shelter, I walked dogs that had been abandoned for trivial reasons or for no reason at all. I cared for pups that had been tied to utility poles on the street in wintertime, others so thin they had to wear coats in balmy spring weather, lacking the body mass to stay warm at 60 degrees. The more I walked these dogs, the more I became an animal person.

To be called an animal person is not necessarily a compliment, not when it implies that you love animals with a passion matched only by how much you loathe your own species. Animal people can be judgmental, self-righteous and cranky, all of which I was becoming.

As I spent more time at the shelter, I found that I became less patient with human beings, even my sweet husband. Walking the dogs would cheer me up, but my mood would darken as I fixated on the stupidity and carelessness of my fellow Homo sapiens. On the subway ride home I often caught myself frowning at strangers on the train.

Then I realized that if I truly wanted to help the dogs, I needed to do more than exercise or comfort them. I had to help them get out of the shelter faster, before kennel life turned them into whirling dervishes that no one would adopt. So I asked to be trained to introduce dogs to their potential adopters.

In the early going, helping with adoptions made my dismal opinion of people worse: I had to answer too many silly questions (“What are those droopy things on her belly?”) and field nonsensical requests (“I want a dog I can crate 12 hours a day, but who will run with me on weekends.”)

Then one Saturday afternoon I noticed a young, outdoorsy couple walking down the row of kennels, stopping to say hello to each dog. I asked if they wanted to meet one.

“Can we meet Ciera?” the man asked.

“Ciera?” I squeaked. “Really? I mean yes, of course you can.”

No one ever asked to see Ciera, a young mutt with skinny legs that went this way and that. Shiny and black, like a seal, she was cute but regularly pooped right in her kennel, then ran back and forth in it. She thought it was fun to grab your arm with her small mouth, hard, or if you dared sit on the floor, pounce on your head. She zoomed around her kennel as if on amphetamines.

This was her big chance. I didn’t want to mislead this couple about what a nut she was, but I did want her to find a home. I asked them to follow me to a bare-bones room with a stained rug and couch.

“Why don’t we stand?” I suggested.

As I began reading the notes on Ciera out loud, I dropped her leash and hoped for the best. She began ricocheting around the room, bouncing off the couch, the bookcases and the man’s legs as her leash snapped behind her. She was an air-bound blur of black, her mouth wide open, joy in her eyes. On one pass, she ripped my clipboard out of my hand and kept running.

As I muffled a sigh, the couple laughed. Hard. I looked up. Their faces glowed.

“I love her,” the man said.

“Me too,” said the woman. “We want her.”

Everyone knows that dogs can be firehose-like gushers of unqualified love. Humans, in contrast, have always struck me more as takers than givers, fickle lovers who are cagey with their affections and hearts. But in watching people tumble for goofballs like Ciera, I saw that my own species longs, maybe even needs, to gush unqualified love too, something we rarely do with other humans, even with a mate.

A dog may eat our Italian loafers but will never ghost us, or say, “We need to have a talk.” With them, we can let it all hang out. At the shelter, that’s what people did with our one-eyed pugs, our ancient hounds with bald patches and juveniles who hopped like kangaroos.

Watching people fall in love so completely with dogs, I began to see how humans long to give their hearts away.

Of course, there are outliers: cool customers set on French bulldogs of a certain shade, or people who turn up their noses at pit bulls, even the smoosh-mouthed little “pittie puppies.” And the difficulties of human relationships can keep the love from flowing.

I spent one afternoon introducing one small dog after another to a doughy man and his wife. As the man sighed happily at each pooch, his wife ran her hand over the dog’s coat, then sniffed her manicured fingers to check on her allergies.

“Not him. He’s making me sniffle.”

By the end of the afternoon, the man was sitting in the lobby with his head in his hands while his wife dug her fingers into a tangle of white fur named William.

“You’re breaking my heart,” he moaned.

I wanted to tell him to take William and leave the wife behind.

But most of us are like the middle-aged couple who came in looking for a mellow, pint-size dog to fit in their one-bedroom, beachside apartment. We had no miniatures that day, but on a long shot I pointed the men to a good-natured shepherd mix with a coat like a shag rug, about the size of a motorcycle.

“He might take up half the couch,” I told them, “but he’ll happily lounge all day.”

“He’s gigantic!” one exclaimed, smiling.

“We should go,” the other said.

For the next hour, each time I walked in and out of the kennels, there stood the couple, beaming at the behemoth. Watching them fall for the fuzzy giant — a dog completely at odds with what they claimed to want — I felt the remaining coldness in my heart for my species begin to thaw.

I wanted to help them. I wanted to help people do what they so obviously needed to do: love wholeheartedly, with reckless abandon. I had always thought of love as a response, but this couple and others showed me that it’s an innate feeling, something we are born with, and need to express.

Many of us have more love inside than we know what to do with, but are too bottled up. Which is where dogs can come in. With them, we can let our love flow freely without fear of being judged or rejected. They are like safety valves.

They certainly had become that for me. But as I saw the couple making kissy noises to the shepherd through his kennel door, I realized I had relied on dogs for this to a fault. With humans, I had bottled myself up. And love doesn’t like to be bottled up. That’s how you end up frowning at strangers on the train.

Watching people fall in love is contagious. I began to swoon at the whole scene. I loved the dog. I loved the couple.

“O.K., time you all met,” I announced, grabbing a leash.

Soon after, the three of them went home together, to try to squeeze into their cozy apartment. I returned to the kennels to help more people toss their hearts away.
