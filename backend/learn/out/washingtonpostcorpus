It can be a challenge to pitch policy to a president with little interest in policy. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/ABACA PRESS)

As the White House goes, so goes K Street. With each new administration, lobbyists, interest groups and other swamp creatures scramble to tailor strategies for getting their issues on the president’s agenda, developing fresh arguments grounded in the White House occupants’ principles, priorities and policy goals.

Obviously, no one expected to sway the coolly cerebral, professorial and progressive President Barack Obama with the same arguments that won over a self-proclaimed “decider” and “gut-player” like President George W. Bush. But now, influence-peddlers face an even greater challenge: figuring out how to best position themselves before President Trump, an unlikely commander in chief whose policy agenda and worldview appear thus far to lack the coherence of those of his 44 most recent predecessors.

Consider these examples of how ploys for presidential attention may have evolved over the past three administrations.

Your best case for investing in education

Bush: One way to reduce regulations is to enact multi-purpose ones. For example, when it comes to important questions like “Is our children learning?” “Anyone see the twins?” and “Will Jeb ever be president?,” here’s a threefer: No Child Left Behind.

Obama: Unfortunately, statistics show that 93 percent of Americans still lack the reading comprehension skills to follow a conversation between you and Michiko Kakutani.

Trump: No, sir, the state standards have nothing to do with the pizza place. Wait, this whole time you thought it was Comet Core?

Your best case for standing strong against Russia

Bush: We need to mobilize our most sophisticated intelligence resources to assess Vladimir Putin’s intentions — so would you mind looking deeply into his eyes again?

Obama: As much as we hoped for a new chapter in this relationship, Putin’s actions in Crimea suggest he forgot there’s no “I” in “peregruzka,” which the experts at State are at least 80 percent positive is Russian for “reset.”

Trump: The best way to remove this cloud of suspicion over your Russia dealings is to remember that smart sanctions are like a great necktie: broad, bold and designed to hit below the belt.

Your best case against torture

Bush: It paints an ugly picture of our country abroad. And you wouldn’t want to paint an ugly picture, would you?

Obama: Since you’ve already made clear that the United States doesn’t torture folks, let’s just break for lunch. Here, I brought you seven almonds.

Trump: Mad Dog and I don’t want to Merkel-splain about international conventions to you, sir, but who needs waterboarding when we could just make them watch “Saturday Night Live”?

Your best case for fighting climate change

Bush: Even if you don’t believe the science, we can’t misunderestimate the possible consequences: The hotter the weather, the bigger the storms, the more you’ll have to deal with Kanye.

Obama: Sen. James Inhofe found a snowball, so you can go ahead and cancel the Paris conference. Haha, obviously just kidding.

Trump: As the evidence — namely that DVD Leonardo DiCaprio gave to your daughter — makes clear, there’s at least some possibility that energy from the sun could be messing with our greenhouse gases. As you said, sir, you can do anything when you’re a star.

Your best case for paid family leave

Bush: This common-sense policy will open new doors of opportunity for hardworking American families. And we all know how hard it can be to open doors.

Obama: The United States is the only industrialized nation that doesn’t give workers paid family leave — and I imagine that makes America a little too exceptional for your taste.

Trump: If we let new mothers stay home until they’re done with the disgusting stuff like breast pumps and baby weight, we can Make Working Moms 8s Again.

Your best case for same-sex marriage

Bush: Even the vice president is for it, and you’re supposed to be the one with the good heart.

Obama: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. And it needs to bend a little faster than we planned because Joe went off script today.

Trump: Daddy, you’re embarrassing me and Jared in front of our friends!

What to expect when your orangutan is expecting

Two and a half centuries of political bickering — on Twitter

Gregg Popovich has led the Spurs to five NBA championships and emerged as one of President Trump’s most prominent critics in professional sports. (Adam Hunger/Associated Press)

Gregg Popovich called his old basketball coach from the Air Force Academy in late January and asked what Hank Egan, a friend and mentor of nearly 50 years, was up to.

Nothing? Then Popovich had a deal for him. Leave the late January chill of Colorado Springs, hop a plane and spend the week in sunny San Antonio, where Popovich — arguably the NBA’s best coach but definitely its most complex figure — coached the Spurs. Airline tickets, a hotel room and two good seats for Egan and his wife at AT&T Center — “Pop,” as he’s known, would take care of it all.

Egan agreed, but because this was Popovich he knew the package wouldn’t exactly be free. The 68-year-old Spurs coach isn’t just a five-time NBA champion and the architect of a franchise that is a model of consistency. He’s also one of the most complex figures in professional sports who has emerged as a forceful and unrelenting critic of President Trump and his administration’s more controversial policies.

More than just a high-profile sports figure with a megaphone, Popovich — previously best known off the court as a professional grouch — has revealed the inner workings of a curious, nuanced mind with a series of opinions noteworthy for their thoughtfulness.

“I’d just feel better,” Popovich told reporters the day after Trump’s inauguration, “if someone was in that position that showed the maturity and psychological and emotional level of somebody that was his age. It’s dangerous and it doesn’t do us any good.

“I hope he does a great job. But there’s a difference between respecting the office and the person who occupies it. That respect has to be earned. It’s hard to be respectful of someone when we all have kids, and we’re watching him be misogynistic and xenophobic and racist and make fun of handicapped people.”

[Popovich: ‘Do we have to talk about race? … Damned right we do.’]

More recently, Popovich has criticized Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, and this past week the coach suggested that the United States in Trump’s first month had the feel of a country being “invaded by another power.”

The NBA, which holds its annual All-Star Game in New Orleans on Sunday, is notable for the willingness of its stars and executives to wade into political and social activism. Within the league, Popovich stands out as a credible voice.

“Sometimes when life moves along,” he told reporters before a game at Indiana this past week, “you’re presented with situations where you find it necessary to speak because so many people either seem to be afraid to or, more sinister, are unwilling to face things and let things go and worry about their own situations.”

Popovich has never been especially willing to let things go. In fact, debate might truly be his favorite sport.

When Egan’s phone rang a few weeks ago, he heard the urgent voice of a man he’d first known as a walk-on player at the Air Force Academy. Back then Popovich, a striking combination of military man and Vietnam-era free spirit, spoke two Eastern European languages, majored in Soviet studies and drove a yellow Corvette. In his mind, he was going to become a real-life James Bond. But when that pursuit lacked the Sean Connery glamour he expected, Popovich returned home to master a complicated and diverse game — and to find his voice in an uncertain world.

Now here he is, and eight days after Trump was sworn in, Popovich called his former coach and invited him to San Antonio. Egan might not open his billfold for a week, but he knew Pop was bunched up and in the mood to argue; Egan, a wisecracking centrist from Brooklyn, was a reliable sparring partner.

“He’s on a mission to educate me,” the 79-year-old retired coach said by phone late in his week with Popovich.

Egan was sitting in a hotel room then, and a few hours later he and his wife would head to Popovich’s house. He knew they’d eat some complicated dish Egan would never remember, and after a while the Spurs coach would bring in a few selections from his 3,000-bottle wine collection.

Then at some point, one of them would say something to light the evening’s fuse, and with the pump primed with opinions and plenty of good red, away they’d go.

A natural curiosity

He’d sit in the bleachers after losses, alone and fuming. Popovich was somehow less patient then, and athletics officials at Division III Pomona-Pitzer — two small colleges in Southern California that shared an athletic department — knew their men’s basketball coach needed a novel way to blow off steam.

So into gym walked Pop’s designated arguer, armed with a few conversation starters to get the coach’s mind off another bad game.

More than 30 years ago, long before Popovich’s ornery wit turned NBA sideline interviews into a form of awkward performance art, Steven Koblik’s job was to tame a less subtle beast. Popovich put his hand through a blackboard once, threw chalk at players sometimes and once challenged any player to take a swing at him.

Koblik, a scholarly type with a collection of doctoral degrees, was the Sagehens’ academic adviser; his real job, he says now, was to keep Mount St. Popovich from erupting. The most effective technique was to engage Pop in a debate, a twisted form of relaxation for the coach’s restless mind.

Sometimes Koblik would bring up the Korean War or the underrated presidency of Dwight Eisenhower; he could challenge Popovich on the political climate in Sweden or Israel. Before long, Popovich could barely remember the latest loss.

Koblik saw a young coach with a natural curiosity about the world. Culture fascinated him, differences intrigued him; he could talk books or international affairs or the Reagan White House for hours. Popovich revealed he spoke Russian and Serbian (his immigrant parents’ native tongue), though finding much more about him was a challenge. In between the postgame therapy sessions, Popovich explored the two campuses and went looking for new ways to express himself.

He joined the schools’ fraternity committee and became involved in the campuses’ women’s commission. A part-time associate professor, Popovich moved his wife and two children into an on-campus dorm, and when his mind wandered, he’d invite friends or players over to argue about basketball or desegregation or the existence of God. If a conversation was stimulating enough, Popovich would approach his tiny wine rack, eight or nine bottles that were the seeds of a vast collection, and let the contents and conversation breathe.

“If he saw something that he thought was inequitable or wrong,” former Pomona-Pitzer player Tim Dignan says, “he spoke up for it. He wasn’t afraid to speak his mind.”

[Popovich: ‘Some days, I feel like we’ve been invaded.’]

Other times, as many others discovered, the man just liked to argue — and those who became his friends had that in common with him. Popovich would go on about the complex flavors of some California grape, and just to watch Popovich approach critical mass, Koblik would praise the finest vintages of Coors Light.

Popovich was always trying to prove something, on and off the basketball floor. He’d join pickup games with his players, never above throwing an elbow or a fist to create an opening. “Man,” former Sagehens co-captain Dan Dargan said recently, “you never wanted to guard him.”

He was always looking for the little advantages, a hallmark later of his coaching career, and he discovered that his professorship allowed for a one-year sabbatical. He spent it as a volunteer assistant at the University of Kansas, one of college basketball’s most prestigious programs. During that year, Popovich was such an eager volunteer assistant, such a tireless learner, so determined to be heard and noticed that legendary coach Larry Brown would indeed remember him and, in 1988, offer him a job with the Spurs. It was a startling career jump from basketball’s low rungs to its mountaintop, even for a talented coach. Other than two seasons as an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors in the early 1990s, Popovich has been in San Antonio since.

He’d still call Koblik sometimes, especially when he craved a rollicking debate, but over time Popovich learned to blend his interests: basketball with politics or history or an old-fashioned argument. He showed documentaries sometimes during film sessions, arranged field trips to historic sites, invited guest speakers such as the former Olympian John Carlos, who raised his fist on the medal stand in 1968, to share remarks with his team.

Popovich became purposely difficult during in-game television interviews whose purpose he never understood. Only Craig Sager, the late Turner Sports reporter whose garish suits and unbreakable charm were the perfect counterweights to Popovich’s impatient snarl, seemed to draw personality out of Popovich.

“I was always waiting for the next big interview,” said Craig Sager Jr., whose father died in December but who still answers his phone occasionally to hear Popovich’s voice. “I would almost keep score: One for Popovich, zero for Sager tonight.”

Sager was a worthy opponent, and that’s all Popovich ever wanted.

“He just wants to argue. He wants to debate. He wants what he calls a participatory environment,” said Danny Ferry, who played for and later worked with Popovich in San Antonio. “He does periodically enjoy mixing up a little dirt.”

Embracing his progressivism

For all the conversation starters and debate kindling, there is one topic he refuses to touch: that of Gregg Charles Popovich.

In the early 1990s, he was the best man at Larry Brown’s wedding, but now Brown cannot remember a single conversation in which Popovich talked about himself. Reggie Minton, still a close friend years after they were assistant coaches at Air Force, learned on long recruiting trips that the best way to keep a conversation going was to avoid asking Pop about Pop.

“He has made some new friends,” Minton said, “but he has probably lost some other friends in the process.”

Popovich is famously private, conversational evasion another favorite pastime, and nothing ends conversations or interviews faster than a pivot toward his personal life. The Spurs declined an interview request for this story, and following a news conference before a game in Philadelphia this month, Popovich abruptly ended an interview with The Washington Post after learning that the intended article’s subject was Popovich himself.

But the truth is, even some of his close friends know only superficial details about him. He prefers cooking shows to ESPN, and he treats the release of the NBA schedule like a holiday because he can comb Zagat for new restaurants to try. Popovich likes avant-garde movies and presidential biographies, and though he earns $11 million per year to coach basketball, he wishes his life were as cool as Anthony Bourdain’s.

Culture or politics or the gift of Tim Duncan, the future Hall of Fame center who was the foundation to all five of San Antonio’s championships, are ripe topics. But how he grew up?

“We talked about God, we talked about religion, very personal things,” said Koblik, who has known Popovich for close to 40 years. “But never about his childhood. That just wasn’t part of what we talked about.”

The reasons he left Merrillville, Ind., to enroll at the Air Force Academy determined to play basketball despite not having been recruited?

“We never have discussed that,” Egan said, “and I would not want to discuss it with him. . . . You don’t ask questions about that stuff.”

The mysterious two years between graduating from the Academy and returning to the school as an assistant coach?

“I thought he was a spook,” said Dargan, the former Pomona-Pitzer player. “You go to the Air Force Academy and speak Russian and you disappear for a few years? Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. Nobody knows.”

Actually, Koblik did pry that much out of him: Popovich spent those two years translating Russian chatter on the border of Turkey, Koblik said. But he was less “007” than stenographer, which was boring to him, and so he returned home after fulfilling his active duty requirement.

Over the years he embraced his progressivism, the aging hippie who never stopped wanting to fight the power, though for a long time he did so quietly. He made donations to Democratic causes and candidates, but last year he began displaying his leanings more publicly.

He expressed support for San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the national anthem before games last season as a form of protest against police brutality and social injustice. He attended last year’s gay pride parade in New York and, during last fall’s presidential campaign, openly wondered whether the United States was approaching a tipping point similar to the one that led to the fall of the Roman Empire.

“The question is: Are we in that process and we don’t even know it?” Popovich was quoted as saying in October by the Wall Street Journal. “I really am starting to think about that. It’s not just the two candidates. It’s the way the whole thing is being treated.”

[Popovich: ‘My big fear is — we are Rome.’]

He zeroed in on Trump, saying after he won the election that the result made him feel “sick to my stomach.”

“What gets lost in the process are African Americans, and Hispanics, and women, and the gay population — not to mention the eighth-grade developmental stage exhibited by him when he made fun of the handicapped person — I mean, come on. That’s what a seventh-grade, eighth-grade bully does. And he was elected president of the United States.

“We would have scolded our kids. We would have had discussions until we were blue in the face trying to get them to understand these things. He is in charge of our country. That’s disgusting.”

Popovich, who in 2015 was named the new coach of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, cleared his mind — or solidified his thoughts — by going for long walks or drives, occasionally dialing old friends to ask what they thought about some issue confronting the country. Before he fully made up his mind, he wanted to consider the views of others.

They’d talk, and he’d listen or sometimes argue. Every once in a while, if the discussion was good enough, Popovich would ask whether the friend might like to come down to San Antonio, open a few bottles of the good stuff and talk more about it.

Interest in other people

The day after the dinner at Popovich’s house, Egan spent the first Saturday of February watching from the middle of the lower level of AT&T Center.

The Spurs dismantled the Denver Nuggets, and Egan found himself admiring the fluidity of San Antonio’s offense, the chemistry of its players, the discipline he can trace back to the Academy. But mostly he watched Popovich, who in his 21st season is the longest-tenured head coach in U.S. professional sports, identify with players and coaches who transcend cultures, nations and backgrounds: Tony Parker, a point guard from France; Manu Ginobili, a shooting guard from Argentina; Kawhi Leonard, a small forward from Los Angeles. Four years ago, 10 of San Antonio’s players were born outside the United States, the most international roster in NBA history. Popovich’s assistant coaches include Becky Hammon, the first woman to be hired full-time as an NBA assistant, and Ettore Messina, a famed EuroLeague coach.

“He is genuinely interested in other people, from other places,” Egan later said of Popovich. “That might scare some coaches, but Pop looks forward to it.”

Egan said the dinner conversation wound up being milder than he’d imagined. Popovich was in a good mood; maybe his comments about Black History Month, systemic racism and more criticism of Trump — who he blamed for fueling racism by attempting to delegitimize Barack Obama’s presidency by questioning his citizenship — helped release the steam.

“It’s a celebration of some of the good things that have happened and a reminder that there’s a lot more work to do,” Popovich told reporters in early February, pivoting toward race relations in general. “But more than anything, I think if people take the time to think about it, I think it is our national sin.”

Egan was in the arena when Popovich made those remarks. The entire experience, he said, made him think back to the early 1970s, when a kid from Indiana arrived at the Air Force Academy and refused to keep quiet.

He’d ask questions and test boundaries and argue until Egan told him to go away. He’d do so for a while, but then the team would be on a bus or a plane, headed on a road trip to some new and interesting land, and the kid would slide into the row next to Egan.

The coach would roll his eyes but let him talk, about Vietnam or the coaches’ game plan or whatever else was on his mind, Egan occasionally entertained but mostly wondering when the day would come that the argumentative kid would grow out of this.This entry was posted in Featured Partner .

The D.C. Council will begin considering dramatic revisions in the coming weeks to the District’s new law guaranteeing expansive family and medical leave benefits to private-sector workers, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said Friday.

In an interview, Mendelson said he was suggesting changes because opposition from local business leaders could hinder the success of the program, which would offer eight weeks of parental leave, six weeks to care for an ailing relative and two weeks of personal sick time — a package that would be among the nation’s most generous.

He said that in recent weeks, business groups have offered suggestions for changing the law that might be workable.

The bill, which the council passed 9 to 4 in December, advanced through the mayor’s office this week and must now be submitted to Congress for a 30-day review period. Even after that, there will be time to reviseD.C. C the legislation, whose main provisions are not scheduled to take effect for several years.

Mendelson said he expects alternative versions of the bill to be filed with the council over the next month. Although the benefits would remain the same, the means of paying for them may be redesigned in a way more palatable to the business community, with a lower tax rate and possibly the use of private insurance plans, he said.

Mendelson said the city may also turn to a private contractor to run the system rather than setting up the new government department envisioned in the current legislation.

“There’s a lot of pushback over the tax rate and the creation of a new, huge bureaucracy,” he said. While council members may ultimately decide not to amend the law, he said, “I think we should look at some alternative ideas and see if there’s something there.”

Mendelson’s remarks were an unexpected turn in the District’s efforts to establish paid family leave for all workers. The bill was a landmark victory for the council’s progressive faction and drew support from labor activists across the country.

By proposing that the council reexamine the law, Mendelson seemed in a sense to be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory: Just this week, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), a fervent opponent of the bill, announced that she would not veto it. Mendelson oversaw the drafting of the existing bill and argued forcefully for its passage.

“This is surprising to hear, because the chairman has been such a convincing and passionate defender of the legislation,” said council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), who began leading the push for a paid-leave bill more than a year ago with council member David Grosso (I-At Large). “I would welcome improvements, but this does seem like a rehashing of a debate we’ve already had.”

In its current version, the law would levy a 0.62 percent tax on employer-paid payroll taxes. Using that revenue, the city would reimburse employees for 90 percent of their first $900 in weekly pay and 50 percent of their remaining weekly pay, with a cap of $1,000 per week. The District’s chief financial officer estimates that the city could begin offering those benefits during the 2019 fiscal year.

The benefits would not apply to federal workers or to the 35,000 people employed by the District government.

Mendelson said he plans to consider alternatives that would shrink the size of the payroll-tax increase and use the money solely to help pay for benefits for employees of small businesses, perhaps through insurance policies.

Larger employers — many of which already have leave policies — would be mandated to provide the amount of leave required by the legislation.

Many of the details are still being worked out, Mendelson said, such as what size constitutes a “small” employer and how far the tax rate should be lowered.

One draft plan from the business community that has been floated to council members suggests a fee on employers with 50 or more workers that would not exceed 0.1 percent of payroll.

Mendelson said he would introduce one or more bills fleshing out such ideas in the coming weeks unless other council members introduce similar legislation.

Business groups have been arguing for months for an “employer mandate” approach to paid leave. Mendelson had previously rejected their suggestions, saying they would create a burden for small businesses.

Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who sided with business leaders and voted against the leave bill, said Mendelson’s new openness could be the result of a political calculation as he looks forward to the 2018 election.

Evans said Mendelson may have realized only in recent weeks how unpopular the paid-leave law is among influential business groups, such as the Greater Washington Board of Trade and the D.C. Chamber of Commerce. “I’m sure he’s looking at the tea leaves, saying, ‘Wow, I pissed a lot of people off,’ ” Evans said.

Mendelson said it was “nonsense” to impute political motives to his willingness to listen to the business community. He said the new approaches suggested in recent weeks are more likely to address his concerns about small businesses than those put forward last year, before the law was approved.

As a practical matter, he said, supporters of paid leave also have a vested interest in securing the support of the mayor, who could still hinder the law — for example, by moving slowly to set up the technology system that would be required for the city to administer benefits.

“We can get the bill through — we can get the votes, we can get past the mayor, we can get the bill in place,” he said. However, “If the Board of Trade and the Chamber of Commerce are going to continue to scream and yell, it’s going to be more difficult.”

He added: “We know the mayor doesn’t like the bill. So if there’s a lot of business upset, then she’s going to be incentivized to move very slowly to implement the bill.”

Grosso said he was open to hiring a contractor to run the city’s benefit system and had made similar suggestions in the past. He said he was much more skeptical of arguments to lower the existing tax rate on businesses and said an employer mandate would be difficult to enforce

“I still am adamantly opposed to any kind of employer-mandate approach,” Grosso said. “There is no enforcement mechanism in D.C. government that is good enough to monitor whether these employers are providing these benefits to their employees.”Post POV: The Future of the Corcoran – The Washington Post’s Philip Kennicott recently wrote that the Corcoran Gallery of Art’s mission was defined as the collection, the college and the community.

Thursday’s hearing might have been the first shot for this Congress, but it’s not likely the last.

Two House subcommittees joined forces for Republicans to hit what they consider to be abuses of “official time.” That system allows government labor organization officials to engage in certain, but certainly not all, union-related activities while being paid by federal agencies.

Federal employees and their representatives can expect other actions affecting the workforce, in fact those actions have already begun.

Thursday marked the first hearing, but President Trump earlier imposed a temporary hiring freeze. Just before Trump took office, House Republicans reinstated the long dormant Holman Rule that permits Congress to strip the pay of individual federal employees.

Official time has long been a Republican target. But now, Republicans know they have a better chance at success because they have a friend in the White House, albeit a mercurial one.

Federal union leaders know it too.

They and their Democratic allies in Congress are fighting back, but they have a difficult battle. On the official time question, for example, no matter how often they point out that official time is used for such things as improving productivity and resolving workplace problems, Republicans narrowly and inaccurately cast it as a system allowing union people to do union business on the taxpayer’s dime.

The hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations and the House Veterans’ Affairs economic opportunity subcommittee focused on official time in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA is an easy target and not just because it is still spinning from the scandal that broke in 2014 over the coverup of long patient wait times. The VA also accounted for about one-third of all the federal government hours spent on official time from 2008 to 2012, according to a Government Accountability Office report that cited Office of Personnel Management (OPM) statistics.

One more thing makes the VA an easy target — poor bookkeeping.

GAO found the VA “could not accurately track the amount of time its employees spend on official time at the VA agency-wide,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the oversight subcommittee. “With the VA taking up one-third of the official time for the entire federal government, it’s important that it employs accurate methods to calculate and records to show how much time we’re spending on those union activities.”

In the report released at the hearing, GAO said VA’s data “were not sufficiently reliable to determine the amount of official time used by VA employees and the purposes for which it was used.”

Meadows said OPM statistics indicate “345 VA employees spent all of their time engaged on union activities … so they were essentially full time on official time. That means that 345 VA employees spent all of their time engaged on union activities.”

William Kovacs III, also known as Trey, a policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, has suggested using the Holman Rule to “simply get rid of federal employees who spend 100 percent of their work hours on labor union business instead of actual government work.” He testified at Thursday’s hearing, but this statement was taken from his January article in the Hill.

But what Kovacs calls “union business” also benefits non-union members and agency missions.

Using official time for strictly union business, such as soliciting members, internal union meetings and union elections, is prohibited, J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), told the hearing. AFGE represents VA staffers.

The GAO report shows that most VA managers and union officials surveyed agreed that official time was beneficial in improving agency decision-making, resolving problems and improving relationships — all items that help productivity.

“The reasonable use of official time provides the means, not only in DVA [Department of Veterans Affairs] but also throughout the federal government by which employees and their elected representatives participate in the improvement of DVA services,” Cox said.

Democrats on the panel also stressed the importance of official time in protecting whistleblowers, a group of federal employees politicians of both parties make a point of supporting.

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) made that point with a video of Michelle Washington. As a VA psychologist, she suffered retaliation after her Senate testimony about poor conditions at the VA hospital in Wilmington, Del. Connolly read a letter from her that said: “‘If official time had not been available to the AFGE representatives we may not have been able to defend my case. It would have set a precedent that management can retaliate without consequence.’”

Added Connolly: “I am certain that my colleagues do not intend to disadvantage whistleblowers, but the effect of their concerted attacks on unions and civil service protections would be to strip whistleblowers of their advocates in the workplace — their union.”

That seems to be the point.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The flames from the 2016 San Francisco Giants’ dumpster fire of a bullpen, as flames are wont to do, did the most damage to those in closest proximity. The actual members of those 2016 Giants may never fully get over the last and most spectacular of that bullpen’s many disasters, in Game 4 of the National League Division Series, when five relievers failed to hold a three-run lead in the ninth inning at AT&T Park, and lost the game and the series to a Chicago Cubs team that would go on to win the World Series.

But viewed from a safe distance, that fire was just a great, sad spectacle on the horizon, one that, if you had any empathy in your heart, would make you feel sorry for the victims. That’s how it looked on television from the comfortable chair where Mark Melancon, a soon-to-be free agent closer, watched with a bit more interest than most of the rubberneckers and gawkers.

“You feel for everybody,” Melancon said of the experience of watching Game 4 on television. “You can’t blame [the loss] on anybody. You lose collectively, and it happened.”

[The Cubs try to strike a balance between remembering their title and moving on]

Melancon, wearing a polo shirt, shorts and sandals, said those words in the dugout at Scottsdale Stadium on Friday following the Giants’ first full-squad workout of the 2017 spring training, and the Giants seemed already a more complete team by his very presence. He signed a four-year, $62 million contract with them on Dec. 5, but you could say he became a Giant the moment the Cubs recorded the final out of Game 4, at the end of that epic bullpen meltdown that shuttered San Francisco’s season.

The Giants’ front office acted swiftly and decisively to solve the team’s most glaring problem, phoning Melancon’s agent within minutes of the free-agent market opening at midnight on Nov. 8. They flew Melancon to San Francisco for a visit, made an offer and eventually outbid several other teams — including the Washington Nationals, for whom Melancon pitched in the second half of 2016 — for his services.

“We wanted to get in early,” Giants General Manager Bobby Evans said of the Melancon pursuit. “We knew we were going to be in a battle with other clubs, and we just wanted to make it clear early on that we had a lot of interest.”

It took the richest contract in history for a closer — a mark that was topped in the weeks that followed by both Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen — for the Giants to land Melancon, as their payroll will likely soar beyond $200 million for the first time in 2017.

[The Mets will rise and fall on the arms of their young pitchers]

“There was so much positive here,” Melancon said of the Giants. “I enjoyed my time in Washington, but these guys have done it, and they’ve done it consistently. It’s the same core. On my visit here, it was just clear they had their priorities straight. Even their smaller intangibles — it was a great fit.” Of the Giants’ Game 4 loss, he added, “Really, when I was thinking about where to go and deciding, I looked at that as a positive — because these guys have gone through some trials and it’s going to make them hungrier.”

With his 92-mph cut fastball, Melancon, who turns 32 next month, has become one of the best closers in baseball since ascending to that role with the Pirates in the second half of 2013; his 131 saves since the start of the 2014 season are the most in the majors in that span. Last year, which he split between Pittsburgh and Washington, he converted 47 of 51 save attempts, pitched to a 1.64 ERA and allowed only three home runs all season while facing 270 batters.

Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the Giants’ bullpen, once the envy of baseball, was on its way to blowing a franchise-record 32 saves in 2016, with nine of them coming in September. Eight Giants relievers made 40 or more appearances — despite a rotation featuring three of the top five starters in the NL in innings pitched — as Manager Bruce Bochy tried everything he could to mix-and-match his way through the late innings.

It all came to a head in Game 4. The Giants were three outs from forcing a decisive Game 5 at Wrigley Field, where they would have had Johnny Cueto on the mound (and Madison Bumgarner available in relief), but Bochy cycled through five relievers in a futile attempt to close it out. The loss was the first for the Giants in 12 postseason series under Bochy.

[Excited for the World Baseball Classic? Yeah, that’s what we thought.]

In the aftermath, it was difficult not to play the “what if” game, especially since the Giants had had a chance to trade for Melancon at the July 31 trade deadline, but lost out when the Pirates sent him instead to the Nationals for a pair of hard-throwing, young lefties, Felipe Rivero and Taylor Hearn. Evans, the Giants’ GM, later acknowledged he should have been more willing to give up what the Pirates sought in return to Melancon.

“When we finished the postseason like that, my mind went immediately to the players — because I knew they did everything they could to get us into that position, and to not finish it was very hard,” Evans said Friday. “But it gave us perspective on what we needed to do this winter, and we tried to answer our biggest need with arguably one of the best [closers] out there.”

Remaking the Giants’ bullpen was as much about subtraction as addition. With the free-agent defections of right-handers Santiago Casilla (to the Oakland A’s) and Sergio Romo (to the Los Angeles Dodgers) this winter, and the retirement of lefty Javier Lopez, the Giants cut ties with a trio of cornerstones who had been part of the team’s World Series-winning bullpens of 2010, 2012 and 2014.

That leaves only one reliever left in the Giants’ bullpen, right-hander Hunter Strickland, who was part of one of their World Series championships.

Difficult as it is to say goodbye, there will come a day soon when the bullpen gate at AT&T Park will open, and the person jogging through it toward the mound will give all who witness it a feeling of calm, instead of one of anxiety.

But one deeply submerged, nagging thought will be fighting to reach the surface: How far might the Giants have gone if they had had Mark Melancon last October?

Interviews by Michele Langevine Leiby

Two strangers find out they have so many things in common, it’s “creepy.” But is it creepy in a good way? Or a bad way? Lindsey Gendron, 24, an MBA student and research analyst for a nonprofit, and Ryan Rabac, 24, a digital marketing manager for a nonprofit, tried to figure that out at Ella’s Wood Fired Pizza in Penn Quarter.

Lindsey: I was super-nervous about being late. That would have been really hella awkward.

Ryan: I’m used to being the first person to get somewhere, but she was already there.

Lindsey: I stood up and hugged him. ... No shaking hands.

Ryan: I think we were both nervous at first, so we wanted to sit down and talk for a little bit.

Lindsey: We didn’t order food until after an hour. We just weren’t looking at the menu because we were talking.

Ryan: She is strictly vegetarian, and I said I was mostly vegetarian. We both like craft beer. ... We’re both afraid of mushrooms, so that was a good match.

Lindsey: I actually didn’t do my own application. My best friend did. She was dead-on in all of her answers because we lived together all four years in college, so we know each other really well.

Ryan: We were both sarcastic and dishing it out back and forth. We had an absolute blast. I had a good friend who did Date Lab a couple years ago, so I started talking about his experience and joking about that, and that made it easier.

Lindsey: We have kind of a creepy amount in common. I mentioned I am Croatian, and he was like, “I am too.” That is very random. It came up when we were talking about travel or something.

Ryan: On my form I said my type was blondes. And she was asking if she was blond enough. I wasn’t too serious about what my type was. [It was] a joke.

Lindsey: We belong to the same gym. He tried yoga, which I think is awesome because I like yoga.

Ryan:I don’t even remember what we had said, but we started laughing uncontrollably for a couple minutes, and I thought, Oh, all right, that’s pretty good then. We can be that entertained with each other.

Lindsey: No offense, but there were a couple weirder questions [on the Date Lab questionnaire], like “What was the most luxurious thing you’ve ever bought for yourself?” [Ryan] put down a $6 carton of eggs from Whole Foods because it had the chickens’ backstory pamphlet with it. He was like, “I was really treating myself to some nicely treated eggs and chickens.” That was funny.

Ryan: We had to do all the typical complaining about politics in the world in its current state.

Lindsey: For me, it’s important to discuss that, especially in the political climate now. We have very similar views. ... There are certain things I’m not willing to compromise on like abortion and gay marriage.

Ryan: We joked that she was a Patriots fan and that might be a dealbreaker.

Lindsey: When he took [his phone] out to take a final selfie, his mom had texted him, “How’s the date going?” And then he sent a picture of us to his mom, which was funny. ... God, I hope I don’t embarrass him.

Ryan:We were allowed to stay after hours. That made it a more fun, unique experience.

Lindsey: Something I found attractive in him is that he was just very chill.

Ryan:It was about 12:30 a.m. when I went home. It was a lot of fun for a Monday. Probably the most fun I’ve had on a Monday for a long time.

Lindsey: I’m not super straightforward, but I had had a couple of beers, and when we were leaving, I was like, “Yeah, do you want my number?”

Ryan: I almost forgot [to ask]. It’s rare that you go on a truly

blind date, so I wasn’t thinking about the fact that I didn’t have

her contact information to begin with.

Rate the date

Lindsey: 4.5 [out of 5]. I wouldn’t die if I never see him again. I’ll be disappointed and a little bitter, but I can take a hint. [Laughs].

Ryan: 4. I thought we got along extremely well right from the start. The time passed very quickly.

FORECAST IN DETAIL

We’ve got warm times ahead this weekend and for most of the upcoming week.

Today (Saturday): This one should be remembered for its sunshine and warm temperatures more than anything, and both should be rather glorious. Sure it’s Presidents’ Day Weekend, a time when we’ve had some monumental snowstorms, but how can we complain about highs largely in the mid-and-upper 60s? I know I won’t. We may see some high-level clouds as soon as morning, but they probably don’t really thicken until late in the day as the sun drifts toward the horizon. Winds are from the southwest around 10 mph. It’s on the edge of Nice Day, but in February there’s little doubt. Confidence: Medium-High

Tonight: Clouds thicken up and lower through the evening. It’s a mostly cloudy night, and we could even see a few light and passing showers. It’s hard to say we will for sure but there is a weak storm system passing to our south. It’s well south and very weak, but if you’re out very late, don’t be surprised to see some rain drops. Lows dip to the 44 to 50 zone. Confidence: Medium

Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend …

Tomorrow (Sunday): Clouds should be out of here with sun rise, but it’s still the time of year that if they linger they can keep temperatures muted. So, some caution is advised. Not a lot of caution, though! I think the day is largely wonderful as mostly sunny skies dominate from at least midmorning onward. If we get near-full sunshine, temperatures are up near 70. If not, somewhere in the 60s. Not bad, either way. Confidence: Medium

Tomorrow night: Mostly clear skies and light winds allow temperatures to fall quickly in the evening. However, they have a long way to go. Lows are a little cooler than tonight thanks to the clear skies, with readings mainly in the low-and-mid 40s, perhaps closer to 50 downtown. Confidence: Medium

A LOOK AHEAD

Clear skies should continue to be the rule for Presidents’ Day Monday. It’s a really pleasant one all around, although it might be a touch cooler as wind directions shift for a bit. In this case, cooler means not quite as above average as today and tomorrow. Instead, we’re looking at temperatures probably mostly within a few degrees of 60. While it won’t be as extreme as last weekend’s temperature gradient, it could be a case where it’s in the 50s for northern suburbs and low-to-mid 60s for southern suburbs. Winds are light and variable. Confidence: Medium

Cooler air continues to sink into the area from the north on Tuesday. It’s still not truly cool for February, but closer to normal. Highs should mainly be in the mid-50s to near 60, but could have trouble hitting the mid-50s once you’re north of the city by a bit. Clouds tend to increase during the second half of the day as a very weak front approaches from the west. Any slight chance of showers should wait until overnight. Confidence: Medium- Director of Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt was sworn in by Justice Samuel Alito on Feb. 17 after the U.S. Senate confirmed him over the objections of Democrats and environmentalists worried he will gut the agency.

You’re all set!Scientist Feng Zhang has done revolutionary research on the gene-editing technique CRISPR from his lab at the Broad Institute in Massachusetts. (Joel Achenbach/TWP)

Feng Zhang occupies a corner office on the 10th floor of the gleaming, modern biotechnology palace called the Broad Institute. He is one of the most acclaimed young scientists in the United States, regularly mentioned, even at 35, as a possible Nobel laureate.

That’s because of CRISPR, the gene-editing technique that lets scientists manipulate the genetic code of organisms almost like revising a sentence with a word processor. Zhang was one of its pioneers, and on Wednesday he emerged victorious after a bitter patent dispute.

The ruling, by judges with the U.S. Patent Office, declared that Zhang’s work on living plant and animal cells was sufficiently original to deserve its own protection. It was a decisive outcome that will surely prove lucrative for Zhang and the Broad Institute, but he did not do anything special to celebrate. He made no immediate public comment. He did not even read the news coverage, he said.

“The patent stuff is not so interesting, and it can be distracting,” the soft-spoken scientist offered a day later, finally addressing the case as he sat down with a Washington Post reporter for a previously scheduled interview. “Now we can get back to work.”

The patent dispute was closely followed in the triangle of geography marked by the institute, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Here, in what has become the Silicon Valley of the life sciences, Zhang and his colleagues have spun off ventures that can commercialize their inventions.

CRISPR is an all-purpose tool that promises great advances in the prevention of diseases caused by genetic mutations. In China, Zhang’s birth country, it is already being used in human clinical trials.

Yet the technique has also raised unsettling possibilities for cosmetic human enhancements and “designer babies.” Earlier this week, the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine produced a long report on the ethics of gene editing, arguing for extreme caution when dealing with heritable human traits but leaving open the possibility of use to remove disease-causing genes.

Some critics worry about a slippery slope, but Zhang thinks the bioethics committee got it just right.

“I think these are important issues, but I don’t think right at this second we should be overly concerned about it. It’s too far off,” he said.

The politics of science

Even with the patent case behind him, however, there is another significant distraction these days. It arises not through the courts but from the White House.

Science is inherently an international enterprise, built around a universal language of discovery and methodology. Zhang’s lab, like similar facilities across the country, has a large percentage of foreign-born scientists drawn to research opportunities in the United States.

President Trump’s executive order banning entry from seven Muslim-majority countries has alarmed this global community. The Broad, as it is commonly called, put out a statement of opposition, saying the order “turns its back on one of America’s greatest sources of strength: the flow of visitors, immigrants and refugees who have enriched our nation with their ideas, dreams, drive, energy, and entrepreneurship.”

Zhang talks of his own life story when asked about Trump’s action.

“From my own experience, America has been an amazing place,” he said. “And it sort of gives opportunities for immigrants to realize what they want to do, to reach for their potential, and also, by doing that, make the world a better place. I’m very fortunate to have had the opportunity to move here.”

He was 11 when he first came to the United States in 1993. He spoke almost no English, arriving with his father to at last rejoin his mother. The teeming city of Shijiazhuang, in the north of China, was replaced by the alien landscape of Des Moines.

His mother had not intended to stay following her studies here, but Iowans embraced her. She got a good job with a company called the Paper Corp. She decided to start a new life and bring her son and husband to the United States. They each received a series of visas and green cards. She eventually became a citizen, as did her son. Her husband remains a Chinese citizen.

“I never felt I was discriminated against. I never felt we weren’t welcome there,” Zhang said of his youth in the heartland. And there were other immigrants, too, many of them Vietnamese refugees from war zones. He spent half the day learning English and then playing word bingo to hone his vocabulary.

He hung out with other kids interested in science. “We were all nerds,” he said. As a teenager, he got a position working after school at the Human Gene Therapy Research Institute. He could call himself a bench scientist, often working late into the evening while his mother waited for him in the parking lot.

Elite institutions soon recognized his brilliance. His résumé includes a degree from Harvard, then a doctorate from Stanford. He learned about the natural bacterial immune system, CRISPR, an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.

Bacteria evolved a defense mechanism against viral invaders that would insert genetic material into bacterial DNA. The system functions like molecular scissors, snipping away the invasive material.

Two other researchers, who would become rivals in the patent case, published the first paper describing the gene-editing technique and applied for patents. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier showed how to turn the natural bacterial system into a laboratory tool, but initially they did not apply it to plant and animal cells. That was Zhang’s breakthrough, published in 2013 at the same time as a similar paper by Harvard geneticist George Church.

“Feng was very early in recognizing the importance of reducing it to practice in mammalian cells,” Church said this week.

Doudna and Charpentier can still receive patents on their original discovery. In an email Friday to The Post, Doudna wrote, “Obviously the Broad Institute is happy that their patent didn’t get thrown out, but we are pleased that our patent can now proceed to be issued.”

But she raised another concern. The judges’ decision was based in part on public comments she made, expressing uncertainty about whether CRISPR would work in cells with nuclei. Because of that, she fears the ruling could have a chilling effect on scientific communication.

“Must every scientist now factor in a potential patenting strategy and alter how transparent they are about their work?” Doudna wrote.

Doudna and Charpentier have already received the $3 million Breakthrough Prize funded by Silicon Valley tech tycoons. Then earlier this year they won the Japan Prize, each receiving the equivalent of about $420,000.

And lurking out there somewhere is the Nobel.

‘Why do we age?’

On Thursday, the morning after the ruling, Zhang drove his 2004 BMW to work as always, arriving at 7:30 to meet with a student and help him prepare for a class presentation. Then he had a call with an oil executive in the United Arab Emirates who is funding research on a genetic disease that affects the executive’s daughter.

He still has a spot in his lab for experiments, though he does those during the summer since right now he’s busy teaching two classes. The lab work is in the hands of about 20 researchers, some already with doctorates and medical degrees.

CRISPR gets all the publicity these days, but it is not the only game in town. Life is a complex chemical system that over billions of years has developed all sorts of tricks and mechanisms. Most of the microbes in the human gut have never been cultured or characterized. Basic questions remain unanswered.

“Why do we age?” Zhang asked.

The CRISPR system is itself a work in progress. It’s an inexact editor still.

“It cuts very well,” he said. “To insert something, it doesn’t work very well at all.”

But he’s working on that. Everyone stand by.Drink the District Save $5 on tickets to Drink the District: Rock the Core Cider Fest, October 29 at The Yards This entry was posted in Save - test . Bookmark the permalink

Swedish YouTube star Felix Kjellberg, also known as PewDiePie, poses on the red carpet at the Inaugural Social Star Awards in Singapore on May 23, 2013. (Stephen Morrison/European Pressphoto Agency)

Felix Kjellberg, a.k.a. PewDiePie, a.k.a. YouTube’s biggest star, spoke for the first time Thursday about his extremely bad week in the spotlight. He was apologetic and furious.

“I’m sorry for the words that I used, as I know they offended people and I admit that the joke itself went too far,” Kjellberg said in a video posted to his channel on Thursday, four days after a bunch of Nazi jokes on his channel became a huge news story that had some very real consequences for his career. “I do strongly believe that you can joke about anything, but I also believe there’s a right way, and not the best way, to joke about things.”

That was from the apologetic part. But the majority of the 11-minute response Kjellberg posted was devoted to his feelings about the media who broke the story about him in the first place. The media has only been interested in writing about the millions of dollars he makes as a YouTuber, he said. They don’t “get” him, and now they are taking him out of context as a “personal attack.”

[Anti-Semitic jokes cause YouTube, Disney to distance themselves from PewDiePie]

In case you don’t remember, here is what happened: On Monday, the Wall Street Journal published an article identifying nine PewDiePie videos that contained anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery. For example, in one recent video, Kjellberg paid two South Asian men via the freelancer site Fiverr to hold up a sign that read, “Death to all Jews.” He paid another Fiverr freelancer to dress up as Jesus and film himself saying “Hitler did nothing wrong.”

The Wall Street Journal also revealed that, as a result of them bringing these videos to the attention of Disney, the YouTuber would lose his longtime relationship with the entertainment company’s Maker Studios. YouTube itself then more or less disavowed its biggest star the next day, canceling the release of the next season of a reality series he made in partnership with YouTube Red, and revoking his inclusion in a lucrative, premium advertising program.

“If there’s anything I learned about the media from being a public figure is how they blatantly misrepresent people for their own personal gain, and even viciously attack people just to further themselves,” Kjellberg said in his response video. Later, he called the entire Wall Street Journal piece, and the ensuing media attention, “an attack by the media to try to discredit me, to decrease my influence, and my economic [success]. That’s what this was.”

The full video is here, with an obligatory language warning for this and any other PewDiePie videos embedded in this piece.

Whether this response surprises you or not probably depends on how familiar you are with what Kjellberg does on YouTube. He is usually described in news articles as that guy who got famous and rich for filming himself making jokes and screaming a lot while playing scary video games. And sure, Kjellberg filmed himself playing his way through the extremely scary “Resident Evil 7″ a couple of weeks ago, just as pretty much every other YouTuber who emulated his early success to find their own audiences did. But Kjellberg, who calls his fans “bros” and often vlogs as if he is in conversation with them, has long used his channel to complain about and criticize the institutions that, he feels, don’t respect or understand him or his like-minded fans.

The media has long been one of these institutions, as has YouTube itself. In December, he announced that he was going to delete his channel at 50 million subscribers (he didn’t) because of some changes he didn’t like to how YouTube shows videos to people on the site. In the video, which has 22 million views, he claims that “YouTube is trying to kill my channel.”

“It’s because I’m always complaining to them. I don’t have family-friendly content. I clickbait too much, huh, is that it?” He keeps going: “They want someone really extremely cancerous, like Lilly Singh. I’m white. Can I make that comment? But I do think that’s a problem.”

Singh, a.k.a. IISuperwomanII, is a Canadian-Indian YouTube personality. In a follow-up video, Kjellberg said that those who took his comments about her negatively (and the insinuation that YouTube was trying to kill his channel because he’s white) were unable to understand that he was just joking about it.

That move should sound familiar. Saying something racist or otherwise offensive and then responding to outrage by, essentially, accusing the opponent of not getting the joke, is a core part of the Internet that has helped to make PewDiePie a success.

Kjellberg has recently disavowed the support of white supremacists in the alt-right, whose online culture also relies on the same orientation toward offense. He had to do that because there had been recent speculation among the alt-right that maybe Kjellberg was secretly one of their own — or that he might be about to come around to their worldview.

The Daily Stormer, a white nationalist blog, cheered on PewdiePie last month, writing that “it doesn’t matter” whether the YouTuber’s anti-Jewish jokes were genuine or simply attention-seeking trolling, “since the effect is the same; it normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies.” Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Jonathan Vick, an Anti-Defamation League associate director, argued that Kjellberg’s jokes were having this normalizing effect, because “Just putting it out there brings it more and more into the mainstream.”

On Thursday, Kjellberg appeared to respond to this too, by saying he believed it was his critics who were normalizing racism, and not him. “They are the ones normalizing hatred because there is actual hatred out there,” he said. “Instead of celebrating my show getting canceled, why don’t we focus on that instead?”

If Donald Trump were an off-the-street federal job applicant, he most likely would not be granted a security clearance. Measured against the standards applied to thousands of Americans involved with our national security, knowledge essential to granting Trump access to classified information simply isn’t there.

Security clearances are granted after determining that an individual’s personal and professional histories make it safe to do so. The criteria for such a judgment include, quoting State Department policy, the person’s “loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and a willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.”

Eligibility for access to classified information is not based on a person’s wealth, business acumen or ability to persuade large crowds. Great attributes, maybe. But they are no basis upon which to decide whether an individual ought to have access to the nation’s secrets.

The most critical step in deciding whether to grant someone access to classified information is a background investigation consisting of a thorough examination of the individual’s past and current histories.

In previous incarnations, and during years of service as an investigator with the U.S. Civil Service Commission (now the Office of Personnel Management) and as a special agent and regional security officer with the State Department, I conducted hundreds of background investigations here and overseas.

Life histories tell a lot, and a lot must be known about people entrusted with our national security.

This is where deciding whether Trump is an acceptable security risk hits a wall.

There is so much about him and his conduct, past and present, that is unknown.

And, as the Wall Street Journal reported this week, questions about Trump may be causing U.S. intelligence officials to withhold sensitive intelligence from him.

The intelligence community’s concerns, reportedly, center on the Trump team’s contacts with the Russian government. There are also Trump’s repeated expressions of admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump’s call during the presidential primary for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, and FBI and CIA knowledge that the Russians leaked Clinton campaign emails to undermine her candidacy and boost Trump’s.

Then there are those aspects of Trump’s life that would raise security concerns were they found in background checks of others seeking clearances. Applicants’ associations with foreign interests — especially substantial business, financial or property interests in a foreign country or with foreign-owned businesses — would not escape U.S. scrutiny, especially if those associations might subject the applicant to a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.

Trump has eluded such an examination.

Little is known about the nature of Trump’s foreign business relationships — what they are, his conduct while traveling outside the United States, or his interactions with foreign governments known to target U.S. citizens to try to obtain protected information.

A background investigation that uncovers questionable judgment, lack of candor or dishonesty draws heightened attention. So, too, the refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions. That kind of activity may constitute grounds for unfavorable clearance action.

Trump has never been subjected to such an inquiry.

He has a proven record of not providing truthful or candid answers. True, it didn’t disqualify him from the presidency. It would, ironically, darken his chances of getting a U.S. government security clearance.

A security clearance applicant who has engaged in deceptive financial practices, who has a history of failing to meet financial obligations, and who fails to identify and explain all sources of income is a red flag. Such a record, of course, is no bar to the presidency.

A background investigation that turns up evidence of possible emotional, mental or personality disorders, even without a formal diagnosis, elevates security concerns , although not to the point of disqualification without an evaluation by a duly qualified mental-health professional. But bizarre behavior suggesting emotional instability, and which casts doubt on the individual’s judgment or reliability, will certainly get a closer professional look before a security clearance is granted. Trump has no such worries.

The White House denies that the intelligence community is keeping sensitive information from Trump. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence agrees.

Indeed, it’s doubtful that the intelligence community would hold back about security threats or potential plots against the United States.

But to expose sensitive information about Russia to an enigmatic Trump, with advisers and former staff now under investigation by the FBI and congressional committees? Without solid evidence that Trump is reliable and can be trusted?

That might explain why the intelligence community may be keeping some secrets under wraps — that is, until Americans who place patriotism above partisanship, such as Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), decide that the national interests supersede Trump’s fixation and fascination with himself, and they agree that the intelligence community should come forward to speak truth to power.

A ground-launched cruise missile that the United States has identified as a treaty violation is being deployed by Russia, according to a report in the New York Times. This threatens to upend an important treaty and poses a major challenge for the United States, especially since years of objections over the violation have been stonewalled by President Vladimir Putin. With a new U.S. administration taking office, it would make sense for President Trump to press Russia once more to adhere to the treaty, while holding out the possibility of military countermeasures if he does not.

The treaty was a centerpiece of the cooperation between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the end of the Cold War, eliminating an entire class of deployed land-based missiles in Europe with a range between 300 and 3,400 miles, and their launchers; prohibiting flight-testing and production of new missiles in the future; and including new, intrusive verification measures.

Over the past decade, Russia stealthily developed a ground-launched cruise missile in apparent violation of the treaty, one of a number of asymmetric weapons programs developed by Mr. Putin to throw the West off balance. The new missile was first seen in a flight test in 2008; the Obama administration told Congress about it in late 2011, and State Department compliance reports formally called it a treaty violation in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Russia has repeatedly refused to acknowledge a treaty violation. A special commission set up in the treaty to resolve disputes met late last year without result. Now, Mr. Trump should raise the issue directly with Mr. Putin and make it clear that the United States will not tolerate behavior that undermines the very foundation of arms-control treaties — that they are binding and verifiable. Mr. Trump has described himself as a good negotiator and as a Mr. Fix-it. Certainly, the INF treaty needs repair. The military countermeasures prepared by the Pentagon, such as deployment of new U.S. missiles or active defenses, might, over time, coerce the Kremlin to change tack. But it would be far preferable for Mr. Trump, who has yet to meet Mr. Putin, to attempt persuasion first, while being direct about the consequences of inaction.

According to an account by Reuters, Mr. Trump denounced another U.S.-Russian accord, the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), in a Jan. 28 phone call with Mr. Putin, saying it favored Russia. In fact, the treaty has been a model of successful implementation, holds both nations to equal levels and ought to be extended when it expires in 2021. The real worries about strategic nuclear weapons are elsewhere, starting with setting priorities for the hugely expensive nuclear modernization cycle that the United States has embarked upon. There’s also the unratified nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the toothless and drifting Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Plenty of negotiating and fixing up awaits Mr. Trump, and none is getting easier by waiting.Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost.

You’re all set!Michelle Zipp. (Bedford County Jail)

The man had known Michelle Zipp for only a few months, but he already knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

So after learning that his 31-year-old fiancee had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, the smitten Pennsylvania man decided he would do whatever it took to keep the love of his life alive.

That included exhausting his bank account and taking out loans totaling $40,000 to pay for Zipp’s cancer treatments.

But the man would eventually discover that there a problem, Bedford County District Attorney Bill Higgins said: Michelle Zipp didn’t really have cancer.

“It’s a really sad situation,” Higgins told The Washington Post. “He felt they were engaged to be married, but obviously her intentions were different.”

“What we have here is a bad person who preyed upon the heart and kind intentions of a really good person who wanted to help,” he added.

[‘Sophisticated con artist’ faked cancer for taxpayer-funded abortion]

The relationship began in October after the two were introduced by a mutual friend. Higgins said he isn’t sure exactly when Zipp’s ruse began, but the prosecutor believes it was easier to maintain because the couple didn’t see each other often.

“Most of the relationship was conducted through text messaging and email and phone calls,” he said. “It doesn’t appear they spent a lot of time together.”

Higgins said Zipp persuaded the man — whose name has not been released by authorities — to take out loans to help her pay for the surgeries that she said she desperately needed. At one point, NBC affiliate WJAC reported, the man transferred more than $6,000 to Zipp at a local Walmart through money grams.

To keep the lie alive during the couple’s four-month-long relationship, Higgins said Zipp manufactured characters over text.

“She even sent him text messages from a reported nurse who was treating her to give him updates on her health status,” the prosecutor said. “She went to great lengths to perpetrate this lie.”

Higgins said one of the deceitful texts from the nurse who didn’t exist informed the victim that his girlfriend was in a medically induced coma. That same day, WJAC reported, Zipp was pulled over by a state trooper, proving that she was conscious enough to operate a vehicle.

“She even gave him the name of the hospital she was staying at and gave him a lot of details,” Higgins said. “She told him that if she didn’t get the money for these surgeries she would die.”

“She exploited him with romance,” he added.

Zipp is being represented by Bedford County public defender Lucas Kelleher.

“She was arrested under a bizarre set of circumstances, however, we have yet to receive the discovery materials — the paper documentation for her case,” Kelleher said. “These are only allegations at this point and she maintains her innocence.”

[Students rushed to help a coach who said he had cancer. Then they learned his story was a lie.]

Higgins said he didn’t know what caused the woman’s boyfriend to become suspicious about her alleged condition. By the time he did and reported Zipp to police, Higgins said, it didn’t take investigators long to unravel her story.

“Police reached out to the hospital where Zipp claimed she was receiving treatment to determine if she was a patient and her story quickly unraveled from there.”

Higgins said Zipp is charged with theft by deception, which amounts to creating a false impression to rob an unsuspecting victim. The charge is a first-degree felony that is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison, Higgins said.

Zipp was arrested last week and was released from jail after posting a $50,000 bail.

Higgins said his office sees more online scams targeting victims’ bank accounts, but he’s never encountered a case in which someone manufactured a relationship to steal money.

“People are getting more creative in how they try to trick others into giving them money,” he said. “I’ve never had one exactly like this, where someone played up an illness that didn’t exist.”

Jackie Battenfield’s painting “Tending Tender,” on view at Addison/Ripley Fine Art. (Jackie Battenfield/Addison/Ripley Fine Art)

Spring has arrived early in area galleries, which are budding with floral imagery. Not all of it is soft and delicate. The majority of the works in Addison/Ripley Fine Art’s “Branched” is by Julia Bloom, who arranges bare twigs into latticelike forms. These are the inspiration for her charcoal drawings, some of which climb higher than the sculptures.

Julia Bloom’s “Clear Forest #5,” at Addison/Ripley Fine Art. (Julia Bloom/Addison/Ripley Fine Art)

The D.C. artist’s model is the forest, where trees divide space, diffuse light and cast shifting shadows. Yet Bloom’s wired-together constructions can resemble buildings as much as baskets or birdcages, and are sometimes painted in bright, artificial colors. “Clear Forest #5 Gray” is a leaning tower of sorts, and most of the sticks in the wall-mounted “Abacus” are vivid blue.

Although Bloom’s drawings essentially depict her sculptures, they have a different feel. The hard edges are sometimes softened by smeary grays, and perspective deftly simulates the dimensions of the twig-built grids. The seven-foot-high “Monolith 3” evokes misty depths with gray-on-gray gestures and has nearly the presence of a 3-D piece.

“Branched” also features Jackie Battenfield’s paintings, in which silhouetted trunks and twigs are embellished by leaves and flowers. From a distance, these vignettes appear realistic. But the New York artist paints with watery acrylics on Mylar panel, so the pigment flows and pools, and yields accidental patterns when it dries. Usually executed in just two or three colors, Battenfield’s pictures are part minimalist and part abstract. And yet they convey nature’s serene aspects.

Branched: Jackie Battenfield and Julia Bloom On view through March 4 at Addison/Ripley Fine Art, 1670 Wisconsin Ave. NW. 202-338-5180. addisonripleyfineart.com.

Kiki McGrath &

Jean Jinho Kim

Swirls of green suggest the botanical origins of Kiki McGrath’s expressionist abstractions, but the local artist also has drawn on another source, examples of which are part of this Studio Gallery show. Alongside the paintings, “Aerial Roots” displays three sculptures inspired by ikebana — Japanese flower-arranging — and made by local devotees of the art form.

These are large, burly and far from traditional. Rather than dainty flowers and grasses, the assemblages feature log-size branches and unnatural accents; one incorporates chunks of vine painted orange. With them, McGrath has installed a black rubber hose, coiled and hanging in midair. The shape of this gardening accessory echoes the spirals in the paintings and pays an amusing tribute to ikebana. The found-object sculpture is not flower-arranging, but it is an act of transformation, and that’s an fundamental theme of Japanese art.

Downstairs, Jean Jinho Kim has clustered everyday objects in ways that complement “Aerial Roots.” The Leesburg artist’s “No Boundaries” is more far-ranging, but it does include glittering mock butterflies and — in a piece titled “Garden 1 60-12” — two roselike blooms. If Kim’s assemblages include many industrial materials, there is a hint of ikebana amid the car parts and LEDs.

These Flowers . . .

Wendy Cortesi’s drawing “Veronica,” at Adah Rose Gallery. (Wendy Cortesi/Adah Rose Gallery)

Botanical illustration is such a specific calling that the Corcoran used to award a certificate in it. The 11 artists in Adah Rose Gallery’s current show, members of the local Studio 155 cooperative, all participated in that program. The paintings and drawings in “These Flowers Are Like the Pleasures of the World,” do include a few non-vegetal subjects, ranging from small (snails) to vast (the Grand Canyon). But most depict flowers, fruits and vegetables with academic precision.

Indeed, among the drawings are Wendy W. Cortesi’s “process” pieces, which catalogue the visual and scientific aspects of plants she’s preparing to render in watercolor. Other artists add drama with black backdrops, giving their paintings an Old Master vibe, or with implied action; Donald Beekman Myer pictures fruit such as lemons and pears, tumbling like dice. Most ominous is Roberta Matthews Bernstein’s series on toxic plants, pretty but potentially fatal. The skull and crossbones painted on the side of one canvas warn that botanical art is not for the timid.

These Flowers Are Like the Pleasures of the World On view through Feb. 25 at Adah Rose Gallery, 3766 Howard Ave., Kensington, Md. 301-922-0162. adahrosegallery.com.

Mary D. Ott

“Metallics,” the title of Mary D. Ott’s show at Touchstone Gallery, refers to her use of gold, silver and copper paint and ink. But the subject of the Silver Spring artist’s paintings and prints is not metal but grass, a longtime interest. Wispy blades are conjured with embroidery yarn dipped into pigment to produce hundreds of lines, usually vertical. The resulting image could be an unmown lawn, a wild prairie or merely an exercise in color and form.

The metallic hues give the paintings an undulating glow that suggests daybreak or sunset. The prints lack that luminosity, but they’re just as compelling. Ott uses string much as she does thread in the paintings, drawing lines on a plate that’s then etched. The elegant “Wide Grass” series renders meadows in blue and silver, and “Grass Bouquet VI” contrasts lacy, detailed fronds in black with looser shapes in reddish brown. This is the meadow as a minimalist Eden, a place of narrow yet infinite variety.

One of Blaise Tobia’s images in “Plain & Fancy” at Hillyer Art Space. (Blaise Tobia/Hillyer Art Space)

Blaise Tobia

Among some stern sects, austerity is required in public only. Opening the door to a private space reveals that different rules apply. That’s true, Blaise Tobia’s “Plain & Fancy” demonstrates, even of such seemingly utilitarian objects as the horse-drawn carriages of Pennsylvania’s Amish. Inside the stark black or gray exteriors are bright colors, textured carpet and other unexpected decorative touches.

The Hillyer Art Space show consists of twinned photos of in and out, both in close-up. Tobia made the images, but the Philadelphia artist doesn’t consider himself primarily a photographer. He’s concerned more with contrasting found forms than with documentary storytelling (although he does allow glimpses of Amish life, visible in the background or reflected in windows). Although the backstory is intriguing, the diptychs would work even if their subject were unknown. The juxtaposition of asceticism and flamboyance reflects human contradictions far beyond Lancaster County.

“We should go together.”

That’s right — I asked a guy who I met on Tinder two weeks earlier to take me to his church.

“Yeah, sure!” he said. He laughed, but I was actually serious.

We had arrived at the topic when James brought up a sentence I have in my profile: “Jesus is my homeboy.”

“What does that mean, exactly?” he said, his eyes smiling but serious as we maneuvered around our dinner — steak and frites for him, mussels for me.

“Well, I put that in there because it seems like there are so many agnostics and nonbelievers out there who make their faith clear in their profiles, and I wanted to make it clear in mine that I wasn’t,” I said.

“I had no idea there were that many!” he said.

For the record, I am in no way the poster girl for Christianity. I grew up attending church on a more-than-weekly basis, but entering college and leaving home made my attendance sporadic at best. The last time I attended with any type of regularity was in 2012, and my once-nightly prayers have evolved into “God please just let me make through this one moment” and liking the occasional cutesy-fonted scripture quotes on Instagram. But, after navigating oh-so-many professional and personal ups and downs and still being able to standing upright, I have held on to faith in God, and it has been a long-held hope of mind to find a person who feels the same way.

I’ve dated guys who claim to believe in God. But something seemed different about James. He had actually read about God and faith over several years, and had determined himself a believer, rooted in his Catholic upbringing. “I go through phases,” he said of his Sunday Mass attendance at St. Augustine near U Street. “When I don’t go, I miss it.”

With that, I asked him to take me.

We concluded our dinner date with a kiss goodbye on the curb, noting that our next date would be bright and early on a Sunday at 10 a.m.

The following Thursday, however, I grew hesitant. “We don’t have to go, you know,” I said over the phone. “It was just something I threw out there. We can just go to brunch and not go to church before.”

“No, no, let’s go!” he said enthusiastically.

“Okay then,” I confirmed. “We’re going.”

All of my churchgoing had been with family, friends or by myself. I had never done something so … relationship-like with a guy I’d just met. But if faith is a quality that I’m looking for in a partner, then it makes sense that I would want a date where we explore it.

The only other notable Catholic Mass I had attended was in high school, during a Christmas break visit to Texas to see my dad. He is Catholic, and though our relationship has always run from nonexistent to strained, this Mass was one of my fonder memories. To see him, kneeling, praying, taking the sign of the cross along with his fellow parishioners, gave him a look of humility and humanity, two qualities I have, to this day, never seen come out of him before or since.

As James and I sat shoulder to shoulder and service began, I realized I had no idea how to … proceed. I folded my hands, but wondered, “Will he try to take my hand? Should I take his? Am I giving him enough room?” I decided to just breathe and observe, and concentrate on staying roused (romance aside, Mass is still an hour of being talked at, which can make even the most alert start bobbing their heads).

James was conscientious in opening the hymnal so I could follow along. “I wanna hear you sing!” he chided me, as I had warned him before that, due to my tone-deaf nature, I most definitely do not and would not sing. He said, “Just follow my lead” when everyone dropped to their knees to pray, and, most adorably, seemed to truly have found peace in those tender moments.

I found myself at peace too. I listened intently to the homily, which was focused on how to be a shining light to others that we encountered during the week. I really appreciated how the Catholic church made sure that if you actually took the time to come, you were going to be taught something. My time wasn’t wasted, which is how I had felt in way too many Sunday sermons that focused exclusively on salvation. That may be the ultimate goal, naturally, but sometimes you just need to hear a confirmation that you’re okay — that there is good waiting for you on the other side of whatever you are facing. And I felt like I got that.

Once the service concluded, James and I headed to brunch. Over Belgian waffles (him) and a salmon burger (me) we shared more funny stories and faults, and discussed that darn dating albatross known as timing. We talked so long that the server eventually had to drop our check without asking, so we could move it along.

We moseyed back to my car and, after a kiss goodbye, agreed that we’d be seeing each other again, soon. “What if this could be our thing?” I wondered. “Church, followed by brunch, followed by a long walk? Maybe not every Sunday, but like, a few Sundays a month?”

Was this what Etta James meant when she said she wanted a “Sunday kind of love?” A love that lasted past Saturday night, and was more than just love at first sight?

That love wasn’t destined for us. James told me a few days later that while he enjoyed our time together, he felt that something was missing. I was sad, sure, but at the same time I had enjoyed doing something different outside of standard early-date fare. And no matter what, we’ll always have that Sunday in church.

Prince George’s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) announced Friday he was extending the contract for Kevin Maxwell, the schools chief executive officer, giving the educator another four years to continue reform efforts despite recent abuse scandals that led to calls for Maxwell’s resignation.

It is the first time in nearly 25 years that a superintendent in Prince George’s County will get a second term. Before Maxwell, the state’s second-largest school system had seven superintendents in less than two decades.

Maxwell is paid just under $300,000 a year. He was appointed by Baker in 2013, shortly after the state legislature awarded the county executive broad new power over school-system governance.

His leadership is a central part of Baker’s plan to overhaul and stabilize the system after years of scandal, poor performance and dwindling public trust.

Maxwell, who grew up in and began his career in Prince George’s County, has seen graduation rates reach record highs at some schools. Enrollment and some test scores also have increased.

He expanded full-day prekindergarten and language-immersion offerings, and increased participation in dual-enrollment programs that allow high school students to take college-level courses.

But the system faced sexual-abuse and child-abuse cases last year involving school personnel, including a one-time aide who now faces decades in prison. The allegations led to a federal investigation and the loss of control by the school system of millions of dollars in Head Start funding.

[For years, Pr. George’s did not strengthen school sex-abuse policies ]

“It has been challenging but at the same time, it’s been some of the most rewarding work that I have ever done,” Maxwell said at a news conference at DuVal High School, where he introduced a specialized academic program focused on aerospace science.

Maxwell cited letters he has received from grateful students, the number of strategic business and philanthropic partnerships that school officials have brokered and a more than $44 million increase in the value of scholarships offered to county graduates in 2016.

“I see this as my capstone for my career,” he said. “I see this as my legacy and reinvesting in the community that gave me the life that I have today.”

More than three dozen business, government, philanthropic leaders and school board members attended the announcement, giving Maxwell a standing ovation as he ticked off his administration’s accomplishments.

Absent were at least three elected members of the Board of Education, including Edward Burroughs III, one of Maxwell’s most strident critics. He led calls for Maxwell to step down following revelations that a Head Start worker forced a child to mop up their own urine and texted a photo to the child’s mother.

Amid the fallout, Maxwell asked his chief of staff to resign over an email that appeared to suggest that school administrators tried to keep the Head Start scandal quiet.

There were separate allegations of abuse, involving a school bus aide accused of molesting students.

Baker, who is term-limited in 2018, said he “never lost confidence” in Maxwell through all the “bumps and stumbles.”

“Have we had problems? Yes,” Baker said. “The question is how we react. . . . I want him to continue the work he is doing.”Parents Tip – PS P.S. from the PostPoints staff: Here’s our weekly roundup of deals and giveaways we think you’ll enjoy!

These are a few of the featured partners we work with to bring you the best rewards. Click here to see a complete listing.In Donald Trump’s new home town Sunday night, there was a homicide. Thirteen gunshots were fired in a neighborhood less than four miles from the White House. When D.C. police showed up, they found Kenny Bell, a 30-year-old black man, dead on the grounds of the Ferebee-Hope Recreation Center in Southeast Washington.

The rec center is in Ward 8, which is predominantly black and scarred by deep pockets of poverty but also home to a vibrant middle class. Of the 135 homicides in the city last year, 46 were in Ward 8. During President Trump’s campaign, he referred to such crime-plagued areas as “a living hell.”

Now he was just a 10-minute motorcade ride away from one, having pledged to curb violence, reduce unemployment and improve schools in such places.

“I will produce for the African Americans,” Trump said.

Did he mean it?

There are some in Ward 8 who would like to believe him. Perhaps living in a high-crime area and seeing the devastating effects of homicides, day in and day out, leaves you little choice: Cling to hope or succumb to despair.

“During the past 14 years, I have been to 96 funerals, mostly for young, black male homicide victims,” said Trayon White Sr., 32, who represents Ward 8 on the D.C. Council. Three of them were in the past two weeks. “If we can get Justice Department grants for public safety programs and mental health services, we ought to at least make an effort to do so.”

Nearly a month into Trump’s presidency, however, Trump has shown no sign of producing anything but more misery for the nation’s poor and working class — black and white alike.

[Trump’s plan to help black America doesn’t look like much of a deal]

His efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act could leave millions of the nation’s most vulnerable residents uninsured. His tax-cutting scheme would certainly enrich corporate America, but it could also reduce incentives for developers to create more affordable housing. His administration already includes appointees who have advocated for cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and Head Start programs.

On the campaign trail, Trump appealed for black votes with a harshly put observation about life in troubled neighborhoods: “You’re living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”

The answer, so far, appears to be food, housing, health care and education.

In the nation’s capital, slashing the federal budget would likely increase a racial wealth and income gap that is already obscenely wide. White households in the Washington area have a net worth 81 times that of black households — $284,000 compared with $3,500, according to a report last year by the Urban Institute.

In 2013, the top one percent of families nationally made 25.3 times as much as the bottom 99 percent, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute released in June.

Yet during the presidential campaign, those at the bottom rung were cast as the primary cause of all that was wrong with America. Trump said immigrants coming from Mexico were not the best, but rapists and criminals. He tweeted that black people were responsible for 81 percent of homicides against white people.

His claims were not just divisive, they were lies.

Meanwhile, immigrants fear being rounded up and deported now more than ever, the white working class continues to die of suicide and drug overdoses in record numbers and black Americans in poor neighborhoods are overwhelmed with the knowledge that they may be the only ones worried about the violence taking so many black lives.

[To make black lives matter, black people need to believe it]

Instead of having a president working to solve our common problems, we have one who has set up each group to hold the other in contempt on their way to the grave.

On Tuesday, Valentine’s Day, White wasn’t waiting for Trump to address the problems of his new city. He launched a “Red Ribbon Safe Communities” initiative in which couples gathered to discuss ways to make their communities safe. “We need to build stronger families,” White said. “Residents need to become more active in the community because, in the end, the solution lies with us.”

Spread love, not bullets, was the theme.

But, as White knows, there can be no separating chronic, concentrated poverty from increased violence.

A few days before Bell was killed, a gunman fired 12 rounds into a crowd on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE. Four people, including a 17-year-old girl, were hit and wounded. It could have been a dozen homicides.

“Our ward has one of the highest unemployment rates, per capita, in the country,” White said. “People are very stressed, a lot are desperate. If Trump can help with workforce development and job placement, then I’m willing to focus on what we have in common and not our differences.”

What does White have to lose?

Sergio Roblero didn't need to imagine a “day without immigrants.” On Oct. 18 of last year, the 19-year-old line cook lived it.

At the time, Roblero -- who is from Chiapas, Mexico — was cooking at a popular Mexican restaurant called Agave in downtown Buffalo. He had overstayed a work visa by several months, he said, but he felt confident that, if he kept his head down, nothing would come of it. But early on the morning of Oct. 18, Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided not only Agave, but three sister establishments.

All told, 25 people, including Roblero, were arrested. And of the restaurants targeted in the raid, only one has since reopened.

“Immigrants are part of the U.S. economy,” Roblero said, in Spanish, via Facebook Messenger. “Now I’m under house arrest. I haven’t left to see any of my coworkers, the restaurant is closed and I can’t work.”

Thus far, few restaurants have suffered the scale of the raids that Agave did. But in cities across America, restaurants, bars and hotels are bracing themselves for the possibility of further enforcement action under the Trump administration. On Thursday, restaurants in several major cities — including José Andrés’s Jaleo, Oyamel and Zaytinya in D.C. -- shut down or cut service to demonstrate how much their businesses would suffer without immigrants.

Celebrity chef José Andrés, currently locked in a legal battle with President Trump, says he's supporting his immigrant employees taking off from work on Feb. 16 in protest of Trump's immigration stance. (Reuters)

It’s clear from the data that restaurants depend on undocumented workers for labor. Eleven percent of all U.S. restaurant and bar employees are undocumented immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center. At current industry employment levels, that translates to roughly 1.3 million people.

In some places, the numbers are even higher. According to Pew, there are even more undocumented immigrants working restaurant and hospitality jobs in New York, Florida and the Southwest.

“In major cities, you’re talking about a restaurant workforce that is maybe 75 percent foreign-born, and maybe 30 to 40 percent undocumented,” said Saru Jayaraman, a labor activist and the founder of the worker group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. “The restaurant industry in major cities would absolutely collapse without immigrants.”

Immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, aren't always visible to restaurant patrons. They tend to work in lower-level restaurant positions, often in roles that don’t involve interacting with customers. Instead, they bus tables, prep food or work the grill line, like Roblero did.

According to Pew, undocumented immigrants make up 17 percent of the nation’s busboys and 19 percent of its dishwashers. These figures are likely higher in major cities, in states with large numbers of undocumented immigrants, and in certain minority-owned “ethnic” food establishments. And they’re likely to grow even more in the future.

According to a new analysis by Bruce Grindy, the chief economist at the National Restaurant Association, the shrinking population of 16-to-24-year-old workers will further squeeze an industry that has already faced intermittent labor shortages since the end of the recession. Grindy says that restaurants will turn to foreign-born workers to make up the gap.

“Foreign-born employees,” he writes, “will be increasingly important to the restaurant industry’s ability to expand and create jobs in the years ahead.”

Given these trends, the restaurant industry has long advocated for comprehensive immigration reform — including a “clear path to legalization" for undocumented workers.

Shortly after the election of President Trump, Jayaraman's group began to hear from restaurants and restaurant workers expressing concern about the president’s immigration rhetoric. In response, she partnered with Presente.org, a Latino advocacy group, on an initiative they’re calling “Sanctuary Restaurants”; among other things, the project offers member restaurants a rapid-response legal hotline and organizing help. In exchange, restaurants publicly post a placard that declares their “sanctuary” status. As of Feb. 16, 400 restaurants had signed up.

All of those establishments participated in Thursday’s “Day Without Immigrants,” Jayaraman said.

The national strike sought to show Americans what the dining scene would look like if immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, could no longer participate. In D.C. at least, a number of restaurants closed their kitchens while leaving the front-of-house open. A trio of pubs owned by restaurateur John Andrade served drinks and let customers bring their own food. At Compass Rose, the entire kitchen staff, save one chef and line cook, are immigrants.

“The dining industry would not exist without immigrants. Period,” said Carlie Steiner, of D.C.’s Himitsu, in a statement.

Of course, not everyone agrees that the industry would collapse without undocumented immigrants, even if they play an important role presently. Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that staunchly opposes illegal immigration, argues that restaurants could adapt to a crackdown just as easily as they have adapted to other shifts in the labor market. He compares the attitude of restaurateurs who hire undocumented workers to the arguments made in favor of slavery almost 200 years ago: Both systems are exploitative, Stein said, and both claimed that any changes would cause business to suffer.

“Once abolished as a practice, businesses adjust, adopt, shift and innovate,” Stein told The Post by email. “The alternative is bankruptcy, and any well-managed business won’t go under.”

But in Buffalo, where three popular restaurants remain closed, that doesn't appear to be the case.

Of the 25 people arrested in the Oct. 18 raid, three are fighting deportation for overstaying their visas, and five are still in detention, said Brenda Valladares, an organizer for the immigrant rights group Cosecha, which has provided legal and organizational help for the employees. The owner of the restaurants, Sergio Mucino, has also been charged with harboring illegal aliens, as have two of his managers.

While Mucino declined via an associate at his remaining restaurant to comment, citing the pending charges, he previously told a reporter that his employees were “very nice people” and “hard workers” and that he felt “very bad for everything that happened.” In the aftermath of the raids, it came out that Homeland Security had targeted Mucino and his restaurants after receiving a tip from a former employee. In a statement, the agency said that “building and supporting a business through the intentional use of people not lawfully authorized to work here is a model that [Homeland Security] will not tolerate.”

That has been devastating to the families of the employees, Valladares said, particularly those with young children. Many of the families fear being split up if their relatives are deported. They're also having trouble buying food and paying rent while their primary breadwinners await immigration hearings; Cosecha is now providing for many of those needs. Only one of Mucino's restaurants, the taco joint La Divina, is open and in need of employees.

On a recent Wednesday evening, the phone at La Divina was answered by a 21-year-old college student named Drew Smith. He was hired after the raids, he said, to replace a cashier who had been arrested, along with several new cooks who, early on, didn’t even know where to source ingredients. Smith loves La Divina: The people are nice, the tacos are good, and it “feels like working in Mexico,” he said.

“But it seems like less people come to the restaurant now,” he added. “I think there’s a perception that the tacos are different.”

You’re all set!Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and the two Roosevelts, Franklin and Theodore, have kept their lock on their positions as, respectively, the four best presidents in American history, according to a new ranking by 91 presidential historians.

Barack Obama took the No. 12 spot in his first time on the survey.

The poll, released on the eve of Presidents’ Day weekend, is the third one conducted by the wonky public-affairs cable network C-SPAN over the past 17 years.

The presidents in the bottom rankings were the same as in 2000 and in 2009.

They were Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, who again comes in dead last. Buchanan, who served from 1857 to 1861, is regarded as having been an inept and indifferent leader as the nation was headed toward civil war.

Yet there was also some movement in the rankings.

[See the full historians’ poll]

Andrew Jackson — whose style of populism that Donald Trump’s advisers like to cite as a model for the current president — slipped five spots since 2009, coming in at the 18th best president.

Dwight Eisenhower moved into the top five for the first time, moving up from No. 8 in 2009 and No. 9 in 2000.

George W. Bush also gained slightly in the esteem of the historians, moving up to 33rd in 2017, from 36th in 2009. But he was bested by his father, George H.W. Bush, who ranked 20th.

Bill Clinton, whose presidency was bookended by the two Bushes, remained in the 15th spot.

The survey asks historians to rank the presidents on a 1-to-10 scale on 10 qualities of leadership: public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision/setting an agenda, pursued equal justice for all and performance within the context of his time.

“Once again, the big three are Lincoln, Washington, and FDR — as it should be,” said Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley, one of the academic advisers to the study. “That Obama came in at No. 12 his first time out is quite impressive.”

However, Edna Greene Medford of Howard University, another adviser, said she would have expected Obama to rank higher, given his high approval ratings when he left office in January, that his administration had been close to scandal-free and his role in steering the economy back from the brink after the financial crisis.

“Of course,” she added, “historians prefer to view the past from a distance, and only time will reveal his legacy.”

Overall, the period from 1933 to 1969 was “the golden age of the American presidency,” said historian and biographer Richard Norton Smith.

Five presidents from that period made it into the top 10. They were led by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is regarded as “not only the first modern president but the man who, in reinventing the office, also established the criteria by which we judge our leaders,” Smith added.

The other mid-20th century presidents in the top 10 were Eisenhower, Harry S Truman, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Lyndon B. Johnson.

If that time was the apex, the period between 1837 and 1869 might be regarded as the most dismal era for the presidency, with No. 1-ranked Lincoln being a stark exception.

(Christof Stache/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)

Germany’s defense chief on Friday hit President Trump’s dismissive attitude toward Washington’s European allies, giving a frosty reception to U.S. envoys at the largest ­conclave of U.S. and European officials since the inauguration.

Speaking to a packed hall that included Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen hammered Trump’s ­attitudes toward Russia without ever mentioning the U.S. leader by name.

“There can be no policy of equidistance between allies on one side and those who on the other question our borders, our values and the principles of ­international law,” von der Leyen said to applause at the Munich Security Conference, where ­Europe’s senior security leaders were gathering to figure out how to respond to Trump.

“We must pursue finding a reliable coexistence with Russia together instead of going over our partners’ heads in a bilateral relationship,” she said.

Trump has offered the most direct challenge to the ­transatlantic security alliance in its post-World War II history, calling NATO “obsolete,” ­welcoming Britain’s decision to split from the European Union and holding back from criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who in 2014 redrew ­European borders by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

In comments shortly before his inauguration, Trump equated his relationships with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Putin, saying he would start off with open minds on both of them and then reevaluate based on how they treat him.

Mattis and Kelly were ­dispatched to Europe this week to reassure nervous allies about Trump’s policies, even as they reaffirmed some of his toughest messages on the need for greater European defense spending.

Vice President Pence arrived Friday ­evening in Munich as he kicks off a ­miniature tour of European ­capitals.

The visits come amid ­controversy on Trump’s team’s ties to Russia. Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser Monday after The Washington Post reported that he may have had improper conversations with Russia’s ­ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.

But many European leaders are responding to Trump’s push by agreeing to spend more while also saying that all Western allies — including the United States — must not abandon the basic values that helped create a ­Western security backbone in the years since 1945.

Only four nations apart from the United States meet NATO commitments for defense ­spending. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is among the laggards, and it would need to nearly double its budgetary ­commitments to get there, ­ballooning its military into ­Europe’s most powerful.

Without dismissing the ­spending guidelines, von der Leyen said that NATO’s strength was far more than an economic balance sheet.

“Burden sharing is a matter of funding, of money, but sharing the burden is also much more than what can be expressed in euros and in dollars,” von der Leyen said. “To share a burden is to first of all share the principle to stand up for one another. Without exception.”

She also hit against Trump’s stated affinity for torture and campaign-trail rhetoric that ­appeared to dispense with the need to avoid civilian deaths in prosecuting wars in the Middle East.

The alliance must be “bound by human dignity in all it does,” von der Leyen said. “This leaves no room for torture. It means avoiding civilian casualties at all cost.”

“We must beware of turning this fight into one against Islam and Muslims per se. Otherwise we run the risk of deepening the trenches from which terrorism grows,” she added.

Von der Leyen met Mattis in Washington last week before he traveled to Brussels and Munich this week. She has pushed for greater European defense ­spending — an unpopular stance domestically — even as she has echoed Merkel’s firm message about not abandoning ­fundamental values.

Von der Leyen’s comments largely fall in line with what Mattis has advocated over the past few months, at times putting him at odds with Trump’s views. In particular, Mattis said during his confirmation hearing that he views Russia as the top security threat to the United States and that Moscow wants to “break” the NATO military alliance.

Mattis also told Trump before he was nominated that he was against torture and that there are other more effective ways of getting information, surprising the president. Trump said last month that he still “absolutely” believes torture works but would defer to Mattis on the issue.

The defense secretary has dampened speculation about a U.S. rapprochement with Russia, saying Thursday that it was too early to discuss any military collaboration. But he also has delivered Trump’s tough message on defense spending to fellow defense chiefs in NATO, warning that the United States may “moderate its commitment” if allies do not start meeting their spending obligations.

On Friday, Mattis continued his warnings to European ­partners, even as he assured them that NATO’s mutual ­defense agreements are a ­“bedrock commitment.”

“To confront the threats facing our alliance, we must recognize not just strategic realities, but also political realities. President Trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to NATO,” Mattis told the hall in remarks immediately after von der Leyen spoke. “It is a fair demand that all who benefit from the best alliance in the world carry their proportionate share of the necessary costs to defend our freedoms.”

Mattis’s message on the need to devote more to defense ­spending has been welcomed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. But Stoltenberg said Friday after a meeting with ­Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that there were few ­fundamental shifts in Russia’s position on NATO, Ukraine or Syria. He pointed to modest progress in avoiding inadvertent incidents between the militaries when they operate in proximity to each other.

Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world

President Trump has made a huge deal of his attempts to bring back blue-collar manufacturing jobs that have gone overseas and to shame companies into building plants here rather than in other countries. Both of which I think are fine.

But Trump would probably get greater value for working-class Americans — and for American consumers — by spending some of his time leaning on companies to preserve a huge, threatened class of blue-collar jobs: cashiers. Yes, cashiers.

Speaking up for cashiers, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says is the second-largest occupation in the country, wouldn’t be as glamorous or tweet-able as berating Ford or General Motors or Carrier for the loss of American jobs.

[Why bodyslamming big companies is good for America]

But it would be a great way for him to get back to playing offense and showing he cares about the working class. Supporting the nation’s 3.5 million cashiers could help preserve the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of low-paid people who are in entry-level jobs or rehabilitating-themselves jobs or trying-to-feed-their-family jobs.

What’s more, there’s even an example, not far from Trump Tower in New York, of how preserving cashier-type jobs could be done, at minimal (or perhaps no) cost to consumers. It’s in my home state of New Jersey, which has saved thousands of such jobs — those of gas station attendants.

It’s the unintended but welcome outgrowth of the state’s 1949 ban on the self-pumping of gasoline, which many out-of-staters ridicule. Even so, it is so popular that Jersey residents have resisted repeated attempts to end it.

Now, let’s step back a bit.

The number of cashier jobs — No. 2 only to retail sales clerks, according to the BLS — was almost exactly the same in 2015 (the most recent year for which statistics are available) as in 2005, even though total U.S. employment was up by 7.6 million.

Still, it’s obvious that these jobs are threatened as never before.

[How to save good jobs]

Go into any large, reasonably modern supermarket, drug store or retail store, and you see more and more self-checkout lines and fewer and fewer manned cashier lines.

McDonald’s is using self-checkout in some locations. Even Costco — a big company that seems to care about employing people — is experimenting with it.

And here’s the crowning blow. Amazon, which has upended America’s retail business (and whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post), is building physical stores that have no cashiers. If Amazon’s initiative succeeds, can cashier-less days at mainstream operations be far behind?

Look, I’m not proposing that the United States turn into a modern-day version of old-style Russia, where it took half a dozen people to check you out of a store. And I’m not proposing to return to pre-bar code days, when checkout lines were slower and there was more work for cashiers.

But I just look at the gas stations in New Jersey and compare them with the large, modern retail outlets in Atlanta’s northern suburbs, where my wife and I recently spent considerable time.

Georgia customers using the self-checkout line got no savings whatever in return for doing the store’s work. Late at night, at least some big stores had so few cashiers on duty that self-checkout became the norm.

By contrast, at New Jersey gas stations, someone pumps my gas. That’s a boon to those of us, like me, who have arthritic wrists that don’t react well to pumping my own gas, which I did in Georgia. And the Jersey gas lines moved more quickly.

[What to expect at work in 2017]

Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey trade group that represents gas stations and convenience stores, estimates there are about 9,000 gas-pumping jobs in the state. (The BLS once tracked Jersey gas-pumping jobs but no longer does.) Risalvato, who wants the self-pumping ban repealed, estimates that having attendants increases the price of gas by about 10 cents a gallon. To put that in context: The state increased gas taxes by 23 cents a gallon in November, and the recent average cost of gas ranged from $2.32 a gallon for regular to $2.79 for premium, according to GasBuddy.

Robert Scott III, a professor at New Jersey’s Monmouth University who in 2007 published a scholarly article about the self-pumping ban, thinks it adds little or nothing to gas prices. A major reason, he says, is that insurance costs for Jersey gas stations are lower than they would be if customers pumped their own gas.

To be sure, you don’t see the plight of cashiers portrayed nightly on cable news, and there’s no big public fuss made when cashier jobs quietly slip away. But if Trump can dig out of his current problems and get back to playing offense, he could do a lot of good for cashiers and himself by publicly leaning on retail chains to preserve those jobs or even add to them.

And who can say? Just as we Jerseyites appreciate having gas pumped for us, store customers across the country would probably come to appreciate cashier-based checkout. We’d keep cashiers working instead of having to live in poverty or go on welfare or file for disability. We’d all win. And so would Trump.

Why I can’t (and won’t) stop writing about Social SecurityIn recent years, one of climate change doubters’ favorite arguments has involved the floating sea ice around Antarctica. It’s growing, they contended — and that raises doubts about our understanding of human-induced climate change.

To this, climate scientists always responded: Not so fast. Floating sea ice in another cold place, the Arctic, is clearly shrinking, as are Arctic and Antarctic glaciers, and we don’t fully understand all the drivers behind the vast and complex Antarctic sea ice system. So don’t leap to the conclusion that odd behavior in floating Antarctic ice, which indeed has been growing slightly in recent years, undermines climate concerns.

Now, though, the argument for doubters just got even more complicated. After seeing a record high for total extent in the year 2014, Antarctic sea ice had been running very low in late 2016 and early 2017. And now, as of data recorded on Monday and Tuesday by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the extent of Antarctic sea ice now appears to have hit a record low (although scientists still have to confirm this and have not made an official announcement yet).

It’s summer in Antarctica right now, and floating sea ice on Monday only covered 2.287 million square kilometers, according to “near-real-time data” from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. If that’s correct, that would barely edge out the previous record low of 2.290 million square kilometers on Feb. 27, 1997. The records go back to 1979.

On Tuesday, meanwhile, the ice extent shrank further down to 2.259 million square kilometers — underscoring the likelihood of a record, once the data is confirmed. Here’s an image, created using the center’s handy “Charctic” tool, showing this month’s ice (in light blue, below the others) compared with all other years in which we have data for Antarctic sea ice:



(National Snow and Ice Data Center)

“Record low sea ice extent in the Arctic has, in a sense, become old news,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “But now the Antarctic is getting into the act. There are certainly many questions out there as to why Antarctic sea ice is also at a record low, but we can’t deny the reality that things are changing and they are changing fast.”

Sea ice is almost completely absent right now along the coast of West Antarctica in particular, a region where huge and fast-retreating glaciers have raised major concerns about potential sea-level rise. It’s unclear if lack of sea ice in the area might also signal that the oceans are having an effect on the continent’s marine-based glaciers.

It’s also important to note that it’s still only mid-February, so it could be that Antarctic sea will lose more ice before it begins to refreeze and expand again, according to its seasonal cycle. So what now appears to be a new record low may not be the record for very long. We will have to await a formal confirmation of all of this from the center, which may not come until the ice is clearly beginning to grow once again.

In the meantime, there are some interesting ideas out there about what explains the recent behavior of Antarctic sea ice. For instance, Gerald Meehl, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., has published research suggesting that floating Antarctic ice is actually controlled in part by the state of the distant Pacific Ocean, whose influence on wind and weather patterns ultimately stretches all the way down to the Antarctic.

That study focused on a natural climate wobble called the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO, whose negative phase is one in which heat ends up getting buried in the Pacific Ocean, and whose positive phase unleashes it. The IPO was in a negative phase through much of the 2000s, but it may now be shifting back, Meehl says. And that could be playing a role in sea ice.

“It is consistent that a positive phase of the IPO could be associated with reduction of Antarctic sea ice extent, which is what is happening now,” Meehl commented by email. “However, given that the IPO is a decadal timescale phenomenon, and what we’re seeing now is a reduction of Antarctic sea ice that started sometime after the middle of 2016, we can’t say that Antarctic sea ice will stay at this low extent indefinitely. But the evidence from IPO connections is pointing in the right direction for a possible decadal trend toward reduced sea ice extent.”

In the end, since Antarctic sea ice was previously trending upward, the sudden reversal shouldn’t be a reason to turn on a dime and suggest that the ice is now declining — yet. Instead, it further underscores that we don’t fully understand what’s going on with this system. Which is precisely why it’s so dangerous to cite Antarctic ice to undermine the overwhelming evidence of climate change elsewhere.

You’re all set!The U.S. Marshals Service says it is providing security for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos after a handful of protesters prevented her from entering a D.C. middle school.

[Protesters briefly block Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s visit to a D.C. school]

The move is unusual for the Education Department, which typically has a team of civil servants guarding the secretary, and for the marshals, law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges, transporting prisoners, apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses.

The last Cabinet member protected by marshals was a director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service. That office ceased to be a Cabinet-level position in 2009.

Donahue said that for security reasons, she could not provide any information about the number of marshals assigned to DeVos or say whether they are providing round-the-clock protection. It is unclear how long the arrangement will last.

Education Department officials did not respond to requests for information about why they have called on the marshals or what the security team normally assigned to the secretary is doing now.

Federal policy allows the Education Department to pay other agencies for services, but it is unclear whether the department is reimbursing the marshals for the cost of deploying a security team.

Marshals began providing security for DeVos on Monday, the first weekday after she encountered protesters outside the District’s Jefferson Middle School Academy last week, Donahue said.

The demonstration was mostly peaceful, but several protesters tried to block the movement of a government car entering the street in front of the school, and a few others tried to bar DeVos from entering the school building. Video circulated by WJLA (Channel 7), the local ABC television affiliate, showed a member of the department’s security team steering DeVos away from the protesters, guiding her by an arm as she returned to her government vehicle.

One of the protesters who blocked the secretary’s way appeared to have touched her, according to a video circulated by Fox5DC.

D.C. police arrested one person on a charge of assaulting a police officer.

[The popular uprising that threatens the Betsy DeVos nomination]

The incident was the latest sign that DeVos remains a deeply polarizing figure after winning Senate confirmation by the slimmest of margins. A Michigan billionaire, she spent three decades lobbying for private school vouchers, charter schools and other alternatives to traditional public schools. Her supporters say she is a bold reformer, but her detractors worry that DeVos aims to undermine public schools by redirecting taxpayer money to private and religious schools.

Last Friday’s protest was not the first for the team responsible for protecting the education secretary. In 2015, for example, anti-testing protesters confronted then-Education Secretary Arne Duncan when he visited an elementary school in Chicago. Duncan’s driver turned down a dead-end alley, according to the Chicago Tribune, compelling Duncan to exit his vehicle and walk past chanting protesters about half a block from the school.

“I entrusted my life and my family’s lives to that team for seven years,” Duncan said of the department’s security detail. “They could not have been more professional, more committed, more thoughtful. I can’t say enough about how much I respected them. A couple protesters? That’s part of the job. You embrace that. You don’t run away. You have to deal with people. You have to work outside your comfort zone.”

Many of the security personnel are former Secret Service agents who have been at the department for many years, as far back as the tenure of Education Secretary Rod Paige, who served from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush, according to former department officials. One former official said the agency’s guards have protected multiple secretaries and are “top-notch security professionals.” Duncan said he “never for one second doubted” the security team’s ability to do its job and never saw a need to ask for additional protection.

“That’s a waste of taxpayer money,” Duncan said of the use of U.S. marshals.

In an interview Wednesday with the conservative publication Townhall, DeVos said that on the basis of her first few days in the job, she had concerns that some Education Department employees were sympathetic to the Obama administration.

“I . . . would not be surprised if there are also those that would try to subvert the mission of this organization and this department,” Devos said. Asked what she could do about that, she said, “Whatever can be done will be done, and it will be done swiftly and surely.”

Oil on canvas portrait of Thomas Jefferson, 1805, painted by Gilbert Stuart. (Colonial Williamsburg Foundation)

During his time as U.S. minister to France, Thomas Jefferson penned a letter to a statesman from Virginia, waxing poetic about the importance of a free press.

“The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right,” Jefferson wrote to Edward Carrington in 1787. “And were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them.”

Those words would help identify the Founding Father as a champion of the press.

But as Jefferson was writing them, scholars say, he did not foresee that newspapers would become a partisan tool for warring political factions in a climate of unrest and uncertainty over the fate of a nascent nation.

By the time he was approaching his presidency, anxieties were high and newspapers had taken a critical stance. Jefferson in turn had taken critical tone with them, at least in his in personal letters, in which he often excoriated the press — much as the 45th president, Donald Trump, would do more than 200 years later.

[Trump says ‘I inherited a mess,’ blasts media and detractors at combative news conference]

“Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper,” Jefferson said then.

“FAKE NEWS media … makes up stories and 'sources,'” Trump tweets now.

Jefferson called the press “the only tocsin of a nation.”

Trump calls the media “the enemy of the American People.”

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

“Thomas Jefferson was as irritated with newspaper coverage as any public figure of his era,” Ken Paulson, president of the Newseum Institute's First Amendment Center, told The Washington Post in an email. “For all the talk of media bias today, it can't compare to the overt partisanship and personal attacks appearing in papers in our nation's early years. But Jefferson also knew that our democracy could only flourish with a free press that would keep an eye on people in power and help protect our freedoms.

“He understood that press coverage comes and goes, but freedom of the press must endure.”

The Newseum celebrates Jefferson's famous First Amendment stance, selling a magnet with one of his quotes: “The only security of all is in a free press.”

Trump has repeatedly lambasted the media, first for its coverage of his presidential campaign and, now, of his administration. During a combative 75-minute news conference Thursday, the president continued to air his grievances, saying, “I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.”

At the time Jefferson wrote the storied words about press freedom that journalists have since embraced as a mantra, “his view of the press was uncluttered with the experience he was going to soon acquire,” said Joseph Ellis, a U.S. historian who has written a biography about Jefferson, “American Sphinx.”

“His view of the press was going to change,” he said.

Jefferson was a controversial presidential candidate, portrayed in the press as a Francophile and an atheist and was later rumored to have had children with a slave at Monticello (now widely believed by historians). Many people were worried he was putting the survival of the republic at risk — and that sentiment was echoed in the press, historians say.

Then during his presidency, the historians say, he was heavily criticized for his actions, namely the Louisiana Purchase and the Embargo Act of 1807.

[Here’s why Trump’s attacks on ‘fake news’ succeed]

In 1796, a year before he became vice president, Jefferson wrote a letter to George Washington, saying that “from a very early period of my life, I had laid it down as a rule of conduct, never to write a word for the public papers.”

But Ellis, the historian, noted that “Jefferson never said about the press what Trump says about the press.”

Still, Ellis said, “Jefferson recognized the press as one of the pillars of the society we wanted; but when he came under criticism in a big way, he used his powers to censor them.”

In a 1993 op-ed in the New York Times, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anthony Lewis wrote:

In 1798 the Federalists pushed through Congress a Sedition Act making it a crime to publish false, malicious comments about the President or Congress. (They exempted Vice President Jefferson from this protection against abuse.) The aim of the law was to silence the country's main Jeffersonian newspapers in the run-up to the election of 1800. Their editors and owners were indeed prosecuted, some for mere critical opinions or lampooning of President Adams. Jefferson and James Madison, the author of the First Amendment, worked to rouse the public against the Sedition Act. They argued that the Federalists, by trying to silence speech critical of politicians, were taking America back to the British system — the tyranny of George III. And their arguments persuaded many, contributing to Jefferson's defeat of Adams. When Jefferson took office, on March 4, 1801, he pardoned all those who had been convicted under the Sedition Act. In his Inaugural Address he opened his arms to his bitter opponents — and set out what I think is the true American attitude toward freedom of speech.

But once Jefferson was in office, he tried to censor the critical press.

“In his second term, in response to serious criticism from the New England newspapers … he instructed the state attorney generals in New England to prosecute the newspaper editors for sedition in the same way he had opposed such behavior when it was done by the federal government,” said Ellis, the historian.

The move further alienated Jefferson from the journalists, as well as the clergy.

It was during his second term in 1806 that Jefferson wrote to U.S. Rep. Barnabas Bidwell of Massachusetts, “As for what is not true you will always find abundance in the newspapers.”

The next year, Jefferson made his opinion known in a letter to John Norvell, a politician, lawyer and journalist who had written to him about plans to start his own newspaper.

“To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, 'by restraining it to true facts and sound principles only,'" Jefferson said. “Yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more completely deprive the nation of it's benefits, than is done by it's abandoned prostitution to falsehood.

“Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.”

[‘Fake news’ has now lost all meaning]

Jefferson's presidency ended in 1809 — but his frustrations with the press did not.

In 1814, he said, “I deplore with you the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who write for them.”

A year later, he wrote to James Monroe: “A truth now and then projecting into the ocean of newspaper lies, serves like head-lands to correct our course. Indeed, my skepticism as to everything I see in a newspaper, makes me indifferent whether I ever see one.”

And then again the next year: “From forty years' experience of the wretched guess-work of the newspapers of what is not done in open daylight, and of their falsehood even as to that, I rarely think them worth reading, and almost never worth notice.”

Monticello historian Christa Dierksheide said Jefferson was lamenting the press he envisioned when he first fought for its freedoms.

“As an idealist, he continued to hope that the press would overcome its partisan leanings,” she told The Post. “But that never happened.”

But, Dierksheide said, Jefferson still “held that a free press had to be protected.”

“He felt that a free press was an expression of the people's opinion,” she said, “and there had to be an outlet for their opinion because government was based on their opinion.”We invite you to submit your videos, photos, articles, and comments in certain areas of our website.

(The Washington Post)

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — When President Trump took the stage here Friday to mark the launch of Boeing's newest aircraft, it was a scene reminiscent of his airplane hangar rallies during the presidential campaign.

Except, instead of his “Trump” branded Boeing 757 parked in the background, Boeing's newest product, the Dreamliner 787-10, glittered in the sun behind him, and off to the side stood Trump's new ride, Air Force One.

Trump's somewhat unusual appearance at the launch event for the company's highly anticipated version 10 of the Dreamliner wasn't to roll out new economic policy or even push a specific economic agenda item. Instead, it seemed that Trump was there to boost the company with a presidential endorsement for its American-made fleet, and he in turn would be the face of a major milestone for one of the country’s largest job creators.

“We’re here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing,” Trump said. “We’re also here today to celebrate jobs. Jobs!”

“Jobs is one of the primary reasons I’m standing here as president, and I will never ever disappoint you. Believe me,” he added.

Trump's visit to the Boeing plant also comes at a time when the Trump administration is struggling to establish a greater sense of order and focus after weeks of distractions and negative headlines.

The White House has aimed to structure his daily schedule with at least one jobs-focused meeting each day. But much of that has been overshadowed by several all-consuming stories, the most damaging of which was the ouster of Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Monday.

Questions about the Trump administration and campaign’s ties to Russia have only intensified after multiple media reports revealed that Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, despite Flynn's statements to the contrary.

Friday’s event on the manufacturing floor of Boeing’s South Carolina plant offered Trump a much-needed opportunity to reset his administration and refocus an economic-based message.

“You look at what’s happening with jobs. You look at what's happening with plants moving back to this country. All of a sudden they’re coming back,” Trump said. “As your president, I’m going to do everything that I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and put our great people back to work.

“This is our mantra, buy American and hire American.”

A few months ago, it seemed that Trump’s relationship with Boeing was on the rocks before it even really began.

As president-elect, Trump launched into a Twitter fight with the company and its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, over the cost of a new fleet of presidential airplanes that would be used as Air Force One. Quickly, Boeing relented, promising to bring down the plane’s costs after meetings with Trump.

Less than a month into his presidency, Trump is back to Boeing on a decidedly more positive note.

“That plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old,” Trump said, pointing to the Boeing 747 that serves as Air Force One. “What can look so beautiful at 30?”

The turnabout is emblematic of Trump’s preferred mode of dealing with America’s largest and most powerful businesses. It reflects the degree to which Trump has already changed the terms of engagement with the business community, quickly creating an incentive structure where businesses are rewarded with praise from the highest office in the land when they roll out jobs or cost savings for taxpayers — and credit him for influencing their decision-making.

Over the past several weeks, chief executives including Intel's Brian Krzanich traveled to the White House to announce new American jobs, thanks to fresh “confidence” in the economy spurred by the new administration.

“They’re keeping and bringing thousands of jobs back to our country because the business climate, they know, has already changed,” Trump said, highlighting jobs announcements from automakers Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler. “We will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes — including for the middle class, including for everyone, and including for businesses.”

In this setting, Trump seems at his most comfortable.

Here, Trump reveled in his electoral victory and the adulation of a supportive crowd in a state that he won in both the Republican primary and the general election.

“This was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide,” Trump declared.

As the restive crowd of Boeing employees waited for hours for Trump to arrive, some cheered when his name was mentioned in the preshow. “Make America Great Again” hats and T-shirts dotted the sea of people on the plant’s manufacturing floor where more than 5,000 employees were gathered.

He toured the new Dreamliner with Boeing executives and could be seen sitting in the plane's cockpit after his speech.

On Saturday, Trump plans something of a repeat performance in what the White House is dubbing the first “campaign” event of his presidency, at an airplane hangar rally in Melbourne, Fla.

Among some Boeing employees, the reception to Trump was reserved, but optimistic.

Leif Anderson, who started working at the factory six years ago after leaving the Air Force, sat Thursday night at the bar at Domino Lounge, a pool hall three miles from the Boeing plant, smoking cigarillos and sipping a shot of Crown Royal apple whiskey alongside a glass of Bud Lite.

Anderson said he voted for Trump more out of loyalty to the Republican Party, but is “not jumping to conclusions” about the president as a leader.

“I'm really curious to see what he does,” said Anderson, who leads a group of workers at the Boeing plant installing the planes' interiors. He hopes that Trump's economic policies succeed, which he said would help his own career along with the country as a whole.

“If he does good, then I'm going to do good,” Anderson said.

Elliott Slater, a Boeing mechanic, took the day off Friday and did not attend Trump's speech, saying he wanted to avoid the traffic.

“I didn't vote for him, either.” said Slater, a veteran of the Navy. “He's not my president. He's got to earn my respect.”

Slater, who supported the union's unsuccessful vote to organize the plant in Wednesday's election, said that Trump would support companies over workers. “He’s definitely pro businesses, being a business man himself. … That’s fine, but you know, how does the business treat its workers?”More and more, home builders are introducing regional styles into their designs in markets well beyond the places they originated.

All you have to do is flip on HGTV or scroll through an online home design sites to see how dramatically home architectural styles vary from one part of the country to another.

For instance, Spanish-style stucco houses with red tile roofs are more common in the Napa Valley or in Florida than in the Washington area, with climate, culture and history often playing a big part.

“In the Carolinas you see more houses with double front doors, and in Texas you see a lot of houses with a casita, which is a separate little detached guesthouse,” says Dennis Kelleher, division president of Comstock Homes of Washington, in Reston, Va.

Tim Gehman, director of design for Toll Brothers home builders in Philadelphia, says even some seemingly minor interior layout preferences such as the location of the master bedroom closet are driven by regional preferences. He says in Washington and north of this area, walk-in closets tend to be a separate entity entered directly from the master bedroom, while in the Carolinas and south of that area, closets are entered through the master bathroom.

More and more, though, such distinctions are fading. Home builders, sometimes driven by buyer demands, are introducing regional styles into their designs throughout the country in markets well beyond the places where they originated.

“One of the trends from the West Coast that has spread east is the open flow between a courtyard and the great room,” says Damon Bradley, sales manager with Williamsburg Homes in Maryland. “Homes in the eastern part of the country used to be much more formal.”

If you’re planning to buy a newly constructed home in the near future, expect to see more indoor-outdoor rooms, more storage, more bathrooms with small tubs and larger showers, more informal areas and fewer formal ones. Many of these ideas proved to be popular in other parts of the country.

“Houses don’t change like hemlines, but over the last few years, trends have spread faster due to the availability of online sites like Houzz and Pinterest,” Gehman says.

Informality and indoor-outdoor living

A major national trend that continues to expand in influence is the interest in an informal lifestyle focused on entertaining in the open kitchen and extending into the outdoors, says Kermit Baker, chief economist of the American Institute of Architects in Washington. Nearly all newly designed houses today have more floor space devoted to casual living areas rather than a formal living room and formal dining room.

“Millennials, in particular, don’t want space dedicated to formal living and that crosses over into other generations, too,” says Baker.

While the Washington region has long been known for its traditional homes, Matthew Ossolinski, principal of Ossolinski Architects in the District, says that home buyers in this area are embracing informality, even if they prefer a traditional exterior.

“Even when home buyers want a formal dining room, it tends to be more open to the other living areas,” Ossolinski says. “Interior walls are dematerializing, with rooms defined by glass doors or columns or completely open to each other.”

Gehman says home buyers’ tastes in the D.C. region have changed to embrace what he calls “East-West” living common in Florida houses, with the kitchen, breakfast area and family room spread out in one big space across the back of the main level.

“Even the small definitions between spaces have gone away, such as a railing or a step-down between those rooms,” he says.

Ossolinski says that embracing open floor plans extends to allowing more flow between interior and exterior spaces.

“Homeowners like the look of an open living and dining area and kitchen with a minimal threshold and minimal walls separating those spaces from their outdoor space,” he says. “Those outdoor spaces have changed, too, and look more like interior space with a kitchen with a counter and furnishings that are visually connected to the indoor furniture.”

At Toll Brothers, covered outdoor living areas called a “California room” or a “lanai” in different markets, often accessible through accordion-style glass doors, are being offered everywhere the company builds homes.

“These outdoor living rooms expand the usable living space and create a sense of privacy because they are at least partially covered,” Gehman says. “These are standard in our homes in California and Florida, but they are also very popular options in the D.C. region.”

Kelleher says that every one of Comstock’s new floor plans for single-family houses includes a covered outdoor area such as a screened porch or covered porch as a standard feature. Buyers can customize these spaces with stone walls, a fireplace and a beamed ceiling.

Even in smaller homes, buyers like having a flexible room that they can customize for their own use, such as a main-level room with an adjacent bathroom that could function as a home office, a guest bedroom, a hobby room or even a small formal dining room depending on the buyer’s choice.

Home offices or a library with doors are popular with a lot of buyers, but they also like the option of being able to turn that space into a bedroom if they need to, says Anissa Willis, vice president of sales for Miller & Smith home builders in McLean, Va.

“We name the rooms on a floor plan but we also tell buyers they can use any space any way they want,” says Patricia Wynkoop, vice president of product development and purchasing at Miller & Smith.

Wynkoop says Miller & Smith offers an upscale townhouse model with a large dining room for people who like to entertain often, as well as a more intimate lounge area and hearth space in back of the house for friends and family. Both rooms are visually connected so the entire main level can be used at once for larger gatherings.

“Buyers want flexible spaces on the first floor and even upstairs now,” Kelleher says. “They want options upstairs for a prayer room, laundry room or a storage closet.”

Accessibility for every generation

As Americans live longer and the baby-boom generation ages, builders are recognizing the increased need for houses that make it easy to age-in-place. At the same time, more people are living in multigenerational households, which also influences how houses are designed. According to the Pew Research Center, a record 60.6 million people, or about 19 percent of the U.S. population, lived with multiple generations in one household in 2014.

“Multiple-generation households and the aging baby boomers are both generating more interest in accessibility issues,” Baker says. “Open floor plans work well with those issues because it’s easier to get around if you have wider halls and doorways. First-floor bedrooms have always been popular in the South and the West, regardless of the price point of the house.”

Not every buyer is ready for a first-floor master suite and configuring a house for that space requires either eliminating other first-floor rooms or a larger lot, which can add considerable cost, especially in areas like the D.C. region where land prices are high.

“Outside the D.C. region, first-floor master suites are far more common, but we’re finding that buyers over age 55 in this area are starting to want a main-level guest suite for future use and a second-floor master suite to use now,” Kelleher says.

Gehman says that south of Virginia, nearly every house has a first-floor master suite, in part because these houses are built on a slab without a basement and more space is needed on the second floor for a children’s play area.

“While our research shows that the majority of home buyers in every generation want a single-family home, 64 percent also want one-level living with a bedroom, bathroom and laundry room on the first floor,” says Rose Quint, assistant vice president for survey research at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. “That demand for one-level living is driven by older buyers, with 35 percent of millennials wanting one-level living compared to 88 percent of seniors.”

Ossolinski says that many new houses are designed with a first-floor bedroom and bathroom that can function as an in-law suite or a space for adult kids returning home and then eventually become the master suite.

“Designs like that work for multiple generations living together and for aging-in-place, both trends that are driving home designs today,” he says.

Kelleher says that in larger single-family homes, especially those over 3,000 square feet, buyers want a bathroom for every bedroom so that older returning kids don’t have to share one.

“Even when people don’t need a multi­generational house now, we plan for the future with things like a full bathroom on every level and a kitchenette on the lower level with a refrigerator and a microwave,” says Eric Tovar, owner and president of Churchill Classics in Rockville, Md. “We put in elevators or at least design homes with a series of closets that can function as an elevator shaft in the future.”

Tovar says many of today’s popular bathroom features such as large walk-in showers with a seat and a handheld showerhead are functional for future accessibility issues.

“Master bathrooms don’t always have bathtubs now, but those that do tend to have a free-standing tub that’s more of an art object instead of a soaking tub set into one of those platforms,” Gehman says.

Wynkoop says other master bathroom trends include a dramatically long vanity, a linen closet in the bathroom and as much natural light as possible brought in through transoms and “sun tunnels” in the ceiling as well as through regular windows.

Organization and storage

Whether it’s the influence of Marie Kondo’s “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” or simply the fact that Americans have a lot of stuff, a major trend identified by the NAHB is that homeowners want organized storage in their new homes, including a walk-in closet in the master bedroom, a larger laundry room and as many closets as possible.

“The features that consistently appear on the most-wanted list for new homes are a walk-in pantry and a laundry room,” Quint says.

Gehman says “service spaces” such as areas next to the garage or a family entrance are getting larger so they can provide more storage.

“Most people want a command center or a dedicated spot in the mudroom or near the kitchen with power sources for devices and cable hookups for adults or the kids,” Tovar says. “Instead of having a little desk in the kitchen, people want a bigger space nearby with built-in file drawers and wall cabinets and a space for a computer screen.”

Tovar says that the desire for organization extends into the kitchen, where buyers want pullout receptacles for recycling and trash.

Buyers are evenly split on whether they want a laundry room on the first or second floor, Gehman says. In some larger homes, a second laundry closet will be installed so there’s one on each level, he says.

“Buyers also want a real room, not just a closet, for laundry machines with lots of cabinets and shelves,” Tovar says.

Buyers prefer to have a laundry room with a window if possible, Wynkoop says.

“Sometimes we just don’t have the space for a real laundry room, but even if we have a closet with stacked machines we try to include a sink and shelving so that it feels more like a room,” she says.

Wynkoop says Miller & Smith adds storage under the eaves of the upper floor and in the garage whenever possible.

“Builders have gotten a lot smarter about converting dead space such as under stairs or in small corners into storage areas,” Bradley says. “Everyone wants extra shelving and double hanging rods in closets now, too.”

Larger townhouse models

Even in townhouses, traditionally smaller than a single-family home, buyers are looking for an open floor plan and as much storage as possible.

“The D.C. region is unusual in that there is a wide variety of townhouses in different sizes and configurations even in the suburbs,” Gehman says. “You don’t see townhouses in the suburbs in many other parts of the country.”

However, there is some evidence that townhouses, especially as an affordable alternative to a single-family home, may be spreading to other regions.

“Our research shows a 30 percent increase in the number of townhomes being built in 2016 compared to 2015,” says Robert Dietz, chief economist of the NAHB. “These townhomes are bigger than they were two or three decades ago, sometimes up to as large as 3,000 square feet. In lower-cost markets, they are around 1,700 square feet, but they have been designed more efficiently and typically have an open floor plan on the main level.”

Kelleher says Comstock and other builders design nearly every new townhouse with a central kitchen that has an open floor plan on the main level.

“If height restrictions allow it, we add a fourth-level loft and a roof terrace with options like an outdoor kitchen,” he says.

Kelleher says townhouses are designed now with more emphasis on storage. For example, they offer an optional attic storage space.

“Another townhouse trend is to have two bedrooms on the third floor and a third bedroom either on the lower level or a fourth level for more space and privacy,” he says. “That way all three bedrooms have their own bathroom.”

Pulling a rear-entry garage back from the house is another relatively new trend that allows for a patio off the main level and adds extra square feet inside the house.

With prices for newly built residences frequently higher than prices for similarly-sized existing homes, builders recognize that following trends and meeting buyer expectations is essential for their business to succeed.

What buyers want

Buyers of newly built homes want:

●Wide-open floor plans for informal living.

●Blending indoor and outdoor spaces with covered patios and courtyards.

●Flexible first-floor rooms for a current or future bedroom or home office.

●A bathroom for every bedroom.

●Master bathrooms with oversized showers and no tub.

●Extensive storage options, including larger laundry rooms.

Chicken, Leek and Parsley Pie: Paired with a salad, it’s a midweek meal that satisfies. (The Washington Post)

A frequent question during our weekly online Free Range chat concerns our favorites — the meals and drink recipes we at WaPo Food turn to most often. For me, a perfect weeknight meal is a modest portion of warm, savory pie with a crisp green salad, because there’s something so satisfying about the contrast in temperatures and textures. Plan it right, and the combo’s a veritable #DinnerInMinutes.

With the Recipe Finder as your guide and leftovers in hand, you could start with a simple Olive Oil Dough, which makes enough for a single-crust pie, and Anna’s Veloute Sauce, an all-purpose base for a potpie-type filling.

Chicken, Leek and Parsley Pie and Cheddar Cheese and Onion Pie can feed a family and are both double-crusters, but you could top them with a single crust. If you can’t make either in advance, use the brand of frozen pie shell or dough you like best. Their fillings don’t take long to make. Speaking of store-bought, it’s always to keep a roll of phyllo dough in the freezer; that way, you could make a Greek Mixed Greens Pie in about an hour.

You’re all set!Many aspects of George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate in the 21st century would be familiar to its creator, who was born 285 years ago Wednesday.

The mansion, for years painted bright white, is now daubed in the subdued greenish-beige hue that the first president would have known. His fanciest garden, the Upper Garden, has taken on a more utilitarian feel over the years as more became known about its 18th-century design. In the Fruit Garden and Nursery , Washington would recognize the braided raspberry canes, the locust stumps fashioned into a living fence and the root vegetables grown for their seed.

One element of the winter garden might not seem so normal to Washington: the winter itself. Once consistently cold, the season has become predictably unpredictable in these parts.

In Washington’s day, gardeners set about pruning the apple trees at the start of winter. The trees here in Northern Virginia no longer enter dormancy in December. “They still have their leaves,” gardener Kristin Prommel said. Men cannot harvest blocks of ice from the adjacent Potomac River and its creeks. Yes, this practice is history now that we have refrigeration, but it’s been decades since the river could be counted on to freeze over.

We live in an age of generally milder winters and, more important for the gardener, one in which temperatures seem to lurch from frigid to balmy.

This isn’t all bad. When the soil isn’t frozen, you can sink posts for fences and trellises, you can work and amend the soil, you can haul compost. Laboring for hours in 45 degrees is a lot more pleasant than at 25 degrees. But there are downsides.

The gardeners here fret that insect pest populations such as cucumber beetles and harlequin bugs will be back with a vengeance in the next growing season. But the biggest worry is that once trees and shrubs are coaxed into precocious spring growth, once the protective bud scales drop and the blossoms open, freezing temperatures will return to kill tender shoots. This is a particularly pressing concern for fruit growers, because damaged flowers mean no fruit.

[Exhibit explores life at Mount Vernon from the slave’s perspective]

Fruit orchards were an essential element of Colonial plantations. Sugar was scarce and expensive, but fruit could be preserved and stored for months after harvest. A fresh apple or peach was one of life’s great indulgences.

Nowhere is this significance captured better than in the Lower Garden, which is in some respects the least authentic display garden at Mount Vernon, being more of a Colonial Revival take on Ye Olde Virginia plantation. A mirror image of the Upper Garden, the one-acre, walled Lower Garden is my favorite garden at Mount Vernon because it lends grandeur and dignity to the lowly vegetable, as well as the loftier fruit espaliers.

The espaliered peaches, apricots, apples and pears that line the brick walls of the garden are representative of Washington’s time here, but the apple and pear cordons that flank the paths are from the early-20th-century reworking. Some are 80 years old, and in the care of gardener Edward Harrington. There is a lot to prune — trees grown as cordons, fans and candelabras take far more grooming and training than regular trees. With winter pruning season now more compressed, the weeks around Washington’s birthday are a busy time.

The key to maintaining control over espaliers is to trim their stems during the growing season as well. In summer, Harrington can be found snipping back vegetative growth, getting to each of more than 100 trees every two weeks.

In February, he thins out the thicket of stems growing upright at the top of the cordons. The twigs that he leaves will be frothy with blossoms in April. He will remove these after flowering, knowing that fruiting spurs lower in the horizontal branches will bear plenty of apples in the season ahead. He wants to keep the hedges low enough so visitors can look over them to glimpse the expanse of river in the distance.

Over the years, he has become more conservative with his pruning. “On an old tree like this,” he said, showing me one of the original trees, “you have to be very careful with it and not take too much off.”

Across the lawn in the Upper Garden, Prommel points out a plum espalier near the Georgian brick orangerie that is showing color in its buds. “It looks like it’s about to start flowering, and it’s February. It’s been a weird winter.”

The thought of its getting zapped by frost unsettles her, but she is glad to be pruning the fruit trees. “Pruning season is, like, I’m a real gardener again. Composting doesn’t feel like gardening to me because you’re not handling the plants.”

Harrington wears a long peaked cap and wraparound sunglasses that hide much of his face. The temperature is above 70 degrees in advance of a snowstorm that turned into a bust. His cheeks seem a little sunburned, but maybe it’s the wind.

Once his winter pruning is done, he will attend to the other plots in the Lower Garden. Next will be forming tepees for the garden peas, which will be pushed into the cold earth. He will put in the cabbage and lettuce transplants now growing in the greenhouse. He will pull back the thick mulch of straw on the extensive strawberry beds so they can flower freely in early spring. He will trim back the herbs in advance of spring growth. “It’s a very dynamic job,” he said. “You have to work with the weather.”

And Old George, what would he make of it? “I think he would be proud of what Mount Vernon is today. It’s a place of education and where we keep his legacy going, what he did here with his beautiful gardens and farm.” Harrington adjusts his hat. “It’s an American treasure, really.”

President Trump — with, from left, Vice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, head of the White House Trade Council Peter Navarro and senior adviser Jared Kushner — signs an executive order that places a hiring freeze on non-military federal workers on Jan. 23. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

Shortages of employees already contribute to putting some federal programs at high risk, and the hiring freeze will make it “more difficult” to address that problem, the government’s top auditor said Wednesday.

“We’ve looked at hiring freezes in the past by prior administrations and they haven’t proven to be effective in reducing costs and they cause some problems if they’re in effect for a long period of time,” Comptroller General Gene Dodaro told a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing.

Dodaro heads the Government Accountability Office, which released its biennial description Wednesday of federal programs at high risk of mismanagement, fraud, waste and abuse.

[Report lists ‘high risks’ needing Trump’s attention]

“We know there are already skill gaps … cybersecurity, acquisition workforce, oil and gas management, petroleum engineers. A number of areas on our high-risk list have human capital [aspects] — nurses at the VA [Veterans Affairs], a lot of areas. There likely will be emerging skill gaps and you’re going to have a lot of people retiring,” he said.

Preparing for such turnover, and recruiting and retaining employees in key occupations, is itself at high risk; the GAO has pointed to that challenge in “strategic human capital management” since 2001.

The freeze, ordered in the early days of the Trump administration, allows for exceptions, primarily for jobs deemed vital for national security or public safety reasons. Agencies could justify continued hiring from some of the occupations Dodaro listed.

Meanwhile, unlike some prior freezes that the GAO said actually raised costs, the current freeze bars federal agencies from adding contractors to make up for the work as employees leave.

[Hiring freeze closed government’s front door but left many windows open]

Further, the two central agencies overseeing the federal workforce, the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget, are to produce within 90 days a long-range plan to reduce the workforce by attrition. Such a plan could include an extended freeze, although possibly on different terms.

“I think a lot of it will depend on what kind of plan they come up with at the end of this temporary hiring freeze. But a sustained hiring freeze is not the best way. It’s better to do it through a budget or workforce plan,” Dodaro said.

“If you want to reduce the number of federal employees, in my opinion, you have to reduce the functions that those employees are doing. If you don’t reduce federal programs, eliminate programs, reduce things, or find some other way to do it, if you just eliminate the employees but keep all the functions there you’re going to have a problem,” he added.

Groups representing federal mid-level managers and senior executives made similar arguments at a Senate hearing last week about how the freeze could affect services to the public.

You’re all set!This entry was posted in Featured Partner . Bookmark the permalinkOn March 21, 1973, White House Counsel John Dean confronted President Richard Nixon about the growing Watergate scandal. “We have a cancer — within, close to the presidency, that’s growing,” Dean warned. “It’s growing daily.”

Dean’s famous metaphor is relevant to the Trump administration — not because the risk is precisely analogous but because it isn’t. In Nixon’s time, cancer was apt to be a death sentence. The tools to combat it were crude and brutal. Today, even as cancer remains a leading cause of death, for many people it can be managed as a chronic illness, capable of being kept under control with an arsenal of treatments.

That view of cancer — not as a metastatic killer but as a dangerous problem requiring vigilant control — may be the best way of understanding, and dealing with, the Trump administration. In the alarming month since he took office, it has become clear, if it were not already, that President Trump is dishonest, unprepared and undisciplined. His presidency poses an enormous risk to the country — to its safety, standing in the world and relations with allies, just for a start.

So the question becomes: Can the chronic disease that is the Trump presidency be managed? Are there tools available, not to cure him, but to keep his worst tendencies in check?

The situation is worrisome, yet the prognosis is decent. Indeed, we have already seen evidence of effective therapies.

First, the courts. For all his railing against “disgraceful” judges, Trump has signaled that he will obey court orders, including in Thursday’s news conference, when he said a new executive order on immigration “is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision.” Rule of law beats rule of Trump.

White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller can take to the Sunday shows to assert that “the powers of the president to protect our country . . . will not be questioned” or that “there’s no such thing as judicial supremacy.” But the evidence suggests that ultimately Trump will comply with court rulings even as he denounces them as “disgraceful” and “political.”

Second, the media. Every president chafes at press coverage and bristles at leaks. Trump is different, quantitatively and qualitatively, in the amount, venom and public nature of his attack. No matter. As Nixon learned, and as the stories leading to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn underscore, reporters continue to do their jobs in the face of presidential hostility and stonewalling.

Meanwhile, as much as Trump may seek to employ the news conference to berate the “dishonest” media, reporters can effectively use the opportunity to confront Trump on untruths and press him as he dodges straight answers.

When Trump, repeating false claims of an electoral landslide, said his had been “the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan,” NBC News’s Peter Alexander fact-checked him in real time — and Trump, confronted with irrefutable numbers, seemed to crumble: “Well I don’t know. I was given that information. I was given — actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?”

Third and fourth, the public and Congress. They go together because the growing concerns of the former stiffen the limp resolve of the latter. So it matters that Gallup shows Trump’s approval rating falling from 45 percent just after the inauguration — he is the first elected president with initial approval ratings below the 50 percent mark — to 40 percent last week, 21 points below average.

Bad numbers and bad news — the two are interconnected — can help move even the most spineless lawmaker. At week’s end, there were glimmerings of congressional willingness to engage in the more searching oversight essential to get to the bottom of the Russia mess.

Fifth, personnel, a still-open question. Flynn did Trump the favor of doing himself in. Others in Trump’s inner orbit, whether malevolent or incompetent, will not go as easily. But an obvious solution for a White House in trouble is to trade in true believers for more experienced hands. Trump may not yet be willing to make such changes, and the toxicity of his White House may dissuade the best; on this score, retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward’s decision to decline the Flynn job was disheartening.

It’s impossible to predict, after this turbulent first month, where the Trump administration is heading, and there are many reasons to worry. But it is comforting to recall: The body politic has a resilient immune system.

Spring arriving early at the Kennedy Center. (George Jiang via Flickr

Area residents might remember this as the winter without a winter. As we inch closer toward actual spring, February — a month known for its big snowstorms — has a chance to conclude with the longest warm spell in recorded history. And the month is likely to rank among the two warmest.

A little over halfway through February, the District has already seen record warmth. The two days in a row of 70s earlier this month was, by itself, quite unusual. The prospect of more 60s and possibly even 70s ahead only adds a punctuation mark on February, as well as the nearly snowless winter.

The 2016-2017 winter (December-February) temperature to date is an astounding sixth warmest on record, in tallies back to 1872. I say astounding, but it is of course just part of a growing list in recent years.

December 2016 was in the top 25 percent warmest for that month. January was 12th warmest. So far, February is running fifth warmest, with eyes on a higher prize.

The late February forecast



0z GEFS model temperature forecast for D.C. (Weatherbell.com)

Over the next week to 10 days or so, high temperatures should flirt with 60 and above more often than not. Such temperatures are much more typical of April.

A few days above 65 or even 70 are possible. Consider average highs are around 50 as we close February.

A record long warm streak is possible



(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)

We have a chance to put together a historically long streak of days above 60 degrees, starting Saturday.

Chances are good we can put up at least a three- or four-day streak of 60 or above, even 65 or above. A streak of five days at or above 60 in February would enter record territory.

There is an outside chance we could put up five or six days in a row of 60+, but it will depend on how significantly a “backdoor cold front” drifting in from the north early next week impacts temperatures. These kinds of fronts are notorious late winter (and early spring) warmth killers and always bear watching.



Cooler air is shown on last night’s GFS for later Monday. Notice the wind direction is out of the northeast behind a cold front.

A near-record number of days in the 60s and 70s is possible

By the time February is over, it’s reasonably likely that the number of days in the 60s and 70s will rank among the most on record.

D.C. goes into this warm stretch with three days above 60 degrees and two above 70 degrees so far in February. If all goes to plan, the city should add on at least half a dozen more of the 60-degree days, and probably at least one or two of 70 degrees or higher.

Nine days in February in the 60s or higher would place this year in the top six on record for that count (No. 1 is 14 in 1976). If we can get to four days in the 70s, it would tie for second most on record (No. 1 is 1976 with seven such days).

Warmest February on record?

With all these warm days in the pipeline, the average temperature for February is also in the running for warmest on record.

This February ranks as fifth warmest on record month-to-date, and is likely to rise in the rankings. Plugging in the best available model data suggests the monthly average temperature ends up around 46 degrees. That would rank second warmest on record between 1976’s top-ranking 46.9 degrees and 1990’s 45.2 degrees. If temperatures end up warmer-than-predicted, there’s an outside chance 1976’s record is broken.

February 2017 is destined to cap off what will be remembered as a non-winter, adding to the ever-growing list of bizarre warm periods in recent years.Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.

Kyrie Irving believes the Earth is flat and he’s serious about it. (Mark Duncan/AP Photo)

Kyrie Irving is the type of NBA player anyone would trust to take the winning shot with time expiring. But would you want the four-time NBA all-star teaching a science class?

Certainly not after what he told Cleveland Cavaliers teammates Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye this week.

On a podcast with Jefferson and Frye title “Road Trippin’ with RJ & Channing,” which was posted on the Cavaliers’ official website, Irving said that, despite all scientific evidence to the contrary proving that the Earth is round.

Jefferson began a discussion (around the 15-minute mark) about whether aliens exist in the universe. It quickly evolved to the very non-controversial statement that the Earth is round.

“The Earth is flat,” Irving, who spent some time at Duke before entering the NBA draft, repeated three times.

“The fact that in our lifetimes that there are so many holes and so many pockets in our history … History is history, and it’s happened long before us, and it’s going to happen after us, and it always repeats itself somehow, in some way,” Irving said. “All these things that they keep giving to us, all this information, I’m just saying that these things that used to put me in fear, it makes you not want to question it naturally, because of how much information you actually can figure out and how much information there actually is out there. It’s crazy. Anything that you have a particular question on, ‘Okay, is the Earth flat or round?’ I think you need to do research on it. It’s right in front of our faces. I’m telling you it’s right in front of our faces. They lie to us.”

When asked who “they” is, Irving denied that it was “the man.”

“For what I’ve known for many years and what I’ve been taught is that the Earth is round, but if you really think about it from a landscape of the way we travel, the way we move and the fact that — can you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what’s going on with these ‘planets’ and stuff like this?”

“Everything that they send or they wanna say that they’re sending [to space] doesn’t come back,” Irving said. “It doesn’t come back. There is no concrete information, except for the information that they’re giving us. They’re particularly putting you in the direction of what to believe and what not to believe, and the truth is right there. You’ve just got to go searching for it. I’ve been searching for it for a while.”

“Everything that was particularly thrown in front of me, I had to just be like, ‘Oh, this is all a facade.’ Like, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in … but now there is a certain aspect of life in which I want to tell people about, which is this true journey of really becoming a complete individual and total freedom of thought. Do you know what I’m saying?”

“Question things, but even if an answer doesn’t come back, you’re perfectly fine with that, because you were never living in that particular truth. There’s a falseness in stories and things that people want you to believe and ultimately what they throw in front of us.”

Insert thinking face emoji here, perhaps?

Later Friday, ESPN’s Arash Markazi spoke to Irving and informed him that his unorthodox view has made him a trending topic on Twitter. Markazi asked Irving if he’s seen pictures of the planet, which is, in fact, round.

“I’ve seen a lot of things,” Irving replied.

Donald Trump has a plan to make Apple's dividends great again.

I'm talking, of course, about the administration's plans for corporate tax reform. Now, in theory, allowing companies to bring their foreign profits home at a much, much lower tax rate than they could today—as a prelude to a system where overseas earnings wouldn't be taxed at all—would bring in a flood of cash that could boost investment and jobs. In practice, though, it would probably just bring in a flood of cash that would boost investor payouts and stock prices. That, at least, is what Apple's Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri admitted recently. Repatriating that money, he said, would give them "additional flexibility around our capital return activities."

Translation: American shareholders would be better off, but American workers wouldn't.

Not that this should be a surprise. It's precisely what happened the last time there was a repatriation tax holiday in 2004. Indeed, according to a 2011 Senate report, the 15 companies that brought the most money back actually cut their R&D spending and over 20,000 jobs in the three years after the policy. So what'd they do with the $150 billion they brought into the country? Easy: they paid it out to shareholders either directly in a dividend or indirectly by buying back stock. It's not an exaggeration to say that's pretty much all they did. "A one dollar increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost one dollar in payouts to shareholders," concluded economists Dhammika Dharmapala, C. Fritz Foley, and Kristin Forbes in their 2009 study.

And keep in mind this happened despite the fact that the George W. Bush administration put rules in place to try to prevent it from doing so. The problem, you see, is that money is fungible: even if I don't pay out the money I brought back, bringing it back allows me to pay out other money. The broader point, though, is that our big companies are not capital constrained. If they see good investment opportunities, they can make them—borrowing costs, after all, are still very low by historical standards—whether or not they're able to bring their overseas earnings over here at a low tax rate. In other words, there aren't any jobs they want to create but can't afford to.

That doesn't mean corporate tax reform isn't a good idea. It still could be. A system that raised the revenue we need and didn't create an incentive for companies to "move" their intellectual property to, say, low (or no) tax Ireland would be better than one that did. But it does mean that it probably wouldn't be "something that is so phenomenal, far beyond what people even think," as Trump claimed during the campaign. Which is to say that it wouldn't exactly, to quote the president again, "turn America into a new magnet for new jobs. Instead, it would do a lot for Wall Street and the well-connected, and do nothing for Main Street and what Trump called the "forgotten men and women" of the country.

Populism is just another alternative fact of the Trump administration.Robin Smith, left, and sister Kimberly Smith drove from Pennsylvania last month to visit the project. (Michael Laris/The Washington Post)

When Kimberly Smith dragged her sister to Washington last month, their first stop wasn’t the White House or the Jefferson Memorial. It was a patch of tricked-out pavement in Dupont Circle.

The Smith sisters made the trek from the Poconos specifically to experience the District’s “Smart City” experiment in human­-generated power. But as they paced on sidewalk tiles designed to collect energy from their footsteps and turn on a strip of interactive lights, Smith couldn’t help being a bit disappointed.

“It’s a great thrill. But I have my questions right now,” she said.

While the underground generators beneath the pavers were capturing the Pennsylvanians’ energy, the interactive lights weren’t switching on as they walked. “They’re not working,” Smith said, dancing around just to make sure. “That’s unfortunate.”

Project boosters had bounced around on those same triangular tiles during an opening ceremony in November, prompting six little lights embedded in the pavement nearby to glow in sync with their footsteps.

It wasn’t exactly Michael Jackson tearing it up on a glowing sidewalk in his “Billie Jean” video. But it worked. And it highlighted the broader pitch from Pavegen, the British sustainable-energy start-up behind the technology, which touted its “ability to connect physical and digital worlds through a single footstep.”

The company says it is in talks with officials in Chicago, San Francisco and the Middle East about additional installations, and executives are raising money to spur production and drive down costs, which are far higher than those of traditional pavers. Washington is the first test case for the latest version of the company’s technology. And the real world has at times been humbling.

“We’ve got a crazy challenge, and there are tweaks being made,” said Laurence Kemball-Cook, Pavegen’s founder.

Among the issues: Washington’s winter weather has made energy production 5 to 10 percent lower than expected, Kemball-Cook said. “The main thing we will be doing is testing out some ‘DC’ optimized generators that should be better with the temperature variances,” he wrote in an email.

The system also is getting fewer steps — and thus less energy — than anticipated, Kemball-Cook said. People walking toward or coming from a nearby Metro entrance sometimes end up missing the strip of high-tech pavers or cutting across them.

“When pedestrians cut the corner they are only doing a few steps on the array rather than the expected 10 to 14 steps,” Kemball-Cook said, reducing by up to 20 percent the amount of energy piped into a big battery system. “We should have moved the whole thing two feet to the left.”

Another of the three patches of pavers had somewhat more traffic than expected, so the complete “footfall” numbers aren’t yet clear, he said.

Still, the company needed to do some triage.

The human-generated energy was intended to power two light displays — the interactive lights in the sidewalk and LEDs meant to glow at night under new park benches. There was also a relatively power-hungry digital uplink feature that was supposed to feed a Web page with data on energy production.

Kemball-Cook said the company made some temporary technical adjustments. The result: The Web page and interactive lights haven’t been working, but the bench lights have.

After delays due to the inauguration and a hang-up at customs, Kemball-Cook said, company technicians are expected to be on site as early as this weekend to investigate and make fixes.

[This Dupont Circle sidewalk turns footsteps into power]

The District Department of Transportation has overseen the $300,000 project, which includes new sidewalks, planters and benches as well as the 194 high-tech pavers in the city’s newest miniature park. Pavegen received about $100,000, city officials said.

“We continue to monitor the progress of the project and work collaboratively with Pavegen,” DDOT said in a statement. “We are aware of the technical challenges and have been informed that Pavegen staff will be here as soon as this weekend to address the issues.”

Leona Agouridis, executive director of the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District, which provided some of the funding, said she’s pleased to see the cooperation between the city and the company.

“The first couple tries, or the first couple months or whatever, is a learning experience for everybody,” Agouridis said. “Everybody hopes that this great innovation is going to be perfected to the point where it can be applied on a larger scale. This is a smaller scale. It’s kind of like a controlled laboratory.”

Not everyone is as patient.

“I’d just rather have a well-designed sidewalk that drains properly — and no gimmicks,” said Samuel Barber, a District-born dog-walker, who came by this week. “If we’re the test case, did we pay the full price or did we get a discount?”

Kemball-Cook said as with any innovation, the early days can be daunting.

But the partnership between the District and his company will benefit both, he said, and he can envision sharing later iterations with the city.

“We’ve got this shared vision to make this as great as we possibly can,” Kemball-Cook said. Whether it’s “a road that generates energy” or a related innovation in the future, “we’ll probably give them that to test as well, because there’s that relationship.”

Another letdown for Smith was that “no one knows what they’re walking on,” she said.

As she visited, many seemingly oblivious Washingtonians power-strolled their way through the winter chill, often ignoring the tiles. She noted that there was no placard informing pedestrians what was underfoot or that they, as the technology’s fans hope, could be on the vanguard of a sustainable-energy revolution.

Though Smith is eager for the kinks to get worked out, she remains a believer. The artist has been following Kemball-Cook’s progress online for years. “Laurence invented these in his bedroom — it’s really incredible,” she said.

“We drove four hours to walk on these,” said Robin Smith, who came along for the ride. “She’s my sister. What’s dear to her is dear to me.”Travel Tip – Content (photo credit) content here blah blah Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse condimentum mi vel ultricies iaculis.

The University of Pennsylvania’s president has no comment about one of the Ivy League school’s most famous alumni, President Trump. Virginia Tech’s president has no comment about one of its most famous alumni, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon.

The president of Trinity Washington University, though, has had plenty to say about one of its graduates. “Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trinity Class of 1989, has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the Trump Administration’s war on immigrants among many other issues,” Patricia McGuire wrote recently.

[‘You do not represent us': Wharton students and alums write to Trump]

University presidents used to be part of the national dialogue, decades ago when the demands of the job were less complicated and the need for fundraising less consuming. But it has long been unusual for a college to single out a graduate for criticism, especially as college and university presidents are expected to build community among a diverse group of students, faculty, staff and alumni, to foster pride in the institution, and to raise money and support from people on all sides of the political spectrum.

Because of the importance of alumni to fundraising, said Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education, “presidents tread very carefully. Losing the support of alumni is a very bad idea.”

But McGuire, the longtime president of the small women’s college in Northeast Washington, said she felt a moral imperative to speak out against the Trump administration — in particular for its policies on immigration and its lack of truthfulness — and Conway is not exempt from that.

Conway said by phone Friday she was surprised to find her alma mater’s social media feed full of partisan retweets and snarky comments. “It’s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,” she said, citing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as an example, “attack me, and never have the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion.” McGuire had looked at her comments through the most negative lens possible, she said.

McGuire never hesitated to call her to ask for donations to Trinity, Conway added. She and her husband donated $50,000 to a 1999-2002 Trinity fundraising campaign. “My money was good.”

[A professor called Trump’s victory ‘terrorism.’ The student who recorded the rant got suspended.]

While a few college presidents have taken a strong public stand against President Trump, and hundreds have signaled their opposition to his immigration policies, Trinity stands out for the volume and tone of its messages.

Through its institutional and its president’s social media messages, the university has been sharply and repeatedly critical of Trump, his policies and many of his top advisers.

“I get better treatment from Robby Mook,” Conway said, of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, “than I do from the president of the university I attended.”

Trinity has been quick to praise other alumnae, many of them Democrats, such as former Obama administration Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius — who is prominently displayed on the school’s home page highlighting women graduates “shattering glass ceilings” — and Pelosi, but also some Republicans, as well as honorary alumnae.

For a small Catholic women’s college to have as their alumnae both the first female Speaker of the House and the first woman to run a Republican presidential campaign, Conway said, and to “look at the disparate treatment of the two of us, tells the entire tale.”

[Thousands assemble at Washington Monument for the March for Life]

She asked why she didn’t see concern expressed about Pelosi’s support for abortion rights, or mention of her own speech at the recent March for Life, which signaled high-level administration support for the cause. “Does she not think there are pro-life alumnae?”

Conway said McGuire clearly sees her position and the role of the university as one “that is peddling a very narrowly subscribed political viewpoint.”

[‘They never saw this coming': A Q & A with Kellyanne Conway about President Trump’s victory]

McGuire said it’s not about politics. (She also said the university does not support Pelosi’s support for abortion rights.) “People can agree or disagree around national policy or domestic policy. You can have a raging debate about Obamacare … But when you lie so consistently as this administration does, that’s a moral issue. We are teachers. We have an honor system here. We believe deeply in upholding the value of truth. … it’s urgent not to be shy about it.

McGuire said some alumnae have criticized her for not honoring Conway.

But she said she has gotten hundreds of messages from alumnae whom she described as appalled by Conway. “I don’t go around denouncing our alumnae,” she said, but “I want to be on the record: We don’t condone lying. We can’t say someone is exempt from that.”

“In offering criticism, it’s mean to be a call to a higher standard of behavior.”

There was a time, during Civil Rights battles and the Vietnam War, when university presidents were visible figures in national conversations. Some great public figures spoke out on the dominant issues of their times, said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College. That changed, he said, when fundraising and management became more important for college presidents than ideals and scholarship and public service.

This is a different moment, he said, one that transcends partisan politics. “Truth-telling is a crucial element of democracy, a true and absolutely indispensable component of any true definition of freedom. …

“If we don’t stand up for what we believe, we have nobody to blame at the end but ourselves.”

But some, at a time when many college campuses have been criticized as too liberal and out of touch, argue university presidents no longer speak for the nation.

[Conservative students at the University of Michigan ask why they are not included in the school’s “inclusiveness"]

“To me, university leadership has felt enormously partisan…” said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “That factors into seeing this as cheap partisan thuggery rather than any serious commitment to robust civic debate.” Of all the university graduates who had been convicted of crimes over the years, he asked rhetorically, how many have been singled out by their school?

He added, “Criticism is appropriate and valid – people have points of view. But I think it’s striking how incredibly uniform higher education is.”

[Nearly 600 colleges object to Trump’s travel ban]

McGuire benefits, Hartle said, from being a very established president with strong support from the board, faculty and alumnae (and not having to answer to state legislators, as a public university president would), which makes it possible for her to speak out about something she feels strongly about.

“This reflects her strong personal commitment to social justice and educational opportunity and the nature of her student body,” Hartle said.

Trinity, one of the oldest Catholic women’s colleges in the U.S., has changed dramatically over the years. It’s still a private school, but the undergraduate program now has a particular emphasis on reaching people facing significant hurdles to higher education, such as single mothers and women from low-income families. More than 95 percent of the students are black, Latina or mixed race, and some of their most academically outstanding students are “dreamers” working to achieve legal immigration status, who are now feeling personally at risk.

In a blog post, “On Lies and the Truths We Must Tell,” Maguire included some thoughts about Conway,

Some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client’s positions, and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign. But in fact, as is true of many of President Trump’s statements, her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth. Ms. Conway invented the now-infamous phrase “alternative facts” to defend Trump’s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration, a thinly-veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the Trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when, in fact, it was on the smaller side. Ms. Conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Perhaps the “Bowling Green Massacre” comment was truly a mistake, as she claims, but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban, an executive order that clearly discriminates against Muslims, was necessary.

Many people wrote warm thanks for the essay, and praised her courage. “Thanks, Pat, for your clarity and eloquence. You give voice to the Trinity I know, respect and love,” one alumna wrote.

Another cited past comments by Obama and asked, “where was the outrage and demand for the truth??”

Some wrote to McGuire on social media: “Shame on you,” and “God help any conservatives who may be trapped inside” Trinity.

McGuire acknowledged pushback; people tell her, “‘I can’t believe you’re saying this,’ or ‘You’re so liberal,’ or ‘You’re the great Satan,'” she said, laughing. “I’ve been at this long enough there’s always somebody who’s terribly upset with any statement.”

[Some college presidents seem afraid to speak out. Not this one.]

She pointed to signals Trump has sent that federal funding could be affected if he doesn’t like something a university does.

“That’s a threat that can’t just sit there,” McGuire said. “I don’t mean to provoke him. But I can’t just be silent …

“Many college presidents are entirely too reticent when it comes to addressing the clear moral issues at the center of some of the big national issues today,” she said. “We have academic freedom. We should speak truth to power.”

Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 22, 2016. (Alex Brandon/AP)

The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus said Friday that reports that the Trump administration had considered deploying tens of thousands of National Guard troops to apprehend undocumented immigrants were “outrageous” and “very reminiscent of what led up to World War II.”

Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) made the statement in an interview for C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program shortly after the Associated Press broke news of the draft Department of Homeland Security memo.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the memo was “not a White House document” and that “there is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.”

But Crowley said “seeing these kind of actions . . . even being talked about” was alarming.

“Using the National Guard, the Army, to come into our communities, to police our communities, to disrupt and to gather people up for the purpose of deporting them, is a very, very scary thing,” he said. “It’s not a country that I’m familiar with called the United States. It’s not how we conduct ourselves. We see that happen in other countries that aren’t as free and aren’t as open as we are to welcoming immigrants. We welcome immigrants. We want the best, the brightest and the bravest. . . . And now they’re under fear that armed [men], you know, with M-16 rifles, come to your door and break it down and leave your children who are American citizens there but take you and deport you.”

Pressed on the comparison to the run-up to World War II — a reference that could easily be interpreted as a reference to Nazi Germany — Crowley backed off only slightly: “I think we have to always look at our past and look at the history of the world, to put into context where we are today. I’m not describing and saying this is like Germany per se, or making any comparison to Nazis or anything else. What I’m saying is that we as a people have to be concerned about the use of our military to usurp the authority of our police departments. When anyone is suggesting that, that is something to be very, very concerned about.”

The remarks on the immigration order came amid a wide-ranging interview in which Crowley repeatedly expressed concern about President Trump, about his alleged ties to and apparent sympathies for Russia and about whether congressional Republicans will provide checks on his administration.

“When the president omits the mentioning of the Jewish people in the Holocaust remembrance and there’s not a peep from a Republican member of the House? That’s disturbing,” Crowley said, noting that Democrats attempted to bring a resolution to the House floor addressing the omission. “They refused to take that up. They dismiss it. The president continues to dismiss it. That’s not going away. . . . I think they’re tremendously scared of him.”

At other points, Crowley accused Trump and members of his administration of “lying to the American people over and over again” and said the next four years will be “very, very rocky, if he gets to four years.”

Crowley spoke a week after House Democrats met in Baltimore to lick their wounds after losing the presidency and failing to win the House majority for the fourth consecutive election cycle. He acknowledged that “there was a good bit of soul-searching going on” at the policy retreat and that, “even a few months after the election, we’re still finding our way.”

But Crowley said the onus was on Trump and Republicans, given their control of Washington, to approach Democrats about finding a governing consensus, and he said Trump’s actions after one month in office had given Democrats little reason to work with Trump to get things done.

He made reference to a string of Sunday talk-show appearances last week by presidential adviser Stephen Miller, who said in a CBS interview that “the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.”

Crowley took sharp exception to that claim.

“Everything will be questioned,” he said. “By the legislative branch — Democrats right now, and hopefully Republican colleagues — and by the judiciary.

Reporters raise their hands at President Trump's news conference Feb. 16. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

WEST PALM BEACH. Fla. — President Trump further escalated his attacks on the news media Friday afternoon when he tweeted that outlets such as the New York Times, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN are not his enemy but “the enemy of the American People.”

Although Trump has long colorfully criticized news coverage and sparred with reporters who question him, he had not yet labeled the fourth estate as being an enemy of the country. On the campaign trail, some of Trump's supporters would heckle and threaten reporters who covered his rallies, and his tweet Friday came 24 hours before his first political rally as president.

It took the president two tries to properly post his message, which came soon after he arrived at his luxury oceanfront estate for the weekend. The first tweet, which was quickly deleted, contained a number of extra spaces and listed the Times, CNN and NBC, ending with this conclusion: “SICK!” The second tweet added ABC and CBS to the list, while removing “SICK!” Both tweets labeled those organizations as being “the FAKE NEWS media.”

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

The media has been credited with breaking stories about Trump's administration that have prompted action this week, including the resignation of his national security adviser Monday and his nominee for labor secretary withdrawing from consideration Wednesday. Meanwhile, the president has accused the press of distorting facts and berated it for not painting a rosy portrait of the country under his leadership. At a news conference at the White House on Thursday, Trump uttered the words “fake news” seven times.

“Much of the media in Washington, D.C. — along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular — speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system,” Trump said early in the news conference, which lasted over an hour and 15 minutes. “The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.”

[In an erratic performance, President Trump shows his supporters who’s boss]

Thursday night, the Republican Party and Trump's campaign websites posted a 25-question “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey.” The survey formalized Trump's attacks and his insinuation that media outlets are working against the American people. It's unclear what, if anything, the data will be used for, and participants are required to give their name, email address and Zip code.

The first question asks: “Do you believe that the mainstream media has reported unfairly on our movement?” It then asks whether the survey-taker believes that MSNBC, CNN or Fox News “report fairly on Trump's presidency,” allowing for answers of “yes,” “no” or “no opinion.” Those surveyed are also asked their primary source of news, with options limited to those three cable networks, along with “local news.” There is no mention of specific newspapers, websites, magazines or non-cable networks.

Other questions ask whether the survey-takers think the media does “due diligence fact-checking before publishing stories on the Trump administration,” whether it fairly reported on the rollout of Trump's travel ban, whether “political correctness has created biased news coverage on both illegal immigration and radical Islamic terrorism” and whether the media has been “far too quick to spread false stories about our movement.” Participants can also indicate which issues the media does “the worst job of representing Republicans” on, with the option to pick as many topics as they like.

The final question: “Do you believe that our Party should spend more time and resources holding the mainstream media accountable?”

[Memo to Donald Trump: Thomas Jefferson invented hating the media]

The social-media ads driving people to the survey were paid for by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee that splits its proceeds between Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee. Since Trump’s victory, the fundraising committee has continued to pepper supporters with appeals for money, helping keep a steady stream of contributions flowing to the party and Trump’s campaign. By the end of December, Trump had already socked away $7 million into his campaign account, money that officials said they are stockpiling for his 2020 reelection effort.

Digital fundraising experts said the media accountability survey appeared designed to keep Trump’s most loyal supporters engaged. People who fill out the questionnaire are taken to a donation page where they are asked to give between $35 and $2,500 — with the option of making a monthly recurring donation.

“President Trump is asking you to go the extra mile and make a contribution to help defend our movement from the outrageous attacks from the media coming our way,” it states. “Contribute now to help us fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions.”

Jose Daniel Estrada, 36, of Clifton, worked as a math teacher at Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School, according to police and school officials.

In a statement, Falls Church City Public Schools said they learned of allegations against Estrada on Jan. 17 and he was immediately removed from the classroom and placed on leave. The school system also contacted police and child protective services.

Estrada began working at the school in July of 2015, a spokesman for Falls Church schools said.

He is being held at the Arlington County Jail, police said.

It’s official: Germans are more worried about President Trump than Russian President Vladimir Putin.

That, at least, is the result of a poll published Friday by FG Wahlen for public broadcaster ZDF, in which a whopping 78 percent of Germans asked said they were “very concerned” about Donald Trump's policies, up from 62 percent in January. Meanwhile, 58 percent said they were worried about the politics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while 40 percent said they weren't.

The poll, conducted Feb. 14-16, surveyed 1,231 Germans.

The poll results suggest the fast-wavering trust in Trump’s America unfolding in Germany, Europe’s largest economy and a key U.S. ally. On Friday, the same day as the poll was published, German commentators were describing Trump’s rambling news conference on Thursday as surreal.

“It sounds tough, but after this memorable press conference one hopes that there's a good medical department in the White House to check whether everything really is all right with this man,” wrote Veit Medick, a Washington correspondent for Der Spiegel.

Also Friday, Germany’s Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen blasted Trump’s policies and statements, although without directly mentioning his name, at a major security conference in Munich. With Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly in the audience, she said NATO’s values did not leave “any room for torture.” She also warned against turning the effort to combat international terrorism into a “front against Muslims and Islam.”

On Saturday, Merkel is set to deliver a speech at the same conference singling out the need for multilateral cooperation at a time when Trump has seemed to offer conditional support for the transatlantic alliance.

You’re all set!Adapted from an online discussion.

Dear Carolyn: My wife’s family will host get-togethers, and her parents will extend invitations to them on others’ behalf.

We have a strained relationship with her extended family due to our not understanding or not following whatever social conventions they have that we haven’t lived up to. They are also terrible at communication and confrontation.

I’m inclined at this point to say that unless we hear from the party thrower directly, we don’t consider it an invite. However, her parents then seem put out that they have to shoulder the burden for us not going.

How do we handle this?

(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)

Word-of-Mouth Invited

Word-of-Mouth Invited: I’m sorry this family needlessly complicates things for you.

I’m also sorry this advice is mostly for your wife and I’m using you as a conduit.

Where solutions fail, I suggest policies: She tells her parents she appreciates their efforts to include the two of you and that of course she wants to attend — however, to save the second-guessing and hard feelings of recent history, she’s considering herself invited only if she hears it from the hosts directly.

If her parents accuse her of being selfish or high-maintenance or whatever else, it would behoove her not to fight them on it. “That may be so, Mom, but this is what works for us.” No justifications, no explaining, no further argument.

Then she can assure them that she doesn’t expect them to be the go-betweens, because that’s a lousy position to be in. She’s just warning them so they aren’t confused by your absences.

If other family members decry your absences, then she (and you) can be sympathetic and understanding and regretful: “Bummer, we would have loved to be there. Please let us know directly next time? We don’t always know where we’re expected.”

Of course all involved could get snippy with you about this development, but if you’re cheerful and consistent and you’re giving everyone a simple way to avoid any miscommunication, then you really haven’t left a lot of room to feel bad about your end of this decision. Good luck.

Dear Carolyn: I have a friend who always insists on picking up the check. I know it’s just a personality quirk of his, and I actually rather enjoy our witty bickering over who’s going to pay. But I would like to do something nice for him once in a while. I don’t want to just give the wait staff my credit card at the start of the meal, because where’s the fun in that? I want to WIN!

How to Pay?

How to Pay?: Per a reader, servers don’t want to be responsible for keeping your card safe while you eat: “Simply tell the server you’re picking up the check and in no way is the server to take the other person’s card.” A win’s a win.

Re: Paying: Another tactic: Don’t fight on his turf, but instead find a way to win on yours. Bake cookies? Organize a group outing? Find a hidden gem of a restaurant for one of these dinners? He’s more likely to be impressed if you do something he can’t.

How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies

We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

● Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service

● Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.

● Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.

Christine Baranski returns as Diane Lockhart in "The Good Fight,” which will be available through CBS All Access. (Jeff Neira/CBS)

One needn’t always perk up at the words “But wait, there’s more!” which is why it might have seemed, only nine months ago, as if we’d had our fill of the fictional Chicago law firms, courtrooms and political squabbles seen in seven seasons of Robert and Michelle King’s hit CBS drama “The Good Wife.” Even the most faithful watchers were ready to move on.

But what do we know? With remarkable turnaround, the Kings and their collaborators have delivered a spinoff drama, “The Good Fight,” which, in its first two episodes, proves to be a more-than-worthy successor, with the potential to surpass the original. That’s the good news.

The bad news (depending on how much you’re currently spending on your TV addiction) is that “The Good Fight” will only be available through CBS All Access, the network’s subscription streaming site that costs $5.99 a month — make that $9.99 if you want it commercial-free. Taking a page from the huckster handbook, the first taste is on the house: CBS will air a slightly edited version of the pilot episode Sunday night to lure you in, and the remaining nine episodes will be released weekly on the pay site.

That’s a little irksome, especially for those of us already paying for the privilege of watching CBS on cable or satellite. And yet consumers all but asked for this situation, first by demanding a-la-carte options from their cable providers (which never came to pass), and then, as Netflix and others revolutionized the streaming experience, cutting their cords with zeal. CBS is wise to elbow in on this action.

So, with that fine print out of the way, let’s get back to appraising “The Good Fight.” Set a year or so after “The Good Wife’s” slaptastic finale, we catch up with Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) at the top of her game. Her law firm, Lockhart Gardner, has merged with two other firms, creating a top-heavy mumbo-jumbo of partners. (Their names barely fit on the lobby wall.) Sensing it’s a good time to retire and get away from her displeasure at Donald Trump’s election win, Diane is shopping for a country villa in France while she works toward a settlement in her last case, representing the city in a police brutality case.

Then her world falls apart. A lifelong friend, Henry Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle), a prominent investor who manages Diane’s personal fortune, is arrested and accused of running a Bernard Madoff-like Ponzi scheme. Learning that she’s broke, Diane blurts out the f-word with the thrilling emotion of a character who is no longer on broadcast TV. (I guess CBS will have to bleep it out during Sunday’s airing.)

Diane asks for her job back, but she’s shown the door by her weaselly partners, including David Lee (Zach Grenier) and Howard Lyman (Jerry Adler).

As it happens, Rindell’s daughter, Maia (Rose Leslie, who played Ygritte on “Game of Thrones”), has been working as a new associate in Diane’s firm — thanks to strings Diane had pulled for her. Maia is now also out of a job and bereft at the possibility that her father (and maybe also her mother, played by Bernadette Peters) were part of such a massive crime. The first treat in “The Good Fight” is to see how instantly good Leslie is as a rookie lawyer faced with an overwhelming personal crisis. The show could easily be built around her — and it sort of is.

Baranski, of course, is a force all her own; fans will enjoy watching Diane pick herself up and start anew. Her rescuer comes in the form of Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo), Diane’s opposing attorney on the police brutality case and a partner at a law firm that prides itself on its all-black staff. Convincing his colleagues — among them Diane’s former employee, Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) — that she would be a strong “diversity hire,” Lindo makes Diane a junior partner. Maia also winds up working there on the lowest rung. And before long so does Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele), and, as we get back to the courtroom, a host of familiar judges and attorneys from “The Good Wife” universe begin to reappear.

Still, the show is by no means a retread. There are shifts in storytelling and core values that are different from “The Good Wife” and make judicious use of new freedoms to be a little more risque. Most notable is the way “The Good Fight” becomes an intriguing drama about life at a minority-owned law firm, where the money, clients and a sense of justice are not as easily won as they were at Diane’s old job.

On its broadcast network, CBS may or may not have had the gumption to roll out a new one-hour drama about black lawyers — and that’s not exactly what it’s done here, either, using the firm more as a backdrop than center stage. It’s a subtle but effective use of diversity that continues to elude CBS in its on-air programming — which is all the more reason I wish “The Good Fight” was airing for free, where more viewers might catch it, instead of being offered as a fancy accessory.

The Good Fight (one hour) premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS. The remaining nine episodes will become available each Sunday on CBS All Access, a subscription streaming service.

Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) in North Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 17. (Sean Rayford/Getty Images)

In a candid and lengthy interview with Politico Magazine, Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said that Donald Trump has “fanned the flames of intolerance,” one of a string of criticisms that the former governor leveled at the president.

In the interview with Tim Alberta, which can be found here, Sanford said that “at some level” Trump “represents the antithesis, or the undoing, of everything I thought I knew about politics, preparation and life.”

You should definitely read the full piece (again, check it out here), but here are a few snippets of what Sanford, the former governor of South Carolina, said about Trump:

His digs at Trump cover the spectrum. The president, Sanford says, “has fanned the flames of intolerance.” He has repeatedly misled the public, most recently about the national murder rate and the media’s coverage of terrorist attacks. He showed a lack of humility by using the National Prayer Breakfast to ridicule Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ratings on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Most worrisome, Sanford says, Trump is unprepared for the presidency.

And, later on in the piece, Alberta writes:

Sanford says he’s spoken with Trump only once, and the interaction was brief, backstage at a primary debate in South Carolina. “I’ve watched you. You’re a winner,” Trump told him, as Sanford recalls. He rolls his eyes. “It’s like, OK.” Sanford swears he has nothing personal against the new president; in fact, he’s heard good things about him personally from several mutual acquaintances. But, he says, he can’t “look the other way” as Trump peddles false information to suit his political aims.

When Alberta asked whether Trump was an “honest man,” Sanford replied that he had to be careful. “Because people who live in glass houses can’t throw stones,” Sanford said.

His comments on Trump and honesty might seem noteworthy because Sanford in 2009 confessed that he had been involved in an extramarital affair with a woman in Argentina, a scandal that destroyed his marriage and, for a time, his political career.

Sanford at the time made headlines when he went missing for days, a disappearance that his office initially attributed to a hike along the Appalachian Trail. After he returned, he admitted that he had traveled to Argentina to see the woman with whom he was having an affair. He was at one point engaged to that woman, Maria Belen Chapur, but in 2014 announced that the engagement had been called off.

Sanford also suggested that he was somewhat disappointed with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) in the wake of Trump's victory.

“I admired his conviction in the campaign,” Sanford told Politico Magazine of Ryan. But, according to the piece, he added, “At the end of the day, radio silence is not sustainable in being true to yourself.”

Ryan's office did not immediately reply Friday to an email seeking comment about Sanford's remarks.

Eugene Robinson is an Associate Editor and twice-weekly columnist for The Washington Post. His column appears on Tuesdays and Fridays. In a 25-year career at The Post, Robinson has been city hall reporter, city editor, foreign correspondent in Buenos Aires and London, foreign editor, and assistant managing editor in charge of the paper's award-winning Style section. In 2005, he started writing a column for the Op-Ed page. He is the author of "Coal to Cream: A Black Man's Journey Beyond Color to an Affirmation of Race" (1999) and "Last Dance in Havana" (2004). Robinson is a member of the National Association of Black Journalists and has received numerous journalism awards.Michael Novak, a Catholic philosopher who helped carve a space for religion in modern politics, diplomacy and economics, arguing that capitalism is the economic system most likely to achieve the spiritual goods of defeating poverty and encouraging human creativity, died Feb. 17 at his home in Washington. He was 83.

The cause was complications from colon cancer, said his daughter Jana Novak.

Mr. Novak, who spent his formative years in the seminary, was widely recognized as one of the most influential Catholic theologians of his generation. He was the 1994 recipient of the Templeton Prize, which honors makers of an “exceptional contribution to affirming life’s spiritual dimension” and is accompanied by a monetary award exceeding that of the Nobel Prize.

In a measure of Mr. Novak’s influence within the Catholic Church, he was received and consulted by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. He was at times a professor, a columnist, chief U.S. delegate to the U.N. Human Rights Commission and, for several decades, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank in Washington.

Mr. Novak was among several scholars who “brought serious religious thought to Washington in a way that it had not been present before,” George Weigel, a distinguished senior fellow at the Washington-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, said in an interview.

He credited Mr. Novak with demonstrating to an “audience of insiders” a “way of thinking that was not merely statistical or ideological but was perhaps more deeply reflective of enduring human questions and problems.”

Mr. Novak wrote a shelf full of books on topics ranging from nuclear weapons to atheism to social justice to sports. But he was best known for his economic writings, particularly the book “The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism” (1982).

“Democratic capitalism,” he wrote, is “neither the Kingdom of God nor without sin. Yet all other known systems of political economy are worse. Such hope as we have for alleviating poverty and for removing oppressive tyranny — perhaps our last, best hope — lies in this much despised system.”

Mr. Novak’s book found resonance around the world. It was illegally distributed in Poland, where the Solidarity movement helped defeat communism. His writings were credited with influencing Václav Havel, the dissident playwright who became the first president of Czechoslovakia after communism, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.

In affairs across the Atlantic, Mr. Novak was a forceful critic of liberation theology as it was espoused in Latin America, where many adherents argued that the church should provide economic deliverance for the poor through leftist political ideologies.

Critics of Mr. Novak charged that he overlooked the severe inequalities often wrought by capitalism: “Michael Novak preaches capitalism’s virtues to Christians,” Arthur Jones, a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter, once wrote. “The breakthrough will come when he simultaneously preaches Christian virtues to his capitalist backers.”

Mr. Novak acknowledged that “Judaism and Christianity do not require democratic capitalism.” But, he continued, “it is only that without it they would be poorer and less free.”

In the sphere of international affairs, Mr. Novak tussled with church leaders over Catholic teaching on “just war.” He regarded the nuclear deterrent as a moral means of prevailing over the Soviet Union in the Cold War and defeating what Weigel said they and like-minded thinkers considered Communism’s “defective” and “downgraded view of the human person.”

It was under President Ronald Reagan that Mr. Novak served on the U.N.’s human rights body. Communism, Weigel said, explaining his and Mr. Novak’s position, “denied that the human person was made in the image and likeness of God, and it’s that image in us that is the root, we would argue, of the human dignity from which spring human rights.”

In the cultural arena, Mr. Novak wrote frankly of “radical feminism, gay liberation, utopian socialism and geopolitical neutralism” and “the cheaply radical young graduates of . . . Catholic universities.” But he also drew praise for the openness with which he approached religious dialogue, such as in his book “No One Sees God: The Dark Night of Atheists and Believers” (2008).

“The line of belief and unbelief,” he wrote, “is not drawn between one person and another, normally, but rather down the inner souls of all of us.”

Michael John Novak Jr. was born to a Slovak American family in Johnstown, Pa., on Sept. 9, 1933. His father was an insurance salesman, and his mother was a homemaker. A brother, Richard Novak, became a priest and was killed amid political upheaval in Bangladesh in 1964.

Mr. Novak joined the Congregation of Holy Cross at 14 and studied for the priesthood but ultimately left the order.

“It was not untypical of bright idealistic Catholic boys to want to enter the priesthood, though your immediate circle of friends thought you were faintly crazy,” Mr. Novak told the New York Times in 1982. He said that he aspired to be a novelist, but “didn’t see how I could do the independent thinking and traveling I wanted to do, and do it in community and under obedience.”

His first book, a novel titled “The Tiber Was Silver” (1961), centered on an American seminarian who ventures to Rome and wrestles with the question of whether he can pursue his religious vocation as well as his love of painting.

Mr. Novak received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., in 1956, a bachelor of sacred theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1958 and a master’s degree in the history and philosophy of religion from Harvard University in 1966.

He positioned himself initially on what he described as the “anticapitalist left.” In the early years of his career, he taught at schools including Stanford University, the State University of New York and Syracuse University and did political work for Democrats including Sen. George S. McGovern (S.D.), a torchbearer for liberalism despite his landslide loss to President Richard M. Nixon (R) in 1972.

Mr. Novak supported the liberalization of the Catholic Church brought about by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s — a position he later recanted — and opposed such church teachings as its prohibition on contraception. His early liberal writings included the book “The Open Church” (1964), about the effects of Vatican II, and “A Theology for Radical Politics” (1969).

Over the next several years, Mr. Novak shifted rightward, economically and culturally — an evolution detailed in the memoir “Writing From Left to Right: My Journey From Liberal to Conservative” (2013).

Contributing to his growing disillusionment with the left was the unsympathetic reception of his book “The Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics” (1972). In that volume, he railed against what he regarded as the marginalization of working-class Eastern European and other ethnic groups by the elite, largely Protestant establishment.

In 1978, Mr. Novak joined AEI, where he retired in 2010. He served at the time of his death on the faculty of Catholic University.

Mr. Novak’s wife of 46 years, the former Karen Laub, died in 2009. Survivors include three children, Richard L. Novak of San Antonio, Tanya Holton of Boston and Jana Novak of Oklahoma City; a sister, Mary Ann Novak of Washington; a brother, Benjamin Novak of Ave Maria, Fla.; and four grandchildren.

With his daughter Jana, Mr. Novak wrote “Tell Me Why: A Father Answers His Daughter’s Questions About God” (1998). In that volume, he articulated his idea of what God is — and is not.

“He is not ‘the Big Guy upstairs,’ nor the loud booming voice that Hollywood films affect for God. . . . There are hosts of bogus pictures for God: the Watchmaker beyond the skies, the puppeteer of history,” he wrote. “If you wish to find him, watch for him in quiet and humility — perhaps among the poor and broken things of earth.

“There are people,” he continued, “who looked into the eyes of the most abandoned of the poor and saw infinite treasure there, treasure without price, and there found God dwelling.”4

National Guard memo is ‘reminiscent of what led up to World War II,’ a top House Democrat saysSushi chef Greg Ryu at the District’s Soho Cafe. His $6 Cup O(f) Rice satisfies hungry diners. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)

It was the parentheses that first attracted me to Cup O(f) Rice, a lunch entree served daily at the Soho Cafe at 13th and K streets NW.

The sign didn’t say Cup of Rice or Cup o’ Rice or Cuppa Rice, but Cup O(f) Rice.

I pronounce it this way: Cup Oh-fuh Rice.

The first time I got Cup O(f) Rice was a revelation. It comes in various permutations: beef, pork, shrimp, etc. I ordered it with chicken. Before the plastic lid was snapped on top, the man making it fired up a little blowtorch and applied flame to the meaty strips like he was brazing a gas fitting. It struck me as midday theater, a delightful bit of bargain Benihana.

I paid for my Cup O(f) Rice — $6 — took the elevator back up to my office, sat at my desk, removed the lid from the cup and beheld . . . what, exactly?

Leonardo Cruz Portillo applies the finishing touch to a chicken Cup O(f) Rice: a blast from a tiny flamethrower. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)

I saw none of the namesake rice. On top was the chicken, still hot from the blowtorch. And two tiny fried dumplings. And a thatch of glassy sweet potato noodles. This was all drizzled with spicy sauce and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and discs of sliced green onion.

I dug down and made a surprise discovery: shredded iceberg lettuce. That didn’t seem very Asian to me.

Finally, below that, was the rice.

It tasted good, but it was confusing. Who gives you rice and noodles and dumplings? Who thinks American iceberg lettuce goes with Asian dumplings? Who decided on the blowtorch? I vowed to meet the person behind Cup O(f) Rice.

That person is Greg Ryu. When we sat down together in the lull after a recent lunch rush, he explained that Cup O(f) Rice is “a kind of a Korean and Japanese fusion food.”

Greg, 46, is kind of a Korean/Japanese fusion himself. Born in Korea, he moved to Japan at age 13. He learned the art of sushi there — and married a Japanese woman — before moving to Maryland in 1998 to study biotechnology.

Soho Cafe is owned by a man named Des So, who owns several similar cafeterias. In 2014, Greg was working at one near the White House — the Met Cafe — when the boss asked him to put his mind to something: There was room to install a new food preparation area, but what should be made there?

Diners can choose different levels of spiciness for their Cups O(f) Rice at the Soho Cafe. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)

Greg had an idea. In Korea, there is bibimbap: rice with various toppings. The Japanese have something similar called donburi. Greg took these as inspiration and added ingredients from the sushi world, including a dumpling called gyuza and eel sauce.

He wanted different flavors and different textures: soft for one layer, crunchy for the next. He tried different vegetables, including spring mix, but found that it “died very quickly.” Shredded iceberg lettuce held up better. Sprinkles of deep-fried tempura batter added a satisfying crunch.

Greg tried different proteins, including a version with sausage — Polish sausage — “but it was not successful,” he said. Some things refuse to fuse.

He came up with various levels of spiciness by mixing different sauces: Korean gochujang, Sriracha from Vietnam, Chinese chili sauce . . .

And the blowtorch? It isn’t for show, Greg said, but to give the meat a flame taste, to juice it up and evaporate some of the sauce, encouraging it to mix with the other ingredients.

Greg said he spent about three months tweaking Cup O(f) Rice. “Everything has been changed a little by little,” he said, “and then there is perfection.”

It was an immediate hit.

The Met Cafe closed when renovations began in its building, but Cup O(f) Rice is just as popular at Soho Cafe. There, Greg tapped Leonardo Cruz Portillo to make it. Greg had noticed that Leo, as everyone calls the Salvadoran immigrant, was especially adept at plating.

“He had a kind of gift to assemble everything beautifully,” Greg said. “So I chose him, then I trained him.”

I asked if Greg had seen “Jiro Dreams of Sushi,” the movie about the three-star Michelin restaurant in Tokyo, where a meal averages $300.

He had. “I don’t want to make it too steep,” Greg said of his own creation. “I want an easy way to access food. I want food that is beautiful and well made at a medium price. That’s why I came up with Cup O(f) Rice.”

Greg believes food should be more than something that just keeps us from starving. “Food is culture,” he said.

And for six bucks, you can get some American culture: a pan-Asian dish invented by a Korean by way of Japan and made by a Salvadoran.

First lady Michelle Obama joins school children to harvest the summer crop from the White House kitchen garden, Tuesday, May 28, 2013, at the White House. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/P

It was less than a year ago that Michelle Obama referred to it as “her baby.”

She wasn’t talking about her youngest daughter, Sasha, or the Obama’s pet dog Bo, but something undoubtedly dear to her during her time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: the White House vegetable garden.

Her comments were made during her eighth and final spring planting, but “hopefully,” she added, “this will not be the last” one ever.

First lady Melania Trump confirmed that although the garden’s founder may have moved away, her beloved garden lives on. A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“As a mother and as the First Lady of this country, Mrs. Trump is committed to the preservation and continuation of the White House Gardens, specifically the First Lady’s Kitchen Garden and the Rose Garden,” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, senior adviser to the first lady, said in a statement to CNN.

[‘This is my baby’: Michelle Obama’s last spring planting at the White House garden]

The White House vegetable garden was supposedly the first of its kind since Eleanor Roosevelt’s in 1943, The Washington Post’s Dan Zak reported in April.

The garden in the past has offered a varied menu that included “Churchill” brussels sprouts and “Kentucky colonel” spearmint, as well as garlic and fennel and shallots and endive. The garden was, at last count, 1,700 square feet in size, but for the past eight years it has occupied a much larger space symbolically, as Michelle Obama used her platform to fight childhood obesity and improve America’s eating habits.

Throughout that fight, health advocates said, the garden was a physical reminder of Obama’s message.

“The vegetables wind up in dinners for the first family,” Zak noted. “Almost 500 pounds of them have been shipped to homeless shelters. In 2010, they ripened into Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign, for which the first lady danced with Elmo and Jimmy Fallon in order to get kids off the couch and to the crisper. She has also nudged corporations to trim salt, sugar and fat from food products.”

The garden — located on the corner of the South Lawn — more than doubled in area during the Obama presidency. The garden also includes an apiary and a pollinator garden for bees and other insects. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton told The Post that she intended to keep the garden if she were elected president, but Trump had not signaled whether the garden would survive until last week.

CNN reported that Trump toured the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Delray Beach, Fla., with Akie Abe, wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The visit gave the first lady — striking a Michelle Obama-esque tone — a chance to tout the health benefits and physical beauty that can be derived from a well-kept garden.

“Both our countries’ histories and cultures are steeped in the nurture and nature of gardening,” Trump said in a statement, according to CNN. “Having knowledge of different cultures and customs is a wonderful way to learn and to explore. Gardening teaches us the fundamentals in care and the evolution of living things, all while inspiring us to nurture our minds and to relax and strengthen our bodies.”

Beer of the Week: Allagash’s new year-round beer sounds simple. It isn’t.It started with the snacks. In December, Delta replaced its generic bags of peanuts and pretzels with finer crunches and chews, such as Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels, Squirrel Brand honey-roasted peanuts and NatureBox apple cinnamon yogurt bars. The next course will soon follow: free meals on a dozen cross-country routes.

The last time we saw gratis food — on any airline — that was larger than a half-ounce, we were scratching our heads over the iPad and Lady Gaga’s meat dress. Delta tested the service last year, and the people approved. On March 1, the carrier will start providing meals to main cabin passengers on flights between New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles or San Francisco. On April 24, it will expand to additional markets between the East (Washington, New York, Boston, Raleigh, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando) and West coasts (Portland, Seattle).

So, what’s coming out of the galley from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m.? In the morning, travelers can choose from a honey maple breakfast sandwich, Luvo breakfast medley, or fruit and cheese plate. Later in the day, they can fill up on a mesquite-smoked turkey combo, Mediterranean whole-grain veggie wrap, or fruit and cheese platter. The airline will also change the offerings to incorporate seasonal and local ingredients and flavors. (Note: All of the dishes are cold, and many overlap with the for-purchase Flight Fuel menu.) On red-eyes, customers will awaken to a gift from the fairy foodmother — a breakfast bar. Passengers in Delta Comfort+, who enjoy extra legroom, receive an extra pinch of pampering with a pre-arrival snack basket; free beer, wine and spirits; and a mid-service Greek frozen yogurt bar (only on the JFK to/from LAX and SFO route).

The complimentary meals are part of the company’s multimillion-dollar plan to improve the customer experience. Since last summer, the airline has introduced new Flight Fuel options, including a non-GMO snack box; a free in-flight entertainment system called Delta Studio (available on select aircraft); and cozier blankets. First-class fliers receive a gray Westin Heavenly blanket, and coach passengers snuggle up in calming blue.

Beethoven had an “ideal of this incredible, strong woman who saves her husband through her love,” says Antony Walker, who will conduct “Leonore,” forerunner to “Fidelio,” at the Lisner Auditorium on March 5. (Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera)

“The idea of a strong female who ends up liberating somebody who’s been unjustly imprisoned, and helping bring down a powerful, evil person, I think still really resonates today,” says the conductor Antony Walker.

He’s describing the plot of “Fidelio,” Ludwig van Beethoven’s only opera. And it resonates indeed. Throughout the 20th century, this story of a woman who disguises herself as a man to infiltrate the prison where her husband is unjustly confined (the opera’s subtitle is “Conjugal Love”) has been a beacon of heroic freedom and resistance to injustice. “Fidelio” was the first opera performed in Germany after the end of World War II; the prisoner’s chorus, an ode to freedom, has become a veritable anthem. And more than one stage director has moved the opera to a contemporary setting — including Jürgen Flimm’s powerful production, set in a 20th-century prison camp, which returns to the Metropolitan Opera on March 16.

But the plot was just as resonant in 1805 when Beethoven premiered the piece he initially called “Leonore” (the heroine’s name) rather than “Fidelio” (the name she assumes as a man). In France, around the time of the French Revolution, “rescue operas” — in which characters are saved from perilous situations — enjoyed a great vogue. One of these was “Léonore,” written in 1798 by Pierre Gaveaux, a now-forgotten tenor and composer, and popular for several years after its premiere. The libretto Gaveaux used, by Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, became the basis for several other operas, including versions by Ferdinando Paer and Simon Mayr as well as Beethoven’s “Leonore;” all three of these opened in 1804 and 1805, although Beethoven’s final, hard-won version, “Fidelio,” didn’t come to the stage until 1814.

Not everyone feels that “Fidelio” is the definitive take on the story; but not many people have had a chance to experience all of its antecedents. This month, however, audiences in Washington and New York will have a chance. On Feb. 19, Opera Lafayette will give the modern premiere of the Gaveaux work, which has lain nearly forgotten since the early 19th century (it will go to New York later that week). And on March 5, Walker will lead the Washington Concert Opera in the 1805 “Leonore,” which is the version of Beethoven’s work that Walker has always preferred. If you go to the Met production, as well, you can see three different versions of the same opera.

“It’s exactly the same story,” says Ryan Brown, the founder, conductor and artistic director of Opera Lafayette, of the Gaveaux piece. “Beethoven had the Bouilly libretto and was working with it. What we don’t know is whether he saw a copy of the [Gaveaux] score. After doing this [piece]” — Brown has been rehearsing “Léonore” for months — “I tend to think he did. But it’s one of those cases — Okay, that’s the same response to this situation in the libretto musically, the same use of figuration; is that just a trope of the time or did Beethoven hear [Gaveaux’s interpretation] and then make it so much more complicated?”

“Fidelio” is one of a number of operatic masterpieces that hover between two genres. It represents an uncertain juxtaposition of comedy, with the story of the jailer’s pretty daughter and her suitors, and high drama, with the story of a prisoner wasting away in a dungeon, rescued by his wife. The discrepancy stems from Bouilly’s libretto, which was purportedly based on a true story (perhaps a reason it doesn’t lend itself to neat pigeonholing), and every composer who has taken it on has wrestled with it. Mayr focused entirely on the humor; his opera based on this material is a one-act work he categorized as a “sentimental farce.” Paer tried to create a more Mozartian take that dips in and out of humor and seriousness. And this balance was one of the things that kept Beethoven struggling with the work for so many years.



“You start off with this sort of domestic comedy,” says the WCO’s Walker. “Then you find out about the man in the dungeon, and you start thinking very strange thoughts about Rocco [the jailer]: How can he just be sort of the jolly guy whose day job is actually helping to stab somebody to death? It’s the dilemma of the everyday person in that time, and still today it resonates. Ordinary, good people being put into intolerable situations.” Indeed, it is a modern trope: the loving family man who perpetrates acts of cruelty because he is just following orders.

Beethoven’s 1805 “Leonore” is considerably longer than the 1814 “Fidelio”: It extends over three acts rather than two and contains several entire numbers that were eliminated from the sparer final version, including a duet for Fidelio and Marzelline, the jailer’s daughter, that Walker calls “sublime,” and a big heroic aria for the villain Pizarro and the men’s chorus. Where “Fidelio” is “more symphonic in scope and more seriously heroic,” its original version presents “a more gradual progression” and arguably a smoother dramatic line, Walker says.

Brown is eager to present both works to his audience, as well. Opera Lafayette will present its own “Leonore” in the 2018-2019 season (financial concerns have led the company to put the production off for a season). In his view, the 1805 “Leonore” has closer links to the Gaveaux than the final “Fidelio,” including lighter voices. He has deliberately cast the Gaveaux opera with native French Canadian singers whom he plans to use in his staging of Beethoven’s “Leonore” as well, to underline the comparison and forward the hypothesis that Beethoven’s later, more heroic work also called for a different kind of voice.

Walker, however, sees Beethoven’s two versions as more closely linked; the same soprano, he points out, sang the title role in 1805 and 1814. There has been much debate about whether that indicates that the role was essentially written for the same voice type, or whether the singer’s voice became heavier with age, as voices tend to do. Walker, in any case, is casting the opera with the kind of Wagner/Strauss voices that have become standard in this piece: Marjorie Owens and Simon O’Neill will sing the leading roles, with Alan Held, who sang Wotan in the Washington National Opera’s “Ring” last year, as Pizarro.



For a modern audience, the main interest of the Gaveaux opera, obviously, is to see how it anticipates Beethoven’s later masterpiece. “We kind of want to have it both ways,” Brown concedes. “We want people to come because they’re heard of it, but we don’t really want them to compare it to what they already know. I think [the Gaveaux opera] really stands up, and you see why people found the story compelling.”

And whether it’s based on fact or not, the story does seem to have undergone a particular alchemy when Beethoven encountered it. “Beethoven never had a relationship that lasted with a female,” Walker points out. “And this ideal of this incredible, strong woman who saves her husband through her love and devotion — he was so passionate about trying to find somebody like that of his own; he never did. I think one of the reasons he was so interested in this was that it combined two topics that were passionate for him: revolutionary zeal and the immortal beloved.”

Opera Lafayette’s “Léonore ” will be performed in Washington at Lisner Auditorium on Feb. 19 and in New York at John Jay College on Feb. 23. The Washington Concert Opera’s “Leonore ” will be performed at Lisner Auditorium on March 5. “Fidelio” will be performed at the Metropolitan Opera from March 16 to April 8.

On a frosty morning in the Calvert County, Md., community of Chesapeake Beach, an hour southeast of the District, Lisa Klazura pushed her 2-year-old son, Coen, in his stroller across the parking lot near the storied Rod ’N’ Reel restaurant, casino and hotel.

Boats sporting names such as Player, Daydreamer and Bay Hunter rested in their slips for the winter and formed a nautical backdrop as Klazura, 34, talked about what brought her there.

“My husband’s job is at Andrews Air Force Base. There’s a good military community here,” she said.

The couple are leasing a four-bedroom house for $2,400 a month, which, she said, is an average rate for rents in the community. “We like the town because it’s small. We can walk by the water, we can kayak. And the people are nice.” Although Klazura said she misses her home state of Arizona, she likes that the Washington area “is green and that there’s seasons. So you’ve got that going for you.”

With a young family in tow, Pat “Irish” Mahoney moved from Alexandria, Va., to Chesapeake Beach in 1994, so that he would be closer to his federal job near Joint Base Andrews.





Now retired, Mahoney, 62, who was elected mayor in November, paid around $150,000 for a two-level house with a one-acre lot on a bayside block. “A guy built it in the 1950s as a one- or two-room cottage set under a big oak tree to hunt and fish,” he said. “He sold it to a waterman who used it for the same purpose.”

Since buying his house, which he estimates he could sell for $400,000, the town, he said, “has tripled in size.”

Railway, gambling roots: With the arrival of regular railroad service in the late 1890s, Chesapeake Beach forged close ties with the District and Baltimore. The visionary behind the initiative, Otto Mears, was a short-line railroad builder from Colorado. Mears and a circle of business partners from the Rocky Mountain State energized Chesapeake Beach with features such as beachfront hotels, a casino, a racetrack, a bathhouse and a 1,600-foot boardwalk over water. The first train pulled into the resort in June 1900 amid much hope and hoopla. However, in 1935, in the wake of financial chaos sparked by the Great Depression and the rising interest in the automobile, Mears’s railroad ceased operation.

Decades later, through the efforts of local preservationists and the Calvert County Historical Society, the railroad station got its second wind, reopening as a bayside museum. Visitors can plug into its glory days with the help of an audiovisual show and view artifacts, photos and exhibits from that period. Admission is free to the museum, which is open from mid-March through November.

While slot machine business in Maryland is flourishing with the recent opening of the MGM National Harbor Resort and Casino in Prince George’s County, gambling in jurisdictions such as Calvert is steeped in tradition.

In the late 1940s, some counties succeeded in steering around Gov. William Preston Lane’s veto of a bill that would have outlawed gambling by separately legalizing slot machines. At the time, although more money was wagered in Nevada, Maryland had three times as many businesses with federally taxed gambling devices installed.

Town anchor: Chesapeake Beach residents take advantage of Chesapeake Station Shopping Center on the east side of the town. During business hours on most days, the parking lot overflows with vehicles. Residents say it is the best and nearest spot for fast food and liquor. There’s also a CVS and the family-owned Roland’s Market, a longtime meetup spot for residents to swap local gossip while stocking up on groceries and deli items like egg, meat and cheese sandwiches and barbecue loaf.

For 40 years, Leo Mallard has owned pharmacies in the area. The Boston native, 70, said he likes being close to the water. He said he enjoys the area “for its small-town atmosphere.” Except for the Rod ’N’ Reel, a gas station and a few other businesses, “when we moved in, there were not a lot of services.” That all changed, he added, when developers built the shopping center. “It gave the town an anchor.”

The house Mallard bought, south of Chesapeake Beach, is a four-bedroom Colonial. “When I got here in ’76, Calvert was the poorest county in the state.” (According to WorldAtlas.com, Calvert now ranks 19th on the list of the nation’s 25 wealthiest counties.)

“This is an adorable town!” said Donaleen Millard, as she loaded groceries into her white Chevy Silverado by Roland’s. Millard, 54, who rents a townhouse a mile away in North Beach, works at Neall’s Wine and Spirits in Owings. The Montgomery County native said she moved to the Bay after traffic congestion around the Beltway became an issue.

Mahoney, who served for 20 years as a Chesapeake Beach town council member before being elected mayor, said his administration is vigorously building an economic bridge to adjacent North Beach, best known for its quaint boardwalk and artsy feel. “There’s no sense fighting with them for the tourist dollar. We share services in a whole lot of ways. It makes sense.”

Living there: Chesapeake Beach is bordered on the north by First Street, on the south by Chesapeake Village Boulevard, on the west by Richfield Station (Route 260 and Harrison Boulevard) and on the east by the Chesapeake Bay.

In the past 12 months, 200 homes were sold in the Zip code that includes the town of Chesapeake Beach, ranging from $39,900 to $799,900, with an average of 98 days on the market, said Greg Cocimano, an agent with Re/Max 100 in Dunkirk. Twenty properties are under contract.

There are 58 active listings, ranging from an $80,000 two-bedroom, one-bathroom rambler in as-is condition to a $799,900 four-bedroom, three-bathroom rambler on more than nine acres, he said.

Transit: Public transportation choices include daily commuter bus service to the District. Calvert County also operates a local bus service.

Schools: Beach Elementary, Windy Hill Middle and Northern High.

Crime: According to the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office, in 2016, there were 16 assaults, 14 burglaries, one robbery, seven motor vehicle thefts and two sexual assaults reported in Chesapeake Beach.Beloved cookbook author Dorie Greenspan ("Baking Chez Moi," "Baking: From My Home To Yours," "Around My French Table" and more) answers your questions about baking, her "Everyday Dorie" column and everything else she's cooking.

Georgetown University (The Washington Post)

The director of Georgetown University’s Saudi-financed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding is under fire from right-wing conservatives for a lecture he gave about slavery and rape in Islamic history.

Jonathan A.C. Brown, a professor of Islamic studies, gave a lecture on Feb. 7 at the International Institute of Islamic Thought in Herndon, Va., titled “Islam and the Problem of Slavery.” The lecture — which ran more than an hour and 20 minutes — sparked critics to accuse him of supporting slavery and rape when he said, for example, “I don’t think it’s morally evil to own somebody,” and “[f]or most of human history, human beings have not thought of consent as the essential feature of morally correct sexual activity.”

The tenured Brown, who is Muslim, said in an interview and on Twitter that the accusations that he condones slavery and rape are simply untrue and that his words were taken out of context.

Islam as a faith and I as a person condemn slavery, rape and concubinage. — Jonathan AC Brown (@JonathanACBrown) February 11, 2017

Brown’s lecture was from the first of several papers he said he is writing on the question of Islam and slavery that are aimed at giving the Muslim community tools to bridge the gap between “elements of Islamic traditions and modern values” at a time when the Islamic State has “slammed the issue of slavery on the table in the 21st century.” In a phone interview, he said was trying to “help frame this problem by discussing the values of consent and autonomy that are prominent today, but they weren’t always.”

Brown denied that he had condoned slavery and non-consensual sex and said that his critics, some of them from the “alt-right,” are misquoting him. “I don’t know how they could say that I did,” he said. Scholars are at risk, he said, if “some de-contextualized quote of theirs is taken out and prompts a feeding frenzy that calls for them to be fired.”

A number of stories from conservative magazines and websites wrote scathing stories about the lecture, saying that he was condoning slavery and non-consensual sex. For example, the American Conservative wrote a piece with this headline: “Georgetown Prof Defends Islamic Slavery.” American Thinker had a story with this headline: “Georgetown professor defends Islamic slavery and ‘non-consensual’ sex.” The Daily Banter wrote: “Islamic Studies Professor On Whether Rape and Slavery Are Wrong: It Depends” and “An Islamic Studies professor at Georgetown has taken academic obscurantism and cultural relativism to new heights.”

Some critics noted that the Georgetown center where Brown is a director — the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding — is funded with money from Saudi Arabia, where women have few rights. The institute where he gave the lecture has in the past been under scrutiny by U.S. officials for having ties to anti-Israel terrorist financing, a 2004 Washington Post story said.

In a phone interview, Brown said that after the lecture he and his family were threatened anonymously with rape and death. Other Muslim scholars, he said, contacted him and said they were worried about the same kind of reaction if they discussed such issues.

“The first paper was a historical description of slavery as a global phenomenon,” he said. “But these people criticizing me don’t know the difference between the past and the present tense. The talk I gave was historical description. … I was so nervous to talk about this issue because it’s so controversial.”

Brown said that he could have said things more clearly, or used one word for another, but that he is not guilty of what he is being accused of saying.

In one controversial part of the lecture, Brown said: “I don’t think it’s morally evil to own somebody because we own lots of people all around us and were owned by people and this obsession about thinking of slavery as property.”

Asked to explain that comment, he said in an email:

“I never condoned slavery. My argument was that, by limiting our notion of slavery to owning someone, we’re blinding ourselves to institutions of exploitation in the past and present in which people are technically not “owned” at all, like incarcerated labor in US prisons. And there have been instances in history where people were technically owned by others but not exploited, like the grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire. Ownership is complicated in any legal system. Exploitation is easy to spot.”

Rachel Pugh, a Georgetown spokeswoman, provided this statement from the university:

As an academic community, we are committed to academic freedom and the ability of faculty members to freely pursue their research and express their analysis. While we will defend this academic freedom, the body of a faculty member’s work does not necessarily represent the University’s position. The views of any faculty member are their own and not the views of the University.

In the lecture, he said that Americans think of slavery as depicted in the film “12 Years a Slave,” but that it looked differently in other times and places in history. He noted, for example, that a concubine’s autonomy in early Islamic civilizations was not that much different from a wife’s because women married whom their family wanted.

He concluded that “the word ‘slavery’ can mean so many things that it’s not very useful for accurate communication” because it “often ends up referring to things we don’t mean when we think of slavery, or it fails to match things we do associate with slavery.” He said that “we morally fetishize” the word “slavery” when “we should actually be looking at the condition” in which people live. He said:

“Slavery cannot just be treated as a moral evil in and of itself because slavery doesn’t mean anything. The moral evil is extreme forms of deprivation of rights and extreme forms of control and extreme forms of exploitation. I don’t think it’s morally evil to own somebody because we own lots of people all around us and were owned by people and this obsession about thinking of slavery as property … it’s just inconceivable sin, I think that’s actually a really odd and unhelpful way to think about slavery. It kind of gets you locked in this way of thinking that if you talk about ownership and people that you’ve already transgressed some moral boundary that you can’t come back from. I don’t think that’s true at all.”

He also said:

“For most of human history, human beings have not thought of consent as the essential feature of morally correct sexual activity. And second, we fetishize the idea of autonomy to where we forget, who is really free? … What does autonomy mean?”

He asked what the difference was between someone who was captured in a raid in the steppes of Central Asia in earlier times, brought to a slave market and sold to an owner who might treat her badly or might treat her “incredibly well” and offer her high status and that of a baker’s daughter who was forced to marry a baker who might treat her terribly.

Brown wrote a long statement about the controversy in which he said he apologized to those hurt by the lecture. He also sought to clarify some positions. He said, for example, that “[r]ape in Islam is haram (prohibited),” and “a violation of the rights of a human and the rights of God.” He also wrote:Lt. Gov.

Let’s tackle a perplexing word problem.

Two clerks have the same job.

Clerk A earns $194,341 a year. Clerk B earns $175,392 a year. Clerk A has been doing the job for nearly six years. Clerk B has been doing the job for 27 years.

To arrive at X, factor in the head-shaking disparity between the two salaries, allowing for experience.

If you got X = gender — bing-bing-bing — you’re a winner!

The high-earning Clerk A is G. Paul Nardo, a man who has been the clerk of Virginia’s House of Delegates since 2011. The lower-paid Clerk B is Susan Clarke Schaar, who has been working for Virginia’s Senate clerk office since 1974.

She took over the head job in 1990.

Same jobs, wildly different résumés, a salary gap of nearly $20,000.

There it is, folks. The insane arithmetic that nearly always calculates a woman’s worth in the workplace as less than a man’s. It is also one of the reasons that millions of men and women in the United States and across the globe marched last month.

[More than one million protesters vow to resist President Trump]

Nardo and Schaar are public employees with public salaries, and the transparency of that sector should make pay disparity pretty minimal.

But this glaring inequity made news in the Richmond Times-Dispatch after state Sen. Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) introduced a budget amendment to raise Schaar’s salary to equal Nardo’s.

Schaar said she didn’t want to comment on how the discrepancy came to light.

But the truth is that for every Schaar, who will receive equal pay only after an act of the state Senate and House of Delegates, there are thousands of women who will never get that raise.

“It’s discouraging in 2017 to hear something like that, but sadly not surprising that it’s still going on,” said Charly Carter, executive director of the Maryland Working Families advocacy group.

Some critics say this pay gap — which usually goes with the statistic that women make 79 cents for every dollar a man makes — is because women largely choose to work in low-paying fields such as teaching and nursing.

But Nardo and Schaar have the same job. And the disparity still occurs when women take jobs in male-dominated fields, says Emily Martin, who specializes in pay gap issues at the National Women’s Law Center.

Let’s start in Alabama, where Karin Woodard was vice president of information technology/management information systems at Medseek, a digital-marketing company for the health-care sector. Her boss told her that she was making less than the other vice presidents and that he would correct that. But he never did.

So Woodard kept working and getting great reviews before she learned that lower-ranked managers and directors were paid more than she was. Even a recent hire working for her made more than she did. When she brought up her concerns, the chief operating officer said that women did not belong in technical leadership, according to the lawsuit she filed against the company last year.

Or we can go to Connecticut, where Deborah Morse complained that even though she was a top regional manager at the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, she earned thousands less than the men who had the same title.

When she asked about it, Morse’s supervisors told her that “ ‘girls’ who had husbands with jobs did not need to make as much money as men since men were the primary earners in the family,” according to the District Court decision in 2013.

Or we can check out Chicago, where Susan King was one of the most successful sales executives at the food brokerage Acosta Sales and Marketing but made less than the male executives at her rank. Some of the guys she outperformed were paid two or even three times what she made, according to the case filed in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2012 opinion, right after the chart showing King’s $46,850 salary compared to a comparable male colleague’s $122,004 pay, the court wrote: “The difference between men and women is striking.” The court remanded the case back to District Court.

Kathy Riser was 50 when she was working for QEP Energy in Utah, managing a 250-vehicle fleet, managing facilities and earning about $47,000. She logged more than 400 hours of overtime in 14 months, and it became clear that she was really doing two jobs. So the company broke off her fleet management duties and hired a 39-year-old man to take that part over. He walked in the door at $62,000, according to the lawsuit she filed in 2015. When the company tried to argue that it wasn’t pay discrimination because those were two different jobs, the 10th Circuit laughed and slapped that lawsuit right back into play.

Back here in Virginia, we can look at Ann Marie Reardon, an assistant attorney general for the state who never even made it into the salary range for her job title — between $70,000 and $90,000. She started at $62,000 in 2010 when she was hired by then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and received $1,000 annual raises after glowing reviews. But in her five years there, she never matched the salaries of her male colleagues with similar experience and duties, according to the lawsuit filed last year against Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D).

All of the cases went to some stage of settlement, according to court records. And none of the women stayed at their jobs.

The companies fought the lawsuits, and in each case, a judge denied most of their arguments. Pratt & Whitney did adjust Morse’s salary after doing a company audit that found gender pay gaps, but Morse continued her legal claims for back pay.

Acosta Sales, Medseek and the Virginia attorney general’s office argued that the pay gap was based on starting salaries and experience, arguments that judges denied.

These women have to slog through the court system — often for years — to find resolution, often after being reprimanded at work for agitating.

“It really just goes to show that it’s critical for employers to be affirmatively looking at whether there are indefensible wage gaps and how they are paying men and women with similar job titles,” Martin said. “We have a lot of marching left to do.”

Counselor to the President of the United States Kellyanne Conway enters a joint press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., USA, 27 January 2017. EPA/JIM LO SCALZO

The University of Pennsylvania’s president has no comment about one of the Ivy League school’s most famous alumni, President Trump. Virginia Tech’s president has no comment about one of its most famous alumni, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon.

[‘Sinister and reckless': Thousands at Virginia Tech call on President Trump to remove political strategist]

The president of Trinity Washington University, though, has had plenty to say about one of its graduates. “Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trinity Class of 1989, has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the Trump Administration’s war on immigrants among many other issues,” Patricia McGuire wrote recently.

[‘You do not represent us': Wharton students and alums write to Trump]

University presidents used to be part of the national dialogue, decades ago when the demands of the job were less complicated and the need for fundraising less consuming. But it has long been unusual for a college to single out a graduate for criticism, especially as college and university presidents are expected to build community among a diverse group of students, faculty, staff and alumni, to foster pride in the institution, and to raise money and support from people on all sides of the political spectrum.

Because of the importance of alumni to fundraising, said Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education, “presidents tread very carefully. Losing the support of alumni is a very bad idea.”

But McGuire, the longtime president of the small women’s college in Northeast Washington, said she felt a moral imperative to speak out against the Trump administration — in particular for its policies on immigration and its lack of truthfulness — and Conway is not exempt from that.

Conway said by phone Friday she was surprised to find her alma mater’s social media feed full of partisan retweets and snarky comments. “It’s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,” she said, citing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as an example, “attack me, and never have the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion.” McGuire had looked at her comments through the most negative lens possible, she said.

McGuire never hesitated to call her to ask for donations to Trinity, Conway added. She and her husband donated $50,000 to a 1999-2002 Trinity fundraising campaign. “My money was good.”

[A professor called Trump’s victory ‘terrorism.’ The student who recorded the rant got suspended.]

While a few college presidents have taken a strong public stand against President Trump, and hundreds have signaled their opposition to his immigration policies, Trinity stands out for the volume and tone of its messages.

Through its institutional and its president’s social media messages, the university has been sharply and repeatedly critical of Trump, his policies and many of his top advisers.

“I get better treatment from Robby Mook,” Conway said, of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, “than I do from the president of the university I attended.”

Trinity has been quick to praise other alumnae, many of them Democrats, such as former Obama administration Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius — who is prominently displayed on the school’s home page highlighting women graduates “shattering glass ceilings” — and Pelosi, but also some Republicans, as well as honorary alumnae.

For a small Catholic women’s college to have as their alumnae both the first female Speaker of the House and the first woman to run a Republican presidential campaign, Conway said, and to “look at the disparate treatment of the two of us, tells the entire tale.”

[Thousands assemble at Washington Monument for the March for Life]

She asked why she didn’t see concern expressed about Pelosi’s support for abortion rights, or mention of her own speech at the recent March for Life, which signaled high-level administration support for the cause. “Does she not think there are pro-life alumnae?”

Conway said McGuire clearly sees her position and the role of the university as one “that is peddling a very narrowly subscribed political viewpoint.”

[‘They never saw this coming': A Q & A with Kellyanne Conway about President Trump’s victory]

McGuire said it’s not about politics. (She also said the university does not support Pelosi’s support for abortion rights.) “People can agree or disagree around national policy or domestic policy. You can have a raging debate about Obamacare … But when you lie so consistently as this administration does, that’s a moral issue. We are teachers. We have an honor system here. We believe deeply in upholding the value of truth. … it’s urgent not to be shy about it.

McGuire said some alumnae have criticized her for not honoring Conway.

But she said she has gotten hundreds of messages from alumnae whom she described as appalled by Conway. “I don’t go around denouncing our alumnae,” she said, but “I want to be on the record: We don’t condone lying. We can’t say someone is exempt from that.”

“In offering criticism, it’s mean to be a call to a higher standard of behavior.”

There was a time, during Civil Rights battles and the Vietnam War, when university presidents were visible figures in national conversations. Some great public figures spoke out on the dominant issues of their times, said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College. That changed, he said, when fundraising and management became more important for college presidents than ideals and scholarship and public service.

This is a different moment, he said, one that transcends partisan politics. “Truth-telling is a crucial element of democracy, a true and absolutely indispensable component of any true definition of freedom. …

“If we don’t stand up for what we believe, we have nobody to blame at the end but ourselves.”

But some, at a time when many college campuses have been criticized as too liberal and out of touch, argue university presidents no longer speak for the nation.

[Conservative students at the University of Michigan ask why they are not included in the school’s “inclusiveness"]

“To me, university leadership has felt enormously partisan…” said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “That factors into seeing this as cheap partisan thuggery rather than any serious commitment to robust civic debate.” Of all the university graduates who had been convicted of crimes over the years, he asked rhetorically, how many have been singled out by their school?

He added, “Criticism is appropriate and valid – people have points of view. But I think it’s striking how incredibly uniform higher education is.”

[Nearly 600 colleges object to Trump’s travel ban]

McGuire benefits, Hartle said, from being a very established president with strong support from the board, faculty and alumnae (and not having to answer to state legislators, as a public university president would), which makes it possible for her to speak out about something she feels strongly about.

“This reflects her strong personal commitment to social justice and educational opportunity and the nature of her student body,” Hartle said.

Trinity, one of the oldest Catholic women’s colleges in the U.S., has changed dramatically over the years. It’s still a private school, but the undergraduate program now has a particular emphasis on reaching people facing significant hurdles to higher education, such as single mothers and women from low-income families. More than 95 percent of the students are black, Latina or mixed race, and some of their most academically outstanding students are “dreamers” working to achieve legal immigration status, who are now feeling personally at risk.

In a blog post, “On Lies and the Truths We Must Tell,” Maguire included some thoughts about Conway,

Some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client’s positions, and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign. But in fact, as is true of many of President Trump’s statements, her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth. Ms. Conway invented the now-infamous phrase “alternative facts” to defend Trump’s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration, a thinly-veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the Trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when, in fact, it was on the smaller side. Ms. Conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Perhaps the “Bowling Green Massacre” comment was truly a mistake, as she claims, but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban, an executive order that clearly discriminates against Muslims, was necessary.

Many people wrote warm thanks for the essay, and praised her courage. “Thanks, Pat, for your clarity and eloquence. You give voice to the Trinity I know, respect and love,” one alumna wrote.

Another cited past comments by Obama and asked, “where was the outrage and demand for the truth??”

Some wrote to McGuire on social media: “Shame on you,” and “God help any conservatives who may be trapped inside” Trinity.

McGuire acknowledged pushback; people tell her, “‘I can’t believe you’re saying this,’ or ‘You’re so liberal,’ or ‘You’re the great Satan,'” she said, laughing. “I’ve been at this long enough there’s always somebody who’s terribly upset with any statement.”

She pointed to signals Trump has sent that federal funding could be affected if he doesn’t like something a university does.

“That’s a threat that can’t just sit there,” McGuire said. “I don’t mean to provoke him. But I can’t just be silent …

“Many college presidents are entirely too reticent when it comes to addressing the clear moral issues at the center of some of the big national issues today,” she said. “We have academic freedom.

What a president says and doesn’t say is significant. So when President Trump was asked once on Wednesday and twice on Thursday to address an upsurge in anti-Semitism in America, his reaction was notable.

Trump could have said he condemns anti-Semitism and takes incidents, such as the dozens of threats made to Jewish Community Centers, seriously. But instead, he lashed out against those asking the question.

It was startling and, unfortunately, it was only the latest episode in a troubling pattern.

Last year, we watched as the Trump campaign repeatedly tweeted and shared anti-Semitic imagery and language, allowing this poison to move from the margins into the mainstream of the public conversation. We saw white supremacists accommodated with press credentials and welcomed at Trump’s political rallies. And when the Anti-Defamation League repeatedly and respectfully raised concerns, we were dismissed by the Trump campaign and its allies.

Immediately after the election, we saw white supremacists celebrating and convening right around the corner from the White House, raising their arms in Hitler salutes. Barely a week after Trump’s victory, the FBI issued an annual report that noted that there were more hate crimes against Jews in 2015 — the report for 2016 will be out this fall — and that we remain the most frequently targeted religious minority, even in a climate where Trump has rallied supporters behind the idea of banning Muslims from entering the country. In the months since then, the Jewish community has been victimized by a surge of hate crimes, including waves of bomb threats against Jewish community centers, a torrent of verbal abuse and physical graffiti directed against Jews and relentless attacks on Jewish journalists and Jewish public figures on social media.

[Donald Trump’s conspiracy theories sound anti-Semitic. Does he even realize it?]

Just Thursday, even as Trump refused to condemn all that, a man in South Carolina was arraigned on charges of plotting to attack a synagogue. He was apprehended by the FBI before he had the chance, in his own alleged words, to emulate his hero Dylann Roof, the convicted murderer who now sits on death row for killing nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.

So it’s no surprise that the Jewish community is on edge and looking for reassurance from our president. Yet just a few weeks ago, the White House issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that bizarrely omitted any reference to the wholesale slaughter of six million Jews, the very reason that the day was created by the United Nations more than a decade ago. Unlike statements put out by previous Republican and Democratic administrations, the language evoked long-standing efforts by white supremacists and anti-Semitic regimes to trivialize Jewish suffering and downplay the Nazi extermination of the Jewish people. And when asked about this exclusion, senior White House officials said that it was intentional, that “everyone’s suffering in the Holocaust [matters], including obviously all of the Jewish people” and that it was “asinine” to question the issue.

[Trump is dividing American Jews over domestic politics, not Israel]

But the anger that deliberate omission generated among American Jews — even among organizations that have supported Trump staunchly up to now — apparently didn’t really break through to the president. On Wednesday, when asked during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about this rising tide of anti-Semitism, Trump waxed on about his electoral vote total and referenced his Jewish daughter, Ivanka Trump; son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and grandchildren. At Thursday’s news conference, when an Orthodox Jewish journalist began a question on the same topic by stipulating that he did not believe the president was anti-Semitic but that many Jews wanted hear his response to the climate, the president cut off the reporter, accusing him of lying for asking a “very insulting” question and dismissed the whole issue by declaring himself “the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.” He went on to insist that some anti-Semitic and racist graffiti and signs were put up by his political opponents to anger the press.

Regardless of how much the president claims to love Israel or how his grandchildren spend the holidays, as John Adams said, facts are stubborn things. Simply put, dismissing this issue as a political distraction or partisan concern does not change the fact that there has been a surge in anti-Semitic rhetoric and actions. Trump’s repeated failure to denounce anti-Semitism has consequences, emboldening bigots.

[The Trump administration is showing white nationalists it won’t fight them at all]

So it is honestly mind-boggling why Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or deride the concerns of the Jewish community. It is shocking to us that in this day and age, the president will not acknowledge — much less condemn — the rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric and actions.

The issue of anti-Semitism is not a political one. But it is potentially lethal. With the president’s leadership, it can get better. With his neglect or instigation, it can get worse.

In light of the rise of hate, there is a simple question that Trump should answer, not only for American Jews but to assuage Americans of all faiths — what will his administration do about the surge of anti-Semitism? What concrete steps will the White House take?

There are many possible answers — increasing anti-bias education, engaging law enforcement, calling on more states to pass comprehensive hate crimes laws, engaging affected communities in dialogue. Most of all, the president could emphatically and unambiguously speak out against anti-Semitism whenever it happens and shame anti-Semites from the public square.

It is still early in his administration, but we hope that the president will respond to the very simple question posed to him several times this week. Until we get a clear answer, we at the ADL are going to keep asking how Trump plans to tackle anti-Semitism — and we urge others in the press and public to do so as well.4

You’re all set!Recently, I had the opportunity to be one of the co-chairs of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. One of the reasons I was pleased to do so is because of the theme of this year’s meetings: Responsive and Responsible Leadership. As the CEO of a U.S. public company that operates across the country and around the world, I view responsive leadership as being curious, listening to people, and understanding their differing perspectives and backgrounds as we make decisions in the best interests of our employees, our customers and clients, shareholders, and the communities we serve across the U.S. and overseas.

The theme also struck me because it is similar to the way we run our company. As we emerged from the clean-up of the financial crisis, we simplified and strengthened our company, and we focused on serving our customers and clients to help them live their financial lives. We needed a way to talk about what we do. We call it “responsible growth.”

Responsible growth has several tenets: First, we have to grow. But our focus on “responsible growth” means we have to grow by doing more for our customers and clients. Not every dollar is a good dollar, if it comes from an activity that doesn’t tie back to a customer need.

And we are growing in that way. Lending to businesses of all sizes is up 12 percent year over year. To pick just one of the nearly 90 domestic markets we serve, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, we provided 18 percent more small business loans versus last year, and we are expanding our branch system and adding small business lenders. Alongside direct lending to consumers and businesses, we also are the nation’s largest investor in Community Development Financial Institutions, with more than $1 billion invested with 240 community partners around the nation. Lending by CDFIs creates access to capital for women and minority-owned small businesses by creating a bridge between ourselves and individuals or small businesses that might otherwise have a hard time getting access to capital.

We also have to grow within a clear risk framework so that we can maintain a balanced, stable, and financially strong platform. That’s happening, too. In the last quarter of 2016, we saw the lowest level of bad loan charge offs perhaps ever in our company’s history.

Finally, our growth has to be sustainable. Long-term, sustainable growth has many components. It’s how we invest in our team; as of this month, we’ve increased our minimum wage so that all Bank of America employees make more than $15 an hour. We will keep adjusting that, as we have regularly for several years now. In 2016, we increased our parental leave to 16 weeks of paid leave for all new parents. We’ve also kept our healthcare premiums flat for the last five years for those employees who make less than $50,000 a year.

Sustainability also comes from maintaining and building upon best practices in corporate governance, including a strong, independent board and other measures. We also view the more than 2 million volunteer hours our teammates commit to their communities and our $125 billion new energy initiative as critical to creating the conditions for long-term, sustainable growth.

Because of the way Bank of America looks at responsible growth, it appealed to me that the ideas behind it are similar to what the business, government, and non-profit leaders were talking about at the World Economic Forum.

Countries, too, have to grow; economies have to grow. Economic growth is the engine of prosperity. The financial services industry at home and abroad has a responsibility to help drive real economic growth. But it has to be the right way. Leaders have to focus growth on all participants in the economy. Inequalities arise; there is fallout from the ups and downs of market-based forces. Leaders from every sector have to come together to focus on all the participants in the economy to address those left behind by those forces.

Economic growth also has to avoid excessive risks, such as we saw during the economic and financial crisis from a decade ago. And, finally, economic growth should be sustainable. We have to invest in the future, in changes in technology and also in the social safety nets to ensure no one is left behind.

My teammates and I at Bank of America have a responsibility to help the economy grow, and we have a role to play in partnering with leaders from other sectors in government at every level, non-profit agencies, and elsewhere, to help ensure growth comes in lasting and sustainable ways. We will continue investing in our business, our people, and our communities because we understand that when our communities and employees succeed, we succeed.

Mortgage rates have defied conventional wisdom this past month by holding steady for the fourth week in a row.

Home loan rates usually follow the movement of long-term bonds, particularly the 10-year U.S. Treasury. When its yield rises, mortgage rates tend to go up as well. The yield on the 10-year bond jumped 10 basis points (a basis point is 0.01 percentage point) from Friday to Wednesday, yet mortgage rates stubbornly refused to budge.

According to data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average slipped to 4.15 percent, with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) It was 4.17 percent last week and 3.65 percent a year ago.

The 15-year fixed-rate average slid to 3.35 percent, with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.39 percent last week and 2.95 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable-rate average fell to 3.18 percent, with an average 0.4 point. It was 3.21 percent last week and 2.85 percent a year ago.

[Lenders now must report more information about your mortgage to the IRS]

“For the last 46 years, the 30-year mortgage rate has been almost perfectly correlated with the yield on the 10-year Treasury, but not this year,” Sean Becketti, Freddie Mac chief economist, said in a statement. “From Dec. 29, 2016, through today, the 30-year mortgage rate fell 17 basis points to this week’s reading of 4.15 percent. In contrast, the 10-year Treasury yield began and ended the same period at 2.49 percent. While we expect mortgage rates to fall into line with Treasury yields shortly, this just may be a year full of surprises.”

Mortgage rates are not expected to hold fast last much longer. Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that more than half of the experts it surveyed think rates will rise in the coming week.

Federal Reserve Chair “Janet Yellen sent mortgage bond[s] into a nosedive Wednesday, causing prices to move lower and mortgage rates higher,” said Elizabeth Rose, branch manager of Movement Mortgage. “With improving economic data and higher inflation, we can expect higher rates.”

[Poor credit scores and hefty debt may not keep you from getting a mortgage]

Meanwhile, mortgage applications decreased last week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume – fell 3.7 percent. The refinance index dropped 3 percent, while the purchase index tumbled 5 percent.

The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 46.9 percent of all applications.

“Mortgage applications fell last week as mortgage rates were little changed,” said Michael Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist. “Purchase activity fell last week on a seasonally adjusted basis, but remains 3 percent above last year’s pace. Overall refinance volume continues to decrease, with the refinance share at its lowest level since June 2009. With higher fixed rates, more borrowers are turning to ARMs, and the ARM share reached its highest level since October 2015.”Home Tip – PS P.S. from the PostPoints staff: Here’s our weekly roundup of deals and giveaways we think you’ll enjoy!

Kim Gustafson, who owns Blüprint Chocolatiers in Old Town Alexandria in Alexandria, Va., rents a store below the headquarters of the Richard Spencer’s far-right National Policy Institute. (Patricia Sullivan/The Washington Post)

Kim Gustafson, wearing her chef’s smock, stood on the iron staircase of Blüprint Chocolatiers in the midday drizzle last Sunday to check out the growing crowd of protesters across the street.

Ever since her landlord rented the upper two floors of the Old Town Alexandria townhouse to Richard Spencer and his National Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes white-nationalist ideologies, she and her husband, Bruce, had been trying to make sure everyone knew that their 22-month-old designer chocolate shop had nothing to do with the tenant upstairs.

The railing in front of her shop was braided with red and white ribbons, colors that the protesters have adopted. Like other storekeepers along King Street, she put a poster in her window declaring, “Everyone is welcome here.” And she meant it: She served Spencer a cup of coffee when he came downstairs to introduce himself.

But Valentine’s Day was just two days away, and Gustafson worried that the presence of her new neighbor, as well as the latest of what have become weekly protests, could be a deterrent for customers.

“You can plan for electrical problems. You can plan for not growing as fast as you’d like. You can’t plan for this,” she said.

Spencer came to national attention for claiming Donald Trump as his movement’s champion during the presidential campaign (Trump later repudiated Spencer’s philosophy). At the NPI’s convention in November, attendees responded to Spencer’s call of “Hail Trump” with Nazi salutes.

A dispute involving his mother’s business in Spencer’s part-time home of Whitefish, Mont., resulted in neo-Nazis threatening Jewish residents in that small resort town. And while Spencer was being interviewed in downtown Washington on Inauguration Day, he was punched in the face by a black-clad assailant there to protest Trump’s election.

So when the Atlantic magazine reported last month that Spencer had rented space at 1001 King St. with the intention of creating a “one-stop shop” for the alternative right, Alexandria residents mobilized — and the Gustafsons grew concerned about their sales.

At least three groups are coordinating protests outside the building every Sunday. Protesters have tried to spread the word that the Gustafsons are not affiliated with Spencer, and some make a point of going into the chocolate shop to buy candies before or after their demonstrations.

City council members have reissued a statement on inclusiveness, declaring Alexandria a hate-free zone. Alexandria spokesman Craig Fifer said city officials have “certainly received a lot of calls and comments” about Spencer but have no power to involve themselves in a private real estate lease.

The landlord, Mahwash Wasiq, did not respond to email and telephone requests for comment. Spencer, who did not answer his door and did not respond to messages left for him there, said in a text message in response to a phone call that he was unable to talk.

The orderly demonstration last Sunday, which drew about 50 people, featured chanting and signs with messages such as “Hate is not a community value” and “Virginia — home to immigrants since 1607.”

Scores of passing drivers honked in support.

“The whole concept of white supremacy is offensive, even if it is legal,” said Jonathan Krall, who was there Sunday and has organized some of the protests for the new Grassroots Alexandria group.

David Hoover, a parishioner at the nearby Episcopal Christ Church, said he and others will not be silent, even though the church is not taking an official position.

“Episcopalians are called upon at baptism to renounce evil in the world. Silence implies consent. I want to speak out against the evils of racism,” he said. “We believe questioning the humanity of black people and Jews and others is, to use church language, a sin.”

Adam Roberts, a member of Old Town Indivisible, said Spencer’s “thinly veiled white supremacy” is offensive to a town that prides itself on its racial, religious and ethnic diversity.

“I fully understand he has a constitutional right to free speech; I just want it to be very well-known that we are not okay with this behavior and his ideas. I want him to feel he’s not welcome here,” Roberts said. “I’m less interested in his long-term goals than I am in making sure members of my community feel welcome and safe.”

It turned out that the Gustafsons need not have worried. On Valentine’s Day, “we sold out of chocolates by 12:30 p.m.,” Kim Gustafson said in an interview. “We are making chocolate like crazy now to catch up.”

Gustafson said the business has had “just fabulous support, not only from our Old Town neighbors, but from the whole community.” That includes residents of Whitefish, the small Montana town hard by the Canadian border, who sent letters, emails and telephone messages of support to the candy store after hearing about Spencer’s new location (starting this fall, they and others will be able to order chocolates from the shop online).

“[We] hope that if you ever pass through Old Town Alexandria you’ll stop by and say ‘hello,’ ” Bruce Gustafson said in a message to Whitefish residents that he posted on the shop’s blog. “We have 6,649 hot chocolates just waiting for you to arrive.”

If President Trump were to make a movie encapsulating his feelings about China, it might look a lot like this:

A red, white and blue ball with the word “jobs” appears on the screen. It rolls under the portrait of Mao Zedong through an animated Gate of Heavenly Peace, the iconic entrance in Beijing. There, where the ancient Forbidden City should be, belching smokestacks jut skyward.

Words then roll against a black background, saying that 57,000 American factories have disappeared since China joined the World Trade Organization and “began flooding American markets with illegally subsidized exports.” Next, a bread knife with the words “Made in China” is plunged into a map of the United States and animated blood runs out, trickling into the title: “Death by China.”

The movie actually exists, and it was written, produced and directed by Peter K. Navarro, a 67-year-old professor in the University of California at Irvine’s business school who is the head of the new White House National Trade Council. His task: to help rewrite the rules of global trade, from Mexico to China to Britain, and to bring back American manufacturing and jobs.

“The best jobs program is trade reform with China,” Navarro says in the movie, which is narrated by Martin Sheen, who starred in “Apocalypse Now” and as liberal hero President Josiah Bartlet in the TV series “West Wing.”

Navarro’s ideas have been widely criticized by other economists. “The biggest source of U.S. economic challenges and the biggest set of solutions are to be found in domestic policy,” said Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. “While international issues and a level playing field all matter, China is not the source of every problem, nor is doing something about China the answer to every problem.”

[The places in America most vulnerable to a trade war]

But Navarro has struck such a chord with Trump that he could end up playing an outsize role in the administration’s economic policy. The president’s announcement of his appointment called him “a visionary economist.”

“I read one of Peter’s books on America’s trade problems years ago and was impressed by the clarity of his arguments and thoroughness of his research,” Trump said in a statement. “He has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class.”

Putting nations on notice

Few of the people Trump has brought into the White House seem to be so in tune with the president. And for the moment at least, he has filled a policy vacuum by being visible while other Cabinet nominees struggle with confirmation.

Navarro has been one of just a handful of White House officials at Trump’s side for the signing of executive orders, such as withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and blocking federal funds for groups that provide abortions or abortion counseling.

[One expert’s simple explanation of why Trump is wrong on trade]

In early February he attended a White House meeting about trade that included Trump and the Hill’s “big four” — Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.), House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) and ranking Democrat Richard E. Neal (Mass.).

On Feb. 14 and 15, he briefed Senate Finance Committee members. According to people there, Navarro laid out principles — free and fair trade; bilateral deals, not multilateral ones; a reduced trade deficit; a strengthened defense industrial base; and automatic triggers for renegotiation when trade deficits occur.

Although he didn’t describe any mechanisms, Navarro also listed about a dozen more specific trade goals, including boosting the number of U.S. parts in imported finished goods; developing tools to punish currency ma­nipu­la­tion; cracking down on intellectual property theft that Navarro said cost $300 billion a year and “steals the seeds of innovation for the future”; and restricting heavily subsidized, state-owned ­enterprises.

He also said that World Trade Organization decisions had been “unfair” to the United States and that Chapter 19 of the North American Free Trade Agreement had allowed Canadian softwood lumber exporters to avoid duties. Navarro said that the Canadians “have played us.”

And like Trump, Navarro has put other countries on notice that the United States would confront its major trading partners even when they are close allies. In a ­Jan. 31 interview with the Financial Times, Navarro sent shock waves through Europe when he said that Germany was getting an unfair competitive advantage by manipulating the euro to lower its value and make its exports ­cheaper.

In 1996, Peter Navarro, then a Democrat, hoped that the backlash against the “Republican Revolution” led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich would sweep Democrats into office. Navarro used this flier in his unsuccessful campaign to unseat Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.).

‘The one that got away’

Navarro got his start in politics at the local level — as a Democrat. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of San Diego in 1992, city council in 1993, county supervisor in 1994 and Congress in 1996.

“My citizen activism is a direct outgrowth of a classical and fiscally conservative training in economics at Harvard,” he wrote in “San Diego Confidential,” a revealing, cutting and readable memoir of his years in politics there. “It is a perspective rooted in one of the most important concepts in economics — the need for government intervention in the presence of a market failure.”

Initially he became active in a popular local group called Prevent Los Angelization Now (PLAN) opposing developers.

“A city should decide where it doesn’t want to develop,” he wrote, “saving at least some of the canyons and hillsides and wetlands from the bulldozer’s blade.”

But instead of running for county supervisor, a race he might have won, Navarro jumped into the San Diego mayor’s race. His opponent, Susan Golding, launched three negative ads and he responded with an ad attacking Golding, whose ex-husband was convicted of laundering illegal drug money. Ahead in the polls going into the last weekend of the race, Navarro attacked her again in a televised debate. In tears, she called the attacks on her family unfair; Navarro accused her of rehearsing the response and came off as dismissive. He lost.

Years later, he wrote that he still thought about “the one that got away.”

“He was almost the mayor,” said Larry Remer, a political consultant who worked on three of Navarro’s campaigns after that one. “He flubbed it, is what really ­happened.”

Remer said Navarro was a hard-working candidate who “realized the need to stay on a clear, concise message, a lot like ‘make America great again.’ Nothing could appeal to people in San Diego more than saying ‘not L.A.’ ”

But, he added, what undid Navarro as a candidate was his personality. “He would just burn through volunteers,” Remer said.

“He’s not quite as prickly as Trump, but he has the same ego issues.”

In 1996, Navarro took on then-U.S. Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), hoping that the backlash to the Newt Gingrich revolution would sweep a Democrat into the House. He later wrote that Bilbray “was as much of an idiot as he was when he first ran” for Congress “but this time he was an idiot with a record — a bad one.” Nonetheless, heavily outspent, Navarro lost soundly.

Discouraged, divorced and in debt, he moved on.

A ‘decent trade deal’

Navarro resurrected his public persona by turning to writing, doing a set of online basic economics books and a how-to investing book titled “If It’s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks.”

In the mid-2000s Navarro latched onto the issue of China’s growing global ambitions, writing “The Coming China Wars,” “Death by China” and “Crouching Tiger; What China’s Militarism Means for the World.”

According to the New Yorker, Navarro in 2011 read that Trump told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua that he liked Navarro’s first book on China. They communicated after that but met in person only during the presidential campaign, when Navarro was one of the few economists to take Trump seriously.

At times, Navarro sounds moderate. “The last thing a Trump administration plans is a trade war,” he said at a Tax Policy Center event in October. “The issue simply is getting a decent trade deal with each of the major trading partners.”

And many of the issues he raises about China are real: Chinese companies steal intellectual property, receive cheap credit from Chinese banks, pay lower wages, and generally cough up more pollution and pay less for pollution controls. Navarro estimated in 2006 that unfair trade practices accounted for 41 percent of China’s competitive advantage over U.S. firms.

But the film, in which Navarro attempts to be toward China what Michael Moore is to the automobile industry, is hyperbolic in tone. It includes comments by conservatives fearful of China, AFL-CIO leader Richard L. Trumka, ordinary shoppers and Navarro himself, who fires salvos at American corporations that do business in China.

The narrator says that “no company has been happier” to move its capital offshore than General Electric. Then Navarro appears and interjects. “When I go out and do speeches to corporate audiences on China, they want me to talk about strategy,” he says. “It’s like, ‘Hey, you’re going over to China. You’re giving them your avionics so you can participate in a regional jet game in China, and two or three or five years from now you’re going to try to sell your regional jets in Europe — and your biggest competitor is going to be that China guy. How stupid is that?’ ”

Criticism over tax proposals

Navarro’s toughest audience has been his fellow economists.

He started his career writing a book about the utility industry. In a review, Robert A. O’Neill, now a specialist in electricity regulation at the law firm McCarter & English, said its indictment of the regulatory process “greatly simplifies the complex issues affecting the electric utility industry.” He said that readers would “find ample reason simply to discount the book as pro-utility ­propaganda.”

Now, as a key Trump adviser, Navarro has run into more flak.

In a paper he wrote last year with now-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Navarro said that Trump could impose tariffs and encourage changes in consumer buying habits to erase the huge U.S. trade deficit. That would go hand in hand with greater investment in the U.S. economy, a combination of events that William Gale, a Brookings Institution economist, has called “mathematically impossible.”

Navarro and Ross say that getting rid of the trade deficit and boosting investment would also spur faster economic growth, which would bring in $1.74 trillion in tax revenue over a decade.

Hooey, say economists across the political spectrum. (Navarro declined to answer questions in emails or respond to phone calls.)

N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard University economics professor, said in a September blog post that Navarro and Ross’s paper makes elementary mistakes by overstating growth and not understanding that a smaller trade deficit means lower investment along with possibly higher interest rates and less consumption. “Even a freshman at the end of ec 10 knows that trade deficits go hand in hand with capital inflows,” Mankiw wrote.

In addition, if the United States erects tariff barriers to China, factories might go to other lower-cost countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh or India.

Furman said that “if you’re trying to intimidate companies about moving operations or yell at them over supply chains, that’s not the way to make America a more attractive place. The way to do that is to build infrastructure, train workers and invest in technology, not to just beat up on other ­countries.”

Navarro and Ross have also come under criticism for their tax proposals. A tax credit for infrastructure would reward projects that would happen anyway and would not address long-overdue maintenance, experts say, leading to larger budget deficits.

Navarro’s close relationship with Ross could serve him well when Cabinet members arrive and leadership on issues grows more fractured, potentially creating rivalries with more savvy infighters such as National Economic Council head Gary Cohn. Yet for now, Navarro and Ross appear to be in sync with the president and his threats on trade.

That position is one that Navarro has held for at least a decade. His “Death by China” film takes a video of Obama speaking in the White House briefing room and splices in a Chinese soldier who removes the White House insignia behind Obama and puts up a Chinese flag.

The film also shows an empty factory with broken windows and unemployment lines, and juxtaposes that with Chinese container ships and busy Chinese factory workers. In the end, the credits roll to the tune of a glum, folky song whose lyrics Navarro helped write.

“Look around, tell me what you see.

Every day more people in the street.

I used to work in a factory.

By now I’d work for anything

It’s not me, it’s my family I wish to feed.

Not much, we got simple needs.

Too bad they sent our jobs away.

In China they’re not workers, they’re just slaves.

People, wait, it’s a world of trade and greed.

And the CEOs get richer, and our jobs all move offshore.”

It could be an ode describing the plight of Trump’s supporters. And it struck a chord with one crucial viewer, who said in a blurb on the film’s Web page: “Death by China” is right on. This important documentary depicts our problem with China with facts, figures and insight. I urge you to see it.”

The reviewer: Donald Trump.

The State Department under Rex Tillerson, who has been among President Trump’s least visible Cabinet officials and is still lacking much of his senior staff, is undergoing further shrinkage in its upper echelons, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Kristie Kenney, a three-time ambassador and career Foreign Service officer who has served as State Department counselor for the past year, has been told that her services are no longer needed in that job and that her staff is to be reassigned. The offices of counselor, who provides strategic guidance to the secretary, and the empty slot of deputy secretary for management may not be filled, officials said.

Thomas Shannon, Kenney’s predecessor as counselor and now the undersecretary for political affairs, is expected to become acting deputy secretary for policy until someone is permanently approved.

Tillerson’s choice for the job, Elliot Abrams, was vetoed last week by the White House. Abrams, who served in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, subsequently speculated that he was blocked because of statements he made during the presidential race that were seen as critical of Trump’s candidacy.

[In diplomatic debut, Tillerson takes firm line on Russian role in Ukraine]

The appointment of Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil executive with no previous government experience, was viewed favorably by much of the Republican establishment, which sees him as a steadying influence.

But since his arrival at the department on Feb. 2, he has made only one public comment, a brief statement Thursday at the G-20 conference of major world economic powers being held in Germany. He took no questions.

Five of the eight senior staff members who accompanied Tillerson on the trip — his first as America’s top diplomat — are serving in temporary capacities. Tillerson has not appointed a press secretary, and the State Department — which traditionally holds daily media briefings — has not held a single one.

Department officials said that Tillerson has described himself as being in a “listening mode” until he feels up to speed on the issues. His silence comes as the administration has become embroiled in controversy over contacts officials in the Trump campaign and transition had with Russian officials.

Although the secretary of state is traditionally included in virtually all formal presidential contacts with foreign leaders, Tillerson did not attend Trump’s meetings over the past week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Asked about the changes in the State Department’s seventh-floor executive suites, R.C. Hammond, who was press secretary for Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign and currently is a department spokesperson, said in a statement that “the State Department is made up of a corps of very talented public servants. In some cases, we are redeploying people to new assignments where they can immediately put their talents to work.”

The removals and reassignments, some of which were first reported by CBS News, come as many senior jobs at State remain empty or filled by acting officials following the departure of those in charge of regional affairs and top issues such as nonproliferation and human rights. Most were career officials who were asked to leave, but there was also a handful who resigned.

Can Europe find its spine?In 2014, St. Louis County Police Sgt. Keith Wildhaber stopped by a local restaurant for a routine check, according to a lawsuit.

There, he spoke with John Saracino, who at the time was a member of St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners. Saracino indicated to Wildhaber that he knew that the sergeant was applying for a promotion within the department, the lawsuit states.

“Mr. Saracino told Plaintiff, ‘The command staff has a problem with your sexuality,’ ” the court documents read. “‘If you ever want to see a white shirt (i.e., get a promotion), you should tone down your gayness.’”

Wildhaber has filed suit against the county, alleging that he had been subjected to employment discrimination by being denied promotions.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Saracino denied the conversation, which Wildhaber’s suit claimed occurred during a routine restaurant check.

“I never had a conversation like that,” Saracino told the newspaper. “I would never say anything like that. That’s not me.”

Saracino no longer serves on the civilian oversight board, according to the Post-Dispatch.

[A black police officer complained about racism. He says his department retaliated by firing him.]

Sgt. Shawn McGuire, a department spokesman, told The Washington Post that St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar would not comment on the lawsuit, because it was active.

“It is our firm’s practice not to comment on pending litigation,” Wildhaber’s attorney, Russ Riggan, said in a statement emailed to The Post on Friday. “Until the case goes before a jury, we will allow the Petition to speak for itself. Our system of justice provides the right to a fair trial, and we do not wish to compromise our client’s rights by commenting to the media.”

According to the lawsuit, filed in January and recently posted online by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Wildhaber has worked for the department for more than two decades. He applied for a lieutenant position, the lawsuit said, and took a written test and underwent an assessment. His scores during that process ranked him as No. 3, out of 26 candidates.

Wildhaber claims he was sorted into a group with nine other top candidates, all of whom have since been promoted except for Wildhaber and one other officer, who the suit states has issues that might have stalled his professional advancement.

Wildhaber has a clean disciplinary record, strong performance reviews and a solid résumé, according to the lawsuit.

“Nonetheless, Plaintiff has not been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant,” the suit states.

After a second round of candidates was sorted into the top group, Wildhaber again ranked as No. 3 on the list. Since February 2015, however, he has “continued to be passed over for multiple promotions,” according to the suit.

“Defendant has refused to promote Plaintiff because he does not conform to the County’s gender-based norms, expectations, and/or preferences,” the lawsuit states. “Mr. Saracino’s comments to Plaintiff are direct evidence of sex/gender discrimination.”

It continues: “That direct evidence is further buttressed by the fact that Plaintiff has received stellar performance reviews, has solid backing from his immediate supervisors (who have expressed surprise and displeasure about Plaintiff being continually passed over for promotions), and is more qualified to hold the position of Lieutenant.”

[An armless man couldn’t carry his bike up the stairs. He says it cost him his job.]

The suit alleges that Wildhaber filed a discrimination charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Missouri Commission on Human Rights in April. In May, according to the suit, he was reassigned from afternoon shifts in one precinct to midnight shifts in another precinct, which was located about 27 miles from his home.

The Post-Dispatch reported that Wildhaber was once asked to serve as a liaison to the LGBT community. That happened under another police chief who was replaced by Belmar, and Wildhaber didn’t step into that role.

Joe Patterson, president of the St. Louis County Police Association, told the newspaper that the group has asked Wildhaber to be a part of a still-forming committee that would “ensure all of our members are treated equally and fairly in the workplace, which is a bedrock principal of our organization.”

“We have been actively recruiting LGBT members and minority members to serve on steering committees in order to bring forth not only their concerns, but their ideas on how to improve the police association,” Patterson told the newspaper.

Early excitement about the next generation of the iPhone is building months ahead of an expected fall debut. Analysts expect Apple to release three iPhones this year, but the one getting the most attention is a rumored super-premium model to celebrate the iPhone's tenth anniversary. And, for that phone, Apple is expected to change the type of screen the iPhone uses.

Now, you say, “The type of screen? I'm really supposed to get excited about that?” And I hear you. But when you consider how much time you spend looking at a phone screen, this could be a meaningful change. So, here's a quick look at what you need to know about what it means if Apple switches from its current liquid crystal display (LCD) screens to a type of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen called AMOLED.

The essential difference between an LCD screen and an AMOLED one is the presence of a backlight. The LCD screens currently on Apple’s phones have a backlight that's always shining behind the screen. AMOLED screens, however, don't need this additional layer; the pixels that make up the images on the screen light up whenever electricity passes through them.

Thanks to that difference, AMOLED screens can be very thin, which means you can make thinner products. They also naturally provide more vivid colors, which is a reason that television makers have been pushing OLED in its various forms for their big screens. AMOLED screens, in particular, boast even greater control over each individual pixel — which means better contrast for the viewer. In certain situations, these screens can also improve battery life. Because there's no backlight, AMOLED screens can be more energy-efficient when the user is viewing darker subjects, allowing the phone to shut off pixels and stop drawing power.

So why hasn't Apple switched to AMOLED yet? After all, Apple competitors such as Samsung and LG already have these screens on their smartphones.

LCD screens have their own advantages, of course, otherwise Apple wouldn't have stuck with them for so long. In general, they produce truer-to-life colors than AMOLED screens. They also tend to be easier to see in direct sunlight than AMOLED screens, and are brighter overall thanks to the backlight. In my opinion, Apple's LCD screens are also easier to see from multiple angles than AMOLED-screen smartphones — although it can depend on the device. LCDs are also cheaper to produce.

It's also not that easy to make the complex AMOLED screens, particularly on the scale that Apple makes iPhones. That could explain why most Apple fans expect that only the highest-end phone will have the new screen. Some analysts have cautioned that, even with just one of the three expected models changing technology, there still may not be enough iPhones with the new screens to meet demand.

And then there's the cost. The switch to AMOLED has also been cited as a reason that the price of the high-end iPhone may jump above the $1,000 mark. Beauty, even in a mass-produced world, does not come cheap.

Still, the expense may be worth it, especially as people shoot more photos and videos. Social media and streaming services are now some of the biggest reasons we use our smartphones, and Apple knows that. In fact, Apple is even making its own shows — which it may suggest would look great on a shiny new iPhone.Jonathan Blanks is a research associate in the Cato Institute’s Project on Criminal Justice and managing editor of PoliceMisconduct.net.

Last week, federal immigration officials seized an unauthorized immigrant at an El Paso courthouse where she had been seeking a protective order against an alleged domestic abuser. The judge who oversees the court that issued the protective order expressed dismay that such a seizure took place when the person was seeking protection from violence, and perhaps acting on a tip provided by the alleged abuser himself.

President Trump has said his proposed actions to stiffen immigration enforcement are in the interests of public safety, but seizures such as the one in El Paso and the proposed revitalization of the 287(g) program that deputizes local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law make the public less safe and interfere with local policing priorities.

Certainly, immigration enforcement falls within the federal government’s prerogative, regardless of one’s opinion on current immigration laws. However, that does not make every single enforcement action wise or justifiable. Moreover, the respect for federalism — the recognition of state and local governments’ priorities over the whims of Washington — has long been a mantra of small-government Republicans. Yet, it is hard to think of a larger and more dangerous federal intrusion into local affairs than undermining local law enforcement.

Seizing a person who is seeking refuge from violence subverts the protective function of police officers. If individuals fear as much from law enforcement as they do the criminals living among and victimizing them, they will not come forward to report crimes or cooperate with criminal investigations. Non-cooperation makes police officers’ jobs harder by emboldening and enriching criminals who, consequently, may operate with impunity where people are less willing to help investigators.

One Los Angeles Police Dept. detective told the Los Angeles Times, “It is my job to investigate crimes. . . . And if I can’t do that, I can’t get justice for people, because all of a sudden, I’m losing my witnesses or my victims because they’re afraid that talking to me is going to lead to them getting deported.” When he recently approached a group of Latino workers to investigate a crime, they stood up and walked away. Even though Los Angeles has repeatedly asserted its self-appointed status as a “sanctuary city” for immigrants, one of the workers uttered “Trump is coming,” as he left.

Montgomery County police chief and head of the Major Cities Chiefs Association J. Thomas Manger lamented the administration’s lack of concern for local law enforcement priorities. He told The Post that local law enforcement is invested in “retaining the trust of the immigrant communities, not having the immigrant communities afraid of contacting the police.” He added, “If we alienate the immigrant community, we’re sunk.”

Inherent suspicion of police is dangerous to a community’s well-being, whether that community is comprised of immigrants or the native born. We have seen the deleterious effects of poor relationships between police officers and African American communities. Author and journalist Jill Leovy explains that many black neighborhoods are simultaneously overpoliced for petty crimes and infractions while being underpoliced for violent crimes such as homicide. The lack of trust of police in many African American communities discourages cooperation with police and, consequently, black homicides go unsolved at staggering rates. This dual failure feeds a cycle of mistrust and mutual antagonism between the police and those who need their protection the most.

Many law enforcement officials recognize this and are trying to remedy this trust gap. Earlier this week, a group of police chiefs and prosecutors released a five-point blueprint for the new administration to consider as it establishes its law enforcement priorities. Among other “smart on crime” proposals, the law enforcement leaders stressed the importance of fighting violent crime and supporting community policing efforts rather than aggressively pursuing non-violent violations as ways to build community trust. Not only does a lack of trust make policing harder, the release explicitly stated, but also “a mistrustful community puts police officers at risk.”

The federal government has the authority to enforce its immigration laws, but it should do so with discretion and in a way that aligns with the public trust. Likewise, local law enforcement should be free to protect the communities they serve in line with each community’s best interests. Taking law enforcement actions against people seeking protection is dangerous and irresponsible. Threatening those most vulnerable to crime is anathema to improving public safety.

We all know that the technology industry has a gender problem. But how do you move the needle from awareness to action?

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and Girls Who Code, a nonprofit tech group, have an idea: take the fight to the states. On Friday, both will host the first-ever Girls Who Code Governor's Summit at Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The guest list includes Govs. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa.

Many organizations aimed at improving gender equality in the tech field have focused on changing the culture at tech companies in the past. But this is the first time an effort is aimed at the state level.

“​What’s great about having these governors and state officials involved is that they set the educational agenda for their states,” Sandberg said. And, she said, reaching young kids — as Girls Who Code has done on a smaller scale — is key to improving tech's gender problems long-term.

[Pay Up is a community for women who want to support each other and get closer to closing the gender gap. Join here.]

Fallin, Raimondo and Reynolds all spearhead programs in their states to increase access to computer science education — through programs expanding broadband access or even directing all schools to include some computer science education. The point of the summit, in part, is to compare notes and come up with standards and organized ways of measuring efforts that aim to support girls and women who are interested in tech and science.

“We can’t afford to have half of America’s brain power not engaging,” said Raimondo, who has directed all Rhode Island schools to teach computer science classes by December 2017.

The conversation comes at a time when — despite a lot of discussion about the problem — the gender gap in tech is getting worse. In 1984, 37 percent of all computer science graduates were women. Today, that number is 18 percent, according to a survey done by Accenture and Girls Who Code last year. Data from the Census Bureau show a similar decline in the workplace.

Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, said she found that number chilling. “We’ve had our heads down for the past six years. How is this getting worse?” Girls Who Code, which launched in 2012, has since put at least 10,000 young girls through the program — only some of whom have since entered college, and are majoring in computer science.

Saujani said she saw that study as a rallying cry, to step up her efforts and use states' growing interest in computer science to collect good data and get to the heart of what may be contributing to that decline.

"​What's the gender makeup of those classrooms? We know anecdotally it’s normally 70 percent boys and 30 percent girls,” she said. Working with states, she said, lets her group and others “very closely watch the diversity and gender numbers” in schools and find out what is going on.

One reason behind the gap could be what Saujani calls the high school trap in which girls may not see their peers or role models interested in science, or told that it's a “boy” thing. Others looking at the problem think we're not starting early enough.

“We need to be thinking long-term and making long-term investments,” said Raimondo. “That’s why we’re teaching computer science in kindergarten.”

Another reason could be that making such a change on a bigger scale takes time. Many of today's most visible programs launched to get girls interested in coding have started within the past decade.



“Think of Title IX, for example: look at how long it took to work its way into the system,” said Jessica Rovello, chief executive of Arkadium — a technology publishing company that boasts an executive staff of more than 50 percent women. “To go all those years and then, in this last Olympics, have all these women start winning gold medals. That’s how the dots were connected there.”

Rovello is not involved in the summit, but has worked on different initiatives to get more women into technology jobs. Besides getting more girls interested in tech, she thinks that there should be cultural changes at companies.

“Initiatives can fill out the pipeline. Once you have them in the business, though, you have to figure out: how do you keep them in the business?” she said. At Arkadium, she's taken steps to ensure, for example, that all her employees are trained to acknowledge their own biases and feel comfortable communicating. And, she said, companies must continue seeking out qualified female candidates. “I think that qualified women and minorities are there if you care to look and find them,” she said.

(Arkadium works on The Washington Post's games section.)

At the other end of the pipeline, Saujani said she thinks that it's possible to close the tech gender gap in a decade — if advocates can direct the energy, focus on gathering good data and setting metrics, and follow through on their goals. The summit attendees already have plans to reconvene in six months at the National Governors Association, to compare notes and recruit more states to their cause.

“We have the wind at our back,” Saujani said. “We have their attention — policy is being sought out right now about how to get to every child interested in computer science. We need to be addressing some of the barriers that are keeping girls out of field at the same time.”Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost.

You’re all set!Patrick Mondaca served in Iraq with the U.S. Army in 2003 as a military police sergeant.

In 2003, I went to Baghdad as a military police sergeant with the U.S. Army. I came home a different man.

Instead of traffic, I see blocked convoys and kill zones. Instead of crowded subways and train platforms, I see hundreds of potential casualties hemmed in by machine-gun fire from superior advantages of height and terrain. On rooftops and window ledges and on the steeples of cathedrals, I see places of concealment for snipers. On our city sidewalks, I see the anxious faces of commuters running late. They are counting minutes. I am counting dead and wounded.

I have adjustment disorder, defined by the Department of Veterans Affairs as “occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress.”

Adjustment disorder is a strange diagnosis. It implies that the veteran is “adjusting” but that he or she is also having temporary difficulty doing so. It is a quasi-acknowledgment of a problem, but not a condition given the same priority as post-traumatic stress disorder. It also unjustly absolves the government for the mental wounds sustained at war.

Because PTSD can be so disabling, the government offers veterans diagnosed with the disorder varied treatment options and compensation. But to receive such a diagnosis requires a specific traumatic incident. “At a minimum,” VA states, “the veteran must provide the following: a stressor that can be documented; the location where the incident took place; the approximate date (within a two-month period) of the incident; and the unit of assignment at the time the stressful event occurred.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists has found evidence of Army and VA doctors being pressured to diagnose struggling veterans with adjustment disorder instead of PTSD. In a 2008 report of the issue, the group suggested that the aim of the pressure was cutting the cost of long-term, expensive health care.

It’s true — I do not have PTSD in the way it is traditionally defined. I did not suffer a trauma — that is, a specific occurrence of trauma, during my combat deployment. I bore witness to gruesome things in Baghdad, but to observe traumatic events is not necessarily to be traumatized by those specific events.

A soldier, however, may be traumatized by the entire wartime experience — by remaining in a continuous state of hyper-alertness and adrenaline. This theater of war rewires and reconditions the minds of returning soldiers.

I have sustained an adjustment of my person, of my sense of self, of my relationships and of what would have been my common surroundings in any peacetime society. My perception and understanding of the world have been altered: A house dog can be conditioned and trained to fight another dog to the death. A civilian can be conditioned to do harm to his fellow man — to maim, to wound and to kill. This is less a trauma than it is a casualty of war. It is a detachment from the rest of society — an inability of the soldier to come home completely.

Throughout the 2016 election, politicians treated the veteran vote as though it could be earned with empty promises of vast overhauls and additional funding. But my concern is not just about money and promises. They could pour all the resources in the world into VA without addressing the real issue at hand.

The problem is the rest of society. We’re ill-prepared to reintegrate our soldiers back into the “tribe,” as Sebastian Junger explains in his latest book. We don’t recognize the detachment a soldier feels when he or she returns to those who have not also “borne the battle.”

Our society is focused on PTSD and the identification of specific occasions of trauma and its treatment. But I am less injured than I am displaced. I will never belong, mostly because I have been something that most of my fellow citizens have not been and cannot be: a soldier.

I do not feel shame or guilt for my part in the war. If anyone should feel guilt, it should be you. You should feel ashamed for hiding behind my brothers and sisters in arms — for asking us to do the things that you would not; for cheering us on for doing the bad things in the bad places; for shaking our bloodied hands and thanking us for our “service”; and for parading us around and buying us shots of whiskey on Veterans Day.

The village has chosen us to do its dirty work, but the village doesn’t quite know how to bring us back. We need more substantial strategies to integrate our soldiers back into society beyond hollow celebrations.Sports Tip – PS P.S. from the PostPoints staff: Here’s our weekly roundup of deals and giveaways we think you’ll enjoy!

The tricky thing about delicatessens, Ilyse Fishman Lerner has learned, is that everyone has an opinion about them. For every kvell, there’s a kvetch.

“A lot of people come in and they want to tell us their experiences they’ve had with this food growing up,” she says. But those experiences might not match what’s on the menu at On Rye, a Chinatown deli with a modern twist: The vegetarian offerings upstage the meat.

“It’s an amalgamation of everything I had growing up, and it’s also a conversation about where the cuisine is headed,” Lerner says. “Our menu is a lot more vegetarian-friendly and a lot lighter.”

Sure, there’s pastrami and corned beef and matzoh ball soup. But the stars of the show here are Reubens made of portobello mushrooms and spiced broccoli rabe, or smoked beet and Gouda. Stuffed with sauerkraut and slathered with Russian dressing, they stay true to the original deli flavors while being far more interesting than their meaty counterparts.

Another thing that makes On Rye a modern deli is its commitment to health. The kitchen has a light touch with salt, and sandwiches aren’t stacked with so much pastrami and corned beef that they threaten to topple over. You can eat an entire sandwich in one sitting without feeling as if you need to take a nap.

On Rye, which opened late last year, got a lot of buzz initially for using Wagyu brisket. But after feedback, Lerner has phased that out for a more traditional corned beef and pastrami, brined by a local supplier. The changes have been good, and the sandwiches are more flavorful than before, though still not as rich as the pastrami at Smoked and Stacked in Shaw. It’s something Lerner says they’re still tweaking, along with other parts of the menu: The wan baked latkes are out; egg salad and coleslaw are in. (They even have a turkey sandwich named “We Finally Have Slaw!”) As they rethink the menu, they would do well to take a second look at the turkey charoset sandwich, which tastes mostly of cinnamon.

Downtown Washington doesn’t have a traditional Jewish deli, which may explain why some people have been outspoken about this one. Because it’s the only game in town, it draws customers who might have a different set of expectations. To them, a modern deli — where veggies take a front seat and you won’t leave parched from all the salt — may seem contrary to the natural order of things.

[The egg cream is the grown-up chocolate milk you’ve been missing out on]

Aside from the veggie Reubens, there are other things On Rye does quite well. Its egg cream — “No egg, no cream!” the menu exclaims — is fizzy and indulgent, thanks to Fox’s U-Bet chocolate syrup, a classic New York deli component. Its matzoh ball soup, $7, is hearty enough as a stand-alone lunch item, with root vegetables and its baseball-size starring attraction. Even before the deli opened, On Rye was winning people over with its babka ice cream sandwiches, which began as an offering at Nationals Park. Lerner’s husband, and the restaurant’s co-owner, is a grandson of the team’s owner, Ted Lerner. The couple, both 31, are first-time restaurateurs and left their careers in law to work in the industry.

The interior is full of charm, clad in subway tile and wooden shelving that contains Jewish cookbooks and potted plants. One small window-seating nook is swathed in wallpaper printed with tessellated close-ups of the restaurant’s sandwiches, and the bathrooms are decorated with images of pickles and black-and-white cookies. And as you walk in, you’re met with a pun: A tiled welcome mat that says, “Rye, hello there.”

“We brainstormed a ton of rye puns,” Lerner says, including “good-rye” and “we do it rye-t.” But “we haven’t subjected people to them.”

You could say it’s a deli with a rye sense of humor. And one that wants to do right by its customers.

While American children generally acquire basic math and reading skills, they often fail to master more advanced skills like fractions, algebra or critical reading. (iStock)

States and the federal government spend more than $15 billion a year on preschool education. With that hefty price tag, we want early-childhood programs to work. And to reduce long-standing educational inequalities, we need them to work. So it’s encouraging when studies show that these types of interventions can give children a boost by the time they enter kindergarten.

Unfortunately, our investments in many early-childhood programs may be based on an inflated sense of their promise. Even our best efforts often produce only ephemeral gains.

We reviewed data from 67 high-quality interventions, all of which included some degree of pre-literacy and early math skill-building, and found that the effects faded startlingly fast: falling by half within a year and by half again two years later.

Head Start — perhaps the best-known early-childhood program — was no exception. A recent national evaluation showed that a year of Head Start produced tangible benefits. For example, Head Start 4-year-olds scored significantly higher on three of the most widely used literacy assessments than did similarly disadvantaged children who had been placed on Head Start waitlists. The benefits were enough to cut in half the gap in pre-reading skills between Head Start students and the national average for children of the same age. When tested a year later, at the end of kindergarten, however, the reading skills of Head Start children were indistinguishable from those of comparison-group children.

We saw this pattern for one intervention after another.

Why is fadeout so common? It’s obvious that basic math and reading skills are necessary for acquiring more advanced math and reading skills; you need to be able to count to learn to add, and you need to understand the correspondence between letters and sounds to learn to read. And many studies have documented strong correlations between school-entry skills and later math and reading performance. So why don’t boosts in these early foundational skills lead to permanent advantages in the academic trajectories of disadvantaged kids?

Our work suggests that much of what children learn in early-childhood intervention programs are skills that kids typically pick up in kindergarten or first grade anyway. Fadeout is really a process of other children catching up — learning their letters, learning to count, learning to control their emotions and impulses.

What holds disadvantaged kids back throughout their schooling is not a failure to master the basics.

More fundamental to achievement are hard-to-change characteristics such as intelligence and conscientiousness, as well as persistent environmental factors that are difficult to change with a one-time educational intervention. American children raised in poverty must wade through a stream of stresses. They may have to move often or even be homeless for a time. They may be exposed to violence in their homes or neighborhoods. Their parents, dealing with stresses in their own lives, may not be able to provide as stimulating an upbringing as more economically comfortable parents can — leading to problems such as the 30 million-word gap. When children grow up in challenging home environments and move through mediocre classrooms, it’s not surprising that they are unable to translate early gains in basic math and reading skills into mastery of more advanced skills such as fractions, algebra or critical reading.

That’s not an argument for giving up on early-childhood interventions. There is evidence that pre-K helps ease the transition to full-day school, sustaining kids through a period of high vulnerability. It may reduce the need for special education placement or for kids to be held back a grade, which may in turn have positive cascade effects. Additionally, even if the initial benefits fade rapidly, a handful of the most rigorously implemented and evaluated programs appear to produce benefits that persist well into adulthood: Participants graduate from high school at a higher rate, earn more, have fewer run-ins with the law and lead healthier lives than peers from similar backgrounds. We don’t know exactly why.

It’s a mistake to assess these programs — and justify policy — by looking solely at metrics immediately after the conclusion of an intervention. It’s vital that we continue to track the longer-run effects.

But it’s also a mistake to expect that initial gains will sustain themselves. For lasting effects, we need to focus on skills that wouldn’t otherwise develop, do more to change a child’s environment and provide ongoing support, especially during sensitive periods of development such as early adolescence.

One intriguing set of interventions seeks to encourage children’s beliefs about their learning potential, help them affirm their values and enable them to see the point of their education. For example, asking minority middle school students to write about something they value (e.g., friendships or music) has been shown in some experiments to improve their GPA relative to their white peers for years afterward. Such interventions are attractive because they are inexpensive and can be tailored to different contexts, though there are questions about how reliably the results can be replicated in larger samples.

Another worthy model for interventions targets not just children but their caregivers, with the idea that improving parent-child interactions can affect the whole course of a child’s development. For example, low-income mothers randomly assigned to the Nurse-Family Partnership, which involves home visits during pregnancy and a child’s infancy, were subsequently less reliant on social services, and their children had better grade-point averages and achievement test scores in math and reading through elementary school.

A further way to improve children’s environments would be to offer more large-scale interventions. Recent research on North Carolina’s statewide More at Four program suggests that filling early-grade classrooms with enough students who have already mastered the basics may allow teachers to offer a more advanced curriculum from the start.

We need to focus on older children as well. Intensive interventions can help with mastery of advanced skills. A high school program offering a double dose of algebra classes has been shown to boost graduation rates. And students who attend career academies, which restructure large high schools into small learning communities and promote concrete vocational skills, can typically expect higher earnings as adults. Vocational skills, advanced math and literacy skills, and achievement-related beliefs and motivations are examples of what we call “trifecta skills” — skills that are malleable, fundamental to success and unlikely to develop in the absence of an intervention.

Early-childhood programs have the potential to improve the lives of millions of children. Everyone agrees that these programs have the best of intentions. But good intentions are not enough. We need to design interventions that generate persistent advantages for our children.Fashion Tip – Content (photo credit) content here blah blah Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

(Video: Reuters / Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

If you read the New York Times report that several of President Trump's aides and associates communicated regularly during the campaign with Russian intelligence officials, you know that Trump's rebuttal at a news conference Thursday made little sense. That's a big “if,” however.

The reality is that Trump supporters, generally speaking, don't read the Times. When the Pew Research Center surveyed voters after the election, the Times didn't even register among Trump backers' primary news sources.

The Trump base's media consumption habits — of which the president is undoubtedly aware — is the key to success for attacks on “fake news” reports by the Times and other major outlets that Trump voters disdain. If his supporters don't actually read a report, such as the one the Times ran Wednesday, then Trump doesn't have to respond to it, really. He can respond to a version of his own invention, and his backers will be none the wiser.

[Donald Trump’s combative, grievance-filled news conference, annotated]

To see how Trump's strategy works, let's review what he said about the New York Times story and a subsequent report in the Wall Street Journal at Thursday's news conference:

The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was — it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I noticed they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. … I think the one person — I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. … The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. [Paul] Manafort. … He said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories. So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. … And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. … I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in the New York Times, put it on the front page?

For starters, it is flat-out false that these newspapers did not call for comment. The Journal, which reported that some U.S. intelligence officials are withholding bits of information from Trump, quoted a White House official, who said “there is nothing that leads us to believe that this is an accurate account of what is actually happening.” The White House declined to provide a comment to the Times.

If you read the stories, you knew as soon as Trump opened his mouth that his complaint about “never get[ting] phone calls from the media” was illegitimate. But if you didn't read the stories, you might have believed that the White House didn't have a chance to comment.

[Donald Trump is doing A-okay with the only people he cares about]

Trump also was wrong when he asserted that Manafort's denial of contact with Russia was omitted. The Times interviewed Manafort and printed his response.

And Trump's reference to “the three people that they talked about” was a bit misleading. He could have said “three of the people they talked about,” but he implied (inaccurately) that the Times's report dealt with only three people when he said “the three people.” The Times reported that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted calls involving other, unnamed Trump associates.

The three people named in the story were Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman; Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser; and Roger Stone, a veteran and controversial Republican operative (and longtime Trump friend) who worked for the campaign early in the GOP primary.

Trump said he “noticed they were on television … saying they never even spoke to Russia,” but the denials Trump “noticed” were not new. The Times noted in its story that “all of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials.”

Trump delivered a classic straw-man argument in his Thursday news conference. He knocked down a version of the Times report that didn't really exist — a version in which his White House and his former campaign staffers were viciously attacked without any opportunity to defend themselves.

The ploy was obvious to anyone who actually read the report, but the president made the safe bet that his backers did not.This entry was posted in Featured Partner .

Oil on canvas portrait of Thomas Jefferson, 1805, painted by Gilbert Stuart. (Colonial Williamsburg Foundation)

During his time as U.S. minister to France, Thomas Jefferson penned a letter to a statesman from Virginia, waxing poetic about the importance of a free press.

“The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right,” Jefferson wrote to Edward Carrington in 1787. “And were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them.”

Those words would help identify the Founding Father as a champion of the press.

But as Jefferson was writing them, scholars say, he did not foresee that newspapers would become a partisan tool for warring political factions in a climate of unrest and uncertainty over the fate of a nascent nation.

By the time he was approaching his presidency, anxieties were high and newspapers had taken a critical stance. Jefferson in turn had taken critical tone with them, at least in his in personal letters, in which he often excoriated the press — much as the 45th president, Donald Trump, would do more than 200 years later.

[Trump says ‘I inherited a mess,’ blasts media and detractors at combative news conference]

“Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper,” Jefferson said then.

“FAKE NEWS media … makes up stories and 'sources,'” Trump tweets now.

Jefferson called the press “the only tocsin of a nation.”

Trump calls the media “the enemy of the American People.”

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

“Thomas Jefferson was as irritated with newspaper coverage as any public figure of his era,” Ken Paulson, president of the Newseum Institute's First Amendment Center, told The Washington Post in an email. “For all the talk of media bias today, it can't compare to the overt partisanship and personal attacks appearing in papers in our nation's early years. But Jefferson also knew that our democracy could only flourish with a free press that would keep an eye on people in power and help protect our freedoms.

“He understood that press coverage comes and goes, but freedom of the press must endure.”

The Newseum celebrates Jefferson's famous First Amendment stance, selling a magnet with one of his quotes: “The only security of all is in a free press.”

Trump has repeatedly lambasted the media, first for its coverage of his presidential campaign and, now, of his administration. During a combative 75-minute news conference Thursday, the president continued to air his grievances, saying, “I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.”

At the time Jefferson wrote the storied words about press freedom that journalists have since embraced as a mantra, “his view of the press was uncluttered with the experience he was going to soon acquire,” said Joseph Ellis, a U.S. historian who has written a biography about Jefferson, “American Sphinx.”

“His view of the press was going to change,” he said.

Jefferson was a controversial presidential candidate, portrayed in the press as a Francophile and an atheist and was later rumored to have had children with a slave at Monticello (now widely believed by historians). Many people were worried he was putting the survival of the republic at risk — and that sentiment was echoed in the press, historians say.

Then during his presidency, the historians say, he was heavily criticized for his actions, namely the Louisiana Purchase and the Embargo Act of 1807.

[Here’s why Trump’s attacks on ‘fake news’ succeed]

In 1796, a year before he became vice president, Jefferson wrote a letter to George Washington, saying that “from a very early period of my life, I had laid it down as a rule of conduct, never to write a word for the public papers.”

But Ellis, the historian, noted that “Jefferson never said about the press what Trump says about the press.”

Still, Ellis said, “Jefferson recognized the press as one of the pillars of the society we wanted; but when he came under criticism in a big way, he used his powers to censor them.”

In a 1993 op-ed in the New York Times, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anthony Lewis wrote:

In 1798 the Federalists pushed through Congress a Sedition Act making it a crime to publish false, malicious comments about the President or Congress. (They exempted Vice President Jefferson from this protection against abuse.) The aim of the law was to silence the country's main Jeffersonian newspapers in the run-up to the election of 1800. Their editors and owners were indeed prosecuted, some for mere critical opinions or lampooning of President Adams. Jefferson and James Madison, the author of the First Amendment, worked to rouse the public against the Sedition Act. They argued that the Federalists, by trying to silence speech critical of politicians, were taking America back to the British system — the tyranny of George III. And their arguments persuaded many, contributing to Jefferson's defeat of Adams. When Jefferson took office, on March 4, 1801, he pardoned all those who had been convicted under the Sedition Act. In his Inaugural Address he opened his arms to his bitter opponents — and set out what I think is the true American attitude toward freedom of speech.

But once Jefferson was in office, he tried to censor the critical press.

“In his second term, in response to serious criticism from the New England newspapers … he instructed the state attorney generals in New England to prosecute the newspaper editors for sedition in the same way he had opposed such behavior when it was done by the federal government,” said Ellis, the historian.

The move further alienated Jefferson from the journalists, as well as the clergy.

It was during his second term in 1806 that Jefferson wrote to U.S. Rep. Barnabas Bidwell of Massachusetts, “As for what is not true you will always find abundance in the newspapers.”

The next year, Jefferson made his opinion known in a letter to John Norvell, a politician, lawyer and journalist who had written to him about plans to start his own newspaper.

“To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, 'by restraining it to true facts and sound principles only,'" Jefferson said. “Yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more completely deprive the nation of it's benefits, than is done by it's abandoned prostitution to falsehood.

“Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.”

[‘Fake news’ has now lost all meaning]

Jefferson's presidency ended in 1809 — but his frustrations with the press did not.

In 1814, he said, “I deplore with you the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who write for them.”

A year later, he wrote to James Monroe: “A truth now and then projecting into the ocean of newspaper lies, serves like head-lands to correct our course. Indeed, my skepticism as to everything I see in a newspaper, makes me indifferent whether I ever see one.”

And then again the next year: “From forty years' experience of the wretched guess-work of the newspapers of what is not done in open daylight, and of their falsehood even as to that, I rarely think them worth reading, and almost never worth notice.”

Monticello historian Christa Dierksheide said Jefferson was lamenting the press he envisioned when he first fought for its freedoms.

“As an idealist, he continued to hope that the press would overcome its partisan leanings,” she told The Post. “But that never happened.”

But, Dierksheide said, Jefferson still “held that a free press had to be protected.”

“He felt that a free press was an expression of the people's opinion,” she said, “and there had to be an outlet for their opinion because government was based on their opinion.”Washington Post moderators retain editorial control over discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.

Apple senior vice president for worldwide marketing Phil Schiller announces the iPhone 6 in Cupertino, Calif., on Sept. 9, 2014. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)

Early excitement about the next generation of the iPhone is building months ahead of an expected fall debut. Analysts expect Apple to release three iPhones this year, but the one getting the most attention is a rumored super-premium model to celebrate the iPhone's tenth anniversary. And, for that phone, Apple is expected to change the type of screen the iPhone uses.

Now, you say, “The type of screen? I'm really supposed to get excited about that?” And I hear you. But when you consider how much time you spend looking at a phone screen, this could be a meaningful change. So, here's a quick look at what you need to know about what it means if Apple switches from its current liquid crystal display (LCD) screens to a type of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen called AMOLED.

The essential difference between an LCD screen and an AMOLED one is the presence of a backlight. The LCD screens currently on Apple’s phones have a backlight that's always shining behind the screen. AMOLED screens, however, don't need this additional layer; the pixels that make up the images on the screen light up whenever electricity passes through them.

Thanks to that difference, AMOLED screens can be very thin, which means you can make thinner products. They also naturally provide more vivid colors, which is a reason that television makers have been pushing OLED in its various forms for their big screens. AMOLED screens, in particular, boast even greater control over each individual pixel — which means better contrast for the viewer. In certain situations, these screens can also improve battery life. Because there's no backlight, AMOLED screens can be more energy-efficient when the user is viewing darker subjects, allowing the phone to shut off pixels and stop drawing power.

So why hasn't Apple switched to AMOLED yet? After all, Apple competitors such as Samsung and LG already have these screens on their smartphones.

LCD screens have their own advantages, of course, otherwise Apple wouldn't have stuck with them for so long. In general, they produce truer-to-life colors than AMOLED screens. They also tend to be easier to see in direct sunlight than AMOLED screens, and are brighter overall thanks to the backlight. In my opinion, Apple's LCD screens are also easier to see from multiple angles than AMOLED-screen smartphones — although it can depend on the device. LCDs are also cheaper to produce.

It's also not that easy to make the complex AMOLED screens, particularly on the scale that Apple makes iPhones. That could explain why most Apple fans expect that only the highest-end phone will have the new screen. Some analysts have cautioned that, even with just one of the three expected models changing technology, there still may not be enough iPhones with the new screens to meet demand.

And then there's the cost. The switch to AMOLED has also been cited as a reason that the price of the high-end iPhone may jump above the $1,000 mark. Beauty, even in a mass-produced world, does not come cheap.

Still, the expense may be worth it, especially as people shoot more photos and videos. Social media and streaming services are now some of the biggest reasons we use our smartphones, and Apple knows that. In fact, Apple is even making its own shows — which it may suggest would look great on a shiny new iPhone.

Shrimp and Avocado Fondue. (Renee Comet/For the Washington Post; styling by Bonnie S. Benwick)

Are you wary when food writers suggest unearthing the ol’ fondue pot? The hot stuff typically goes one of three ways: wine and cheese; bubbling oil and meat; chocolate and gluttony.

This recipe’s probably no less caloric, but it is different. The emphasis is on creamy, with ripe avocado and only a bit of soft Taleggio cheese folded into a roux. The mixture is simple enough to compose right in the pot, and clings nicely to the best shrimp-cocktail-quality, jumbo crustaceans you can find.

It’s cozy cold-weather party food that friends can gather around — as long as you can summon all your skewers.

SHRIMP AND AVOCADO FONDUE

4 main-course servings or 8 appetizer servings

You’ll need a fondue pot that is heated underneath by an alcohol fuel, such as Sterno (and not just a candle), as well as a backup supply of fuel in case you need more for serving.

8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into chunks

½ medium onion, minced (see TIPS)

1 clove garlic, minced

¼ cup flour

¾ cup whole milk

¾ cup half-and-half

½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed

⅓ cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)

Flesh of 1 ripe avocado, mashed

2 ounces Taleggio cheese, rind removed

2 tablespoons dry sherry

Spanish smoked paprika (pimenton)

1 pound large or jumbo cooked shrimp (peeled and deveined; defrosted if using frozen)

Place the butter in the assembled fondue pot and light the fully uncovered can of Sterno or other fuel underneath.

Once the butter has melted, add the onion and garlic; close the regulator disk over the fuel can halfway, to reduce the heat. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring a few times, until the onion has softened. Whisk in the flour; cook for a few minutes, to form a thickened roux.

Remove from the heat just long enough to whisk in the milk and half-and-half until well incorporated, then return to the heat. Add the salt, lemon juice and avocado; cook for about 5 minutes, stirring, until smooth.

Stir in the cheese; cook for about 5 minutes, until melted; the fondue should be thick enough to coat without dripping. Stir in the sherry, then taste, and add more salt, as needed. Sprinkle in the smoked paprika (to taste).

Arrange the shrimp on individual plates, ready for dunking.President Trump on Jan. 22 said his administration will begin talks with Mexico about the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as border issues. (The Washington Post)

On the campaign trail and in office, President Trump and his advisers have railed against countries that exploit the United States by selling us a lot more stuff than we sell them -- that is, countries with whom we have big trade deficits. The criticism has led them to pursue a confrontational trade strategy, espousing taxes and potentially tariffs that would, at least conceptually, make U.S. exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive.

Yet David Autor, a widely respected economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who actually has done much of the most groundbreaking research on how trade can kill jobs, says that if the president wants trade to do more to benefit American workers, he should take a different approach.

Autor is perhaps best known for his calculations about how China’s entry into the global trading market had a devastating effect on U.S. manufacturing communities. I spoke with him about Trump's trade philosophy and what he would suggest the new administration do to help workers.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What is the biggest thing you think readers should know about the administration’s trade policy?

Their views are quite mercantilist, meaning they tend to view trade as a zero-sum game, where if you export more than you import, you win, and if you import more than you export, you lose. And that’s an antiquated and unsophisticated understanding of trade.

Why is that unsophisticated?

Economists have understood since the Victorian era that the main benefits of trade come from comparative advantage, the idea that people can specialize in what they’re good at, and then benefit from exchange. The principle is no more mysterious than specialization in the labor market. There’s a reason I write articles and go out for good dinners, because I’m better at research than cooking. And there are people who are much better at cooking than research, so it’s mutually beneficial for us to specialize. Why should every country in the world have a crappy airplane manufacturing facility when they can buy jets from Boeing and Airbus?

The ultimate example of the opposite of trade is a subsistence economy, where every household grows its own food, raises its own animals, chops down its own trees and so on. But of course, as societies get more sophisticated, they subdivide work. We do that within countries as well as across countries, because some countries have expertise or cost advantages. The U.S. tends to export high-tech goods because we have strong comparative advantage there, and we tend to import labor-intensive and less skill-intensive goods that other countries can do more cheaply.

So how does the administration’s trade discussion contrast to that?

Their measure of our failure in trade is the trade deficit with China and Mexico. That’s just not an appropriate metric of success. Mexico is one of our biggest export markets. The fact that in some years we’re importing a few percentage points more from them than they are from us, it’s really second order relative to the benefits of trade.

[We’re totally misunderstanding the difference between Mexico and China]

People tend to think about trade as if it’s competition between companies — if Apple wins, Google loses. But that’s false. Trade makes nations better off in general. Now, I want to be clear. I’m not saying that everything about trade is good and beneficial. Trade also has costs. But starting from the point of view where trade is a game where one country wins and the other loses, and the measure of your victory is how much you export relative to what you import, that’s just crazy. You have to understand the fundamental reason for trade is not because you win by exporting and lose by importing -- it’s that there are things that other countries make that you want to buy, and things you make that they want to buy.

By the way, there is almost no evidence that NAFTA [the North American Free Trade Agreement] was substantially harmful for U.S. workers. That myth has been promulgated by people from Ross Perot to Pat Buchanan to Donald Trump, but there is not any academic support for it.

On the campaign trail President Trump spoke out aggressively against NAFTA, calling it "the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere." Economists have a more nuanced view of the deal struck in the early 1990s. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)

So what are the costs of trade?

Trade almost necessarily grows the size of the economic pie, but it also changes the size of different slices. It’s quite possible for trade to increase the size of the pie by a few percent, and yet shrink some slices by 20 to 30 percent. Because we’re a high-skill nation, when we trade with the rest of the world, we increase our production of skill-intensive products. So trade tends to increase the earnings of highly educated and skilled workers, and decrease the earnings and employment opportunities for less educated and less skilled workers.

The gains to consumers and high-skilled workers are sufficiently large that they could compensate those that are worse off for their losses. But that process doesn’t happen on its own. And in fact, it almost never happens in reality.

So that’s the real cost, that trade can dramatically reduce the livelihoods of a subset of people, and that is also extremely visible and wrenching. One reason is that manufacturing is geographically concentrated, so when a sector starts to go into decline, everyone in a region loses their job simultaneously, just like what happened with coal mining. It’s like a small bomb going off in your downtown.

[The places in America most exposed to a trade war]

Meanwhile, the benefits are quite diffuse. They often mean lower prices for consumers, a greater variety of goods, more demand for highly educated workers, and huge profits for certain companies. When we all get cheaper furniture and textiles at Walmart, that’s a couple percentage points in your cost of living over the next few years.

A second factor is that manufacturing employment in particular is relatively high-paid work for relatively less-educated workers. They earn more per hour than similar people, and they have more stable hours. They generally are not going to find equally good jobs.

We know in general as the labor market has become more skill intensive, women have educated themselves and adapted by moving quickly into other jobs. No one spends a lot of time shedding tears about the loss of all those great clerical jobs, but it is the case that clerical jobs have dramatically contracted. Women have moved on and up.

Whereas for men in manufacturing, there has not been nearly as strong of an educational response. When men are displaced from manufacturing, they tend to move into lower paid jobs, or just move out of the labor market. So they really are losing something they’re not going to replace in any short-term way.

Thinking about trade now, there's some confusion over how much people should question the orthodoxy of free trade. It seems like you’ve done a little bit of that yourself, yet your description of how trade works is still very much economics 101.

Here’s the irony: Orthodox economics has always acknowledged that trade could be very disruptive. But that wasn’t the advice given to policymakers. They were told that trade makes every nation better off — which is true — but not the caveat that it could create real challenges for certain individuals.

Why is that? Because historically we had very little evidence of those disruptive effects. What we learned over the last 20 years is that what theory always said, that trade can be very redistributive, was true in spades. The shock of China’s entry into global manufacturing was unprecedented in the disruption it created for U.S. communities. It created much more hardship than anyone anticipated.

In the work I’ve done with my co-authors, we’re not making the hunky dory case for trade. We emphasize you need to start by understanding that there are many potential benefits, but then you also need to complete the sentence and say that the process can be very redistributive, and if you’re not cognizant of that, people can get really hurt, as they did in the 2000s in particular.

So I don’t not want to be on the record saying it’s all good, and everyone who complains it just a troglodyte. That’s not correct.

You’ve mentioned that if we knew then what we knew now, we might have lowered trade barriers more slowly. But is that a case for raising trade barriers now?

If we knew how disruptive this would be, we would have wanted to do it more slowly. The reason the rate of change matters is there is a natural ebb and flow. People retire, and young people don’t enter contracting sectors. If we know that 20 years from now, no one will be driving motor vehicles for a living, we can adjust to that. If it’s announced that after Monday, there will be no one driving cars for a living, that would be very disruptive. So even knowing the destination, the rate of change really matters.

But secondly, no, I don’t think we can put the genie back in the bottle and expect to get back a lot of labor-intensive manufacturing. Some of that would have eventually succumbed to trade or automation, because it wasn’t an area where the U.S. had comparative advantage anyway, as a high-wage country.

That doesn’t mean you can’t aggressively enforce trade agreements. There are certainly cases where countries engage in dumping, flooding the market with their products and bankrupting their competitors. That probably happened in the case of steel, tires and solar cells. The WTO [World Trade Organization] gives us a lot of leverage. There have been several hundred cases brought in the last 15 years, and many of them resolved in the U.S.’s favor.

The TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] was a step in this direction, of creating enforceable contracts and strengthening intellectual property protections. China wasn’t in it. There’s no country that was happier that the TPP was shot down than China. And by the way, there was no country that was more harmed by that than Japan, with the U.S. being second. Trump's decision to withdraw from the TPP was an incredibly short-sighted and theatrical thing to do.

On his fourth day in office, President Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Crafted by the Obama administration, the trade deal failed to be ratified by Congress during Obama's two terms. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)

[Trump’s pick for secretary of state argued against one of the president-elect’s biggest promises]

What about strategic sectors? If trade barriers aren’t the answer, is there anything we can do to preserve industries we see as important?

There are reasons to care about certain sectors. We ought to be really concerned that we don’t lose the robotics sector to China, for example. People are afraid of robots, but whether we produce them or not, they will be here. It’s just a question of whether they will be produced by the U.S., Germany or China. Since a lot of the innovation has originated here, we have an intellectual head start, but our investment is woefully behind.

Manufacturing is also extremely important as a hub of innovation. It may not be a mass employer in the future, but it is still incredibly important because so many of our great ideas are produced while making new products, and a lot of our wealth comes from those ideas.

One thing the U.S. ought to do is change our tax code in a way that favors domestic investment rather than simply favoring companies moving profits offshore. So, for example, the idea of replacing our payroll tax with a value-added tax, sometimes called a border adjustment, is a good one. We have an antiquated tax system that has very high, inefficient corporate taxes. Companies spend a lot of energy getting around them, and that creates huge distortions.

Another big step would be for the U.S. to stop cutting the legs out of its investment in research and development by gutting our science and statistical agencies. The U.S. was by far the leader in R&D expenditure and now we’ve fallen behind Germany. China is catching up rapidly.

I wanted to ask you about automation. Some research claims as much as 80 percent of the jobs lost in manufacturing are due to automation. Do you agree?

If we’re talking from 1980 to the present, automation has certainly been a bigger factor in the decline of manufacturing employment than trade. But from 2001 to the present, I think trade is at least equally important. The other thing is that trade is much faster moving, while automation tends to be more gradual.

Automation will occur whether we lead or we lag on it. Automation could benefit us in two ways. One is by increasing productivity. The other is that if we develop those technologies, the industries that grow up around them will create profit and wealth in the U.S. So we ought to be thinking of automation as a strategic asset. As much as we recognize that, just like trade, automation doesn’t make everyone better off, it does raise national wealth, and that gives us the scope to make everyone better off.

What advice would you give the new administration in terms of labor force policies?

I think steps the Obama administration was taking in terms of worker protections, safety enforcement, wage and overtime laws, and so on were important. I think it’s incredibly important to retain access to healthcare and health insurance.

But there’s no substitute for economic growth, so I do want to see pro-growth policies like tax reform and investment. We should be investing in infrastructure and education. The way that public education institutions are being decimated is a huge national loss. And we would benefit from government investment in R&D, for example the National Science Foundation or the National Institutes of Health.

There is a big role for the government in facilitating growth, and it’s not just about deregulating and letting dirty industries pollute more, and letting companies give bad financial advice to pensioners. Growth isn’t a matter of letting one group of people take advantage of another. It’s choosing policies that make the system work better.

Forty years ago, Fashion Week in New York was focused on the clothes. Not celebrities. Not street-style stars. Not social media. Guests gathered in the often dingy showrooms around Seventh Avenue, and photographers took their places along the runway. And the models walked. They sold the clothes with a knowing nod or jaunty strut.

The audience was filled with retailers, magazine editors and newspaper journalists from all around the country. Back then, there was no digital media, but there was an awful lot of print media representing the big cities on both coasts as well as lots of midsize cities in between — places like Detroit, Cleveland and Kansas City, Mo.

The fashion world was small and clubby. Its members set the style agenda. And the news was disseminated in an orderly, controlled manner. It didn’t matter where you lived. Everyone — every woman — took part in the same fashion conversation.

Today, the industry is global, the audience is expansive and the conversation is lively but fractured. As the fall 2017 womenswear collections roll out this month in New York — followed by debuts in London, Milan and Paris — design houses will roll out their wares to a live audience that numbers in the hundreds. Some shows will be live-streamed and accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. And by the time the last model has sashayed off the runway, the entire extravaganza will be posted to Instagram.

Many of the changes are for the better. More people have access to thoughtfully designed clothes. The industry makes a more substantial contribution to the economy. It helps to shape and define our culture for the future. And it still has the capacity to make people dream.

Fashion is more professional now, but also more corporate. In some cases, it has to answer to Wall Street, and so the stakes are higher. A lucrative new idea is knocked off in the blink of an eye with few consequences. Department stores have consolidated and are under pressure as everything from e-commerce to fast fashion degrades the integrity of the old system. And at a fashion show, you’re more likely to meet a social media influencer from Detroit than a journalist from one of that city’s daily newspapers.

These photographs, taken in March 1980, are a lesson in fashion history. A reminder that a circus did not always swirl around the runways. Hollywood stars used to buy clothes — not borrow them — and got dressed without the continued supervision of a stylist. And designers worried about only two seasons, spring and fall — and perhaps “cruise,” for those exceptional women who regularly spent part of their winter at a spa.

It was a simpler time for the fashion industry. When the pace wasn’t so relentless, the field wasn’t so crowded and there was really only one way to sell a frock. Everything moved at a more measured pace. Women waited until designer duds arrived in stores or the copies turned up a year later at a discount.

Business was different, but it was still challenging and not for the faint of heart. American designers were the underdogs to their more established Paris counterparts, whom critics and customers alike deemed more creative. Designers needed business savvy, too, because even though the big stores weren’t as big as they are today, retailers still had the upper hand. The designers who would ultimately make it — the ones who’d enter our popular consciousness — were more salesmen than artists. They wove a mythology around simple ideas: a Polo shirt, a peacoat, a bodysuit.

The pictures of a much younger Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan — each of them in their studio, or in the case of Karan, in the Anne Klein showroom along with her colleague Louis Dell’Olio — remind us that fashion, no matter how corporate or far-reaching, begins with a bolt of fabric, a model and an idea. Look at what they’re wearing or how they are standing and you can get a quick sense of their design aesthetic. Klein wears a minimalist but sexy T-shirt. Lauren has a preppy crewneck pulled over a Polo shirt with its collar popped. Karan’s body language expresses the ease and sensuality of her clothes, which at Anne Klein and, later, her own label, would appeal to so many women building careers outside the home. Karan is draped over a chair, modeling a shoe. Her arms are wrapped around each other. And the late Bill Blass looks jaunty and debonair — a gentleman from another time — in his tailored suit with a cigarette dangling from his lips.

There is also a picture of Perry Ellis, who was known for his youthful, effervescent sportswear and who died in 1986. He is a reminder of how much of the fashion industry was decimated during the height of the AIDS crisis. And also a reminder of what might have been.

These photos capture the years before the supermodels exploded, before the waifs turned a size zero into the standard and diversity drained from the runway. The model Pat Cleveland might have had the legs of a sparrow, but she did not seem breakable or emaciated as she twirled like a top on the catwalk. There were more black models because the designers were more interested in personality than sameness.

And there’s the late Nina Hyde, the former Washington Post fashion editor, who was part of a generation of journalists who covered the frock trade as a business, not just a social dalliance. She, along with women such as Bernadine Morris in New York and Marylou Luther in Los Angeles, were journalists above all else. Hyde chronicled hemlines, but also personalities, profits and losses, fashion’s place in the broader world and its messy, frustrating, captivating humanity.

Before her death in 1990, Hyde moved fashion off the women’s pages of newspapers; she mainstreamed it. Her stories led the way for fashion to be considered in the context of Washington politics, youthful protest, global trade and social currency.

These photos are not a glimpse at Seventh Avenue’s beginnings, but rather a peek at a particular tipping point in society. Fashion was poised to become the cultural force it is today. It was getting ready to make its pact with celebrities and transform into red carpet entertainment. It was rumbling with possibility.

The industry was growing up.You really make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this matter to be really something which I think I would never understand. It seems too complicated and very broad for me. I am looking forward for your next post, I will try to get the…A week ago, John Davis was in a Towson uniform, playing a college basketball game in his home town, Philadelphia, for the last time. He finished the 69-65 victory at Drexel with 14 points and 10 rebounds.

“I needed about 60 tickets for friends and family,” Davis said with a smile. “Towson couldn’t get me enough, so I had to call some friends at Drexel to get the extras. I played well, we won, it was a really good day. A great day.”

While his teammates bussed home that evening, Davis stayed behind. The christening of his 9-month-old son, Bryson Hunter Davis-Harris, was scheduled for the next morning at Enon Tabernacle Church. The christening had been planned around Davis’s trip home.

“About 20 of us went to dinner at a Japanese restaurant,” Davis said. “Everything was perfect. We went back to my mom’s house and a bunch of us were standing outside talking, reminiscing at about 10:30, when this car slowed down driving past us. I really didn’t notice it because I was talking.

“I remember someone saying, ‘Who’s in that car?’ but didn’t pay much attention because I was talking. The car left, then a couple minutes later, it was back. Next thing I knew I heard shots. We all took off running.”

Davis and his younger brother, Kevin Williams — a high school senior — were side-by-side when Kevin said to John, “I think you got hit.”

John shook his head. “No way,” he said. “If I was hit, how could I be running?”

When things calmed down and he and Kevin went inside, he was beginning to feel pain and there was blood on his knee. “I thought I just got grazed,” Davis said. “I didn’t want to go to the hospital. But when my mother saw it, she said, ‘We’re going to the hospital.’ Davis smiled. “You know how mothers are, better safe than sorry.”

As it turned out, Kimberly Williams’s instincts were correct. There was a bullet in John’s knee.

Towson Coach Pat Skerry woke up at 5:20 on Sunday morning and noticed a missed call from Kimberly Williams that had come in at 12:19 a.m. Thinking she had dialed him by accident, he texted her to say she should call him if she needed to talk. An hour later, she called.

“My first reaction was, ‘Is his life in danger?’” Skerry said Thursday. “Kim told me, no, he was fine, he just wasn’t going to play basketball for a while. Honestly, that was the least of my concerns.

“I was upset, worried, but she told me he was going to the christening that morning, so that made me feel better. It wasn’t until he came back here on Tuesday and I sat down with him that it really hit me. I can’t begin to tell you how much the kid has meant to this program and to me, personally.”

Emotional leader

Skerry started recruiting Davis, a 6-foot-5 inch power forward from Philadelphia Catholic League power Neumann-Goretti, just after finishing his first season at Towson with a 1-31 record, having broken what had been an NCAA-record 41-game losing streak that dated from Pat Kennedy’s last season.

“At that point I didn’t have much to sell,” Skerry said. “I’d just broken the NCAA record for losing handshakes in a season. The kid came on faith that we were going to get better, nothing more. I’ve never forgotten that.”

It was more than that. “Sometimes you just get a feeling about someone,” Davis said. “You can tell the difference from a guy who is selling you something and someone who really means it. I honestly believed he [Skerry] cared about me.”

Late in his recruitment, Temple — a Philly school with a big-time reputation and serious basketball history — came calling. Davis wasn’t interested.

“I wasn’t going to school in Philadelphia,” he said on Thursday, watching a team shoot-around with an ice bag wrapped around his knee and crutches at his feet. “You can see why.”

By the end of last season, the Tigers had improved to 20-13 and the Tigers entered Davis’s senior year picked to finish second in the Colonial Athletic Association. Davis, entering games off the bench because he gives the team an emotional boost, averaged 11.8 points and 7.6 rebounds.

But after a solid nonconference season, the Tigers started out 0-4 in league play, bottoming in a 72-61 loss at Elon on Jan. 7th. Two days later, Skerry got a phone call from one of his assistant coaches: Davis hadn’t showed up for the team’s routine Monday afternoon lift. No one could find him.

“That’s not John Davis,” Skerry said. “I texted him. He called me right back. He said, ‘Coach, if the rest of the guys aren’t going to play hard, I don’t want to play with them anymore.’ I told him he needed to tell them that. He did.”

Davis smiled at the memory of the team meeting later that day. “I gave it to everyone pretty good,” he said. “I even gave it to Skerry. I told him he needed to stop being a candy-ass with us when we were playing like a bunch of candy-asses. Some of the guys gave it right back to me — which was the right thing to do.”

Since then, Towson has gone 10-1, including Thursday’s 85-66 win over Elon, jumping them to third place in the CAA standings going into Saturday’s home finale against James Madison.

“That was always going to be an emotional night for me,” Skerry said of his team’s senior night, which, like the rest of the team’s games this season, will be played without Davis. “Now, honestly, I’m not sure how I’ll handle it. It will be tough.”

‘His attitude is amazing’

Davis left the hospital at about 3 a.m. on Sunday, his mom driving him home. Less than seven hours later, he was in church. It was when he saw his son, Bryson, that he lost it for the first time.

“Walking in was surreal to begin with,” he said. “A few hours earlier a lot of those people had seen me running up and down the basketball court. Now, I was on crutches and I had to tell them what had happened.

“When I saw Bryson, I couldn’t help but think what might have happened to him if the gunshot had been higher, if I’d been killed. My dad [also named John Davis] was killed by a gun when I was 7. It was very tough growing up without him. Thinking about Bryson growing up without me . . . ”

Sunday night, the bullet was removed from Davis’s knee. He returned to Towson on Tuesday and went to see his coach.

“When he started talking about Bryson and how he felt in church that morning, I kind of lost it too,” Skerry said. “That was a very tough meeting — more for me than for John. His attitude is absolutely amazing. I don’t think ‘Why me?’ or ‘This is unfair’ has crossed his mind once.”

According to Davis, that’s true. “The neighborhood I grew up in [Queen Village in South Philadelphia] is a tough place,” he said. “I wasn’t the only one shot that night [a 16-year-old boy was shot in the thigh] and there were other shootings in South Philly over the weekend.

“I’m okay, I really am,” Davis said. “I know I’m blessed. I’m here, I’m healthy, I’m going to get better. I can deal with it.”

Police did not identify a suspect or give a possible motive in Davis’s case, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

“I knew when they told me there was a bullet in my knee that I wasn’t going to play college basketball again,” he said, smiling. “I’m a pretty smart guy, I figured that out pretty quickly. But the doctors told me the bullet didn’t hit any bone. I want to play somewhere next year and I’ll get the chance to do that. I’ll have my degree and I’ll have basketball. I love the game and I hope to be around it in some form for a long while.

“I saw my son christened on Sunday. I’m going to be around to watch him grow up.” He paused and laughed. “Just not in Philadelphia.”

While Davis hasn’t wavered in his emotions for most of the last week, Skerry readily admits that he has, frequently.

“I kept thinking, ‘This isn’t fair, this a kid who deserves the fairy-tale ending,’ ” he said. “Then, seeing him back with the team, I realized we did get the fairy-tale ending.

“He’s alive.”

The man had known Michelle Zipp for only a few months, but he already knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

So after learning that his 31-year-old fiancee had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, the smitten Pennsylvania man decided he would do whatever it took to keep the love of his life alive.

That included exhausting his bank account and taking out loans totaling $40,000 to pay for Zipp’s cancer treatments.

But the man would eventually discover that there a problem, Bedford County District Attorney Bill Higgins said: Michelle Zipp didn’t really have cancer.

“It’s a really sad situation,” Higgins told The Washington Post. “He felt they were engaged to be married, but obviously her intentions were different.”

“What we have here is a bad person who preyed upon the heart and kind intentions of a really good person who wanted to help,” he added.

[‘Sophisticated con artist’ faked cancer for taxpayer-funded abortion]

The relationship began in October after the two were introduced by a mutual friend. Higgins said he isn’t sure exactly when Zipp’s ruse began, but the prosecutor believes it was easier to maintain because the couple didn’t see each other often.

“Most of the relationship was conducted through text messaging and email and phone calls,” he said. “It doesn’t appear they spent a lot of time together.”

Higgins said Zipp persuaded the man — whose name has not been released by authorities — to take out loans to help her pay for the surgeries that she said she desperately needed. At one point, NBC affiliate WJAC reported, the man transferred more than $6,000 to Zipp at a local Walmart through money grams.

To keep the lie alive during the couple’s four-month-long relationship, Higgins said Zipp manufactured characters over text.

“She even sent him text messages from a reported nurse who was treating her to give him updates on her health status,” the prosecutor said. “She went to great lengths to perpetrate this lie.”

Higgins said one of the deceitful texts from the nurse who didn’t exist informed the victim that his girlfriend was in a medically induced coma. That same day, WJAC reported, Zipp was pulled over by a state trooper, proving that she was conscious enough to operate a vehicle.

“She even gave him the name of the hospital she was staying at and gave him a lot of details,” Higgins said. “She told him that if she didn’t get the money for these surgeries she would die.”

“She exploited him with romance,” he added.

Zipp is being represented by Bedford County public defender Lucas Kelleher.

“She was arrested under a bizarre set of circumstances, however, we have yet to receive the discovery materials — the paper documentation for her case,” Kelleher said. “These are only allegations at this point and she maintains her innocence.”

[Students rushed to help a coach who said he had cancer. Then they learned his story was a lie.]

Higgins said he didn’t know what caused the woman’s boyfriend to become suspicious about her alleged condition. By the time he did and reported Zipp to police, Higgins said, it didn’t take investigators long to unravel her story.

“Police reached out to the hospital where Zipp claimed she was receiving treatment to determine if she was a patient and her story quickly unraveled from there.”

Higgins said Zipp is charged with theft by deception, which amounts to creating a false impression to rob an unsuspecting victim. The charge is a first-degree felony that is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison, Higgins said.

Zipp was arrested last week and was released from jail after posting a $50,000 bail.

Higgins said his office sees more online scams targeting victims’ bank accounts, but he’s never encountered a case in which someone manufactured a relationship to steal money.

“People are getting more creative in how they try to trick others into giving them money,” he said. “I’ve never had one exactly like this, where someone played up an illness that didn’t exist.”

AT&T on Thursday announced an expanded version of its unlimited data plan that does not require an additional subscription to a pay-TV service.

The new unlimited plan is aimed at competing with similar offerings recently announced by Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. A single line will cost $100 a month, with the second and third lines each costing an additional $40 per month. For a four-person household, the plan will cost $55 per line for the first two months, and $45 per line every month thereafter.

AT&T's pricing is comparable to what Verizon unveiled on Monday. Customers who consume a lot of data very quickly — more than 22 GB, according to AT&T — will still risk having their plans slowed down by the carrier.

Previously, AT&T's offer of unlimited data was restricted to those who also agreed to purchase a subscription to AT&T's pay-TV services, U-verse or DirecTV; now, however, it appears that the required bundling will be dropped.

Spurred on by T-Mobile, which now advertises only its unlimited data plan, the rest of the wireless industry has moved swiftly to adapt.

Verizon was the last of the four major carriers to offer an unlimited plan, but it also came with the fewest restrictions on how Americans could consume streaming media. For example, it allows streaming in high definition by default, whereas the three other U.S. carriers incentivize or in some cases require content such as online videos to be viewed in lower quality, in an effort to reduce the load on their networks. (At the same time, reducing video quality can help prevent reaching the high-consumption threshold that may trigger a reduction in speeds.)

Separately, some of AT&T's cellular customers on Thursday said they had begun receiving notifications on their smartphones concerning DirecTV Now, AT&T's Internet-only television service. The marketing reminded customers that any video consumption of DirecTV Now that occurred over AT&T's data network will not count against monthly data caps.

Dorie Greenspan’s Cheesy-Bacony Quick Bread. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)

Greetings from Paris, where I’m pondering time, friendship, early-evening drinks and cheese bread.

I’m in Paris a whole less than I’m in New York, yet I see my French friends a whole lot more. It’s not that I prefer the French set. It’s not even that I’m more gadabout here. Nope, I think it’s because there are so many more opportunities to see friends in Paris, and they’re all built into the rhythm of the day.

In addition to breakfast, lunch and dinner, there are three other let’s-get-together moments:

Pre-work. The cafés open before the crack of dawn, and sharing the first coffee of the day with a friend at your regular place is simple. (My husband and our friend, Bernard, meet five days a week at the Petit Suisse, where the waiters start making their espressos as they see them coming down the street.)

At about 4 p.m. for goûter. While the word “goûter” is pretty much reserved these days for kids’ afterschool snacks, the practice of stopping for something sweet continues among adults, giving all of us grown-ups a kind of bonus: the chance to see friends and to be indulgent.

“L’heure de l’apéro.” The cocktail hour.

Apéro really is just about an hour, but it needn’t be cocktails that are served. Most often, the beverage is wine and the accompaniment is something nibbly: a tasty tide-you-over tidbit that will hush tummy rumbles yet leave room for a meal (which usually doesn’t begin until 8 or later).

The go-along might be something as plain as salted nuts, a few slices of dried sausage or cherry tomatoes (a big French favorite that I don’t fully understand), or it might be a kind of cheese bread, a member of the “cake salé,” or savory cake, family. (Yes, the French say “cake”; they use the word for almost anything baked in a loaf pan.)

In France, such a bread makes for a nice before-dinner nibble. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)

I had my first cheese bread about a decade ago in Reims, the champagne capital of France, and I’ve been a faithful fan ever since. Essentially a quick bread, meaning that it gets its rise from baking powder, not yeast, the cheese bread is hardly a light little nothing. Rather, it’s a substantial loaf that, when cut into slender fingers or snackable cubes, is just the right thing with a glass of white wine or, yes, champagne.

Although the bread comes in as many varieties as there are cheeses, the one I make most often uses those not-at-all French classics, cheddar and Gouda, as well as bacon, walnuts, very untraditional apple and, for a surprise, cumin. I like to pack as much texture into the bread as I can, so I make the batter with grated cheddar and small chunks of Gouda; the cheddar melts into the bread completely, and the Gouda half-melts and half keeps its form. As for the cumin, it’s a new addition chez me, one I adopted after having Gouda that was made with cumin seed.

Takeaway tips

●The bread is the kind of thing a resourceful French cook would make with whatever cheese was left over at the end of the week. This means that although you should respect the proportions of the recipe, you can go your own way with the cheese. Pick one you can grate for the batter, then choose whatever you’d like for the chunky add-in.

● I use ground cumin in the bread; it’s an ingredient I always have on hand. But you can use cumin seeds, if you prefer. You could even go halfsies, using some ground cumin in the batter and some seeds along with the mix-ins.

● When you’re combining the wet and dry ingredients, take it easy. There’s no need to get a perfect blend, because you’ll soon be stirring in the cheese cubes and their mates. With quick breads, undermixing beats overmixing.

● Cajole the batter into the corners of the pan — it’s a thick, unusually spongy batter, and you’ll need to nudge it into place — and don’t give much thought to smoothing the top.

When you slide the bread into the oven, pop some white wine into the refrigerator. By the time the bread bakes and cools, it’ll be “l’heure de l’apéro” and you’ll be on top of it. Cheers!

John McCain is increasingly mad as hell about President Trump. And on Friday, he went after Trump — hard.

During a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, the Republican senator from Arizona delivered a pointed and striking point-by-point takedown of Trump's worldview and brand of nationalism. McCain didn't mention Trump's name once, but he didn't have to.

And even considering the two men's up-and-down history and the terrible things Trump has said about McCain, it was a striking display from a senior leader of a party when it comes to a president of the same party.

In his speech, McCain suggested the Western world is uniquely imperiled this year — even more so than when Barack Obama was president — and proceeded to question whether it will even survive.

“In recent years, this question would invite accusations of hyperbole and alarmism; not this year,” McCain said. “If ever there were a time to treat this question with a deadly seriousness, it is now.”

[Trump’s war with the media isn’t new. Thomas Jefferson railed about ‘newspaper lies,’ too.]

In case there was any doubt that this was about Trump. Here's what followed:

"[The founders of the Munich conference] would be alarmed by an increasing turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood and race and sectarianism.”

“They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see towards immigrants and refugees and minority groups -- especially Muslims.”

“They would be alarmed by the growing inability -- and even unwillingness -- to separate truth from lies.”

"They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent."

That's Trump, Trump, Trump and Trump.

McCain continued: “But what would alarm them most, I think, is a sense that many of our peoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the West, that they see it as a bad deal that we may be better off without, and that while Western nations still have the power to maintain our world order, it's unclear whether we have the will.”

Trump has repeatedly suggested a desire to pull out of or scale back on international involvement and agreements. His slogan is “America first,” after all. And it's not just on free trade: It's also when it comes to things like NATO, the transatlantic military alliance that Trump has suggested the United States is getting a bad deal on and has flirted with not enforcing.

Then McCain invoked some of those close to Trump and emphasized that his message won't square with theirs:

I know there is profound concern across Europe and the world that America is laying down the mantle of global leadership. I can only speak for myself, but I do not believe that that is the message you will hear from all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend. That's not the message you heard today from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. That is not the message you will hear from Vice President Mike Pence. That's not the message you will hear from Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. And that is certainly not the message you will hear tomorrow from our bipartisan congressional delegation.

McCain then concluded with another direct shot at Trump.

“I refuse to accept that our values are morally equivalent to those of our adversaries,” he said. “I am a proud, unapologetic believer in the West, and I believe we must always, always stand up for it. For if we do not, who will?

Two weeks ago, you may recall, Trump suggested the United States didn't exactly have the moral high ground on Russia. Asked by Fox News host Bill O'Reilly about wanting good relations with a “killer” like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump demurred.

“There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers,” Trump said. “Well, you think our country is so innocent?”

Ever since, it seems, he and McCain have been on a collision course. McCain didn't fight back when Trump questioned his war-hero status long ago — perhaps because both men were trying to win elections — but the battle between McCain and the White House is picking up steam.

And on Friday, McCain traveled across the Atlantic to deliver a calculated, planned attack on Trump's entire system of beliefs.

Stephen Miller’s authoritarian declaration: Trump’s national security actions ‘will not be questioned’A dance instructor from Sterling has been charged with having an inappropriate relationship with a female student and possessing child pornography, Fairfax County police said Friday.

Chase Clark Peklo, 19, was arrested after someone from the Adrenaline Dance Studio in McLean reported Peklo, police said.

The preliminary investigation revealed Peklo was communicating in an inappropriate way with a 13-year-old girl and two 14-year-old girls between December 2015 and November 2016, police said.

Police allege Peklo also had a sexual relationship with one of the girls when she was 14.

Peklo has been charged with carnal knowledge of a child between 13 and 15 and five counts of possessing child pornography.

Peklo was also a dance instructor at the Stage Door studio in Manassas.

Police said they think there might be other victims and would like to hear from anyone who may be concerned that their child had inappropriate contact with Peklo.

To find out we talked with eight political independents about their reasons for disapproving of Trump so early in his term and asked them whether they’re holding out any optimism going forward.

Across the interviews, independents shared a concern that Trump acts too quickly or erratically. Several also said that even if they did not agree with him, Trump was attempting to fulfill what he promised during the campaign.

(Note: The interviews are qualitative in nature and not statistically representative of all independents as a scientific survey, but they provide a more granular look at the real people behind those commonly cited statistics.)

Here's a closer look at how each of them viewed Trump.

Tom Barnett, an independent from Binghamton, N.Y., said he disapproves of Trump but not strongly, feeling the newly elected president is acting too quickly on some policies. “Sure you make promises, but he’s moving way too fast,” Barnett said. On the travel ban, Barnett said: “I think it’s too quick; he should have looked more into it. And deporting a lot of these people; I don’t think that’s right. Even if they did make a mistake in their lives.”

The 51-year-old Barnett also has problems with Trump’s media habits and temperament. “What the hell is he doing on Twitter and watching cable TV all the time?” he asked. “I don’t want a president watching cable TV all the time! That’s my job!”

“He’s got very thin skin,” Barnett said, “He can dish it out, but he can’t take it.”

--

Neville Braithwaite of Queens, N.Y., has been trying to give Trump a chance, but he said he is skeptical. “How are we supposed to trust him if they’re going to lie to us?” he asked about the Trump administration. He is somewhat disapproving of Trump’s overall performance and said trust issues have “cast a real shadow on the whole administration.”

“At least he’s keeping his word” on campaign promises, Braithwaite, 49, said. As a New York City resident, he has fond memories of Trump always “able to get things done, even with all the B.S. around him.”

When it comes to George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Braithwaite appreciated that both presidents kept their promises to the people. However, he said he sees Trump as “such a wild card,” and he’s not sure what to expect.

--

Minneapolis-area mechanic Matthew Umsted, an independent who disapproved of Obama, sees Trump as a different type of president who might shake up a government he sees as “extremely corrupt.” “He’s a celebrity in my opinion, not a politician.”

But Umsted said he disapproves somewhat of Trump’s first weeks. “I don’t think he’s off to the best start,” he said, mentioning Trump’s seven-country travel ban as one policy that bothered him. “Is he taking account people’s lives? Generalizing everyone as a bad person if they’re not born in the U.S.”

While the 24 year-old did not criticize Trump as sharply as others we talked to, he was pessimistic about the path forward. “I think he’s attempting to get stuff done, but there’s no progress, and I don’t think there will be.” Lamenting a political system that revolves around money, Umsted said Trump is “trying to improve it for himself and his class.”

--

Stuart Dudley, an independent from Washington, N.C., said he disapproves somewhat of Trump’s performance so far. “It’s been one cluster after another,” the 69-year old said. “[They’re] trying to do away with [the Affordable Care Act], and they don’t have anything in place.”

He’s concerned about other issues as well. “Everything from our dealings with other countries, Mexico, illegal immigrants, trying to ban Muslims who are associated with countries where there have been no terrorists. I don’t think it’s been handled very well.” Dudley continued: “I think some of what he wants to do is illegal.”

To counter a lack of governmental experience, Dudley “was hoping [Trump] would surround himself with good people and rely on them.” But Dudley said he doesn’t think Trump has helped himself much with his chosen appointees: “Steve Bannon and the other ones. I just think they’re too radical in their whole way of thinking.”

But there are a few places where Dudley said he holds out hope that Trump will make a positive difference: “Job creation … and favorable tax things for small businesses.” And, he noted, “the stock market is up and fuel prices are down.” And Dudley has good things to say about the vice president: “I think Mike Pence is great. I think he’d make a much better president than Donald Trump would think. … He [is] a good, levelheaded, calming influence in the Trump administration.”

Looking back at the George W. Bush administration, Dudley said the Republican president did some good, despite bringing the country into a war he disagreed with. “I think [Bush] handled 9/11 fine. Other than that, we held an even keel there as far as the economy. We weren’t making great gains, but the deficit continued to decline,” he added, “but it did under Obama, too.”

--

John Abbott, a former math professor who lives outside Tahlequah, Okla., said he is dissatisfied with the way things are going under Trump but sees it more as “a hiccup” that will pass after Trump leaves office.

Abbott said he disagrees with many Trump policies, including what he sees as a “shortsighted immigration order,” along with building the pipeline, what he sees as “immediately kowtowing to the oil industry. I wouldn’t be surprised if we looked into his tax returns that are hiding, that he had a vested interest in those industries.” He’s also opposed to the wall Trump proposes on the Mexican border. “I’ve heard estimates of about $17 billion,” Abbott said. “To spend that kind of money building that wall, it seems like it’s really a Great Wall of Trump. And frankly, by my philosophy, we should welcome the stranger and the foreigner.”

Abbott said he sees Trump as “bigoted, misogynistic, self-righteous and puts himself above all others.” But he still said the Trump presidency is a short blip in a long time span: “He’ll make some right [decisions] and some wrong ones; we all do. But eventually it will all get sorted out.”

--

Dawn Robinson, a therapist from outside of Mobile, Ala., said she “quite strongly” disapproves of Trump. “[I’m] really unsure of what’s going to happen next. … A lot of the plans that [Trump] has are somewhat terrifying to me.” She cited Trump’s open-air discussion of a North Korean missile launch at Mar-a-Lago in proximity to members of the club. “That’s shocking to me that that could happen. It’s like a pay-per-view presidency.”

While there were few positive things she said she could think of about Trump’s presidency so far — other than that he’s trying to make good on his campaign promises — Robinson is not as flatly negative about the Bush presidency, saying she only somewhat disapproved of his time in the White House. “Obviously we had the financial crisis, that was frightening. But he started off okay.” One spot where Bush did well, according to Robinson, was with “his handling of 9/11; he helped people feel secure.”

But with Trump, the 44-year-old independent said she is scared: “He’s very impulsive, very ego driven. And it scares me, quite frankly.”

--

Pranav Prasannakumar is a college student at Hunter College in New York who disapproves strongly of Trump. “The Muslim ban,” for one example, and the lies that he said he sees coming out of the White House. “The whole 'alternative facts'? I can’t!”

“The only good thing I think about Trump are his views on repairing the infrastructure of the U.S. to create jobs, and low taxes,” he said. “But I think everything else going against American ideals.”

But that doesn’t mean the independent is opposed to all Republicans. He said he admires House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), for one: “I think Paul Ryan had a quote, what makes America great is that we share ideas, is that we debate and disagree and agree with things. That’s something that Trump lacks. He doesn’t care about any ideas that are against his.”

Even though the 21-year-old does not have strong memories of the Bush White House, Prasannakumar recollected that Bush did well not alienating Muslim Americans after 9/11, a skill that he wishes Trump held. Prasannakumar recalled: “[Bush said at the time] it’s not our Muslim brothers and sisters who are doing this, it’s the radicals, the terrorists. He really helped with unifying the country after the attack. I think that’s something he did really well.”

“We’re supposed to be a country where … we [are] welcoming people,” Prasannakumar said. “Like during the Holocaust, turning Jews away. I thought we learned from that and the Japanese internment camps. You don’t want history to repeat itself.”

Floyd Grabiel, a self-described independent but “last of the Rockefeller Republicans,” said he disapproves strongly of Trump. “It’s chaotic, it’s frightening,” he said of the transition period. “He’s packed his administration with Goldman Sachs and Wall Street people, he seems to have absolutely no idea what diplomacy means. … Every day there’s something new that bothers me about the guy.”

But Grabiel said he doesn’t think the same of all Republicans. The Edina, Minn., resident disagrees with comparisons of Trump to former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura; "[Ventura] also had a huge ego and was very thin-skinned, but he was a pretty decent governor because he knew what he didn’t know; he surrounded himself with great people.”

Trump, on the other hand, “thinks he knows it all and that’s a dangerous attitude to have.” To Grabiel, Ventura understood his limitations. “He didn’t upset the apple cart … and did a confident job as the executive of the state,” he said. “I have no reason to believe Trump will be the same kind of executive.”

“I love the country,” 70-year-old Grabiel concluded. “And I’m worried about it.”Be the first to know about new stories from PowerPost. Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published.

National Guard memo is ‘reminiscent of what led up to World War II,’ a top House Democrat says

Michael Kahn, longtime artistic director of Shakespeare Theatre Company, will leave that position after the 2018-2019 season. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)

On any given night, in the houses that Michael Kahn built, you could find yourself transported to Illyria or Bohemia, to Dunsinane or Athens. Next to you might be seated a justice of the Supreme Court or an accountant from Gaithersburg or an English teacher from Manassas — all slaking their classical thirsts.

Up on the stages of his Shakespeare Theatre Company, you were apt to encounter actors, nationally known or locally grown, scratching the same itch. One month it could be Stacy Keach in “King Lear” or Charlayne Woodard in “The Taming of the Shrew”; another it might be Nancy Robinette in a drama by Oscar Wilde or Tom Story in a comedy by Richard Brinsley Sheridan.

They, and you, have Kahn to thank for setting iambic pentameter to a Washington beat; for expanding by some impressive magnitude the District’s appreciation of Shakespeare and a slew of other playwrights of antiquity, the Renaissance, the Spanish Golden Age and beyond. A diet hewing to a Western palate, to be sure, but also one that often tried to extend the menu and expand the table of dramatic possibility. For that, the region owes this proud, cosmopolitan man of insight and taste its warmest congratulations.

[Michael Kahn comes to Washington]

Kahn revealed last week that he will be relinquishing his artistic directorship of the company at the end of the 2018-2019 season, an announcement that reduces by one major figure the number of Founding Fathers (and Mothers) running the region’s stages. Among the major companies, only Howard Shalwitz and Eric Schaeffer, both a generation or so younger than Kahn, remain. And yet, given the distance Washington theater has traveled since Kahn arrived in 1986, his departure won’t be quite the seismic event it might have been, even a few short years ago. Yes, for sentimental and, certainly, artistic reasons, the change at the top of the company will have a sizable impact. But because Washington has matured into a theater town with such a variegated constellation of companies, creating and presenting drama in every category, there’s little worry that on a personnel level, the inspirational vacuum can’t be filled.

[Michael Kahn plots his Shakespeare Theatre exit for 2019]

Except, perhaps, at the very company Kahn will leave behind. As Nelson Pressley reported last week in these pages, Kahn has vowed to bequeath to the next artistic director a fiscally sound organization, with its accounts in order. But any longtime patron of the company, observing how the quality of its seasons has taken a hit over the past several years, has to be concerned about what has been sacrificed in the efforts to juggle programming in its two spaces, its longtime home in the Lansburgh Theatre on Seventh Street NW, and, since 2007, its larger, grander theater, the $89 million, 775-seat Sidney Harman Hall on F Street.

A perusal of the selections made so far for the 2017-18 season reveals how conservative the company’s programming has grown. Where once it regularly ventured into daring terrain, producing some of the thorniest plays of Shakespeare, and uncovering some of the forgotten treasures of the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages, the titles now suggest that it is making a conscious choice to lead from behind. The Shakespeares in the offing are default, brand-name titles: “Hamlet” and “Twelfth Night,” with a third, “Othello,” revived as the summer Free-for-All entry. A visiting production from Ireland, Samuel Beckett’s absurdist masterpiece, “Waiting for Godot,” is another scheduled war horse, along with a revival of — wait for it — Lerner and Loewe’s 1960 King Arthur musical, “Camelot.”

The one unconventional selection (with a sixth show still to be named) is a double bill of Harold Pinter one-acts, “The Collection” and “The Lover,” directed, tellingly, by Kahn, who of late has been directing more and more at other theaters around town, although he will also stage the company’s “Hamlet.” Still, for an organization that declares that its vision is “to ignite a dialogue that connects the universality of classic works to our shared human experience in the modern world,” it’s hard to see where the ignition occurs with a stolid musical that’s regularly performed by community groups and high school drama clubs everywhere.

It’s only been since the addition of Harman Hall that the company has been thumbing through Broadway songbooks to beef up its box office; recently, “The Secret Garden” was the decidedly nonclassical choice for this classical theater. “Kiss Me, Kate” and “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” have cropped up at the Shakespeare, as well. It’s a far cry from the more inventive crops the company used to harvest, through its own exciting commissions, such as an adaptation by John Strand of the French “closet play” “Lorenzaccio,” or, as recently as four years ago, a twin bill of Friedrich Schiller’s “Wallenstein,” in a new translation by Robert Pinsky, with a production of “Coriolanus.”

And although an inspired production can still materialize, such as the just-opened “King Charles III,” co-produced with two West Coast companies, informed spectators are sure to notice that exceptional programming is now the rare exception. Whoever is to succeed the estimable Kahn will have to think long and hard with the board and business side of the organization about whether the now 10-year-long experience of running Shakespeare as a two-theater behemoth, with a total of more than 1,200 seats to fill, is a burden or a blessing.

The company needs to be on its guard because, pound for pound, it is being eclipsed for ingenuity and nimbleness by its crosstown colleagues at Folger Theatre, which these days has become, with a shorter schedule, the go-to local troupe for classical innovation. The visits by scrappy up-and-comers such as Fiasco Theatre, as well as overseas visitors such as Shakespeare’s Globe and local playwright-directors such as Aaron Posner, have given Folger an unmatched imaginative momentum.

One can look back appreciatively, of course, on many one-of-a-kind classical offerings Kahn championed, in the conviction that he was cultivating a local audience that would itself grow ever more sophisticated. I think of the superior comedies, among them, his staging of Ben Jonson’s “The Silent Woman” and Shakespeare’s “Love’s Labor’s Lost,” as well as Keith Baxter’s direction of Sheridan’s “The Rivals.” High points too, were Kahn’s teamwork with dramatist playwright David Ives on adaptations of “The Liar” and “The Heir Apparent” as were the work of Rebecca Bayla Taichman on her Italian holiday of a “Taming of the Shrew,” Douglas Wager on a “Comedy of Errors” redolent of Hollywood back lots and Ethan McSweeny, via a heart-stopping “The Persians.”

A mile-long parade of notable actors has marched through with distinction: among them, David Sabin, Floyd King, Franchelle Stewart Dorn, Patrick Page, Michael Hayden, Holly Twyford, Patrick Stewart, John Hurt, Elizabeth Ashley, Bruce Dow, Suzanne Bertish, Andrew Long, Tana Hicken, Finn Wittrock, Edward Gero, Philip Goodwin, and on and on and on.

That’s what you call a legacy. As Kahn graciously paves the way for his successor, let’s hope the company finds the wisdom — and the Will — to preserve the best of it.

Government Accountability Office Comptroller General Gene Dodaro testifies before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in 2009. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)

Gene Dodaro enjoys rare status.

He’s a general but doesn’t wear a uniform. As the comptroller general of the United States, Dodaro is one of the few top government officials whose work is routinely praised by both parties in Congress.

That’s not just because he heads the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a legislative agency that often is called the congressional watchdog. It’s also not because the soft-spoken Dodaro cuts an impressive figure with his remarkable command of facts that he rattles off without notes at Capitol Hill hearings.

GAO reports are welcome on the Hill, because they give elected officials lots of information for their oversight of federal agencies. Politicians can use that to breathlessly bash their favorite bureaucratic targets with over-the-top oratory that contrasts sharply with GAO’s boring, objective style.

Every two years, at the beginning of a congressional term, GAO provides something for everyone in Congress. It’s the high-risk list that covers serious issues with programs all across the government. This year’s list is almost 700 pages long and is scheduled for release at House and Senate hearings on Wednesday. Much of it is deadly dull but important, nonetheless. Here’s a look.

First the good news.

“Since GAO’s last high-risk update, many of the 32 high-risk areas on the 2015 list have shown solid progress,” the 2017 report says. “Twenty-three high-risk areas, or two-thirds of all the areas, have met or partially met all five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List.”

But that’s not the only way to view it.

“Since the 2015 list, “only one program was removed. Three programs have been added,” Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said in remarks prepared for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. “More concerning, six areas have been listed by GAO as ‘high risk’ since the report’s inception 27 years ago.”

Once an agency gets on the list, it’s not easy to get off. GAO looks at five criteria: leadership commitment, agency capacity, an action plan, monitoring efforts and demonstrated progress.

GAO’s prescription for agency success: “Perseverance by the executive branch in implementing GAO’s recommended solutions and continued oversight and action by Congress are essential to achieving greater progress.”

Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) called the report “a roadmap of sorts for this committee, helping us focus on the highest priority items” in remarks planned for his panel’s hearing.

Terrorism is a high priority, and GAO has encouraging information on that front. Managing terrorism-related information is the only area removed from the list since 2015.

“Significant progress had been made to strengthen how intelligence on terrorism, homeland security, and law enforcement is shared among federal, state, local, tribal, international, and private sector partners,” according to GAO.

Health care for veterans was added to the list in 2015, and it remains an area needing “substantive attention,” GAO said. The Department of Veterans Affairs developed an action plan to address problems, but GAO found the plan has “overly ambitious deadlines for completion,” and lacks a thorough analysis of the issues, clear metrics to gauge progress and the resources needed for success.

GAO’s list now has 34 items, including these three new areas:

Federal environmental liabilities: The government is financially responsible for cleaning places where federal activities contaminated the environment, according to GAO. “Because of the lack of complete information and the often inconsistent approach to making cleanup decisions, federal agencies cannot always address their environmental liabilities in ways that maximize the reduction of health and safety risks to the public and the environment in a cost-effective manner.” Since 1994, 13 of 28 GAO recommendations in this area have not been implemented.

Management of Indian programs: The departments of the Interior and of Health and Human Services “have ineffectively administered Indian education and health care programs and inefficiently developed Indian energy resources. Thirty-nine of 41 previous GAO recommendations on this issue remain unimplemented.”

The 2020 census: It costs a lot to count. At $12.3 billion, the 2010 census was the most expensive ever and 31 percent costlier than the 2000 count. The Census Bureau has extensive plans, including greater use of technology, for the 2020 count that also “raise serious concerns about the Bureau’s ability to conduct a cost-effective enumeration.” The bureau has implemented six of 30 GAO recommendations since 2014.

Johnson said the 2020 Census could cost as much as $17.8 billion.

“At that price, the Census would cost $124 per household to administer, compared to just $16 per household in 1970 in inflation-adjusted terms,” he said. “This is inexplicable; it should be getting cheaper to count our population in the digital age, not more expensive.”

Click here to see a complete listing.Vice President Mike Pence and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday offered dueling assessments of the troubled transatlantic relationship, as both praised NATO but Pence made no mention of the European Union, the key economic and political pact that binds Europe together.

In back-to-back speeches at the Munich Security Conference, Merkel and Pence appeared to find common ground about NATO, whose members have been urged by President Trump to spend more on defense. But while Merkel praised the broader international organizations that have been a key part of the post-Cold War global order, Pence’s silence on the E.U. may only fuel fears among European allies that the new leadership in the White House will embrace only some aspects of European unity, while rejecting others.

On Sunday, Pence will travel to Brussels, where the European Union will command more of his attention. On Monday, he will meet with senior E.U. leaders before returning home.

Pence offered a robust embrace of U.S. security commitments to Europe, seeking to tamp down speculation that Trump would pursue a new path that would abandon guarantees that European nations feel they need to keep them safe from Russia.

“Today, tomorrow, and every day hence, be confident that the United States is now and will always be your greatest ally,” Pence said. “Be assured: President Trump and the American people are fully devoted to our transatlantic union.”

Trump has repeatedly called NATO “obsolete,” but U.S. officials in Europe this week, including Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, appear to be concentrating more on pushing allies to meet NATO defense spending commitments rather than focusing on Trump’s desire for a new relationship with the Kremlin, a major fear in Europe. Many European allies see Russia as a security threat following its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

Pence was critical of what he called the “Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force.” He called for quelling the conflict in Ukraine by adhering to the Minsk Agreements, a 2015 plan that sets out a road map for peace.

But — underscoring the beliefs of his boss, who many in Washington and Europe believe has been too cozy toward Russia — Pence also sought to strike a balance, hinting at signs of a possible partnership between the two nations.

“And know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found,” Pence said.

The thorny issue of Russia has clouded Trump’s young presidency, amid reports that Michael Flynn, his national security adviser who resigned Monday, improperly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office, and that Trump staffers and associates repeatedly communicated with senior Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 presidential campaign.

In a bid to reach out to the countries with the most at stake for any U.S.-Russian rapprochement, Pence is expected to meet Saturday with the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

In the 20-minute speech to the Munich gathering, Pence echoed Trump’s call for NATO countries to meet their full finance commitments to the alliance.

“Let me be clear on this point: The president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word, to fulfill this commitment, and for most, that means the time has come to do more,” Pence said — a line that was met with only light applause.

Only four NATO nations apart from the United States meet alliance guidelines to spend 2 percent of their annual economic output on defense, a trend Pence said was problematic.

“The promise to share the burden of our defense has gone unfulfilled for too many for too long and it erodes the very foundation of our alliance,” he said. “When even one ally fails to do their part, it undermines all of our ability to come to each other’s aid.”

Speaking immediately before Pence, Merkel sought to quiet rising voices in Europe that say that the continent should prepare to turn away from Trump’s United States and embrace partners such as China. She said that even as Europe strengthens its own defense capabilities, it will never be able to fight terrorism without the United States.

“The challenges of this world today cannot be mastered by one state alone. It needs a cooperative effort. We need to forge ahead with multilateral structures. We have to strengthen them,” Merkel said. “Let me address this very openly. The Europeans alone cannot cope with fighting international Islamist terrorism. We also need the support of the United States.”

But she also pushed for an approach that does not alienate Muslim allies, a fear that has spiked following Trump’s rhetoric about Muslims and his attempts to impose a travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries.

“Cooperation with the United States is very important to us. But what’s also important to us is that Islamic states have been incorporated into this coalition,” she said, referring to efforts to combat the Islamic State.

“Only this way will we be able to convince people that it is not Islam that is the problem but a falsely understood Islam.”

National Guard memo is ‘reminiscent of what led up to World War II,’ a top House Democrat says

(Photo by HomeVisit) Although the house retains period features such as heart of pine floors, dentil moldings and elegantly carved fireplace mantels, it lives like a modern home with an open flow.

Over the years, this early Georgian house on a crest of a hill in Fairfax has continually reinvented itself, changing its looks and changing its name, but retaining its essential character.

Around 1750, on what was known as the old Ravensworth tract, William Fitzhugh built a three-bedroom farmhouse called Aspen Grove because of the surrounding aspen and locust trees. The house was made of broken, untrimmed stone with brick quoined corners and brick chimneys.

[A look inside the D.C.-area’s most expensive homes for sale]

William Sagar bought the home in 1855. Sagar was a prominent Fairfax resident who donated land for the first public school in Fairfax County. As a Northerner and a Quaker, he strongly opposed slavery. It is said that the house was used as a station on the Underground Railroad.

During the Civil War, the Sagars were forced to abandon the home, and soldiers from both sides occupied it. A research paper written by Wendy Nicholas on Aspen Grove described “great quaking aspen trees surrounding the house . . . were well carved with the initials and identification of military units of the Union and Confederate soldiers who were stationed in the area.”

One soldier apparently lingers. Like many old houses, Aspen Grove has its own ghost. According to legend, a Union soldier heard noises in the middle of the night and ran outside, leaving his boots behind. He was killed and now returns to search the home for his boots. HGTV was so intrigued by the story and the house that the cable television network featured both on its show “If Walls Could Talk.”

“We’ve heard funny noises from time to time, but nothing spooky or strange,” said Betsy Rutkowski, the owner and listing agent. “It makes a fun story, though.”



(Photo by HomeVisit) The kitchen is one of the many rooms in the home that has been updated.

The Sagars returned to the home, which had been left in ruin. It was stripped of trim both inside and outside, the central chimney destroyed and bricks stolen. They rebuilt the home, stuccoing over the stone, and their heirs lived there until William S. Earle bought it in 1920 and renamed it Montague Farms.

Earle made substantial changes to the house and grounds. He expanded the home, rerouted the central stairway and made the fireplace openings smaller and added hand-carved mantels. He removed the cupola and replaced the wood-shingle roof with a copper one. He cut down the aspen trees and put in an English boxwood garden.

When Samuel and Gladys Stoneburner purchased the home in 1959, they changed the front entrance from the north to the east side and added four columns to hold up a stately portico.

Despite all the changes, some of the home’s noteworthy features remain — such as the honey-colored heart of pine floors, the 10-foot ceilings with dentil moldings and the elegantly carved fireplace mantels.

Because of all its modifications, the house is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but it is part of the Historic American Buildings Survey inventory.

The four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 3,038-square-foot home is listed at $1,075,000. An open house is scheduled for Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.

Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on June 22, 2016. (Alex Brandon/AP)

The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus said Friday that reports that the Trump administration had considered deploying tens of thousands of National Guard troops to apprehend undocumented immigrants were “outrageous” and “very reminiscent of what led up to World War II.”

Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) made the statement in an interview for C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program shortly after the Associated Press broke news of the draft Department of Homeland Security memo.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the memo was “not a White House document” and that “there is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.”

But Crowley said “seeing these kind of actions . . . even being talked about” was alarming.

“Using the National Guard, the Army, to come into our communities, to police our communities, to disrupt and to gather people up for the purpose of deporting them, is a very, very scary thing,” he said. “It’s not a country that I’m familiar with called the United States. It’s not how we conduct ourselves. We see that happen in other countries that aren’t as free and aren’t as open as we are to welcoming immigrants. We welcome immigrants. We want the best, the brightest and the bravest. . . . And now they’re under fear that armed [men], you know, with M-16 rifles, come to your door and break it down and leave your children who are American citizens there but take you and deport you.”

Pressed on the comparison to the run-up to World War II — a reference that could easily be interpreted as a reference to Nazi Germany — Crowley backed off only slightly: “I think we have to always look at our past and look at the history of the world, to put into context where we are today. I’m not describing and saying this is like Germany per se, or making any comparison to Nazis or anything else. What I’m saying is that we as a people have to be concerned about the use of our military to usurp the authority of our police departments. When anyone is suggesting that, that is something to be very, very concerned about.”

The remarks on the immigration order came amid a wide-ranging interview in which Crowley repeatedly expressed concern about President Trump, about his alleged ties to and apparent sympathies for Russia and about whether congressional Republicans will provide checks on his administration.

“When the president omits the mentioning of the Jewish people in the Holocaust remembrance and there’s not a peep from a Republican member of the House? That’s disturbing,” Crowley said, noting that Democrats attempted to bring a resolution to the House floor addressing the omission. “They refused to take that up. They dismiss it. The president continues to dismiss it. That’s not going away. . . . I think they’re tremendously scared of him.”

At other points, Crowley accused Trump and members of his administration of “lying to the American people over and over again” and said the next four years will be “very, very rocky, if he gets to four years.”

Crowley spoke a week after House Democrats met in Baltimore to lick their wounds after losing the presidency and failing to win the House majority for the fourth consecutive election cycle. He acknowledged that “there was a good bit of soul-searching going on” at the policy retreat and that, “even a few months after the election, we’re still finding our way.”

But Crowley said the onus was on Trump and Republicans, given their control of Washington, to approach Democrats about finding a governing consensus, and he said Trump’s actions after one month in office had given Democrats little reason to work with Trump to get things done.

He made reference to a string of Sunday talk-show appearances last week by presidential adviser Stephen Miller, who said in a CBS interview that “the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.”

Crowley took sharp exception to that claim.

“Everything will be questioned,” he said. “By the legislative branch — Democrats right now, and hopefully Republican colleagues — and by the judiciary. Everything will be questioned, so they must erase that from their minds. But if, in the end, Republicans come about to actually take up this cause, it’s good for America, and that’s what we’re driving them towards.”

This week, President Trump’s first solo news conference since taking the presidency was fodder for late-night television. But that’s just an extension of what we’ve seen since he took office. Under Trump and press secretary Sean Spicer, the near-daily White House news briefings have changed from routine interactions with a professional press corps to a high-profile media spectacle. The briefings frequently beat soap operas in daytime TV ratings and have been immortalized on “Saturday Night Live.” While that’s a shift away from normal U.S. politics, it resembles Russian President Vladimir Putin’s media strategy.

[Republicans used to fear Russia. Here’s what they think now.]

Under Putin, the Kremlin has built a media empire centered around the idea of information as entertainment. Access to the president is limited to circuslike news conferences attended primarily by regime supporters who ask the president softball questions. The most recent of these conferences, held in December, included questions about stray animals, chess and kvass, a traditional drink made from fermented bread. One reporter even asked Putin how it felt to be “the most influential person in the world.”

These news conferences offer the facade of genuine dialogue and the illusion of freedom of the press while giving the president the tools to control the political dialogue and distract the media from important issues.

[Trump’s war on the news media is serious. Just look at Latin America.]

What might the Russian example tell us about the White House’s communications strategy?

Transparency is not always transparent

One noticeable change to the White House press briefings is that Trump and Spicer are giving priority to conservative and non-mainstream news outlets, allowing questions first from such places as Lifezette, Breitbart, Christian Broadcasting and Newsmax before turning to the Associated Press, CBS or CNN. As Spicer said in an interview with Fox News, “There are voices and issues that the mainstream media sometimes doesn’t capture, and it’s important for those issues to get as much prominence as some of the mainstream ones.”

By framing these shifted priorities as expanding access, the Trump administration wants to portray these changes as increasing transparency. Increasing the number of news outlets with access to the White House, however, does not necessarily translate into more transparency. Rather, it reduces the platform given to professional journalists who have the resources to hold the government accountable to the people.

All that can be seen in Putin’s annual news conference. There, more than a thousand reporters from around the country and abroad vie for Putin’s attention. This carefully orchestrated event is populated primarily by state-owned and pro-state news outlets who ask easy questions to grab Putin’s attention and avoid hard-hitting questions aimed at upholding norms of presidential transparency. Professional, independent journalists are pushed aside to reduce the possibility of opposition and challenge.

Politics as a show

In the Kremlin’s portrayal, these news conferences are when the president can speak directly with ordinary Russians, discussing their concerns. But in fact, they are a political show in which a well-known public figure holds court, delivering his views of domestic politics and world events in a controlled setting.

[Can the courts protect democracy? Yes, but they need these three supports.]

It’s true that reporters are allowed to ask Putin questions. But the event itself — and the types of questions permitted — are carefully scripted. The presser typically starts with the president saying a few words about the state of the economy and mentioning highlights from the past year. Putin’s spokesman then carefully chooses questioners for the next four hours; Putin selects a few reporters toward the end. Putin and his spokesman frequently play good cop/bad cop, with Putin gently criticizing his spokesman for overlooking oppositional media. Reporters vie for the president’s attention by waving huge placards with issue buzzwords and ludicrous statements meant to grab the Putin’s attention. (One sign from the 2016 broadcast asked if there are dive bars around the Kremlin. Another showed a cartoon depicting Putin as Superman.)

Within this setting, Putin displays his wealth of knowledge, charisma and statesmanship. Putin appears relaxed, confident and jocular as he rattles off statistic after statistic (often of questionable accuracy), interrupted only by words of praise and loud applause from the audience. By keeping the attention on Putin, the event deflects attention from the serious issues that are supposed to be discussed at news conferences. It comes off less as a serious news conference and more as a celebrity-focused one-man show. As the show goes on, key questions remain unanswered.

Dissent is permitted … to a point

Although Putin’s news conferences are dominated by softball questions, they do allow critiques — to a point. Some serious and independent journalists are invited and even permitted to ask challenging questions. Putin occasionally takes a few critical questions from state-led news outlets. These questions are often lumped together or framed in a way that makes it easy for Putin to skirt, ignore or dismiss them outright. Reporters are not given the opportunity to press Putin on issues; follow-up questions are not allowed.

The purpose is simple: By allowing some form of disagreement, Putin displays his willingness to have a genuine conversation with the country and to answer tough questions — although in reality, he is keeping tight control of the political discourse and limiting the risk such questions actually pose to his regime.

[What should U.S. military leaders do if the president provokes a major international crisis?]

Russia’s example is instructive. The Kremlin keeps the appearance of a free press while actually reducing transparency. It does this by oversaturating the arena with pro-government reporters, keeping the focus on showmanship instead of content, and limiting opportunities for challenge and dissent. All this makes it harder for the press to hold the government accountable.

Workers walk outside the Boeing South Carolina Plant on Wednesday. (Randall Hill/Reuters)

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- President Trump visited a Boeing factory Friday to show off the company's newest model of the 787 Dreamliner, the latest in a series of planes that experts describe as a marvel of aeronautical engineering. The fuel-efficient construction allows the newest model to fly from London to Cape Town, South Africa, without refueling — an extraordinary distance for a 330-passenger plane.

There is one number on which the Dreamliners are still coming up short, however: return on investment. Analysts say Boeing has sunk tens of billions of dollars into designing and building the various models of the 787. Investors who have been with the project since the beginning may never fully see their money back.

“If you view it through a technology lens, it’s a great success,” Barclays analyst Carter Copeland said. “If you view the program from its inception, it’s a big financial failure.”

[At Boeing, Trump returns to an economic message after a week of controversy]

Last year, Ronald Epstein of Bank of America came to a similar conclusion. He told investors it was unlikely Boeing would recover its investment in the 787 program, Bloomberg News reported in April. Boeing is focused on improving production and profits going forward, spokesman Chaz Bickers said.

The program, which began producing planes in 2007, has been beset by delays and mishaps. Copeland said it is “virtually impossible to imagine” that investors will recover the fair value of the roughly $50 billion he estimates Boeing has put into the Dreamliner. Epstein put the amount of the investment at $29 billion.

Boeing is not disclosing the total investment in the project, Bickers said.

“Development costs are already spent — so we now focus on how we can improve profitability on production even more from here,” Bickers wrote in an email. “We have always said that the airplane has a very bright future — and like many of our other programs, will have decades of service ahead.”

For Trump, the visit is part of an emerging strategy of helping marquee American manufacturers using media savvy, salesmanship and subsidies. Soon after his election, Trump negotiated up to $7 million in state tax credits over 10 years for the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, leading parent company United Technologies to reverse its decision to close the plant. Last week, Trump told lawmakers he wants to allow the controversial Export-Import Bank to resume subsidizing major exporters such as Boeing, breaking with conservative lawmakers who have obstructed the controversial federal agency in recent years, temporarily defunding it in 2015.

Yet economists have questioned whether Trump's dealmaking with individual firms will benefit American workers as whole, as the manufacturing industry loses jobs to automation and cheaper labor overseas.

[Boeing workers in South Carolina vote against union]

Meanwhile, despite all the cameras, bright lights and the marching band at the Boeing plant next to the Charleston International Airport on Friday, it remains to be seen whether the numbers will add up for Boeing's Dreamliner.

With the cameras trained on the president and the Boeing logo on the fuselage of the 787-10 Dreamliner behind him, Trump rattled off statistics about the plane. Then he listed each of Boeing's military aircraft, asking the audience if it thought the Air Force should buy the company's F-18 Super Hornet.

Trump had not come to sell planes, however. He was there to talk about economic policy, he told the audience. “My focus has been all about jobs, and jobs is one of the primary reasons I'm standing here today,” the president said.

“From now on, it's going to be America first,” he said. “Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish, no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach, just like you built this incredible airplane behind me,” he added.

In effect, Trump was using the bully pulpit to present what analysts describe as a money-losing investment, from a firm in part supported by federal subsidies, as an example of his approach to the economy.

In 2008, Boeing's workers went on strike for eight weeks, delaying delivery of the plane's first model. In 2013, regulators grounded the fleet of Dreamliners worldwide when one plane's battery caught fire after a commercial flight from Tokyo to Boston. The following year, Boeing announced that cracks were appearing in the wings of about 40 Dreamliners in production, forcing more delays.

Copeland said that while Boeing is not necessarily to be faulted for these issues, a project as ambitious as the Dreamliner has little tolerance for mishaps.

“Building airplanes is really, really hard, and when you mess up, it’s really, really expensive,” he said. “The amount of money that was lost to get to this point is a very, very large sum.”

Production is going smoothly now, Copeland said, and Boeing's stock might be attractive for investors considering buying into the company now that costs related to designing the airplane and managing obstacles in manufacturing are out of the way. Sales of the 787 are generating cash that the company is returning to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and a generous quarterly dividend, now worth $1.42 per share. In the long term, Boeing expects to net about $30 million in cash per plane.

[Someone big got left off the list of people in Trump’s Cabinet]

The two-engine 787 is a much smaller plane than the older, four-engine 747. Yet the 787's construction — partially made of a lightweight carbon-fiber composite instead of aluminum — allows it to fly transoceanic routes. Copeland said the new top-of-the-line 787-10 Dreamliner unveiled Friday will add to the cash flow. The catalogue price of the 787-10 Dreamliner is $306 million.

“The Boeing 787 program is going to be a great cash-generation machine for us over the next several years,” Boeing president Dennis Muilenburg told investors at a conference last week. He noted that the company has a backlog of about 700 preordered Dreamliners.

At the same time, some analysts are skeptical about the stock. While Muilenburg said that the company plans to increase production from 12 per month to about 14, Copeland and Goldman Sachs's Noah Poponak said they believe that plan is unrealistic, and that it is more likely that declining demand for the plane will soon force the company to reduce production to about 10 per month.

Boeing has been receiving about only four or five new orders a month, Poponak wrote in a note to clients this week, advising them to sell Boeing's stock.

“There are several reasons to believe demand could remain tepid,” Poponak wrote. He noted that declining oil prices reduce the demand for a fuel-efficient plane, and that Boeing now has competition from Airbus, the French manufacturer, which is developing next-generation planes of its own.

Bank of America's Epstein wrote that Boeing could expect only about $16 million in profit on each Dreamliner, about half the $30 million expected by Boeing.

Boeing spokesman Bickers confirmed that the company has not changed its forecasts for profits or the pace of production in the 787 program.

“We don't see any scenarios that would bring us below the current 12-a-month production rate,” Muilenburg told the investors. “We are very, very solid against a 12 per month production-rate skyline.”

Another asset for the company is presidential goodwill. Trump has said he wants to support American manufacturers and help U.S. companies compete with their rivals overseas.

Last week, two Democratic senators said that Trump had told them he wants to allow the Export-Import Bank — a federal agency that provides loans, guarantees and capital to U.S. firms with customers abroad — to resume its regular business. Republicans in Congress view the bank as undue interference in the economy. They have been preventing it from lending for nearly two years, first by shutting down the bank temporarily and then by refusing to appoint enough members to its board to allow the agency to act.



As of 2013, Boeing was the bank's biggest customer, receiving $8.3 billion in guarantees and other financial help. Muilenberg has argued that without that support, companies like his are at a disadvantage.

“If international customers of tractors, turbines, airplanes or satellites can’t get financing from the United States, they’ll simply take their business elsewhere to one of the dozens of other countries with similar export-credit assistance,” he said last year.Roger Gregory, right, shakes hands with Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit after Gregory was sworn in as the first black judge on the court, in Charlottesville, Va., in 2001. (Andrew Shurtleff/The Daily Progress via Associated Press)

In his 72 years, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, who was raised in segregated Richmond, acknowledges that he has seen much change, often for the better, including advances in the 1960s. But in his elegant new memoir, “All Falling Faiths: Reflections on the Promise and Failure of the 1960s,” he explains why today’s distemper was incubated in that “burnt and ravaged forest of a decade.”

He arrived at Yale University in September 1963, a year after John F. Kerry and a year before George W. Bush, “never dreaming that this great university would in many ways set the example of what education should not be.” Everything on campus became politicized, a precursor to the saturation of the larger culture. America was careening toward today’s contentiousness, as “those who rightly challenged the assumptions of others became slowly more indignant at any challenge to their own.”

As the teaching of American history became “one extended exercise in self-flagellation,” historical illiteracy grew, leading to today’s “War on Names.” Wilkinson’s book arrives as Yale, plumbing new depths of shallowness, renames Calhoun College. Yale has chosen virtue-signaling rather than teaching. It should have helped students think about the complex assessments of complicated historical figures, such as the South Carolinian who was a profound political theorist, an anti-imperialist, an accomplished statesman and a defender of slavery, a challenging compound of greatness and moral failure. Yale’s past, as Wilkinson experienced it, was prologue: “Yale itself became less a place for original thought than an intellectual inferno policed for its allegiance to the prevailing alienation.”

Disoriented by the Vietnam War, “Yale became a place of childlike clarity. I arrived at a university that asked questions; I left one that fastened a creed.” We still live with this 1960s legacy — controversy has acquired a “razor’s edge,” and “venom and vehemence” have become fashionable.

The memoir also arrives as the nation braces for another battle over a Supreme Court nominee, perhaps illustrating Wilkinson’s belief that another legacy of the 1960s is that “America’s legal culture is also terribly divided.” When he entered law school in 1968, the school’s dean said: “Laws are the great riverbanks between which society flows.” The law, the dean said, “verbalized aggression,” taming it through an adversarial system that requires each party to listen to the other’s argument.

For the Earl Warren court, Wilkinson, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, has warm words: It “opened the arteries of change, broadened the franchise, equalized access to schools and facilities, gave the common man the First Amendment, and donated to a society in turmoil its lasting gift of peaceful change.”

In addition to being an ornament to the nation’s judiciary, Wilkinson is a splendid anachronism, a gentleman raised by a father who “came to Saturday breakfast in his coat and tie” and who believed that “manners fortified man against his nature.” Wilkinson was raised in 1950s affluence: Summers were “a long queue of black-tie galas,” “luncheons in the day and debutante parties every evening.” His world was “short on ambiguity” but not on absolutes, so he grew up “anchored, fortified by constancy.”

When he went to prep school in New Jersey, his Southern accent caused a telephone operator to ask him to “speak English.” He played soccer with Dick Pershing, the grandson of Gen. John J. Pershing. Dick went to Vietnam and is buried in Arlington beside his grandfather.

But in the coarsening, embittering 1960s, Wilkinson writes, “more Americans annihilated fellow citizens in their consciousness than were slain on the field of any battle.” In a harbinger of very recent events, “the shorthaired and hard-hatted sensed that class prejudice had simply been substituted for race hatred.”

He locates the genesis of today’s politics of reciprocal resentments in “the contempt with which the young elites of the Sixties dismissed the contributions of America’s working classes.” We have reached a point where “sub-cultures begin to predominate and the power of our unifying symbols fades. We become others to ourselves.” The “insistent presentism” that became a permanent mentality in the 1960s cripples our ability to contemplate where we came from or can go. “Sometimes individuals lose, and societies gain,” Wilkinson writes. “Maybe someone’s loss of privilege is another’s gain in dignity. Perhaps there is a selfishness in every song of lament.” At this moment of pandemic vulgarity and childishness, his elegiac memoir is a precious reminder of what an adult voice sounds like.

The Trump administration’s attempts to translate the president’s hard-line campaign rhetoric on immigration into reality have run into two major roadblocks: the complexity of reshaping a sprawling immigration system and a president who has not been clear about how he wants to change it.

In his first four weeks in office, President Trump has sought to use his executive powers to punch through Washington’s legislative and bureaucratic hurdles and make quick progress on pledges to crack down on illegal immigrants and tighten border control.

But Trump has been vague about his goals and how to achieve them and his aides have struggled to interpret his orders.

The resulting turmoil has included a successful legal challenge halting his immigration travel ban, fears among congressional Republicans over the White House’s more extreme measures and widespread anxiety among immigrant communities across the country.

The latest flash point erupted Friday over reports that the Department of Homeland Security was considering mobilizing 100,000 National Guard troops to help round up millions of unauthorized immigrants in 11 states, including some such as Colorado and Oregon far from the southern border.

President Trump said at a press conference Thursday that deciding the fate of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children is “one of the most difficult subjects I have.” (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

The disclosure surprised state officials who oversee the troops and rattled immigrant rights advocates, who have accused federal authorities of exploiting fuzzy White House edicts to frighten vulnerable populations. Trump aides quickly distanced the White House from a memo that federal authorities called a “very early draft” of an implementation plan for Trump’s early executive orders that had not been seen or approved by DHS Secretary John Kelly.

“That is 100% not true,” press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters. “There is no effort at all . . . to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.”

[Trump calls the news media ‘the enemy of the American people’]

Some immigration hard-liners viewed the leak of the memo to the Associated Press, which first reported on it, as evidence that anonymous bureaucrats were intent on undermining the administration.

Trump has faced pockets of resistance within the government to his immigration orders, including the ill-fated travel ban on all refugees and on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries that former acting attorney general Sally Yates said she would not defend in court. Although Trump fired her, the order was later suspended by a federal judge.

Trump has promised to put forward a new travel ban order next week.

To border control hawks, the president’s bumpy start has fostered a sense that a White House stocked heavily with political newcomers is learning the hard way just how difficult amending immigration policies can be. Both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations unsuccessfully pursued sweeping comprehensive reform legislation that failed to win congressional approval.

Despite his “Archie Bunkerisms that he was deporting everyone” during the campaign, Trump and his aides are “still getting their sea legs on immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for lower immigration levels. “They’re starting to realize that it takes time to turn an aircraft carrier around.”

On the other side, immigrant rights advocates pointed to a series of episodes as evidence that federal agents are overstepping their bounds to accommodate the wishes of a president who at one point campaigned on plans for a nationwide “deportation force.”

In one recent case, an undocumented woman seeking a protective order from an abusive boyfriend was arrested by immigration agents at a Texas courthouse.

Among Trump’s earliest executive orders were measures to vastly expand the pool of immigrants who were priorities for deportation and a move to revive a program started by the George W. Bush administration that would deputize local police with immigration enforcement powers.

“There are clear signs that this administration is, in fact, going on a manhunt,” said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. She called the administration’s tactics “deeply troubling — we believe unlawful.”

[Federal immigration raids net many without criminal records, sowing fear]

Within the West Wing there is a sharp ideological split among the president’s senior advisers over just how far to go on enforcement measures. Strategist Stephen K. Bannon, policy director Stephen Miller and other hard-liners have advocated for forceful restrictionist policies in keeping with Trump’s campaign rhetoric, while others such as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus remain wary of the potential political fallout from the most severe measures.

Preibus, the former Republican National Committee chairman, oversaw a 2013 report that said the party must embrace comprehensive immigration reform that included legalization measures to make inroads within the fast-growing Latino population.

Their disagreements over how to proceed have been accentuated by indecision from Trump himself. The president — who vowed to “get them all out!” during the campaign — has equivocated on a promise to “immediately terminate” an Obama administration program that has granted work permits to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered the country illegally as children.

Trump had derided the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which President Obama created through executive authority in 2012, as an unconstitutional “executive amnesty.”

But at a news conference Thursday, Trump called the fate of the program “one of the most difficult subjects I have” and vowed to “show great heart” as he deliberates over the program’s fate.

“I have to deal with a lot of people, don’t forget. And I have to convince them what I’m saying is right,” Trump said. “I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and, you know, the law’s rough. . . . It’s very, very rough.”

[Trump lashes out at ‘so-called judge’ who temporarily blocked travel ban]

One of the people Trump will have to persuade is Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a conservative on immigration who was one of his earliest campaign supporters. King praised some of the president’s early moves to ramp up enforcement raids, but he said he’s been meeting regularly with like-minded “rule-of-law conservatives” to discuss Trump’s delays on ending DACA.

Trump’s presidency “pivots on whether he keeps this promise,” King said. “So that means you simply cannot legalize people that are here illegally and you cannot ratify an edict of President Obama that is blatantly unconstitutional.”

Immigration lawyers said they are uncertain about what to advise their clients. Although DHS continues to process DACA applications, advocates were jolted by the reports this week that a 23-year-old Mexican man in Seattle who is covered by the program was arrested during an enforcement raid.

The detention came after enforcement actions in several cities netted 683 immigrants. The man’s lawyers have denied allegations from authorities that he has gang ties.

“I’m going to watch it carefully, and I’m also going to see if other DACA recipients are targets,” said Patrick Taurel, an immigration lawyer in Washington with clients in the program. “If that happens, it could be death by thousand cuts. Rather than issue a new executive order terminating a very popular program and a very sympathetic program, he could effectively end it by creating fear.”

To Stuart Anderson, executive director of the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy, the Trump administration’s early missteps threaten to erode its credibility on the president’s signature issue.

“It makes people highly suspect of even more reasonable measures that might be able to get more support,” Anderson said. “It basically starts to make all their policies on immigration radioactive.”

Space shuttle Atlantis lifts off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., on July 8, 2011. (Bill Ingalls/NASA via Reuters)

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — For decades it has stood like a skyscraper on the Florida coast, its spire stretching more than 400 feet high. The kings and queens of the cosmos — astronauts from Apollo and the shuttle eras, including Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins — have zipped to the top of its tower in an elevator to get one last view of the waves lapping the Florida coast before launching violently into space.

But then in 2011, when the space shuttle was retired, and NASA could no longer fly humans into space, NASA’s Launch Complex 39A went dormant, a symbol of a once great era rusting away in the salt air.

Now the venerable site is about to come back to life. If all goes according to plan, SpaceX, the commercial space venture founded by Elon Musk, plans to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from the pad on Saturday morning, the first since the shuttle era.

While SpaceX has plans to eventually fly NASA astronauts from 39A, Saturday’s launch will have no passengers, and instead carry 5,500 pounds of cargo and experiments for the International Space Station.

The pad hosted six of the Apollo lunar launches, including Apollo 11, the first mission to land humans on the moon. And it was also the stage for many shuttle missions, earning it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.

In an interview last year, Musk said he was grateful to be able to lease the site from NASA.

“I think it’s a great honor, and I have incredible respect for the hallowed ground that it is,” he said. “I would have never imagined that we would have the same opportunity to launch from the same launchpad as Apollo 11.”

The resurrection of 39A, which SpaceX has spent years renovating, is yet another step in the transformation of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center into what officials here call a “multi-user space port.” NASA and the Air Force, which operates the adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, have leased out large swaths of the area to commercial companies that are taking over roles that traditionally were the exclusive domain of the government.

NASA, meanwhile, is focusing on deep space exploration. Its monster rocket, the Space Launch System and Orion capsule, which it plans to fly around the moon in 2018, would launch from Launch Complex 39B. (While that flight was initially supposed to be without passengers, NASA is now exploring the possibility of putting astronauts on board.)

But signs of the private sector’s emergence are all over this place, with corporate symbols rising alongside NASA’s logo and the American flag. Boeing, which along with SpaceX is under contract by NASA to fly astronauts to the space station, has revamped Launch Complex 41, and has taken over a former shuttle processing facility. After competing unsuccessfully against SpaceX for pad 39A, Jeffrey P. Bezos’s Blue Origin is leasing another launch site here. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Moon Express, which is vying to land a spacecraft on the moon as part of the Google Lunar X Prize, has also had a partnership with NASA to test its lunar lander at the Kennedy Space Center.

“We have four active human spaceflight programs here at Kennedy Space Center at this point in time: Orion, SpaceX, Boeing and now Blue Origin that are all going to be in the next few years taking humans to space,” said Tom Engler, of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. “If you put that in context of the history of human spaceflight only three countries have ever flown humans into space: U.S., Russia and China.”

In a statement, NASA said that SpaceX’s launch from 39A will “mark a turning point for Kennedy's transition to a multi-user spaceport geared to support public and private missions, as well as those conducted in partnership with NASA.”

About 10 minutes after the launch, scheduled for 10:01 a.m. Saturday, SpaceX will once again attempt to land its booster on a landing pad it had built here. Traditionally, the first stages of rockets were ditched into the ocean. But SpaceX has been able to successfully recover several of its boosters. Later this year it plans to re-fly one of its used boosters, which it calls “flight proven,” for the first time.

This year, it also plans to launch the maiden flight of its Falcon Heavy, a much more powerful rocket that has been under development for years. SpaceX plans to use the Falcon Heavy to launch its Red Dragon spacecraft to Mars by as early as 2018 in an uncrewed mission.

Launchpad 39A is also where the company plans to fly NASA astronauts to the station. While that was initially supposed to happen by 2017, both SpaceX and Boeing have faced delays that could push certification of their vehicles to 2019, the Government Accountability Office recently reported.

SpaceX has another launch site here, pad 40. But it was damaged significantly when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded in September while being fueled ahead of an engine test.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) hit out at President Trump in a speech on Feb. 17 at the Munich Security Conference, saying, "this administration is in disarray." (Reuters)

John McCain is increasingly mad as hell about President Trump. And on Friday, he went after Trump — hard.

During a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, the Republican senator from Arizona delivered a pointed and striking point-by-point takedown of Trump's worldview and brand of nationalism. McCain didn't mention Trump's name once, but he didn't have to.

And even considering the two men's up-and-down history and the terrible things Trump has said about McCain, it was a striking display from a senior leader of a party when it comes to a president of the same party.

In his speech, McCain suggested the Western world is uniquely imperiled this year — even more so than when Barack Obama was president — and proceeded to question whether it will even survive.

“In recent years, this question would invite accusations of hyperbole and alarmism; not this year,” McCain said. “If ever there were a time to treat this question with a deadly seriousness, it is now.”

[Trump’s war with the media isn’t new. Thomas Jefferson railed about ‘newspaper lies,’ too.]

In case there was any doubt that this was about Trump. Here's what followed:

"[The founders of the Munich conference] would be alarmed by an increasing turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood and race and sectarianism.”

“They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see towards immigrants and refugees and minority groups -- especially Muslims.”

“They would be alarmed by the growing inability -- and even unwillingness -- to separate truth from lies.”

"They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent."

That's Trump, Trump, Trump and Trump.

McCain continued: “But what would alarm them most, I think, is a sense that many of our peoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the West, that they see it as a bad deal that we may be better off without, and that while Western nations still have the power to maintain our world order, it's unclear whether we have the will.”

Trump has repeatedly suggested a desire to pull out of or scale back on international involvement and agreements. His slogan is “America first,” after all. And it's not just on free trade: It's also when it comes to things like NATO, the transatlantic military alliance that Trump has suggested the United States is getting a bad deal on and has flirted with not enforcing.

Then McCain invoked some of those close to Trump and emphasized that his message won't square with theirs:

I know there is profound concern across Europe and the world that America is laying down the mantle of global leadership. I can only speak for myself, but I do not believe that that is the message you will hear from all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend. That's not the message you heard today from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. That is not the message you will hear from Vice President Mike Pence. That's not the message you will hear from Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. And that is certainly not the message you will hear tomorrow from our bipartisan congressional delegation.

McCain then concluded with another direct shot at Trump.

“I refuse to accept that our values are morally equivalent to those of our adversaries,” he said. “I am a proud, unapologetic believer in the West, and I believe we must always, always stand up for it. For if we do not, who will?

Two weeks ago, you may recall, Trump suggested the United States didn't exactly have the moral high ground on Russia. Asked by Fox News host Bill O'Reilly about wanting good relations with a “killer” like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump demurred.

“There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers,” Trump said. “Well, you think our country is so innocent?”

Ever since, it seems, he and McCain have been on a collision course. McCain didn't fight back when Trump questioned his war-hero status long ago — perhaps because both men were trying to win elections — but the battle between McCain and the White House is picking up steam.

And on Friday, McCain traveled across the Atlantic to deliver a calculated, planned attack on Trump's entire system of beliefs.

Keith Wildhaber stopped by a local restaurant for a routine check, according to a lawsuit.

There, he spoke with John Saracino, who at the time was a member of St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners. Saracino indicated to Wildhaber that he knew that the sergeant was applying for a promotion within the department, the lawsuit states.

“Mr. Saracino told Plaintiff, ‘The command staff has a problem with your sexuality,’ ” the court documents read. “‘If you ever want to see a white shirt (i.e., get a promotion), you should tone down your gayness.’”

Wildhaber has filed suit against the county, alleging that he had been subjected to employment discrimination by being denied promotions.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Saracino denied the conversation, which Wildhaber’s suit claimed occurred during a routine restaurant check.

“I never had a conversation like that,” Saracino told the newspaper. “I would never say anything like that. That’s not me.”

Saracino no longer serves on the civilian oversight board, according to the Post-Dispatch.

[A black police officer complained about racism. He says his department retaliated by firing him.]

Sgt. Shawn McGuire, a department spokesman, told The Washington Post that St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar would not comment on the lawsuit, because it was active.

“It is our firm’s practice not to comment on pending litigation,” Wildhaber’s attorney, Russ Riggan, said in a statement emailed to The Post on Friday. “Until the case goes before a jury, we will allow the Petition to speak for itself. Our system of justice provides the right to a fair trial, and we do not wish to compromise our client’s rights by commenting to the media.”

According to the lawsuit, filed in January and recently posted online by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Wildhaber has worked for the department for more than two decades. He applied for a lieutenant position, the lawsuit said, and took a written test and underwent an assessment. His scores during that process ranked him as No. 3, out of 26 candidates.

Wildhaber claims he was sorted into a group with nine other top candidates, all of whom have since been promoted except for Wildhaber and one other officer, who the suit states has issues that might have stalled his professional advancement.

Wildhaber has a clean disciplinary record, strong performance reviews and a solid résumé, according to the lawsuit.

“Nonetheless, Plaintiff has not been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant,” the suit states.

After a second round of candidates was sorted into the top group, Wildhaber again ranked as No. 3 on the list. Since February 2015, however, he has “continued to be passed over for multiple promotions,” according to the suit.

“Defendant has refused to promote Plaintiff because he does not conform to the County’s gender-based norms, expectations, and/or preferences,” the lawsuit states. “Mr. Saracino’s comments to Plaintiff are direct evidence of sex/gender discrimination.”

It continues: “That direct evidence is further buttressed by the fact that Plaintiff has received stellar performance reviews, has solid backing from his immediate supervisors (who have expressed surprise and displeasure about Plaintiff being continually passed over for promotions), and is more qualified to hold the position of Lieutenant.”

[An armless man couldn’t carry his bike up the stairs. He says it cost him his job.]

The suit alleges that Wildhaber filed a discrimination charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Missouri Commission on Human Rights in April. In May, according to the suit, he was reassigned from afternoon shifts in one precinct to midnight shifts in another precinct, which was located about 27 miles from his home.

The Post-Dispatch reported that Wildhaber was once asked to serve as a liaison to the LGBT community. That happened under another police chief who was replaced by Belmar, and Wildhaber didn’t step into that role.

Joe Patterson, president of the St. Louis County Police Association, told the newspaper that the group has asked Wildhaber to be a part of a still-forming committee that would “ensure all of our members are treated equally and fairly in the workplace, which is a bedrock principal of our organization.”

“We have been actively recruiting LGBT members and minority members to serve on steering committees in order to bring forth not only their concerns, but their ideas on how to improve the police association,” Patterson told the newspaper.

The result — a striking portrait of the president — is this week’s Time magazine cover, which features the caption “Nothing to See Here.”

“I know the deal, that I must be fast, do sketches quickly and get starting immediately,” O’Brien, a veteran illustrator for dozens of top publications, tells The Washington Post’s Comic Riffs. “I immediately saw the image in my head: the swirling paper, driving rain and, of course, the hair flapping.”
