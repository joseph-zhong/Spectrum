Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) released the following statement after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a new regulation today known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH): “Today’s announced new AFFH regulation marks President Obama’s most aggressive attempt yet to force his utopian ideology on American communities disguised under the banner of ‘fairness’. This new Washington mandate has nothing to do with race, as housing discrimination has been illegal for more than 40 years. This overreaching new regulation is an attempt to extort communities into giving up control of local zoning decisions and reengineer the makeup of our neighborhoods. Just as the president has used the DOJ, IRS and DHS as a political weapon, he has now expanded his arsenal to include HUD as a way of punishing neighborhoods that don’t fall in line with his liberal agenda. “The House of Representatives twice voted in favor of amendments I introduced that sought to protect local zoning decisions and rejected this intrusive Washington mandate. I will continue to fight this misguided regulation and do everything in my power to ensure not a single penny is appropriated to this big government takeover of America’s neighborhoods.” Background On June 9, 2015, the House passed Congressman Gosar’s amendment to defund this newly announced AFFH regulation by a vote 229-193. This amendment is endorsed by Americans for Limited Government, Freedom Works, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Taxpayers for Common Sense and Eagle Forum. Americans for Limited Government supports the Gosar amendment stating, “Housing discrimination based on race has been illegal since the 1960s, and people should be allowed to choose for themselves where they live without D.C. bureaucrats nationalizing zoning decisions for political reasons.” An amendment to this same appropriations bill blocking funds from going to this misguided regulation successfully passed the House in the 113th Congress. More information on that amendment can be found HERE. Congressman Gosar appeared on Fox Business Network to discuss the issue. Click HERE to watch the clip. In addition, Congressman Gosar’s bill, the Local Zoning and Property Rights Protection Act, H.R. 1995, rejecting this overreaching regulation is currently cosponsored by 20 members in the House. The new AFFH regulation will increase local taxes, depress property values, and cause further harm to impoverished communities that are actually in need of these funds. According to reports, in 2012, this mandate would have negatively impacted more than 1,200 municipalities throughout the country, costing these communities to forfeit millions that are meant help the neediest families. A trial run of the new AFFH regulation already took place in the State of New York. The result was a failure and a local county was initially forced to forego $12 million in funds that would have benefited the community due to the impractical and unrealistic requirements associated with misguided agency regulation. The county had intended to use a large portion of these block grant funds to establish public housing for individuals in need. Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and writer for National Review, has been following this issue for years and published an article prior to the vote entitled, Obama’s Next Transformation: And How to Stop It. ###WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Senator Susan Collins released the following statement after voting in opposition to the Budget Reconciliation Act this evening:



“I have consistently opposed eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides important family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive health care services to millions of women across the country. For many women, Planned Parenthood clinics provide the only health care services they receive.



“Tonight, I voted in opposition to the Budget Reconciliation Act because this legislation would totally prohibit federal funding, including Medicaid funds, for Planned Parenthood. It would likely result in the shutdown of virtually all Planned Parenthood clinics in our country, depriving millions of women of access to basic healthcare and forcing them to give up the health provider of their choice.



“I know that many Americans, including me, were appalled by the actions of some Planned Parenthood employees who were shown discussing the sale of fetal tissue in a series of videos released last summer.



“But the fact remains that only a very small percentage of Planned Parenthood facilities—only seven of more than 700—were engaged in the sale of fetal tissue, and now no Planned Parenthood clinic is involved in these sales. Despite the sickening nature of these videos, it would be unfair and unwise to respond by shutting down the main source of basic health care for millions of women. In addition, it is important to remember that federal funds are already prohibited for the use of abortions except in the case of rape, incest, and the life of the mother.



“While I do support the ongoing effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, the inclusion of these harmful Planned Parenthood provisions had no place in this legislation.”



Senator Collins offered an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Act, along with her colleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Kirk, which would have struck the provisions defunding Planned Parenthood. Senator Collins spoke from the Senate floor this afternoon to urge her collogues to adopt the amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment was 3 votes short of the fifty-one votes needed for adoption.Morgan Williams is General Counsel of the National Fair Housing Alliance.

Today’s decision in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project broke no new ground. It simply reaffirmed the consistent finding of the federal courts over the past four decades that the Fair Housing Act bars not only intentional discrimination, but also policies that have an unwarranted disparate impact. In doing so, the Court’s majority correctly recognized that it was not construing a new law, but rather one with a long and proud history that did not warrant pruning back the law’s coverage so late in the day.

Justice Kennedy’s opinion appropriately begins by locating the Fair Housing Act against the background of this country’s long history of discrimination and segregation. The Congress that enacted the FHA, in the midst of the civil unrest of 1968, was well aware that the problems it was attacking were (as they remain) deeply rooted in American society. Accordingly, when enacting the FHA, Congress used language focusing on the results of decision makers’ policies rather than the motivation behind them.

And even if there were any doubt about Congress’s intent in 1968, Justice Kennedy’s opinion makes clear, no such doubt remained after Congress amended the Act in 1988. Congress knew full well that that all nine appellate courts to consider the question had concluded that disparate impact claims were viable under the original language. It chose to retain the relevant text and rejected an amendment that would have eliminated disparate impact liability. Congress even added exemptions to the Act that presuppose the existence of disparate impact liability and would be entirely superfluous without disparate impact. Thus, as Justice Kennedy recognized, Congress endorsed and ratified the consistent interpretation of the federal courts.

Congress did so for good reason. In the four decades that the Fair Housing Act has been construed to include disparate impact liability, housing, lending, and insurance markets – once bastions of overt segregation and discrimination – have made important strides toward becoming fair and open to all. This is not a coincidence. Disparate impact doctrine has been at the very core of the Act’s success in ending discriminatory housing practices and promoting integration. As Justice Kennedy recognized, the elimination of zoning laws and other housing restrictions that function unfairly against protected groups, and do so without sufficient justification, is “at the heartland” of disparate impact liability and the Fair Housing Act itself.

As Justice Kennedy’s opinion further explains, those who contend that the disparate impact doctrine somehow interferes with entrepreneurship and the proper functioning of the free market have it backwards. Justice Kennedy notes, for example, that developers who have successfully challenged unnecessary zoning restrictions are now building homes and apartments and providing affordable housing where previously they could not. He could have cited many other examples of the disparate impact doctrine’s positive economic effect, many of which do not appear in the case law but only have taken place because the doctrine has forced businesses to do their jobs better.

Lenders, for example, have developed lending standards – customized to reflect their unique customer bases – that more accurately and objectively separate qualified from unqualified borrowers. The result has been that credit markets, though still far from completely fair, are now more open than ever before to those traditionally shut out of credit. Meanwhile, banks have discovered that these less discriminatory criteria also work better at identifying real risk. The property insurance industry, too, has experienced a similar transformation in its culture. In response to disparate impact challenges by advocates, insurers have refined their underwriting and pricing systems to eliminate unnecessary, unsupported barriers to the availability of adequate homeowners’ coverage.

The bottom line, as Justice Kennedy’s opinion makes clear, is that disparate impact doctrine imposes neither an undue burden nor surprising obligations, nor does it require regulated entities to impose race-conscious policies. All entities must do is apply real scrutiny to those policies that limit the availability of housing. The alternatives they identify when they do so often prove more profitable, or otherwise beneficial to the entity adopting them, as well. In short, the disparate impact doctrine simply requires that those involved in housing must get smarter in order to be fairer.

As Justice Kennedy’s opinion properly observes, the existence of disparate impact liability over the last several decades “has not given rise to . . . dire consequences,” notwithstanding the overwrought rhetoric of the doctrine’s opponents. Instead, the disparate impact doctrine has encouraged various entities to take a hard look at unexamined assumptions and think creatively about better solutions. In doing so, it has unleashed considerable entrepreneurship. The result is good for business, good for consumers, and good for the economy. As Justice Kennedy makes clear, those who contend that the disparate impact doctrine somehow requires the institution of racial quotas, or that it prevents public or private entities from fulfilling their legitimate purposes, misunderstand the doctrine.

Rather, the FHA’s disparate impact doctrine merely has ensured that the most disadvantaged members of our society cannot be further victimized by facially neutral laws that exclude them from housing for no good reason. Families can feel more comfortable knowing that their right to housing will not be restricted because they have children. Women who experience domestic violence can breathe easier knowing that they will not suffer eviction just because they suffered abuse. The predatory lending practices that dumped millions of subprime loans into communities of color will not be allowed. As Justice Kennedy’s opinion makes clear, the Constitution does not bar either courts or policymakers from taking notice of such injustice and correcting it.

Big little lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive. Written by Anand Patel(WASHINGTON) — Democrats demanded a special investigation Tuesday into possible links between President Donald Trump's administration and Russia, including when Trump learned that his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian diplomat.

"The American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security," House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

Flynn's resignation late Monday also prompted Democrats to press again for a no-holds-barred probe of Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Republican leaders have refused so far to establish a special bipartisan committee to examine Moscow's meddling, arguing that the existing congressional committees are capable of handling the inquiries. But they'll be under pressure to reverse course after Flynn stepped down following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Flynn made the right decision to step down but he sidestepped questions about whether an inquiry is warranted.

"You cannot have the national security adviser misleading the vice president and others," the Wisconsin Republican said. "I'm not going to prejudge any of the circumstances surrounding this until we have all of the information."

At issue is whether Flynn broke diplomatic protocol and potentially the law by discussing U.S. sanctions with Moscow before Trump's inauguration.

Republican Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Flynn's resignation "is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus."

"General Flynn's resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies, and attempted interference in American elections," McCain said in a statement.

California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says he wants to know whether Flynn was acting on Trump's behalf or whether Trump or anyone in his administration approved his contacts with Russia. He said Flynn's resignation "does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians."

Pelosi said in a statement that Congress "must call for a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to fully investigate Russia's influence on the administration and the election."

"The truth and consequences of the Russia connection: the American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia's financial, personal and political grip on President Trump and what that means for our national security," she said.

Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said wrote on her Twitter account that it's "time for a select bipartisan committee on the involvement of Russia in this administration and election. Period. Stop. Public hearings."

Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said revelations about Flynn's interactions with Russia "raise grave questions about who in the White House knew about Flynn's vulnerability to blackmail and exploitation by the Russian government, and when they knew about it."

Smith called for a "full investigation that covers any and all connections to these events that could undermine the national security of the United States."

Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said a rigorous bipartisan investigation is needed because there are "far too many questions unanswered about this administration's ties to Russia."

But Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said "the situation has taken care of itself" when asked by reporters if his panel would investigate Flynn's actions.

"Sounds like he did the right thing, he didn't want to be a distraction," Chaffetz said of Flynn. "And it was getting to be a distraction."After two weeks of bleary all-nighters in Paris, diplomats from around the world have hammered out a major global agreement to address climate change. Here's the full 31-page document, which was approved by 195 countries on Saturday.

It's important to be clear on what this wad of paper actually does. The Paris climate agreement hasn't saved the planet, and it hasn't solved global warming. Not by itself. Instead, the deal is supposed to add structure and momentum to efforts that are currently underway around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

That's a worthwhile task in its own right. Since 2014, nearly every country has submitted a voluntary plan to the United Nations for tackling climate change. The US is reducing carbon dioxide from power plants. China is boosting wind and solar. And so on. But those pledges, in the aggregate, remain weak and inadequate. If you add them all up, global emissions are projected to keep rising through 2030, putting us on pace for 2.7°C (or more) of warming by century's end. That's well above the 2°C threshold that many scientists argue is unacceptably risky:

What this Paris agreement does, then, is provide a set of diplomatic tools to prod countries into cutting emissions even more deeply over time. The deal's text starts with aspirational goals: The world should aim for an emissions peak "as soon as possible" and limit total warming to less than 2°C, or perhaps even to 1.5°C. (The Earth has already warmed about 1°C since pre-industrial times.) It's a signal that countries at least hope to do more than they're already doing.

Related The radical idea at the core of the Paris climate deal

The deal then adds transparency measures to verify that nations are actually restraining their emissions. Importantly, it requires that countries reconvene every five years to reconsider the ambition level of their pledges. And wealthy countries have set a goal of providing more than $100 billion per year in public and private financing by 2020 for poorer countries, to help them invest in clean energy and cope with sea-level rise, droughts, floods, and other ravages of climate change.

There are plenty of hard questions about how effective these diplomatic tools will be. Will the transparency measures work? Will that climate aid actually materialize? The basic reality, though, is that the Paris agreement can only encourage countries to step up their efforts. It can't force them to do so. That's the hard part, the part that comes next. Further action will ultimately depend on policymakers and investors and engineers and scientists and activists across the globe, not the UN.

In other words, the Paris deal is only a first step. Perhaps the easiest step. To stop global warming, every country will have to do much, much more in the years ahead to transition away from fossil fuels (which still provide 86 percent of the world's energy), move to cleaner sources, and halt deforestation. Countries will have to pursue new policies, adopt new technologies, go far beyond what they've already promised.

If we want decent odds of staying below 2°C of global warming — the grandiose target laid out in the Paris deal — then most countries will have to make radical changes, and quickly. It's an extraordinarily difficult undertaking, with no guarantees we'll succeed.

What the Paris climate deal does, exactly

Start with this fact: The Paris deal, negotiated through the United Nations, does not legally require any emission cuts. Negotiators tried to craft an agreement like that back in 1997, with the Kyoto Protocol, and it simply didn't work. It was infeasible to force countries to make sharp cuts they didn't want to make. (See here for more on that history.)

Instead, the Paris talks took a radically different approach. Every country started off by deciding for itself how it plans to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account its own unique domestic situation. Since 2014, every single major emitter has submitted a climate pledge to the UN. A few highlights:

The United States is vowing to cut its greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, through policies like the Clean Power Plan to decarbonize power plants.

The European Union will cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

China has vowed that its emissions will peak around 2030 and that it will get about 20 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources by then.

Brazil will cut emissions 37 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, with an emphasis on curbing illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

India will continue to reduce its carbon intensity, or CO2 output per unit of economic activity, in line with historic levels (though overall emissions will grow).

These pledges are all plausible, rooted in each country's analysis of what's politically possible and technologically feasible. But they're also insufficient to avoid serious climate change. As noted earlier, if you assume every country follows its pledge to the letter, global emissions would nonetheless keep rising through 2030, and we'll be setting ourselves up for around 3°C of global warming by century's end, well past the 2°C mark long considered bad news.

So that's where this Paris agreement comes in. The goal was to provide a support structure that will, negotiators hope, allow these national pledges to get stronger over time. Key features in the final deal include:

An overall temperature goal. The Earth has already warmed about 1°C since pre-industrial levels, because of all the greenhouse gases we've put into the air. As part of the Paris deal, countries are aiming to overall total global warming to less than 2°C, and possibly even keep it down to 1.5°C, in recognition that many dangerous impacts are likely to occur above that level. Of course, these goals are only aspirational, and they'll be impossible to meet without policies to match.

Of course, these goals are only aspirational, and they'll be impossible to meet without policies to match. An overall emissions goal. Currently global emissions aren't expected to peak until 2030 or later, which would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stay below 2°C. So as part of the deal, countries agreed on a vague goal of aiming for peak emissions "as soon as possible." They will also aim to achieve net zero emissions by the second half of the century, though there's no specific timeline.

They will also aim to achieve net zero emissions by the second half of the century, though there's no specific timeline. Pledges will get reviewed every five years. As noted before, the current climate pledges offered by nations don't come anywhere close to keeping us below 2°C of global warming, let alone 1.5°C. So as part of the deal, countries will be encouraged to submit new and stronger pledges every five years, starting in 2020 . Again, this agreement won't require anyone to keep cutting more deeply, but the goal is to pressure countries to consider stronger action over time.

Again, this agreement won't require anyone to keep cutting more deeply, but the goal is to pressure countries to consider stronger action over time. Financing for poor countries. Poorer countries will need help in adopting clean energy and adapting to climate impacts — floods, storms, sea-level rise, and so on. So the deal requires developed countries to provide aid for this purpose, although it doesn't mandate a specific number. (Developed countries have set a non-binding goal of $100 billion per year in public and private investment by 2020, and the deal calls for an increase over time.) The accountability measures here are fairly weak. In the past, critics say, rich countries have often relabeled existing aid as "climate aid." There's no provision here to ensure that this financing is brand new.

There's no provision here to ensure that this financing is brand new. Loss and damage. A certain amount of global warming is already baked into the system, and some countries are going to suffer no matter what. Low-lying islands, for instance, could get consumed by sea-level rise. So many poorer countries had been pushing for compensation from richer countries, which are after all responsible for most of the emissions in the atmosphere. The US had opposed this, and the deal "does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation." But it does set up committees to deal with displacement and other related issues.

Transparency measures. The deal calls for yet-to-be-determined reporting and monitoring measures to ensure that countries are actually cutting their emissions as much as promised. Countries like China and India had opposed overly intrusive inspections, which is why the deal calls for a "transparency framework" that is "facilitative, non-intrusive, non-punitive manner, respectful of national sovereignty, and avoid placing undue burden on Parties." How this works in practice remains to be seen.

How this works in practice remains to be seen. Legal status. This deal has a fairly odd legal status. The climate pledges themselves are not binding — if a country fails to cut emissions as much as it had promised, there are no penalties or anything. But much of the supporting structure is binding: the transparency mechanisms, the promise to come back every five years, etc. The main reason for this setup is so that the treaty does not have to be ratified by the US Senate, which would never happen. (Though it also means a future US president could pretty easily abandon Obama's climate pledges.)

You'll notice that some of these provisions are ambiguously worded and will likely need to be hashed out in future UN sessions, starting with the 2016 summit in Morocco. "Many segments contain very vague language, but this kind of 'constructive ambiguity' is often the only way to get a deal done," explained Oliver Geden, who heads the EU research division at SWP, the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. "The actual meaning will only develop over time, as a result of ongoing power struggles."

The Paris deal will officially come into force when at least 55 countries accounting for 55 percent of global emissions have formally acceded. (So, for instance, you'd probably need China, the United States, Europe, India, and Russia to all come on board.)

Will this climate deal actually work? Can we stay below 2°C?

There's ample room for skepticism about this agreement. Countries are offering up entirely voluntary climate pledges that are, so far, awfully flimsy. (India, for instance, has said that its emissions will keep rising indefinitely as it burns more coal to climb out of poverty.) The parties have only agreed to vague feel-good goals at Paris — limit global warming to 1.5°C, have emissions peak "as soon as possible" — without a well-defined plan for how to actually achieve those targets.

So, yes, there's a chance that the Paris deal, and the processes it sets in motion, could prove ineffective. That's the risk with any treaty based on voluntary actions. It's why you see critics like James Hansen, a prominent climate scientist, calling these talks "worthless."

Again, though, the rationale behind the Paris approach was that no one could ever get China, India, or the United States to agree to a legally binding UN deal that mandated deep cuts or global carbon taxes from the get-go. So instead, negotiators decided to start with voluntary pledges, ensure universal participation, and then try to iterate from there, through cooperation and political persuasion.

As political scientist David Victor told me: "The encouraging precedent here is in trade — where you get a bicycle theory of cooperation." This is the idea that once the process of trade liberalization gets underway, it keeps gathering momentum in subsequent talks: "You build credibility and trust over time and then move to bigger issues."

Or, if you like metaphors: Think of the countries making climate pledges as a bunch of out-of-shape slobs trying (and failing miserably) to qualify for a relay event. The Paris agreement can't force these people to train harder. But it can put their names up on a whiteboard, track their progress, work out gym subsidies for those who can't afford it, and facilitate peer pressure. Obviously the exercise is the crucial part, and that ultimately depends on each individual. But that other stuff can help.

So it's worth keeping these talks in perspective. The Paris agreement can support ongoing efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions and curb deforestation. But whether Earth warms 2°C or 2.5°C or 3°C simply won't be decided by this deal alone. That will depend on what future policies get enacted by individual countries, on how quickly we switch over to alternative energy sources, on how technology evolves.

And the bottom line is that current policies will have to undergo a serious revision if we want to avoid drastic temperature increases. A recent report from MIT and Climate Interactive looked at how national pledges would have to be ratcheted up between now and 2030 to stay below 2°C of warming:

Those are wrenching changes. China would have to do much more to ramp up low-carbon energy and shift away from coal so that emissions peak by 2025 instead of 2030. The United States would have to double or triple its current climate policies. Coming even close to 2°C would involve far-reaching efforts to decarbonize homes, vehicles, power plants, and factories. Clean tech would have to proliferate far more rapidly. Plus, we'd likely need to develop technology to suck massive amounts of CO2 out of the air by the latter half of the century. No one knows if that's even feasible.

But that would be true with or without this agreement. Tackling climate change is a massive, herculean task, the work of generations. That was true before the Paris deal, and it's just as true now.

What else should I read about the Paris deal?

Some of the best, most detailed analysis of the Paris climate agreement is happening over at Carbon Brief. Check out its rundown of the final deal here .

here Here is my history of the 2°C global warming target , and here's a look at how the math of meeting it looks increasingly brutal.

my history of the 2°C global warming target a look Robert McSweeney and Roz Pidcock looked at why negotiators adopted the even more stringent goal of 1.5°C in the final deal. Many of the risks of climate change, such as damage to coral reefs, are thought to happen even before we hit 2°C. The problem is that it's extremely unlikely, at this point, that we can cut emissions enough to stay at 1.5°C.

looked at Michael Levi has a smart analysis of the final Paris climate deal, noting that many of the divisions and acrimony that plagued past climate talks could still resurface in the future. He also notes that public perception of the deal could matter a lot in determining its success.

Coral Davenport of the New York Times argues that the Paris deal will be a success if it provides a signal to markets and investors that clean energy is the future. We'll see if that happens, but that could end up being the deal's most concrete impact.

Finally, one thing the Paris deal didn't address was international shipping and aviation, which account for 4 percent of global emissions. That will be left for future talks. Read Julian Spector's piece for a look at why this is such a tricky issue.A few things you should know about The Great Wall: It’s simultaneously 400 percent more movie than most and 10 percent as much movie as most — huge, bombastic, colorful, explosive, and containing almost no story at all. It’s roughly equivalent to watching the assault-on-Mordor bits of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King for 103 minutes. It was filmed in 3D, and I ducked a few times while watching. It also made me seasick, but that’s my own damn fault for sitting too close to the screen.

None of those are necessarily a strike against the movie, which fantastically achieves its simple goal: to be a big, eye-popping spectacle about a Chinese legend. It is big. It is eye-popping. It is about China. And it is definitely about a legend. It also doesn’t have a single thought in its noggin, but it does have armies of toothy monsters.

If that sounds like what you need right now, read on.

The Great Wall is about fighting monsters, and that is all it is about

Matt Damon plays a European mercenary warrior named William who has traveled to China in the company of his frenemy Tovar (Pedro Pascal). He’s heard rumors of a “black powder” that turns the air to fire and promises to revolutionize how war is waged, and he wants to bring it home with him. Camped out in the desert one night, they’re attacked by a creature that they can’t see through the darkness. But William slays it and slices off its giant, scaly green hand, which he packs up and carries with him — along with a big black magnetic rock — to the Great Wall.

That Wall is protected by a huge battalion of soldiers of the “Unnamed Order,” of which there are various contingents in different brightly colored uniforms. One full contingent is led by a woman, Commander Lin (Tian Jing), and made up of women, which seems to briefly surprise William and Tovar. The men are captured by the soldiers, who are reasonably convinced these Europeans haven’t arrived in China in good will. (They also spot another European man skulking around the castle, played by Willem Dafoe.)

But before much can happen, their captors turn their attention to the claw William carries, which the Chinese soldiers deduce — rightly — means the monster onslaught is about to begin.

The monsters are fearsome creatures they call Tao Tei, which are like a cross between bloodthirsty leopards, lizard-like dragons, and some kind of piranha. And what comes next is, indeed, an onslaught. Millions of them, all swarming up to the Great Wall. All the firepower of the army can’t really contain them, though the magnetic rock that William has seems to exert mysterious powers over them.

This story could have wandered into “white savior” territory (and some people certainly feared that would happen), but it doesn’t, really: The Chinese are clearly highly skilled and far more advanced technologically than any of the European men, whom they call “barbarians.” Commander Lin speaks English and fights like a champ, and though William is a highly skilled archer, her prowess, and the prowess of her army, leaves him in the dust. What he has, besides his bow, is this magnet that tames the Tao Tei.

The Great Wall is pure spectacle, and that’s all it wants to be

In its barest outlines, The Great Wall is about a potential clash of civilizations that’s diverted when the humans are threatened by the Tao Tei. It’s also halfheartedly about learning to trust other people, as Lin must teach William about the monsters. (There’s a distinct feeling that most of the story got shaved off the movie at some point, its narrative is so thin.)

But really it’s just about massive, imaginative set pieces, endless battles, and balletic fighting that is often quite beautiful. That’s largely what you’d expect from director Zhang Yimou (Hero, Raise the Red Lantern), who is more visual artist than storyteller. Zhang also directed the visually stunning closing ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and watching The Great Wall is a lot like watching that: a show of pride in one’s country, its beauty, its innovations.

It’s true that Matt Damon is “in” this movie, in the sense that he appears in it. But The Great Wall requires its apparent star to do an excessively tiny amount of acting, to the point where a CGI version of Damon could be swapped in, Rogue One-style, and I’m not entirely sure anyone would know the difference.

But who cares? The Great Wall’s story is firmly beside the point. And, in truth, that’s not a terrible thing. February is a time for spectacle and maximalist cinema, for escaping the winter doldrums by dialing everything up to 11, whether it’s John Wick: Chapter 2 (assassins, but more of them!) or Fifty Shades Darker (kinky sex, but more of it!) or A Cure for Wellness (eels! so many eels!). Complaining about a lack of depth is basically pointless, and at least The Great Wall is upfront about its total lack of interest in compelling narrative. All it wants to do is entertain.

If you go see The Great Wall, you are there to be entertained. And if you turn off your brain, you will be.

The Great Wall opens in theaters on February 17.Prior to Donald Trump’s presidential victory, if you asked the average person to explain the “alt-right,” their response — assuming they’d heard of the alt-right — was likely to involve internet trolls.

Before the alt-right movement became more widely known for neo-Nazism and white supremacism, its members were frequently described as internet trolls. But in the wake of Trump’s ascent to the White House and many subsequent public displays of neo-Nazi behavior in celebration of it, many people are asking whether “trolling” was ever the correct term to describe the alt-right’s behavior.

Do you all ever think about how 4chan went from trolling Habbo Hotel to being an alt-right fascist online incubator — trey (@BlackMetalDad) November 8, 2016

Big spike in alt-right trolling. Don't assume it stays in the ether.https://t.co/aKTaJIN6bK — Jonathan Funke (@jrfunke) November 9, 2016

By the same token, many are questioning whether “alt-right” is itself the most accurate term for a group whose members have, in the wake of Trump’s victory, become even more blatant about championing their white supremacist, Neo-Nazi ideology:

NAZIS. THEY ARE NAZIS. CALL THEM NAZIS. THEY ARE LITERALLY SAYING THE ACTUAL NAZI THING THEY ARE NAZIS STOP FUCKING AROUND. https://t.co/yAk2NzgiAp — Jenny Trout (@Jenny_Trout) November 21, 2016

The tweet above, for instance, is a reaction to news about the alt-right that recently rocketed around the internet. On November 19, a day-long alt-right convention in Washington was punctuated with actual Nazi salutes and shouts of “Heil!” from attendees. Within a couple days, the word “Nazi” had become a worldwide trend on Twitter as many people reacted in horror.

But despite growing resistance to the movement, it’s difficult to reach a consensus on re-labeling the alt-right as supporting Nazism or Fascism, because many people still view the alt-right as “just trolling.”

For decades, the common wisdom online has been that the best way to interact with a troll is not to interact at all. But “don’t feed the trolls” failed spectacularly as a tactic during the 2016 election cycle, stunning many people who assumed the alt-right’s tactics were juvenile and easily seen-through.

Prior to Trump’s appointment of Steve Bannon, former head of the alt-right “news” website Breitbart, as his campaign chief (and later White House chief strategist), many people and members of the media wrote off the site and its reporters as trolling the general populace — even though it claimed around 8 million readers at the beginning of the year, a number that would jump to over 18 million thanks to the election. As polls and pundits dismissed Trump’s chances of winning in the lead-up to the election, many people dismissed alt-right trolling, too:

@SchreckReports @politico one of many lesson that will be lost on the alt-right after nov. 8th: trolling is not good politics — b_leak f_acts (@bleakfacts) November 3, 2016

It’s not a failure of human intelligence that many people failed to take “trolling” more seriously. Much in the same way that fake news on Facebook was easy to dismiss until people realized its potential to massively influence many voters’ viewpoints, trolling obfuscates truth and reality, often through satirical means, in order to mask sincere propaganda.

Trolling used to be online performance art. Increasingly, the performance is real.

For decades, the word “troll” was web-speak for that one rude commenter on a forum who just wouldn’t shut up or go away; the one who kept trying to goad the average reasonable person into a fight — and often an absurd one based on absurd logic, or a twisting of your assumptions regarding the basic principles you were arguing about. For instance, a troll might argue about the color of the sky by insisting it’s red, and remaining intentionally tone-deaf in response to any attempts at correction.

Trolling can take many different forms. A famous internet troll like Ken M (a.k.a. comedy writer Kenneth McCarthy) might comment “are capital letters case-sensitive” on a news story about internet password protection in order to satirize many internet users’ lack of awareness about how to secure their passwords. Others, like Reddit user PhD_in_everything, satirize internet archetypes like the mansplaining know-it-all by overtly condescending to whomever they’re speaking with.

Trolls working as a unit on sites like 4chan can stage highly visible pranks, like the time they “vote-brigaded” the Time 100 vote to promote 4chan’s founder and spell out 4chan in-jokes.

Sometimes, trolls will fake outrage online in order to drum up real outrage, like the time 4chan attempted to manufacture a dangerous fitness trend among teen girls called the “bikini bridge” (similar to the “thigh gap”), then fabricated fake outrage in response to the fake trend, in order to generate real outrage among feminists. Occasionally, trolling “events” can also spill over into real life, some of which, like swatting (using the internet to create fake threats and summon a real-life SWAT team to a target’s house), are extremely dangerous.

The rare danger from a troll brigade notwithstanding, most people who’ve been on the internet for a while are quick to write off trolling itself, to view it as a harmless prank. After all, trolls gonna troll. This dictum has held true even as members of the alt-right have used trolling to propagate sexist, anti-Semitic, racist, and white nationalist memes.

Increasingly, however, many people have pushed back against labeling the alt-right as a bunch of trolls. After all, is it really “just” trolling when the message involves making threats that refer to the Holocaust?

Well, no — but also, yes.

Trolling distorts reality in order to trick you into dismissing its message

One of the most significant and pernicious ways that members of the alt-right use trolling is to create a sincerity-proof chamber of distortion surrounding what their actual message is. They do this by pretending that what they’re really doing is satirically spoofing how progressives and members of the media view conservatives.

Things get really confusing, really fast.

For example: Say I Photoshop a picture of Hillary Clinton so that she’s being chased by rabid wolves. You come along and claim that my image is alarming and sexist. I might then claim that the joke’s on you, because my image was really just a way to bait and skewer liberal hysteria and “the media’s” hyperbolic, distorted image of how the alt-right treats women and Clinton in particular. And by reacting to it and getting upset, you fell for it, proving that liberals are overly sensitive crybabies who habitually whine about trivial or nonexistent issues.

Consequently, you might feel like a fool for having taken the “joke” seriously. You might also be more likely to eyeroll and dismiss the next obviously sexist meme you see being shared online. You might even encourage other people to ignore it too, assuming it was crafted by someone attempting to mock liberals for taking trolls too seriously.

And all the while, my picture of Clinton and the wolves, and many more like it, continue to promote violence against women and a hatred of Clinton — which was, of course, my real goal all along.

All of which is to say that it can be extremely difficult for the average person to parse alt-right trolling from “sincere” alt-right messaging. If you fall for it, you’re catering to the movement’s ostensible perception of left-leaning citizens (or even moderate citizens) as being histrionic.

But if you try to play along with the alt-right’s hyperbole by intellectualizing it (for example, by painting it primarily as cultural commentary), dismissing it as trolling, or simply ignoring it altogether, you risk glossing over actual dangerous messages: racist, misogynistic, bigoted, and violent symbolism and language.

Members of the alt-right use a litany of methods — from fear-mongering to name-calling — to distract and intimidate their opponents while spreading false or misleading information. But trolling is especially effective, because once you’ve identified something as trolling, you’ve developed a built-in readiness to dismiss the behavior. And that readiness is something the alt-right counts on.

that said, part of the game is trolling. The alt-right know the left have bad target acquisition & provoke them to hit the white electorate https://t.co/dp252rbTdG — ColumPaget (@ColumPaget) November 21, 2016

Many in the alt-right are upfront about their tactics

One of the alt-right’s most prominent members is the neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, who blogs about his white supremacist, anti-Semitic cause. On his website, Anglin has an alt-right explainer for “normies” that doubles, minus the overt racism and bigotry, as a fairly straightforward and illuminating chronicle of how the many disparate branches of the alt-right came together.

Anglin lays out the unifying themes of the alt-right movement — misogyny, anti-Semitism, racism, and white nationalism — and explains how meme culture, trolling, and conspiracy theories have linked them under one umbrella term. Further garnishing that hate-filled combination with a large dollop of irony is what allows the alt-right’s troll culture, according to Anglin, to spread its white supremacist message.

Anglin acknowledges in his blog post that the alt-right’s use of ironic hyperbole “can be confusing to the mainstream, given the level of irony involved. The amount of humor and vulgarity confuses people.”

But he’s also very clear that the point of using irony is to mask something utterly straightforward: “The true nature of the movement, however, is serious and idealistic.” In a postmodern, post-ironic culture, he argues, “absolute idealism must be couched in irony in order to be taken seriously.”

In other words, anyone who has argued during a heated election year that “trolling” is a misleading word for the alt-right has heard what Anglin is saying about his own movement. What Anglin calls “idealism,” many people consider dangerous white nationalism — which is why it’s all the more important to be aware that hate speech dressed up as ironic hyperbole can divert attention away from something that is, beneath all the meta, absolutely real.

Because “trolling” is such an easy-to-dismiss behavior, members of the alt-right have successfully used it to obscure the movement’s sincere objective: to support and promote hateful ideology. Countless Americans dismissed “trolls” as a serious political factor in the leadup to the election. Now, with a former Breitbart editor headed to the White House to serve as Trump’s chief strategist, many are asking a different question:

Where does the trolling stop and the new administration begin?The Internet star allegedly posted a video that included two men laughing as they held a banner that read “Death to all Jews.”

Disney’s Maker Studios has severed ties with YouTube star PewDiePie, aka Felix Kjellberg, after he released a series of anti-Semitic posts to his 53 million subscribers.

Kjellberg, a 27-year-old Swede whose YouTube antics secured him multimillion-dollar deals with YouTube and Disney, posted a Jan. 11 video that included two men laughing as they held a banner that read “Death to all Jews." He made a total of nine other videos that made anti-Semitic comments or used Nazi imagery, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the news.

Disney, which has owned Maker Studios since 2014, said it was severing ties with him.

"Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate," reads a statement from a Maker spokeswoman. "Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward."

Following the move by Maker Studios, Google-owned YouTube is also cutting ties with the star. A spokeswoman for the streamer tells THR that it has canceled plans for a second season of reality series Scare PewDiePie, which streamed its first season on YouTube last year. It has also removed Kjellberg's PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred, its premium advertising tier.

Scare PewDiePie, produced by Maker Studios and Skybound Entertainment with Robert Kirkman serving as executive producer, premiered in February 2016 on YouTube Red, which charges $10 per month for access to premium videos and ad-free viewing. The second season, called Scare PewDiePie: Multiplayer, was to include Kjellberg's friend and fellow YouTuber Sean McLoughlin, aka Jacksepticeye.

Kjellberg is YouTube's top star, with more subscribers than any other home-grown talent on the streaming service. The gamer, known for his goofy videos in which he commentates while playing video games, also was the most high-profile YouTuber in Maker's network of creators. Since Kjellberg signed with the YouTube network in 2012, Maker has helped him expand into new ventures, producing Scare PewDiePie and launching a gaming-centric digital network called Revelmode.

This isn't the first time Kjellberg has made some controversial moves on social media. Last summer he was briefly suspended from Twitter over concerns that his account had been hacked. At the time, a source told The Hollywood Reporter that that suspension had been a misunderstanding that resulted from comments he made about ISIS and his use of a graphic Twitter profile picture.

Kjellberg took to Tumblr to defend his more recent comments. "I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online," he wrote, continuing, "I think it's important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes."

Feb. 14, 7:28 a.m. Updated to include details of YouTube's decision to cut ties with Kjellberg.It seems as though the aesthetic admiration between hipsters and Nazis is finally a two-way street. While white male denizens of neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Silver Lake and Wicker Park have long been fans of copping Nazi style, neo-Nazis in Germany are increasingly adapting a hipster attitude and way of dressing as a way of becoming more appealing to young people. I see the slogan now — Nationalists: We Hated People Who Are Different from Us Before It Was Cool.

In an in-depth piece for Rolling Stone, Thomas Rogers investigates the rise of the "nipster," a word that might sound like what you'd call yourself when you wear a particularly revealing American Apparel shirt that requires you to go braless, but is actually a portmanteau of "Nazi" and "hipster."

It's not a huge movement (nor is the neo-Nazi movement's attempt to reach out to young people anything new), but it is a fascinating one. Whereas previously, Germany's far right-wing has refused to yield on certain issues in order to woo new followers, they're currently trying a different tactic — one that allows young neo-Nazis to listen to pop music, wear trendy clothes and have fashionable haircuts.

Andy Knape, the 28-year-old who runs the youth wing of "the country's oldest and biggest extreme-right political party," the National Democratic Party (NPD) of Germany, is hard at work, spreading the nipster way of life.

Rogers writes:

Knape wants to give "nationalism" a friendlier, cooler face (in the NPD, and many other extreme-right organizations, "nationalist" often functions as a politically acceptable euphemism for "Nazi"). For Knape, who grew up with American pop culture, the idea of policing what young members of the scene watch or listen to is silly — he'd much rather hijack it, and use it to bring young people into the fold. Michael Schaefer, the JN's excitable 31-year-old press person, chimes in: "We've taken over the nipster," he says, giddily, before catching himself. "I mean nationalist hipster, not Nazi hipster."

But how do you hijack American pop culture, much of which is produced by black artists, to promote xenophobia and white supremacy? Through dissociation, of course.

"We don't want to cut ourselves off," Knape says, about hipster culture. "I see rap and hip-hop, for example, as a way of transporting our message." In recent years, a number of extreme-right hip-hop acts have emerged in Germany — with names like Makss Damage and Dee Ex. Despite the awkward politics of using hip-hop to preach the virtues of German identity, they've amassed a small, but significant presence within the scene. Dee Ex, for example, has over 7,000 likes on Facebook and posts photos of herself in a revealing outfit on her blog. There is now neo-Nazi techno (biggest act: DJ Adolf) and neo-Nazi reggae.

And Knape isn't the only one demonstrating such a disconnect — young Neo-nazis across Germany are attempting to appropriate Che Guevara imagery, veganism, Sesame Street and even the Harlem Shake in order to attract new youth members members.

Rogers also profiles controversial neo-Nazi vlogger Patrick Schroeder:

Schroeder is 30 years old, about six feet tall, with the boxy musculature of an MMA fighter, his blond hair shaved except for a jaunty strip along the top of his head. He's dressed all in black, wearing armbands slightly reminiscent of those favored by vintage Avril Lavigne and speaks quickly and loudly, with a strong Bavarian lilt. When he laughs, his upper right lip rises up, making him look both threatening and insecure. "If the Third Reich was so bad, it would have been toppled," he argues, before the filming begins. "Every half-intelligent person knows there is no system where everything was bad." He won't elaborate, for legal reasons, but he'll happily share his topline thoughts about everything from Obama (whom he grossly describes as America's "neger president") to why black people don't belong in Germany ("It's against nature — there's a reason we're not walking around in the sun, in Ghana, with our skin color"), to why American neo-Nazis are "primitive" ("It's like they're always dressing up for a costume party") and — because, just like many other Germans, he loves American TV — his strong feelings about the series finale of How I Met Your Mother ("The mother dying was a good reminder that the world isn't a great place").

His delusions are legen. dary.

While the idea of neo-Nazis targeting hipsters, a group already known for thinking that they're better than everyone, and getting them to join their hateful fold is alarming, it has yet to gain much traction. While — horrendously — the number of hate crimes is on the rise across Europe, Rogers reports that the number of people in Germany with extreme-right sympathies has actually decreased dramatically in the last 12 years, going from 9.7 to 5.6 percent — a statistic that has left young neo-Nazis feeling rather persecuted.

"We're the new Jews in Germany," Schroeder told Rolling Stone, "except we don't wear stars."Author of "The Sixth Extinction," Elizabeth Kolbert, talks to Ezra Klein about the next mass extinction. What follows is a transcript of their conversation.

Elizabeth Kolbert: A mass extinction is defined as a moment in time — geologically speaking, a short moment in time — when the diversity of life on Earth plummets. One very well-known paleontologist has described the whole history of life as long periods of boredom, interrupted occasionally by panic. And these are the moments of panic.

Your chances as a species of going extinct at any given moment are very, very low, except during moments of mass extinction, when they skyrocket. In the case of the five major mass extinctions of the last half billion years, roughly three-quarters of all species have been eliminated at those moments. Then, after that, diversity starts to tick up again, but it takes somewhere usually between five and 10 million years for that recovery process to take place.

Ezra Klein: And human beings might be causing another mass extinction.

Elizabeth Kolbert: Yes. We're really inured to extinction. We see stories all day. There was just a story, I think it was today, about how lemurs, 90% of all lemur species on Madagascar are endangered. Many are critically endangered, down to like 18 individuals. So we're just like, "Oh, another extinction," as if that's something that happens all the time.

What history shows us is that if you, Ezra Klein, should not see even one species going extinct in the course of your lifetime. But you're a young man and species have already gone extinct in your lifetime. So something really unusual is going on. You should not be able to see a single species of mammal go extinct in your lifetime.

Ezra Klein: What level of die off do you need for something to be a mass extinction, or even a minor mass extinction?

You should not be able to see a single species of mammal go extinct in your lifetime.

Elizabeth Kolbert: Well, the minor mass extinction is a little bit fuzzy, but the major ones, the five — they're sometimes called the big five — the cutoff, if you will, is roughly 3/4 of all species on the planet disappear in a relatively short amount of time.

Ezra Klein: Conventional wisdom is that the mass extinction that led to the death of the dinosaurs was an asteroid hitting the earth. But what other kinds of events, and recognizing that not everything is fully proven, have typically been behind these kinds of extinction events?

Elizabeth Kolbert: It's sort of an unfinished story, as you say. The impact hypothesis — that an asteroid impact was what ended the cretaceous and did in the dinosaurs — was confirmed, only in the 90s. So then people went back, and they sort of thought, well, we're going to find an asteroid impact at all of these junctures. That would make sense. That would be very elegant, and we're going to find that. They really looked hard, and they couldn't find any evidence of that.

There's sort of a consensus that the first one, which happened 440 million years ago, when most of life was confined to the water, was caused by this snap sort of glaciation. The world suddenly got very cold. So that's the working hypothesis there. The most severe mass extinction of all time was about 250 million years ago at the end of the Permian period. It seems pretty clear that was caused by some kind of massive outpouring of carbon dioxide, which caused really serious global warming and acidified the oceans, changed the chemistry of the oceans very radically. One of the really sobering things to think about is that is what we're doing, massively pouring carbon dioxide into the air and into the water. So increasingly, people are drawing parallels between what we're doing and the worst mass extinction.

Ezra Klein: So what do we think happened to cause that outpouring of carbon dioxide? Obviously at that period we didn't have a mob of SUVs roaming the world. So how did all the carbon dioxide get released?

Elizabeth Kolbert: Well, right. You've put your finger on a big scientific mystery, to be honest. It was so much carbon dioxide that it's been very difficult for people to even think of what the source might be. The sort of lead candidate is a burst of volcanism — these volcanic events that happen and create these huge, what are called igneous provinces. A lot of Siberia is covered with this ancient lava from this event. That's sort of the lead candidate. But people who have tried to date that, those dates have not exactly lined up, so we're not sure.

Ezra Klein: One of the really terrifying parts of your almost nonstop-terrifying book, is that the quantity of carbon dioxide that we are emitting at the moment, every day, every year, every month, every year, is not just similar too, but potentially faster than the carbon dioxide emission that led to that extinction.

Elizabeth Kolbert: Yes, yes, yes. Scientists have come up with amazing methods of following these cold cases, a 250-million-year-old murder mystery, teasing out from things like shells how much carbon was poured into the atmosphere at that point in time, and have concluded that the rate that we are pouring CO2 into the air is certainly comparable, and perhaps greater than what was occurring then.

Ezra Klein: This I thought was one of the really fascinating conceptual things in the book that you really emphasize is it’s the rate of change. So the issue is not that the world has not changed before, it's just that it does so in very slow geologic time frames. But that in these mass extinction events, there’s a rate of change that organisms simply can't adapt to. The way you say it in the book is that the rules of life change more rapidly than life can actually keep up. I thought that was fascinating because our intuition around global warming, with our tiny blink of a geologic-eye life spans, is that it is happening slowly. It's not that much warmer it was than a week ago. But in terms of the earth, and in terms of how rapidly species evolve, this is shocking, dramatic, fast-forward, training-montage-style change.

Elizabeth Kolbert: Absolutely. That is really the heart of the book. Eventually, our whole human history will be compressed in geological time down to this very thin layer. Like we look back on the past and see this very thin layer that represents, say, the end of the Cretaceous period. Change is occurring so fast that it will look not dissimilar to an asteroid impact, because the difference between a year, a hundred years, a thousand years is erased in geological time.

Just to give one example that I think people can relate to, or understand, the Arctic ice cap, which has been there for millions of years, is probably going to be gone in your lifetime. You're going to be able to go to the North Pole in the summertime and swim around, paddle around, if you were in the Polar Bear Club, or whatever. That is a huge change on the surface of the earth, and it will occur in the lifetime of a lot of people who are alive today.

Ezra Klein: I want to ask the same question here from 2 different directions. First direction is, I think, in some ways the sort of selfish human direction. People sometimes ask "Who cares?" Who cares if there are fewer kinds of snails or fewer kinds of bats? What are we getting as a race out of having all these different kinds of animals in the tropics?

Elizabeth Kolbert: I get asked that question all the time. I sort of have two answers for it. One is, we're talking about life on this planet. It took tens of millions of years to evolve to this point, and it's unraveling very, very quickly. If you don't care about that, I'm just not sure what you would care about.

But if you still don't care, I would say that at these moments of mass extinction, it seems that the rules of the survival game change. Once very dominant groups, for example, the dinosaurs — the dinosaurs were not doing anything wrong, there was nothing wrong with the dinosaurs — and they were gone, 100 percent of them were gone. We don't know exactly why, why they were particularly vulnerable, but they're gone. When you're changing the rules of the survival game, as we are, then you don't know where that game is going to end up.

Ezra Klein: That gets to the other direction I wanted to ask that question from. I kept imagining, reading your book, this book being read by someone 5,000 years from now. It is such a monstrous thing to imagine that we know that we are killing off a tremendous quantity of life on this planet yet, because it’s inconvenient to think about or difficult to change, we just don't worry about it. I think to somebody with a larger time frame than our own to imagine that there was a species existed here, briefly, and they didn't really care that they were wiping everything else out — I don't think we would be judged kindly by that society.

Elizabeth Kolbert: No. I don't think we would. Obviously, I'm going to argue, having written on this subject, that we shouldn't be judged kindly. One of the scientists that I went out with to the Great Barrier Reef, a guy named Ken Caldeira, who's at Stanford, made the point to me when we were out on the reef, "Look, if the Romans, whom we feel a pretty significant connection to, had burned through all the fossil fuels the way we are burning through them now, this reef would not exist. It would already be gone."

At the rate that we are burning through fossil fuels, there are very, very robust predictions that coral reefs will start to disappear around the middle of this century. There will be no more coral reefs by the end of this century. We are not that far from the Romans. And yet, had they done what we did, the world would be a totally different place.

Ezra Klein: Is this kind of die off a warning system for us, too? There's a lot we actually can't survive: earthquakes, fires, tsunamis. In the face of really tremendous natural disaster or change, our capacity to endure is not always what we'd hoped. Back in 2006, when you wrote your last book, the global goal was to keep warming under 2 degrees Celsius. It now looks very clear that we're going to blow by that. We may go up to 4 degrees Celsius. It's plausible that we could go higher over the next couple hundred years. That's a swing comparable in size to the swing that produced the Ice Age. It isn't obvious to me on the kind of rate of change we're doing that, particularly if things don't go exactly as we hope on the innovation curve in the next hundred years, that we're going to have such an easy time handling it.

Elizabeth Kolbert: There are two levels at which you have to consider the future of human beings and humanity. One is on the level of the species. Species can survive if a few individuals survive. If a few dinosaurs had survived, we might well still have dinosaurs.

But then we have human society, which is much more vulnerable, and much more interconnected than random pockets of people. Many people who are looking at this issue would say, okay, what's really under very serious risk here, what we're really, really putting at risk, is not necessarily our own survival as a species. Because we are very clever, and there are a lot of us, and we live all over the planet. Most species do not. But our society depends on stability. If you start really destabilizing the natural systems on which we depend, destabilizing the climate, we just don't know what's going to happen with that.

Ezra Klein: The book has this fascinating dimension where it's this incredibly beautiful travelogue of the apocalypse for a lot of species. It reminded me of that book that was big a couple years ago, "100 Places to See Before You Die." This is like "A Dozen Places You Have to See Before We Destroy Them." In those travels, what was the most hopeful thing you saw, or that you heard, along the way?

Elizabeth Kolbert: That's a really good question. I went to the Amazon — it's not actually in the book — but I went out into the forest with the people who are actually trying to incentivize people not to chop down the rain forest, not to illegally log. We talked to some of these people who used to make a living, and it wasn't a good living, to be honest, illegally logging. For a relatively small amount of money, they had been converted to people protecting the forest. That was really a great experience, and a moving experience.

It was a very small scale thing. It would have to be ratcheted up by a million-fold, or whatever. But it was a hopeful thing that people who had seen themselves as having an investment in cutting down the forest could turn within a relatively short amount of time to seeing themselves as having an investment in not cutting down the forest. I think that there are ways to shift our thinking.

This text has been lightly edited for clarity.Allen Frances is a psychiatrist who wrote the rules for diagnosing personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The DSM is the No. 1 tool mental health professionals have for making diagnoses.

Frances, a professor emeritus at Duke, doesn’t mince words about what he thinks of mental health professionals who are now using the DSM to diagnose President Donald Trump with a mental disorder. “What’s going on is bullshit,” he says.

Some mental health experts believe Trump has a severe mental disorder

Frances is talking about the recent Change.org petition — now signed by more than 20,000 people — headlined “Mental Health Professionals Declare Trump Is Mentally Ill And Must Be Removed.” But it’s also an ongoing discussion: Ever since the primaries, mental health professionals have been weighing in on Trump’s psychology — in Atlantic cover stories, in Vanity Fair, and on Twitter. It’s become something of a parlor game.

The Change.org petition strikes a louder note than many of these pieces. It’s not just saying Trump exhibits the personality trait of narcissism but also that he has a “serious mental illness.” The petition was started by John Gartner, a clinical psychologist and former Johns Hopkins professor. He’s convinced Trump suffers from an array of personality disorders, including narcissistic personality disorder, that makes him unfit for office and a danger to the world. “I would bet my life of my children on it [the diagnosis],” Gartner says. “That’s how confident I am.”

If you go down the list of diagnosing criteria for the disorder — which include things like “has a grandiose sense of self-importance” and “requires excessive admiration” — it does sound a lot like Donald Trump. But it’s not necessarily so simple.

Is it an illness if there’s no self-harm?

What’s missing in Gartner’s diagnosis, according to Frances, is the key element to diagnosing all mental illness: suffering.

“Everyone has a personality,” Frances says. “It’s not wrong to have a personality; it’s not mentally ill to have a personality. It’s only a disorder when it causes extreme distress, suffering, and impairment.”

Trump’s willingness to lie and endless self-promotion are traits that have, so far, worked out largely to his advantage. He’s president of the United States, after all.

But people who have a true narcissistic personality disorder, Frances explains, experience a crash of some sort, even if they can’t see it for themselves. They’ll lose their jobs, their spouses and children will abandon them, and their “bubble of grandiosity [will] burst,” he says. “They feel absolutely miserable, can’t function, can’t face the world.” (Research has found that a narcissistic personality can, to an extent, help you move up in the world.)

The American Psychiatric Association has a longstanding taboo on evaluating public figures from afar. It’s called the Goldwater Rule, named after an infamous magazine article in which politician Barry Goldwater’s psychological stability was assessed by thousands of psychiatrists. The rule forbids psychiatrists, who are medical doctors, from making judgments about a public figure’s mental health without personally evaluating them.

But the temptation to break it is always strong in presidential election years. The APA issued a warning to its members this past August, reminding them that “breaking the Goldwater Rule is irresponsible, potentially stigmatizing, and definitely unethical.” (Some in the psychiatric community believe the rule unproductively limits doctors’ free speech.)

Psychologists don’t have such a rule, and Frances — who supports the Goldwater Rule and generally thinks mental illnesses are overdiagnosed — worries that when the petitioners and others call Trump mentally ill, they stigmatize people with psychological problems. They can also distract from the more objective criticisms you can make of his presidency. “Call him a liar, call him evil, call him a threat to democracy, call him impulsive, call him ignorant — these labels are all absolutely true — but saying he has a mental disorder doesn’t really add force to the argument,” Frances says.

Gartner — who has a PhD and treats patients in a private practice — wholeheartedly disagrees with Frances’s position. “The thing about people with personality disorders … they don’t have distress related to their disorder; they cause distress in other people,” he says. “They’re in complete denial about the nature of their illness or even having an illness.”

Gartner feels like he has a “duty to warn” the country about Trump’s potentially pathological behavior. “The duty to warn someone who might be a potential victim of violence trumps — pun intended — all other ethical requirements,” he says. “We often make diagnoses through the reports of informants.”

And in Trump’s case, he says there’s no better source than the public record to prove he is ill. Gartner points out:

Trump’s inability to let go of perceived slights, like the time he publicly attacked the Muslim parents of a fallen soldier

His willingness to exploit the weak in the case of Trump University, which sold individuals on the promise that they could become self-starting real estate entrepreneurs with just a few (very expensive) classes

His leaked comments bragging to Billy Bush about sexual assault and his lack of remorse

His “irritability and aggressiveness” (another diagnostic criterion for personality disorders), like his reportedly hostile conversation with the prime minister of Australia

Gartner says he doesn’t need to sit down with Trump to recognize this is a dangerous pattern of behavior.

I asked Gartner if it’s possible he’s engaging in some motivated reasoning. That because he dislikes Trump’s politics, he’s looking for the signs of mental illness while discounting complicating factors. He denied it. “I didn’t like George W. Bush, and I bitched and moaned all through his presidency, but I didn’t think he was crazy,” he says. When I asked whether he could imagine a Republican psychologist coming to a different conclusion from him. After all, there are many in this country who like Donald Trump, and are approving of his job performance so far. He said, “I’m sure that’s possible.”

But “as someone who has been an expert and a teacher of severe personality disorders in 35 years, this is the worst case I have seen in my career,” he says.

The truth is the line between strong personality and mental illness isn’t always clear — even for the experts

So who’s right here? Gartner or Frances?

I called Joshua Miller, a psychologist who directs the University of Georgia’s clinical training program and studies the differences between personality and disorder, for a third perspective. He says that in many cases, it can be hard to tell where personality ends and illness begins.

That’s because these days, most mental illnesses exist on a spectrum. “Even disorders we thought ... you either had it or not — categorical things like schizophrenia — we now know are much more like spectrum disorders,” he says. “You can have some schizophrenic traits, but not all.” And that’s especially true of personality disorders, which he says are all just extreme manifestations of otherwise “normal” personality traits.

The question What is a mental disorder? he says is “probably one of the most intractable debates that exists. And it’s playing out with Trump now.”

The DSM is meant to standardize treatment and care of mental illness. It’s meant to decrease the subjectivity of making a diagnosis. And it’s the best tool the profession has.

But the human brain avoids standardization. The truth is, Miller says, “there is no magical point where you go from having sub-threshold narcissism to a disorder. We can make a cutoff, but we should acknowledge it is arbitrary. ... There is no sharp divide between ... a shitty personality and a disorder.” All of our personalities cause us and others harm every now and then. It takes an extremely clear and consistent pattern of harm to reach the level of a diagnosis.

Many people make bad or immoral decisions and do not suffer from any malady. As psychologist Cedar Riener wrote for Vox, calling Trump’s behavior an illness may be an easy escape from answering hard questions about politics today:

Efforts to label Trump with a mental disorder let us off the hook in thinking about the kinds of personalities our culture rewards — and about the state of our politics. The very traits that many claim are toxic and dysfunctional have not only failed to harm him but have contributed to his success.

Perhaps elites are particularly concerned about Trump’s stability because he does not act, talk, or think like them. More information would help a diagnosis. Though Trump has a long public record of worrisome behavior, these episodes still represent thin slices of his life.

Trump has a personal life, relationships with children and grandchildren, that’s obscured from view. What other narrative about his mental health would those relationships reveal? “You always want collateral information,” Miller says. “If I was seeing a patient for anything, I would want to talk to their spouse or children, if possible. ... You might get more nuanced information.”

At the New York Times, psychiatrist Richard Friedman explains that a comprehensive clinical screening could pick up on other problems causing the narcissistic behavior — like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or bipolar disorder.

Because of the incomplete picture — and because of the damaging potential to stigmatize mental illness or, worse, make the field of psychology a partisan piñata — I’m more convinced by Frances’s point of view. A case against Trump should be grounded in his visible actions, which are clear enough, and not in the ultimately unknowable configuration of his mind.

And even if Trump’s behavior is purely the result of his personality, that’s still consequential. Psychologists generally feel personality is a stable trait. And that means our past behavior predicts our future behavior. What’s more, research finds ascending the ladder of power only magnifies your personality traits, and makes you more likely to act in accordance with them. You don’t need a diagnosis to say Trump has a troubling pattern of behavior or conclude that pattern is bound to continually repeat.

I asked Frances if he could rewrite his diagnostic guide in the DSM, what changes he would make. “I would have put in a clearer injunction against using the diagnosis in any situation other than the office setting,” he says. “For the 5 percent of the population who have a severe mental disorder, the boundary is absolutely clear-cut, but [with] many people who have mild to moderate psychiatric problems, the boundary with normality is extremely fuzzy, and moving. That’s why it’s always wise to be cautious and underdiagnose.”This isn't the first time for several 2017 Academy Award film acting nominees.

See the entire listToday, Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States. But the story of how he managed to become the most powerful man in the world — why Americans were drawn to someone with authoritarian tendencies and a jarring lack of relevant experience — remains largely unresolved.

The conventional wisdom, spelled out in gallons of digital ink, is economic. Trump's rise, the story goes, is the product of economic losses suffered by the white working class. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are estimated to have been lost due to globalization in recent decades, with industries like manufacturing absorbing much of the pain.

That’s created an ocean of angry and frustrated people — primarily blue-collar and primarily white — who are susceptible to the appeal of an unapologetically nationalist leader promising to bring back what they feel has been taken away.

"In the nineties, President Bill Clinton embraced globalization as the overarching solution to the country's problems," the New Yorker's George Packer wrote during the campaign. "But the new century defied the optimistic predictions of elites, and during this election, in a nationalistic backlash, many Americans...have rebelled."

Most of the stories like Packer's focused overwhelmingly on Americans: They went to Trump rallies, visited post-industrial towns, and profiled Trump voters. But this approach misses a critical global context. It's tempting to think of Trump as something uniquely American, but the truth is that his similar far-right populists are gaining popularity throughout the Western world.

In Hungary, the increasingly authoritarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has started building a wall to keep out immigrants and holding migrants in detention camps where guards have been filmed flinging food at them as if they were zoo animals. In Italy, the anti-immigrant Northern League, led by a politician who has attacked the pope for calling for dialogue with Muslims, is polling at more than three times its 2013 level, making it the country’s third most popular party. And in Finland, the Finns Party — which wants to dramatically slash immigration numbers and keep out many non-Europeans — is part of the government. Its leader, Timo Soini, is the country’s foreign minister.

These politicians share Trump’s populist contempt for the traditional political elite. They share his authoritarian views on crime and justice. But most importantly, they share his xenophobia: They despise immigrants, vowing to close the borders to refugees and economic migrants alike, and are open in their belief that Muslims are inherently dangerous.

These parties’ values are too similar, and their victories coming too quickly, for their success to be coincidental. Their platforms, a right-wing radicalism somewhere between traditional conservatism and the naked racism of the Nazis and Ku Klux Klan, have attracted widespread support in countries with wildly different cultures and histories.

And it is this anger, this fear of difference and social change, that drives them — not, as the conventional wisdom would have it, some kind of backlash to globalization. A vast universe of academic research suggests the real sources of the far-right's appeal are anger over immigration and a toxic mix of racial and religious intolerance. That conclusion is supported by an extraordinary amount of social science, from statistical analyses that examine data on how hundreds of thousands of Europeans look at immigrants to ground-level looks at how Muslim immigration affects municipal voting, and on to books on how, when, and why ethnic conflicts erupt.

This research finds that, contrary to what you’d expect, the "losers of globalization" aren’t the ones voting for these parties. Hardcore supporters of Trump and his global peers are not the people profiled endlessly in the Rust Belt, who lament the loss of factory jobs. What unites far-right politicians and their supporters, on both sides of the Atlantic, is a set of regressive attitudes toward difference. Racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia — and not economic anxiety — are their calling cards.

The ongoing surge of immigrants — especially those who venerate a different prophet or have a darker skin tone — is triggering a fierce right-wing backlash around the West. In the US, the anger about Latino immigration has linked up to another racial anxiety: Many white Americans believe their privileged status is being eroded by the past half-century of moves toward treating African American as truly equal citizens.

Donald Trump is a manifestation of this backlash, as are Brexit and the surge of support for far-right European parties. They show the extent of white Christian anger — the privileged who are furious that their privileges are being stripped away by those they view as outside interlopers.

It is that fury over social change that offers the best explanation we have for why the forces of intolerance are currently on the rise in the West. If we want to understand the world we live in today — and the one we’ll be inhabiting for years to come — we need to understand how immigration and intolerance are transforming the way white Christians vote. We need to understand that the battle between racist nationalism and liberal cosmopolitanism will be one of the defining ideological struggles of the 21st century. And we need to understand that Donald Trump is not an accident. He’s a harbinger.

I. How the resentment of the privileged can change politics

At the beginning of World War II, the small Baltic country of Lithuania saw two major shocks. First, in 1940, it was invaded and conquered by the Soviet Union. Just the next year, in June 1941, it was invaded and conquered by the Nazis.

In the city of Kaunas, the Nazi invasion triggered a spontaneous wave of attacks against Jewish residents, who had gained an unusual amount of power under the Soviets. The perpetrators weren’t the Nazis, who hadn’t yet had time to set up. It was the people of Kaunas themselves.

Prior to the Nazi invasion, Kaunas had a reputation for tolerance; one Jewish resident called it a "paradise." Yet afterward, the "tolerant" citizens of Kaunas tortured, humiliated, and slaughtered their Jewish neighbors. Roughly 3,800 Jews were murdered in just four days.

Just 65 miles away, in the capital of Vilnius, things were different. The city had seen pogroms in the past, so you would have expected something like the horrors of Kaunas. Yet the citizens of Vilnius mostly left the Jews alone. Why?



As recently as the early 2000s, scholars didn't have a good answer to the question of why ethnic violence tore through one city without hitting the other.

Roger Petersen, a political scientist at MIT, decided to try to find one. A year after arriving at MIT he published a book, 2002’s Understanding Ethnic Violence, that contained the first truly solid framework for understanding the difference between Kaunas and Vilnius — and, as it turns out, the right-wing backlash we’re seeing across the world today.

Prior to Petersen, scholars often thought of ethnic violence in terms of threat (one group turns to violence when it feels threatened by another) or in terms of "ancient hatreds" (long-simmering resentments that have left the groups wanting to kill each other). Petersen argued that while these explanations were correct in some cases, they were incomplete. Clearly, neither theory can explain the difference between Kaunas and Vilnius. Nor did they fit several other case studies in Petersen’s book.

In order to fully understand why ethnic violence happens, he argued, we need to appreciate the role of resentment: the feeling of injustice on the part of a privileged portion of society when it sees power slipping into the hands of a group that hadn't previously held it. Drawing on social psychology, he theorized that one of the underappreciated causes of ethnic violence was a change in the legal and political status of majority and minority ethnic groups.

According to Petersen, that change in status comes from a sense of injustice. Members of dominant groups simply believe they deserve to be the dominant force in their societies, and resent those challenging their positions at the top of the pyramid.

"Any group that’s been dominant — well, it’s not that easy for them not to be dominant anymore," Petersen tells me.

This helped explain the puzzle of Kaunas and Vilnius. In Kaunas, the Soviet invasion in 1940 had politically empowered local Jews, who had occupied leadership positions in the Communist Party prior to the invasion and ended up with plum Soviet jobs as a result. This sparked intense feelings of resentment on the part of Kaunas residents, resulting in the vicious pogrom. In Vilnius, by contrast, non-Jewish ethnic Poles held most leadership positions. The Soviet invasion didn’t empower Jews on a large scale, and thus failed to create any resentment toward them.

In his book, Petersen argues that his theory helps explain the causes of other cases of ethnic violence in Eastern Europe, including the carnage in the Balkans in the 1990s. Other scholars have since found that it could be used to understand communal violence elsewhere in the world.

A 2010 paper published in the journal World Politics tested Petersen’s theory, looking at 157 cases of ethnic violence in nations ranging from Chad to Lebanon. It found strong statistical correlations between a group’s decline in status and the likelihood that it turns to violence against another group.

"Any group that’s been dominant — well, it’s not that easy for them not to be dominant anymore"

What does any of this have to do with Donald Trump?

Petersen predicts that ethnic struggle should play out differently when governments are weak, as in the wake of a Nazi invasion, and when they’re strong, as in modern France. In nations with strong and legitimate governments, the loss of status by a privileged group is extremely unlikely to produce large-scale ethnic slaughter.

But "resentment" on the part of the previously dominant group doesn’t just dissipate; it is simply channeled into another way of clinging to power and preventing another group from attaining it. Like, say, elections and government policies.

"Dominance," Petersen writes, "is sought by shaping the nature of the state rather than through violence."

Several case studies support his theory. Later in the book, he examines post–Cold War politics in Lithuania and the other two Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia (which had been retaken and annexed by the Soviet Union later in World War II). In Latvia and Estonia, the ethnic Russian minority was large and had been politically elevated above local ethnic majorities; in Lithuania, the Russian minority was small.

Violence, for a number of reasons, was not a feasible option. So after attaining independence, democratic governments in Latvia and Estonia passed a raft of discriminatory measures against Russians. This included stripping ethnic Russian citizenship, booting Russians out of the police force, and changing language policies to reduce the use of Russian in official government transactions.

Notably, you saw little of this in Lithuania. That’s because there was a much stronger sense of resentment toward ethnic Russians in the other two Baltic states. The status reversal under the Soviets — empowering the Russian minority at the expense of the previously dominant majority — led the ethnic majority to crack down on Russian rights as soon as they could.

While Petersen’s book focuses on Eastern Europe, his framework applies to all different kinds of countries. So when post–World War II Europe experienced a massive wave of immigration, in large part from nonwhite countries, Petersen’s work would predict a major backlash.

What you saw in many of these countries was a nonwhite, heavily Muslim population moving in and occupying social roles that had previously been reserved for white Christians.

This was the ultimate change in social hierarchy. Nonwhites, who had historically been Europe’s colonial subjects and slaves, were now becoming its citizens. They weren’t just moving into Europe; they were changing its society.

The question wasn’t whether there would be a massive electoral backlash. It was when.

II. Meet the father of today’s far right

For Jean-Marie Le Pen, arguably the father of Europe’s far-right political movement, the backlash began in earnest in 1984. His political party, the Front National (FN) won about 11 percent of the French national vote in the 1984 elections to the European Parliament. It was the first major electoral victory for a party of its kind.

Le Pen had founded the party 12 years earlier. It was a populist party, one that argued that ordinary people were being exploited by a corrupt class of cosmopolitan elites. They were also authoritarian, constantly warning of the dangers of crime and the need for a harsh state response.

But above all else, the FN was xenophobic. Its members believed the postwar wave of immigrants threatened the French nation itself; stopping more from coming in was the only thing that could save the country from being overrun.

"Immigration is the symbolic starting point for the debate of the future of the French nation," FN politician Jean-Yves Le Gallou once said.

It had a clever strategy for masking its true beliefs. FN’s leaders knew that overt appeals to white racial superiority and opposition to democracy had become taboo. The FN chose a different route, positioning itself not as defenders of the white race generally but instead as protectors of French values specifically. Its slogan was "France for the French."

Everyone knew what the dog whistle meant, of course. The FN’s rhetoric functioned almost exactly like Trump’s claims that Mexicans are "rapists" who are "bringing crime" to the US — that is, to signal to xenophobes that it stood with them without overtly espousing white supremacy.

In fact, the FN’s rhetoric is often quite similar to Trump’s. "Tomorrow the immigrants will move in with you, eat your soup, and they will sleep with your wife, your daughter or your son," Le Pen famously warned in 1984.

The party’s triumph that year proved that a new kind of far-right politics, with an electoral strategy rooted in xenophobic populism, could succeed in the postwar era. According to Matthew Goodwin, an expert on right-wing extremism at the University of Kent, others who shared the FN’s views raced to form their own versions of the party, either by creating entirely new organizations or by launching hostile takeovers of old ones.

In 1986, Jörg Haider — a firebrand who once praised Hitler for having a "proper employment policy" — took over Austria’s Freedom Party (FPO), transforming it to a xenophobic party along the FN’s lines. In 1999, the FPO came in second in Austria’s parliamentary elections, joining a government led by the center-right People’s Party.

In 2001, a Dutch sociology professor named Pim Fortuyn launched a new political movement — oriented entirely around opposition to Muslim immigration. "I don't hate Islam," Fortuyn once said. "I consider it a backward culture."

By 2002, Fortuyn’s new party, the Pim Fortuyn List, was second in the national polls. He was assassinated by a far-left activist that year but was succeeded by another charismatic populist, Geert Wilders.

Wilders, who declared in July that "I don’t want more Muslims in the Netherlands and I am proud to say that," leads the third-largest bloc in the Dutch parliament. Wilders’s party, the ironically named Party for Freedom, is consistently leading the polls ahead of the March 2017 national elections.

These are just a few examples of FN-style parties finding success. You can list many others, from Norway’s Progress Party (currently a member of the governing coalition) to the Sweden Democrats (leading in the most recent poll for the 2018 election) to Germany’s Alternatives for Deutschland (which in May local elections won the highest vote totals of any German far-right party since the Nazis).

In France, meanwhile, Le Pen’s daughter Marine has shed many of her father’s most controversial statements — his denial of the Holocaust, for instance — and turned herself into the kinder, gentler face of the party he founded decades earlier. A recent poll found her running neck and neck with former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and former French Prime Minister Alain Juppé, beating the former by 2 points, 29 percent to 27, and trailing the latter by just 4 points, with Juppé notching 33 percent to her 29.

III. It’s the xenophobia, stupid

Far-right party platforms differ from country to country, including on major social issues like feminism and economic issues like the size of the welfare state. The one issue every single one agrees on is hostility to immigration, particularly when the immigrants are nonwhite and Muslim.

"What unites the radical right is their focus on immigration," Elisabeth Ivarsflaten, a professor at the University of Bergen in Norway who studies the far right, told me in a recent interview. The widespread popular unease about those migrants is a key source of their appeal.

Start with the timing. The 1980s were a critical time for European immigration. It’s when immigrant families came over in large numbers, rather than just the guest workers who had been allowed under previous laws. That brought white Europeans in contact with nonwhite, heavily Muslim immigrant populations for the first time.

"Until then, they [the immigrants] were mostly secluded; it was mostly men who worked in factories, all together, and [lived] quite close to where they worked. When the families came over, they started to move into residential areas, working-class areas in particular," Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia scholar, told me. "That was one of the key developments [for the far right] — the visibility of multiculturalism, which was not addressed by the mainstream parties."

A 2012 paper by a group of Swiss and Austrian researchers found direct support for this hypothesis. After poring through decades of local demographic statistics from across Austria, they found that the increase in support for the country’s leading far-right party was strongly correlated with a community’s increase in immigrant population.

"Our results suggest that voters worry about a changing ethnic and cultural composition in their neighborhoods and schools," they write.

Ivarsflaten’s research came to similar conclusions. In a 2008 paper, she looked at data on vote shares for seven European far-right parties, to try to figure out why people voted for them. She found that a person’s support for restricting immigration was "close to a perfect predictor" of one’s likelihood of voting for a far-right party.

By contrast, people’s views on other political questions — like economics or trust in government — didn’t have nearly the same predictive value. You can see this in the following chart from her paper. The Y-axis is the probability of voting for a far-right party; the X-axis is the level of support for restrictive immigration policies, right-wing economic views, and the like. The difference between immigration policy preferences and the others is striking:

(Javier Zarracina/Vox)

"This study therefore to a large extent settles the debate about which grievances unite all populist right parties," Ivarsflaten concluded. "The answer is the grievances arising from Europe’s ongoing immigration crisis."

Eight years later, after running tests on newer data for a forthcoming paper, Ivarsflaten believes the thesis still holds.

Now, the fact that immigration is the leading driver of the far right’s rise doesn’t explain why Europeans resent immigrants so much. Luckily, scholars have also looked at that question. What they found was fairly conclusive: European whites believe that immigration poses a threat to "traditional" European culture.

They express the exact kind of grievances that Petersen’s "resentment" theory would predict: a sense of anger at the social order being overturned by immigrants, particularly those from Muslim countries.

George Washington University’s John Sides and UC Berkeley’s Jack Citrin combed through data on 20 European countries, a sample of 38,339 individual people, to see what best predicted negative attitudes toward immigrants.

Economic factors didn’t seem to matter much. They found little association between the national unemployment level and the prevalence of negative attitudes toward immigration, or an individual’s income and their likelihood of holding such attitudes.

But when they tested measures of cultural resentment — people’s evaluations of statements like, "It is better for a country if almost everyone shares the same customs and traditions" — the results were very different. White European Christians opposed to multiculturalism were overwhelmingly more likely to be immigration skeptics.

When you get into the details, the link between anti-immigrant sentiment and cultural anxiety becomes even clearer.

A group of Belgian researchers examined support for their own country’s far-right party, Vlaams Blok, at the municipal and national levels. Instead of just looking at the impact of the presence of "immigrants" in a particular area, they looked at different types of immigrants.

Specifically, they separated out immigrants from Turkey and Africa’s Muslim-majority Maghreb region, which includes such countries as Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. They found that the presence of Muslim immigrants correlated well with increased support for Vlaams Blok, but the presence of non-Muslim immigrant populations didn’t.

"It is not so much the presence of foreigners, but rather the fear of the Islamic way of living that leads to extreme right voting," they write.

What happened in Europe is straightforward: An unprecedented wave of nonwhite, heavily Muslim immigration made many European whites uneasy. Le Pen, Haider, Fortuyn, and the rest developed a mode of politics designed to weaponize this backlash — to take inchoate anti-immigrant sentiment and turn it into votes through heated nationalist and anti-Islam rhetoric.

If that sounds like the rhetoric of America's new president, it should.

IV. Making the hard right great again

For most of this time, the United States seemed immune to the rise of European style-nationalist populism and all of its bigoted and Islamophobic overtones. Nativists like Pat Buchanan found some electoral success but never came close to winning national elections.

It was easy to believe that America was, for some ideological reason, immune to the fever raging in Europe. But the truth was that America was sheltered more by an accident of political institutions than anything else.

America’s electoral system strongly favors a two-party system, more so than any European country. For one thing, American states have ballot access laws that make life tough for third parties. For another, the US doesn’t do proportional representation, where a party gets seats in the legislature proportional to its national vote percentage. It’s a lot harder for a third party to win a majority in specific congressional districts or states than it is to for them to win a reasonable percentage of the national vote.

So when the FN won 11 percent of the national popular vote in the 1984 European election, that translated to 10 of France’s seats in the European Parliament. But when US presidential candidate Ross Perot won 18.9 percent of the popular vote in 1992, that translated into exactly zero votes in the Electoral College.

The GOP was primed for a white nationalist takeover

Trump has proved that these institutional differences were suppressing only the symptoms, not the disease. Beneath the surface, the same white revolt we saw in Europe was brewing in the United States — at more or less the same time.

The American story dates, roughly, to 1964. That year, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act — and the Republicans nominated an opponent of the legislation, Barry Goldwater, to the presidency.

The Johnson-Goldwater race cemented a long-running transformation of the Democratic Party into a multi-ethnic party of civil rights, forcing out the white Southerners who had been the party’s base since the 19th century.

These white Southerners defected to the GOP. This had a critical effect on American politics: It concentrated the nation’s most racist voters in one party.

University of Michigan’s Nicholas Valentino and Berkeley’s David Sears looked at 40 years of election data in the US, starting in the 1970s and running until 2005, focusing on "racial resentment" scores — a test political scientists use to measure racial bias. They found that whites living in former Confederate states scored consistently higher on this test of racial bias than whites in other parts of the country.

Moreover, they write, "racial [resentment] has become linked more closely to presidential voting and party identification over time in the white South, while its impact has remained constant elsewhere." As the years have gone on, voters with high levels of racial resentment have become more and more likely to pull the lever for Republicans in the South — but not in other parts of the country. That suggests the post-1964 move toward the GOP in the South really was motivated by the parties’ shifting stances on race.

Mass Latino immigration intensified this "racial sorting." Between 1980 and 2008, the foreign-born Hispanic population quadrupled — from about 4.2 million to 17.8 million. Democrats, the immigrant-friendly center-left party, were better positioned to take advantage of the growing Latino vote.

The white Americans most hostile to Latino immigration, by contrast, switched to the GOP — driven in part by negative media coverage of immigration like stories about violent crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants.

"When media coverage of immigration uses the Latino threat narrative, the likelihood of whites identifying with the Democratic Party decreases and the probability of favoring Republicans increase," political scientists Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan Hajnal write in their book White Backlash. "As immigration’s impact on the United States has grown, whites have fled to the Republican Party in ever-larger numbers."

And so the Republican Party changed. Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, charted Republican and Democratic feelings of "warmness" toward blacks (rated on a 1-100 scale). He found a consistent gap, one that has widened considerably in recent years:

Drutman’s results were similar for feelings toward Hispanics:

That meant the GOP was primed for a white nationalist takeover. While the country was getting more diverse and tolerant, the GOP was getting whiter and more intolerant. The more that voters with negative views of Latinos and African Americans concentrated in one party, the more clout they had inside that party — even as more and more of the country rejected their beliefs.

All it took was an American Le Pen: someone who could rearticulate American bigotry in the post–Jim Crow era in the way the Front National rearticulated French bigotry in the post-Vichy era.

That someone, it turned out, was Donald Trump — who, almost certainly unintentionally, adapted the FN model for an American audience. His celebrity and personal wealth allowed him to circumvent the barriers that usually prevent insurgents from taking over established parties; his distance from the GOP leadership freed him to articulate a new kind of message that turned out to be quite popular with the GOP base.

Like his European counterparts, Trump has eschewed overt discussion of racial superiority. He claims to have "a great relationship with the blacks" and tweets things like, "I love Hispanics!" He also claims to be an American nationalist standing up against a corrupt elite in hoc to "the false song of globalism." One of his favorite descriptions of his worldview is "America First," a slogan coined by World War II–era isolationists and anti-Semites.

Protestations aside, the bigotry that runs through Trump’s rhetoric is pretty blatant. Trump first became a major political figure as leader of the birther movement — the people who questioned whether Barack Obama was really a natural-born US citizen — in 2011, taking advantage of racial anxieties about a black president to turn himself into a GOP power broker. He has claimed that a Mexican judge shouldn’t hear a case involving him because of the judge’s Hispanic background, described life in black communities as an unending hellscape of crime and poverty, and implied that all Muslim immigrants were potential terrorists.

Trump’s signature policy proposals on these issues echo the European far right. Ban Muslim immigration? Fortuyn first suggested it more than a decade ago. Build a wall to keep out migrants? Hungary’s Orban started construction in July 2015 (though he isn’t making Syria pay for it).

This rhetoric was deeply, deeply appealing to the white nationalist wing of the GOP base. Michael Tesler, a professor at the University of California Irvine, took a look at racial resentment scores among Republican primary voters in the past three GOP primaries. In 2008 and 2012, Tesler found, Republican voters who scored higher were less likely to vote for the eventual winner. The more racial bias you harbored, the less likely you were to vote for Mitt Romney or John McCain.

With Trump, the opposite was the case. The more a person saw black people as lazy and undeserving, the more likely they were to vote for the self-proclaimed billionaire.

(Javier Zarracina)

Tesler found similar effects on measures of anti-Hispanic and anti-Muslim prejudice. This shows that Trump isn’t drawing support from the same type of Republicans who were previously picking the party’s winners. He mobilized a new Republican coalition, one dominated by the voters whose political attitudes are driven by prejudice.

"The party’s growing conservatism on matters of race and ethnicity provided fertile ground for Trump’s racial and ethnic appeals to resonate in the primaries," Tesler wrote in the Washington Post in August. "So much so, in fact, that Donald Trump is the first Republican in modern times to win the party’s presidential nomination on anti-minority sentiments."

Multiple other studies have supported Tesler’s findings. An April Pew survey looked at whether Republicans had "warm" or "cold" feelings toward Trump and how they felt about the census projection that the US would be majority nonwhite in 30 years.

It found that 33 percent of Republicans thought this shift would be "bad for the country." These people were also overwhelmingly likely to feel warmly rather than coolly about Trump, by a 63-to-26 margin.

By contrast, the majority of Republicans who had positive or neutral feelings about a "majority-minority" future were more split: 46 percent described themselves as having warm feelings about Trump, while 40 percent described themselves as feeling coolly.

In other words, Trump did overwhelmingly well with Republicans who were scared of a multi-ethnic future, while performing at a pretty low level with other Republicans even as he secured the party’s presidential nomination. His primary campaign disproportionately drew people who fear the demographic trends that would further erode the foundations of white privilege.

This holds true in the overall population as well. Philip Klinkner, a political scientist at New York’s Hamilton College, found that factors like economic pessimism and income were statistically insignificant to Trump’s rise. Instead, his research found that the leading driver was party identification, followed closely by racial resentment.

"Moving from the least to the most resentful view of African Americans increases support for Trump by 44 points, those who think Obama is a Muslim (54 percent of all Republicans) are 24 points more favorable to Trump, and those who think the word ‘violent’ describes Muslims extremely well are about 13 points more pro-Trump than those who think it doesn’t describe them well at all," he writes.

Now, it’s true that Trump has some uniquely American characteristics. For one thing, his reality TV stardom and decades in the public eye give him a celebrity enjoyed by no European far-right leader. Moreover, he didn’t need to import xenophobia from Europe: As scholars like Mudde argue, Trump’s rhetoric draws on a long history of particularly American xenophobia (like Charles Lindbergh’s America First Committee of the early 1940s, which sought to keep the US out of World War II).

But it’s not an accident that Trump and the European far right surged at roughly the same time. Both of them, in different fashions, figured out a core fact of the world: There are a lot of white people in the West who blame distant elites for allowing — or accelerating — their loss of economic and political power.

Trumpism, in other words, is much bigger than Trump.

V. Their first major victory: Brexit

The various far-right electoral successes in Europe showed that white resentment had political power on the continent. But their ability to gain actual political positions has, thus far, been limited. No modern far-right party has outright won a national election in Western Europe.

That didn't mean Europe's far-right parties can’t move their positions into the mainstream — and see them win at the ballot box. Britain’s June vote to leave the European Union was driven by the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Britain’s leading anti-immigration party. While not all Brexit voters were UKIP members, the party was responsible for putting the previously unthinkable idea of Brexit on the docket.

What’s more, UKIP’s xenophobic rhetoric played a critical role in marshaling support for Brexit. Brexit commanded majorities in poorer places like Hull and wealthier ones like Runnymede, suggesting the key factor wasn’t the economy.

Instead, it was culture — specifically, the decline of "traditional" white British culture. Sixty-two percent of "Leave" voters, according to a poll of 12,000 Britons, said that immigration was "a force for ill" in the UK. While large majorities of both black (73 percent) and Asian (67 percent) Britons voted to stay in the EU, a majority of whites voted to leave.

Voters under the age of 34, who research suggests are the least racially prejudiced group in the UK, supported staying in the EU by margins similar to those seen among racial minorities. Sixty percent of voters over age 65, who harbor the highest levels of prejudice, supported leaving.

UKIP’s anti-immigration stance tapped into one of the darkest strands in British society. A 1964 poll found that more than 80 percent of Britons believed there were "too many immigrants" coming to their country. In 1968, Conservative Member of Parliament Enoch Powell gave a now-famous address, known as the "Rivers of Blood" speech, warning that the UK would collapse into American-style racial infighting if immigration weren’t contained. One subsequent poll found that 82 percent of Britons shared Powell’s views.

Those sentiments haven’t gone away over time.

For elderly Britons and other Leave supporters, the common thread was immigration; an IPSOS/MORI poll a week before the Brexit vote found it to be the most salient issue for Leave voters. "Immigration," the poll found, "has now surpassed the economy."

A post-vote analysis, by University of London professor Eric Kaufmann, supported that. Kaufmann attempted to correlate support for Brexit among white Britons with factors like income and political affiliation. Economics played only a small role: He found "almost no statistically significant difference in EU vote intention between rich and poor." Conservative cultural attitudes, like support for the death penalty, were more significant in Kaufmann’s research.

Torsten Bell, director of the UK economic think tank Resolution Foundation, separated out the regions of the UK by their change in average income between 2002 and 2014. If Brexit were mostly about the economy, people who live in areas with stagnant or falling wages (due to globalization or government policy) would be more likely to have voted for Leave.

Except that’s not what Bell found. As you can see in the below chart, his data showed no correlation between a region’s change in income and its share of votes in favor of Brexit.

Alasdair Rae, a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield in the UK, took a different angle on the regional data. He attempted to correlate support for Brexit with the deprivation index, a comprehensive UK government measure of disadvantage that factors in low income, high unemployment, and low levels of education (among other things). He couldn’t find a link:

The conclusion of these researchers, then, is that the Brexit story cannot be told in purely economic terms.

"[T]his isn’t just about the numbers — it’s about culture, outlook, lifestyle and what we feel a sense of belonging to," Bell writes. "That might not be the normal thing for an economic research organisation to say, but it’s true."

VI. Right, what about the economy?

At the same time that Europe and the United States dealt with profound social change, the global economy went through a fundamental transformation. Branko Milanović, a leading economist and expert on global inequality, calls it "the greatest reshuffle of individual incomes since the Industrial Revolution" — and many believe it’s the biggest single cause of the rise of the West’s new far right.

To understand why some people find the economic explanation so compelling, take a look at the following chart of Milanović’s (commonly referred to as the "elephant chart" because it resembles an elephant with its trunk raised). The chart shows changes in income worldwide at different income percentiles, covering the 1988–2008 period. For the global middle class — formerly poor people in China, most prominently — and the global 1 percent, things look good.

But the American and European working and middle classes, the high 70s to mid-80s on Milanović’s chart, have seen no gains — or even seen their income shrink.

In the West, this reversed decades of progress. The following chart, made with data from Thomas Piketty’s magisterial Capital in the 21st Century, shows the amount of wealth concentrated among the American and European upper classes over time. Between 1910 and 1950, inequality fell rapidly. But starting around 1970, wealth inequality began to rise again. Wages for most American workers during that period were stagnant.

However you explain these shifts — and there’s huge debate over that — the result is clear: In the developed world, the rich are getting much richer, while a huge chunk of the working class is being left behind.

For some analysts, this change in the economy is directly linked to the rise of the radical right. They argue that white voters are attracted to racist parties because of their economic problems, that hard times make them look for someone to blame for their problems. Minorities and immigrants are easy scapegoats, leading to an increase in racism and support for the far right.

The Washington Post’s Jeff Guo rounded up a number of studies linking economic stress to surging support for conservative and anti-immigrant parties. One such paper, by political scientists Peter Burns and James Gimpel, looked at American polls from the 1990s and found that hard economic times correlated with increased expressions of racism.

"The effect of economic hardship is to activate prejudices that are latent, adding fuel to the fire of preexisting views," they write.

In the broad brush, the theory that economic anxiety, and not a breakdown in status hierarchies, is driving the radical right makes sense. The only way to find out which is more important is to test the two theories: to match up their predictions and see which ones better fit the data we have about Trump, Le Pen, and the rest.

The most systematic effort to do this, to date, comes from Harvard University’s Pippa Norris and the University of Michigan’s Ronald Inglehart. Norris and Inglehart looked at 12 years of European Social Survey data, surveying a whopping 294,000 respondents, to figure out the relationship between economic and cultural grievances and support for the European far-right.

They found something startling: Earlier research suggesting the European far right draws support from globalization’s losers was simply wrong.

"The strongest populist support," they write, "remains among the petty bourgeoisie — typically small proprietors like self-employed plumbers, or family owned small businesses, and mom-and-pop shopkeepers — not among the category of low-waged, unskilled manual workers."

Only one of the five economic variables they tested — employment status — correlated well with support for the populist right. That held true even when they controlled for variables like age, sex, ethnic identity, and minority status.

Then they set up an alternative model, one that tested whether five distinct cultural factors — like anti-immigrant attitudes and authoritarian values — would predict support for the far right. Every single one did.

In short: There was no good evidence that economic anxiety was driving cultural resentment. Economics played some contributing role, but it seems much more likely that the far-right backlash is about what the far-rightists say it’s about: immigration, race, and culture.

"[Populists’] greatest support is concentrated among the older generation, men, the religious, majority populations, and the less educated — sectors generally left behind by progressive tides of cultural value change," they write.

The Norris and Inglehart study is not an outlier. In their paper, they discuss a number of other studies that have come to similar conclusions about the priority of cultural concerns over economic ones. When you talk to experts on this topic, they tell you something similar: Most media accounts overstate the role of economic trouble in the far right’s rise, and understate the role of cultural change.

"If you look at where the populists have done well, they’ve actually done well in richer countries, and in the countries where they’ve done well, they’ve done well in the richer regions," Ivarsflaten, the University of Bergen scholar, told me.

She also points to a gender gap — men are much more likely to support the far right than women — as a major problem for the "left behind" thesis.

"If you think of women as workers who usually have lower-paying jobs, and are also in competition with immigrants in, say, the service sector or health care sector ... it’s an interesting thing that you don’t see women voting for these parties much," she says. "Xenophobia plays a bigger role than people realize."

That brings us to Donald Trump. Perhaps no issue has been more debated — or more politicized — in the US than the question of whether Trump’s support comes from economic anxiety or racism.



In its purest form, the economic anxiety argument holds that working-class white men have lost economic ground relative to women and other racial and ethnic groups over the past several decades, sparking feelings of anger and resentment that lead them to support Trump.

"White males aren't the most sympathetic victim group — especially because they still earn more money and have more wealth on average than any other demographic," Tim Carney writes in the Washington Examiner. "But since we tend to judge our well-being relative to others and relative to the past, white working-class males naturally see themselves as the victims of the new economic order."

This, again, is testable. If the economic anxiety argument were true, then measures of support for Trump should track with measures of self-reported concern about the US economy. The more one is concerned about the economy, the theory goes, the more likely one should be to support Trump.

Klinkner, the Hamilton College scholar, examined exactly this in a study published by Vox. He set up an interaction variable between measures of economic pessimism and "racial resentment." This tests whether people who were pessimistic about the economy were more likely to be racially resentful and support Trump.

Klinkner found bupkis. People who were racially resentful were more likely to support Trump regardless of their views of the economy.

Someone who was not very economically pessimistic but quite racially resentful was as likely to support Trump as someone who was equally resentful but much more pessimistic about the economy. Economic stress didn’t appear to be "activating" racial resentment.

This tracks with a long history of research on the prejudices Trump is activating.

Take immigration. A number of scholars have examined whether the recent rise of anti-immigrant attitudes in the United States is caused by economic angst among whites or cultural panic about a changing face of America. The consensus, as described by my colleague Dara Lind, is the latter.

"Evidence about the role of economic concerns in opposition to immigration ... has been inconsistent," three University of Michigan scholars write in a review of the literature. "On the other hand, symbolic attitudes such as group identities turn up as powerful in study after study."

You can say the same thing about anti-black prejudice.

"Multiple studies, using several different surveys, have shown that overall levels of racial resentment were virtually unchanged by the economic crash of 2008," UC Irvine’s Tesler writes at the Monkey Cage. "Some data even suggests that racial prejudice slightly declined during the height of economic collapse in the fall of 2008. The evidence is pretty clear, then, that economic concerns are not driving racial resentment in the Obama Era."

Tesler’s own research confirms this. He looks at data from the same people, interviewed in 2007 and again in 2012, and examined the relationship between racial resentment and their evaluations of the economy. There was no relationship in 2007; in 2012, there was suddenly a strong correlation.

If the Great Recession didn’t cause this, there’s only one obvious explanation: America’s election of a black president. That means we need to turn the "economic anxiety causes racism" theory on its head: It’s racism that caused a certain group of Americans to say the economy is doing badly. Concern about the economy became, for some, an outlet for anxieties about the country being led by a black man.

It’s not that the tectonic shifts in the global economy have played no role in the rise of the Western far right. That would be difficult to prove — and, moreover, is probably wrong. There are doubtless some people who are attracted to Trump or the FN as a result of their own economic pain.

But it’s telling that in study after study, economics plays so much less of a role than racial and cultural anxiety. It suggests that of the two biggest shifts in Western society in the late 20th century, the move toward genuine multiculturalism is playing a far bigger role than growing inequality in giving rise to a new kind of far-right politics.

A lot of people, especially in the Western cultural elite, find this explanation baffling. They find it genuinely confusing that people could be motivated by status anxiety alone, and look for a "deeper" explanation.

"It may or may not be accurate to attribute the political behavior of large groups of people to racism, but it is not very useful," as economics writer Steve Randy Waldman puts it. "Those people got to be that way somehow. Presumably they, or eventually their progeny, can be un-got from being that way somehow."

But the truth is sometimes uncomfortable. Cultural attitudes aren’t always "caused" by anything else in some immediate or obvious sense. To explain how people "got" to believe in racist and xenophobic status hierarchies is to explain hundreds of years of Western history and the complicated story of how race and national identity were made in the West.

As a result of this history, many people value their culture and identity as much as they value economic security. When their vision of the way the world should work is threatened, they see it as a personal threat. They’re racist because race and hierarchy and group identity have come to play integral roles in how humans understand the world.

To deny that is to deny that both identity and the past matter, to assume everything is reducible to some kind of material or economic ultimate cause. History has shown, conclusively, that this is a mistake.

VII. Can the far right be stopped?

It’s not clear just how high the far right’s ceiling is.

On the one hand, the far right has never taken power in Western Europe or the United States (the "far right" here referring to post-World War II FN-style political movements, not dictatorships like the one that ran Spain). Donald Trump's stunning general election victory was caused by a perfect electoral storm, including an unprecedented and race-shifting intervention by the FBI — he may very well only last one term, and could very well discredit his own ideas if the administration goes badly. The United States will be a majority minority country in 30 years; younger generations on both sides of the Atlantic are less attracted to the far right’s racial dog whistles.

So it’s possible that the Trump presidency is the high-water mark for the far-right. But it’s also possible that the opposite is true. We could be at the very beginning of an era defined by a battle between the far-right, racist nationalists and the kind of liberal cosmopolitanism that transformed the world after World War II.

Marine Le Pen is at the top of the French presidential polls; her leading rival, the center-right Republican party's Francois Fillon, has similarly aggressive views on immigration and multiculturalism. Current polling suggests Vlaams Belang, a spinoff of Vlaams Blok, is likely to quadruple its share of seats in Belgium’s parliament in the next election. And that’s only two examples; you can see these parties rising, particularly in the past year, across the continent.

Canada has become an entirely different type of society

In the United States, Trump appears to have cemented control on the Republican party. There's also no evidence that Republican voters are getting less racist.

Trump is facing little meaningful resistance from congressional Republicans, and his favorability among rank-and-file GOP voters remains quite high. Influential right-wing media outlets like Breitbart News aren’t just embracing Trump — they’re embracing Trumpism, denouncing "globalists" and expressing solidarity with the far right. One Breitbart article termed the far right’s surge in Europe the "Patriot Spring." The structural factors are there, in the US, for a kind of Trumpism without Trump.

And the events giving rise to these ideas aren’t going away. The past year of strong polling for the far right is the result of a one-two punch: a surge of refugees trying to get into Europe and a spate of high-profile terrorist attacks. These two factors made cultural change, particularly Muslim immigration, even scarier, activating prejudices and turning Europeans to the right.

No one has a good solution for the refugee crisis or for Islamist terrorism. Longer term, immigrant populations in Europe will continue to have children, and it’s quite a while before white voters in the US can simply be outvoted. The issue of how to integrate ethnic and religious minorities will never entirely disappear, which means xenophobic politicians may continue to find fertile ground among whites concerned about ongoing cultural change.

Western governments can’t simply ignore the far right. Brexit proved its ability to destabilize major Western institutions and the global economy; Trump proved its ability to capture the most powerful position in the world. Most importantly, these parties threaten the most cherished values in Western society: our all-too-recent embrace of equality and tolerance.

If we want to protect the idea of Western societies as fundamentally open and tolerant places, then Western governments need to do something. One possible path forward can be found in the Western country that’s proven most immune to the rise of right-wing populism: Canada.

You might be tempted to think Canada has always been this way. Far from it: For most of its history, Canada was every bit as bigoted and intolerant as its peers. The Canadian immigration system prior to the 1960s was known as the "White Canada" policy because of explicit ethnic and racial quotas.

A half-century later, Canada has become an entirely different type of society.

In 1982 it passed the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a major anti-discrimination law that enshrined multiculturalism as an essentially constitutional value. Ottawa now provides funding for communities and individuals to run citizenship and language classes for new immigrants, and sometimes even help them find housing. It eschewed the guest-worker programs used in much of Europe and emphasized to new immigrants that they would be a welcome and permanent part of the Canadian populace.

Canada also works to inculcate pluralistic values in its youngest citizens. By one estimate, public schools receive more than $1 billion a year to pay for teaching aids and videos with pro-immigrant messages.

The result? Today, 20.6 percent of Canada’s population is foreign-born, one of the highest such percentages in the developed world. While other countries have tried to limit Syrian refugees, Canada has welcomed them — letting in tens of thousands of Syrians and clamoring for more.

"Compared to the citizens of other developed immigrant-receiving countries, Canadians are by far the most open to and optimistic about immigration," Irene Bloemraad, the chair of Canadian studies at UC Berkeley, writes in a 2012 study published by the Migration Policy Institute.

The Canadian immigration model is not a blueprint for ending racism. Canada still has serious problems with structural discrimination, particularly when it comes to its First Nations population. It also experiences occasional bouts of xenophobia — see the anti-immigrant demagoguing from Kellie Leitch, a candidate for the leadership of the center-right Conservative party who speaks favorably about Trump's approach.

Even if other Western countries copied large parts of Canada’s immigration system and multicultural ideology, they could have a hard time staving off the growing political strength of the far right. Divisions over race caused the American Civil War; in Europe, centuries of ethnic supremacy culminated in the Holocaust. What we’re experiencing today, thankfully, is far less dangerous — partly because the open racism that the Confederates and Nazis stood for has been utterly delegitimized.

This is a testament to a basic truth, underscored by the Canadian model: Things really can get better. The forces of reaction, of ethno-racial supremacy, have been defeated in the past, and can be defeated again. The key to doing it is to refrain from surrendering on core values — to reaffirm Western societies’ basic commitment to tolerance and to craft policies that promote that commitment rather than back away from it.

The future shouldn’t belong to the Front National and its ilk. It should belong to the people they’re afraid of.In most shots of the two John Wick movies, John Wick is the only thing worth looking at.

Oh, sure, sometimes enemies dare confront him, rushing in from off-camera to be dispatched with a quick, brutal barrage of bullets. But the camera is usually pinned to him as he dances and swirls amid the chaos, a strangely graceful weapon of a man.

Rating 3.5



John Wick: Chapter 2 is only rarely a movie about two people having a fight, because only a handful of people in the John Wick universe can go toe-to-toe with Wick. No, John Wick: Chapter 2 is about trying to get inside the head of — maybe even empathize with — a death machine.

Wick’s world, which seems to operate by some mysterious assassin’s code that may as well have been handed down wholesale from the middle ages, is always needlessly byzantine when something more straightforward would do. But Wick himself is as stripped-down and simple in his motivations as possible. In 2014’s John Wick, he avenged the death of his dog; in the new sequel, he’s mad somebody burned down his house (though this grows more complicated).

Related Why John Wick rules so hard

Sure, the John Wick movies nod toward, say, how hard it is to break cycles of revenge and other standard action movie tropes. But they’re mostly about how good it would feel to be a one-man army, to be able to kill anybody you see with minimal struggle, even if all you had on hand was a pencil.

In this way, the John Wick movies capture, better than any other action movies, the peculiar feeling of being an American in the 21st century: blessed with immense power but always kinda bummed out about it.

Abandon your moral compass, all ye who enter here

The standard adjective to apply to Wick is “balletic.” By this, critics usually mean that the action sequences in a film are so beautifully and tightly choreographed that they approximate the feeling of watching a dance number or an elaborate slapstick comedy routine. (For a good example of how the word “balletic” can apply to action, watch literally any fight scene featuring Jackie Chan in his prime.)

To be sure, the action sequences and gunfights in both Wick movies have moments of sheer, choreographed wonder. But for the most part, they’re solo numbers — or, at best, a duet between actor Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski’s camera. Wick holds centerstage, blowing away all who would dare oppose him.

That, of course, makes it all the more thrilling when a worthy opponent for Wick comes along, and Stahelski lets both hold the center of the screen while their fight goes on. In John Wick: Chapter 2, the most worthy opponent is Cassian, played by Common, as the biggest threat Wick has yet faced. (He has more trouble dispatching Cassian than entire rooms full of goons.) In one thrilling shot, Stahelski sends Wick and Cassian careening down opposite sides of a row of parked cars, ducking and weaving to fire at each other. In that moment, it really does feel like they’re doing an elaborate dance.

But these thrilling moments are fewer and farther between than you might expect. Every Wick movie is structured to suggest that only a couple of people on the face of the planet can stand with John Wick, that even if you send an endless army after him, he will gun down every member of that army. The scripts’ video game-like structure — right down to a “level” in John Wick: Chapter 2 that could be called “The Catacombs” — further enhances this dehumanization of Wick’s opponents. He’s a wrecking ball, and they’re there to be wrecked.

To be clear, this is a feature, not a bug. The John Wick movies are about momentum, about Wick moving so precisely and so quickly that he reaches a point where he feels more god than man. If some action movie protagonists are regular folks, whose prowess is enhanced by the unusual circumstances in which they find themselves, Wick is superhuman. He’s aspirational, not relatable.

Yet this also means the films are actively inviting you to imagine yourself as a one-person murder factory. Because the movies usually don’t have dramatic tension in the traditional sense — you don’t really worry that John Wick will lose a fight, because, well, look at the title — they instead derive their tension from, say, wondering how Wick will get out of this latest trap, or whether all of this weighs on his soul just a little bit.

To the series’ credit, it’s at least interested in the question of Wick’s ultimate morality — or, maybe, it knows it should pretend to be interested. But the moments when, say, Wick says he worries about being damned are brushed aside by Stahelski’s sheer skill at staging operatic action. The brutality and bloodshed lose any of the weight the movie wants them to have when they take place in a gigantic hall of mirrors punctuated by occasional flare-ups of digital flame.

John Wick: Chapter 2 is the rare sequel to expand a film’s universe without getting too complicated

Those questions of morality may be what you leave John Wick: Chapter 2 thinking about. But during the movie, you’ll be too swept up in Wick’s journey from where he settled at the end of the first film (in a flimsy “retirement”) back into the world of skullduggery and assassinations to think about much else.

John Wick 2 is pretty clearly designed as the middle section of a trilogy — though news of John Wick 3 is not yet available, and Stahelski will be spending the next while on his Highlander remake. It picks up on loose threads introduced in the first film in hopes of weaving them into a bigger picture, then very clearly creates a new status quo a third film can pick up whenever it arrives.

What’s most remarkable about John Wick 2 is that none of the above trips it up. As anyone who watched, say, the Pirates of the Caribbean films can attest, retrofitting a largely terrific standalone film into an ongoing saga is ridiculously difficult to pull off. And there are times when John Wick 2 introduces some new piece of mythology or some larger aspect of its crime-ridden world that threaten to topple over into self-serious camp. The film flirts with the “saga” taking precedence over the immediate story, but it always ends up on the right side of the line, sometimes miraculously.

This is because whenever Stahelski and screenwriter Derek Kolstad box themselves in with Too Much Story, Wick just shoots his way out of it. For example: There’s a lot of business here about a new character who wants his sister dead, so he can take her seat as one of 12 at The Table; instead of turning this into a chance to over-explain what The Table is or something similar, the film trusts that you’ll figure it out amid John Wick killing people. (You will.)

Over-explanation is the enemy of stripped-down tales like John Wick, which is why it’s so refreshing that even as it expands and deepens its already existing crime-ridden world (which includes such delightful idiosyncrasies as a network of homeless assassins spying on everybody, and the return of the first movie’s Hotel for Assassins and its proprietor, played by the great Ian McShane), it keeps things relatively simple. John Wick 2 has a firm sense of its rules and how they interact with its characters and setting, but also a belief that viewers can keep up.

And Stahelski never met a frame he couldn’t turn into a visual presentation on theology and/or art history. (One character hangs out in a museum pretty much so he can loiter in front of marble statues all the time.) He and cinematographer Dan Laustsen are always lighting characters so half their faces are swathed in shadow, and, yeah, we get it. This is an unsettling world. But boy, does it look great.

Yet even at its grandest, most operatic heights, it’s hard to escape the sheer amount of death John Wick deals out, sometimes just because it’s easiest. The film embraces its own murky center when Wick makes some truly questionable moral decisions, but it also tries to suggest that’s just the world he lives in, that he’s bound by the codes he pretends to follow.

Then again, maybe that’s the point. Wick is a cipher of a man, and pretty much all we know about him is that he loves his dead wife, his pets, and his stuff. He’s played by Reeves, one of our most famously remote actors (though a tremendous physical performer). He is, in every frame where he stands alone, a one-man bullet storm, an invitation to consider how hard it would be to exercise restraint if we possessed his weapons and skills, how we’re all of us closer to sinking into hell than we might pretend.

John Wick: Chapter 2 is in theaters everywhere.Peter Thiel is best known as the billionaire technology investor who founded the e-payment giant PayPal and the massive data analysis firm (and security contractor) Palantir. Oh, and he also tried to build a libertarian utopia on a giant platform in the open sea. And he pays smart kids to skip college. And he was one of the first investors in Facebook. And he's the inspiration for the Aspergy venture capitalist on HBO's Silicon Valley.

So he's an interesting guy. And a controversial one.

Thiel's critics, who often dismiss him as just another libertarian techno-evangelist (and it says something about the Way We Live Now that "just another libertarian techno-evangelist" feels like a meaningful category), should give his book Zero to One a close look. In it, Thiel makes some points that don't quite fit with his public caricature. He argues that monopolies are good, and that it's competition, red in tooth and claw, that often destroys industries. He worries that CEOs think too much about money and not enough about moonshots. And he doesn't tweet (well, he did, once, but he doesn't now).

I spoke with Thiel a few weeks ago in Washington, DC. An edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Competition is overrated

Ezra Klein: Let me start with a question you say you ask every job applicant. What important truths do you believe that very few people agree with you on?

Peter Thiel: That as a business, you should strive for monopoly, and that competition is very overrated. We live in a world where we're always told to compete intensely. It's how we're educated. It's how so much of our system is organized. I think that if you want to compete super intensely, you should open a restaurant in DC. There'll be competition — but you won't make any money or do anything.

Competition makes us better at that which we're competing on, but it narrows our focus to beating the people around us. It distracts us from things that are more valuable or more important or more meaningful.

Ezra Klein: You have this great line in the book that monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money, and non-monopolists can't. What you seem to be arguing is that the highest good of a company is to become dominant enough that it develops the fuck-you profits needed to create a Bell Labs, or to send weather balloons up into the air, or to create worldwide internet. It’s almost like you see the point of capitalism as creating companies able to fund technological philanthropies. Is that right?

Peter Thiel: In business, you do have to think about money to some extent. If you weren't thinking about that at all, then things would go wrong in fairly fast order. But I find that companies that are simply mercenary are quite uninspiring.

I think a lot of meaning comes from a counterfactual sense that if we weren't working on something, this problem would not get solved. That's why I always differentiate between mission-oriented companies and social entrepreneurship. They both have a sense of doing something that transcends making money, but mission-oriented companies are often defined by a unique mission that maybe others don’t think is important, whereas a lot of the social entrepreneurship efforts gravitate towards things where you have many copycats doing relatively similar things.

The problem with the Ivy League

Ezra Klein: You're very critical about the way that we incentivize kids to win at competition in general rather than to be amazing and obsessive in particular pursuits. You’ve offered some really smart kids thousands of dollars to skip college altogether. Do you think your critique is about all, or most, kids? Or is it just about a small slice of Ivy League-aimed, hyper-overachievers?

Peter Thiel: I'm very focused on the question of what happens at the elite universities because they dominate the whole narrative. A lot of lesser colleges are trying to emulate the top ones in one way or another. And I do think there's something very odd about our talented people all going to the same short list of colleges and then, from there, going into the same narrow list of careers.

Ezra Klein: So the idea is that the Ivy Leagues are the point of leverage on the system because they’re the point of maximum aspiration not just for students, but for other colleges?

Peter Thiel: My view is if you want to actually somehow get people to rethink the system, you have to rethink the very top schools. There's all these ways we talk about education that are very misleading. I think it’s a tremendous abstraction even to use the word "education." What sort of a good is education? Is it a consumption decision, or college as a four-year party? Is it an investment decision, where you will develop skills to get a better-paying job? Is it an insurance policy, so that you don't fall through the big cracks in our society; or is it, say, a zero-sum tournament in which the intensity of the competition is what somehow validates the tournament?

I think one of the things that's deeply dishonest about it is that it mostly presents itself as an insurance policy, because people in our society are somewhat pessimistic and somewhat worried about the future. They desperately want insurance. But the reality is that it is this tournament.

Ezra Klein: In some ways, it's about who the customer is, too. I was reading Atul Gawande's new book about death, Being Mortal. One of the interesting points he makes in that book is that nursing homes are very badly designed for their inhabitants. They're really miserable. One of the reasons is the nursing homes build themselves around security, because the actual customer isn't the inhabitant but their children. The thing that the children are worried about is not really autonomy and it's not independence and it's not even happiness. It's security for their mother and father, to make sure they're not going to fall or choke.

There's an issue like that with colleges, where the customer is typically the parents, particularly at the Ivy League level where you're usually dealing with more affluent kids. What they want to be sure of is their kid is going to do well. It matters less that they do extraordinarily well than that they don’t do badly. For a lot of parents, it’s success to have a kid who is married and is making $145,000 a year at a law firm. The improvement in parental happiness if the kid becomes CEO of some great firm isn’t that high — maybe it’s even a net negative, because they’ll never call.

It seems that that's part of the issue there: as long as the customer is the parent, colleges are going to have to pitch themselves as a kind of insurance that the outcome won’t be bad. Whereas you’re more interested in a higher-risk, higher-reward scenario that’s oriented towards extraordinary outcomes but doesn’t have quite the same level of safety to it.

Peter Thiel: Yes. I agree that that's mainly what parents are concerned about. But I do think insurance is very different from a tournament, and that is an odd aspect about the way the system is geared. You could presumably have an insurance policy for more people. It's this weird combination of the two that I think really makes very little sense.

If you were president of one of the top universities, the way you would instantly get all the students, all the alumni, and all the faculty to hunt you down and fire you would be to propose doubling the enrollment over the next 20 years. But why can't Harvard double or triple its enrollment? It’s like a Studio 54 nightclub where you have a velvet rope with a very small number of people on the inside and very, very large line of people on the outside.

Why Silicon Valley is beating Wall Street in the war for talent

Ezra Klein: I want to try to draw out this idea of a company’s mission a bit more. Imagine two versions of Google. The non-mission oriented Google is, "We want to build a search engine that'll be the best search engine in the world. If we're dominant in that market, we're going to be able to extract huge advertising revenues." The mission-oriented one is, "Our goal as a company is to categorize and make accessible all the world's information."

Peter Thiel: Yes.

I think the second description is certainly far more inspiring. Maybe it starts by building a much better search engine, but then maybe over time, you have to develop mapping technology, maybe you start building self-driving cars as a way to see how well your mapping technology works. It certainly, I think, feels very different to the people working at the company. I think Google still is a very charismatic company for a company of its size.

Ezra Klein: That’s an interesting point. Google does all of these things that are not obvious profit drivers. The massive effort to digitize books, the decision to send camels across the Sahara to work on mapping the desert. A lot of that, they're losing money on. But it’s partially a recruitment tool — it makes them, in your word, more charismatic than their competitors.

Peter Thiel: One level in which these companies do still compete very much is for talent. Silicon Valley is very competitive with Wall Street banks. And there's a way in which the day-to-day jobs are similar: people sit in front of computers, the people went to similar colleges and universities, even the office floor-planning is kind of similar. There are more similarities than one might think. But the narrative at Google is much, much better than at Goldman. That's why they're beating a place like Goldman incredibly in this talent war.

Ezra Klein: It has become at this point a trope that a lot of the founders of major tech companies have these Asperger's-like tendencies. In the HBO show Silicon Valley, one of the key venture capitalists is apparently based on you, and the show really plays up the spectrum-y qualities of the character. In the book, you say that's actually a competitive advantage. I'm curious why.

Peter Thiel: It was Aristotle that said, "Man differs from the other animals in his greater aptitude for imitation." It's how we learn languages. It's how culture gets transmitted. But it also leads to all sorts of bubbles, all sorts of insane madness-of-crowds-type behavior.

So I always like to flip this around. What is it about our society that somehow talks all of the people who don't have Asperger's out of their original ideas before they're a little bit too weird? Why do we push people to do things that are much more conventional? It's an anti-Asperger's personality, and it’s often actually quite bad for innovation.

Ezra Klein: You mentioned earlier how Google is outcompeting Goldman Sachs for talent. Does it unnerve you to watch the MBAs and the law school graduates and all the high achievers from the traditional pathways streaming into Silicon Valley right now?

Peter Thiel: I do think we're at this point where Silicon Valley is extremely attractive. I think it's going to go on for a very long time. I think The Social Network movie in 2010 was a cultural moment like the Wall Street movie. They were both intended to be negative on the industries. The Social Network was as negative as the Oliver Stone movie. But they both backfired in a weird way. I knew all these people who watched Wall Street and they were inspired by it to become investment bankers.

People at Facebook — we were super nervous about how that movie was going to play out. There was a board discussion about how we've not been on the ball, and maybe we could have stopped the movie, and maybe we could have done all these things to change it. Then, when it finally came out, in fall of 2010, I believe, the whole company went to see the movie and just owned it. The movie was made to be negative on Zuckerberg, but people looked at the positive things — how hard Zuckerberg worked and how passionate he was.

Ezra Klein: Just as a journalist, I thought that movie was so insanely, grossly unethical. It really unnerved me. The idea you can take someone living and create a popularized account of their life with the real names, most of the real events, the real t-shirts that they wore, and then just make up their key motivations and some of the key stories completely. It was appropriating someone’s life in this really weird, dishonest way, and it didn’t sell itself clearly as fiction. The fact that Zuckerberg had been in a relationship with the same woman the whole way through Facebook, and she was just wiped out of the film so he could be presented as a lonely geek in college trying to get back at the pretty girls who spurned him ... I was a little shocked by that.

Peter Thiel: It was this very strange combination of fact and fiction. There was one narrow scene with me: they actually filmed the entrance outside my actual office so they got that details right, but the key thing my character asked was this question "Who was Eduardo Saverin?" Which was not ever a question I asked.

Why he doesn’t buy Silicon Valley’s obsession with failure

Peter Thiel: One of the ideas I'm very skeptical of is that people learn from failure. I think, in practice, failure's really demotivating. Hopefully, you have the character to persevere and keep going, but I think the default is that failure is powerfully demotivating. But success is very motivating.

Ezra Klein: Isn't counseling young entrepreneurs to reach for these moonshot monopolies putting a lot of people onto a path where the chance of failure is much higher, and thus the chance of demotivating all these entrepreneurs is potentially higher?

Peter Thiel: I suppose, but I'm not trying to get more people to be entrepreneurs. I would like people to start more good companies and fewer bad companies. I think that's the thing. I don’t think starting companies or starting startups is an end in itself.

I was talking to one of my friends a few years ago. I asked him "What do you want to be doing five or 10 years?" And he said he wanted to be an entrepreneur. It's a terrible answer.

The problem with Bitcoin

Ezra Klein: To talk about the companies you founded for a moment, something you emphasize about PayPal in the book is how much you guys were united by the belief that there was a space to create a new kind of currency married to a new type of payment network. I think it's fair to say that PayPal did not become a new type of currency.

There's a lot of energy now around Bitcoin. I'm curious where you think we are, or what you think today about the dream of building some type of technologically-based, non-state oriented currency.

Peter Thiel: I'm probably psychologically a little unfairly biased against Bitcoin because, since we didn't succeed at doing it at PayPal, I have this feeling that no one can do it. But Bitcoin's gotten much further than I would have thought possible. The problem is I don't actually think the payment system works all that well yet. The main use case still seems to be either currency speculation or illegal activity where you're willing to go through lots of hoops to make a payment. It's not obvious how easy it is to get seamless payment system attached to it.

When I was pitching PayPal back in the early days, I would hold up a $100 bill in front of an audience. It was this hypnotic effect, everyone paid attention to me immediately. Money is a very mysterious thing. It doesn't have much use value. It's not hygienic. So how does it work?

I think there's a link between the dollar being the world’s reserve currency and the US' military supremacy. The dollar bill says, "This note is legal tender for all debts public and private." You will not be able to pay your taxes in Bitcoin. You have to pay them in dollars. If you don't pay them with dollars, there will be people who will show up with guns to make you pay them. There are all these things that are part of what makes the US dollar the US dollar, and it's all linked together in a very deep way.

The real problem with Edward Snowden’s revelations about the NSA

Ezra Klein: You have this techno-anarchist or maybe techno-libertarian streak. You create PayPal, which is about creating an alternative to the state currency. Then, the next big company you found is Palantir, which is woven into the national security state and is vastly expanding the state's capacity to track and watch the population effectively. A lot of the time now when I hear people spin out scenarios for the super-effective Big Brother of the future, it's Palantir or a Palantir-like company that will appear in those fears. So how did you end up founding one company that is so about challenging the fundamental monopolies of the state, and another company that has made the state much more effective in one of its fundamental monopolies?

Peter Thiel: First, there’s a deep technological link between the two companies. We had this fraud problem at PayPal, and we would have teams of 20 human investigators looking for needles in a haystack. They couldn’t do that across millions of transactions. We solved it with human-computer complementarity. We realized we could do a lot by getting the division of labor right and automating certain processes and then training people to work alongside the computers. Palantir has that same technology working in the anti-terrorism context.

But then you need to think about how these technologies play out over time. As a civil libertarian, my own view is that preventing terrorist attacks is actually quite important. I was surprised that we got something as extreme as the PATRIOT Act after 9/11. The alternative to technological approaches to preventing terrorism will not be the sort of perfect world of the ACLU. I think civil liberties always lose after you have an attack. They always get replaced by things that are, as a default, very intrusive and very low tech.

I define technology as doing more with less. In the context of security and privacy, a technological solution is one that gives you more security without sacrificing privacy, or more security and more privacy at the same time. A non-technological solution is one that always involves trade-offs where you can get more security and you'll have less privacy, or more privacy but you'll have less security.

I think the alternative to something like Palantir would be a world where we're forced to make very unpleasant tradeoffs. I think that at the end of the day, the libertarians lose the trade-off war.

Ezra Klein: What level of confidence do you really have that technology is going to lead to more security with more privacy? One way to read some of the Snowden revelations is that the amount of data and information we now pump into the world creates a capacity for surveillance and intrusion that didn't exist before. Before, you would actually have to break into their house and find people’s nude pictures under their bed. Now you just need to guess their password.

Peter Thiel: I'm not a techno-utopian. I don't think technology is automatically good. There are definitely technologies that I think could be developed that I wouldn't like. There are ways in which I think technology could get us way more security and less privacy.

But I have a slightly different cut on the Snowden revelations. I think it shows the NSA more as the Keystone Cops than as Big Brother. What is striking to me is how little James Bond-like stuff was going on and how little they did with all this information. That's why I think, in some ways, the NSA is more in this anti-technological zone where they don't know what to do with the data they find. So they just hoover up all the data, all over the world. I think it was news to Obama that he was tapping into [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel's cell phone.

One way to think about this is that if the NSA bureaucracy actually knew what they were doing, they would probably need way less information. What's shocking about Snowden is how much information they had and how little they did with it.

Ezra Klein: That's something I've wondered about a lot. So many of Snowden's documents were contractor and middle-manager presentations about what the NSA was doing. I’ve often thought after reading them that if you got a leak of contractor presentations about HealthCare.gov six months before it launched, it would be amazing. I think there's a tendency in the reporting of these revelations to assume the NSA as maximally proficient and living up to its own internal hype in a way that, in my experience, neither government agencies nor companies usually do.

Peter Thiel: It's hard to judge but my sense is they're quite good at getting data and they're quite bad at finding any meaning or knowing what to do with it. I suspect that the bureaucratic momentum has pushed towards more and more data because, perversely, if you don't know what to do with the data, the tendency is to just get more and more, even though that never actually solves the core problem.

I think "big data" is one of these buzzwords that when you hear it, you should almost always think "fraud," because the problem is actually to find meaning within data. It's to make big data small. That's actually the core challenge. It's not to collect more and more data.

Why atoms are more exciting than bits

Ezra Klein: A couple years ago, you started Founders Fund, which is trying to funnel more attention towards the atom. Do you think that's working?

Peter Thiel: There are a lot of different reasons why the focus has been on bits and not on atoms for the last 40 years. It costs $100,000 to start a new software company. It costs maybe $1,000,000,000 to get a drug through the FDA. So you're obviously going to have more video game companies than real drugs. That's the world.

But people are not just information. That’s why I prefer cryonics to uploading. If cryonics works, you can still be the same person. If you were uploaded onto a computer and you had all your information represented, it's not clear whether that's genuine immortality or not.

There were all these social networking companies that came before Facebook. My friend Reid Hoffman, who started LinkedIn, in 1997 started Social Net. It had social networking in the name, in 1997. Back then there were all these avatars in these companies. The idea was I'd be a cat and you'd be a dog and we'd interact in cyberspace. It was all this alternate Snow Crash-like reality. But it turned out that just learning more about real people was what mattered.

I think there's definitely more of an appreciation of this now then there was four or five years ago. I think it's one of the things that makes Elon Musk as charismatic as he is. Tesla and SpaceX are not IT companies. They have this very different feel and there's this sense that they're so valuable because they're so rare.

Ezra Klein: Is there an analogy here to your point about Ivy League colleges being the leverage over the rest of the system? If Musk is the charismatic CEO everybody wants to be, and self-driving cars are what everybody's excited about in Google, are we entering a period where the aspirational companies become more physical in their ambitions, and that has an effect on everyone else?

Peter Thiel: I had this conversation with Elon in 2008. Tesla has been a very touch-and-go proposition. And he was telling me the last successful car company that was started in the US was Jeep, in 1941.

Why he doesn’t Tweet

Ezra Klein: I've noticed you've only ever sent one Tweet.

Peter Thiel: Yes.

Ezra Klein: I'm curious why.

Peter Thiel: You have to be very careful when you write things. You can't take them back. And my more general thought is that once you start doing it, you have to do a tremendous amount and I'm not sure that's worth my time.

It's like all these technologies, where we see information technology everywhere except in productivity statistics. Email is the paradigmatic example where it's changed the way we communicate tremendously but it takes so much time that it's only made things, I would say, moderately more productive. Change and progress are not synonyms. You can have something that represents enormous change but only a small amount of progress.

Ezra Klein: Do you think that, over time, there is a natural tendency to convert technological change into technological progress? People always give the example of how long it took to figure out how to use steam power effectively.

Peter Thiel: I guess my default assumption would be no. We've had tremendous amounts of innovation in IT going back to the ‘70s and it's led to moderate increases in productivity. It's not a new phenomenon.

For us to really have a greater productivity gains as a society, we have to do things more in the world of atoms and not just the world of bits. The problem is reflected in the word technology itself. Normally, it means information technology, whereas in the ‘50s or ‘60s, it would have meant rockets and underwater cities and desalination plants that turn deserts into farmland.Card 4 of 17

What are Obama's specific climate policies?

Here's a list of the major actions the Obama administration has taken on climate change. Most of them have been carried out through the Environmental Protection Agency:

The EPA's endangerment finding: Back in 2007, the Supreme Court said the EPA was required to regulate carbon-dioxide under the Clean Air Act so long as there was evidence that the gas endangered public health and welfare. In 2009, the EPA laid out the scientific case for why this was so — the so-called "endangerment finding."

Fuel-economy standards: As a first step, the EPA began regulating emissions from vehicles. Under a series of rules, fuel-economy standards will slowly rise until all new cars and light trucks sold in the United States average roughly 35.4 miles per gallon on the road by 2025.

Permitting for large industrial facilities: Any new-or newly upgraded-industrial facility that's likely to emit more than 100,000 tons of carbon-dioxide per year has to first get a permit from the EPA and adopt the best available technology for reducing emissions.

CO2 regulations for new power plants: The EPA has also proposed that anyone who wants to build a new coal- or gas-fired power plant will have to meet certain emissions standards. Modern combined-cycle gas plants already meet the proposed standard. But the rules may make it impossible to build a new coal plant in the United States unless it can capture its own emissions and bury them underground (a still-nascent technology).

The Clean Power Plan: This is a big one. In June 2014, the Obama administration proposed new rules to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from the nation's existing fossil-fuel power plants. The EPA will set individual emissions goals for each state and leave it to state policymakers to decide how to get there — via efficiency, switching from coal to gas, investing in renewables, or other options. The proposed rule was expected reduce power plant emissions an estimated 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

Fuel-economy rules for heavy-duty trucks. The EPA has also put out a series of rules to reduce emissions from heavy trucks, buses, and vans — which account for roughly 20 percent of gasoline use in the United States. These standards will slowly ratchet up between 2014 and 2027.

Methane regulations. The Obama administration has proposed policies to curtail methane leaks from all new oil and gas wells. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, though the exact scale of the leaks from natural gas infrastructure is still being determined. As yet, the EPA has not imposed regulations on existing wells, which are estimated to be the source of 90 percent of all leaks.

Complementary policies. Meanwhile, the White House is hammering out an agreement with China and other countries to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), another set of greenhouse gases used in everything from soda machines to many car air conditioners. The Energy Department has been setting new energy-efficiency standards for appliances and buildings. The Interior Department is trying to speed up wind- and solar-power development on publicly owned lands. And foreign-aid agencies have stopped financing coal plants overseas (except when there are no possible alternatives).

Back in 2013, the White House outlined its climate agenda in full here.David Friedman, President Trump’s pick to be the next US ambassador to Israel, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Thursday for his confirmation hearing.

It was anything but routine.

As Friedman began his opening remarks, a young Palestinian man stood up and shouted, “Mr. Friedman said that Palestinian refugees don’t have a claim to the land. ... My grandfather was exiled, was kicked out, by state officials. And I’m right here, holding up the Palestinian flag!” Minutes later, another young man with a Palestinian flag stood up and declared, “David Friedman is supporting the theft of Palestinian land!”

But it wasn’t just Palestinian activists disrupting the hearing. At one point, If Not Now, a left-wing Jewish group that protests Israel’s continued occupation of the West Bank, began singing, “olam chesed yibaneh,” which is Hebrew for “we will build this world with kindness.” One activist blew into a shofar — the ceremonial ram’s horn used on the Jewish new year as a symbol to Jews to wake up.

That a Jewish group was protesting is no surprise. Indeed, the most aggressive debates over Friedman have actually been taking place within the Jewish community, and the Jewish press, ever since the Long Island–born bankruptcy lawyer was named to the post in December.

For a community that often lacks consensus, Friedman’s appointment has been uniquely contentious among both American and Israeli Jews

The Jewish community has no shortage of positions on Friedman. Those on the political right have celebrated the positions of such a hard-line, pro-settlement figure, while those on the left view have described them as “anathema to values that underlie [the] US-Israel relationship.”

An editorial in the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz, titled simply “David Friedman Is Unfit to Serve as U.S. Envoy to Israel,” called him “a man with a simplistic, dangerous worldview, a member of the extreme right who supports annexing territory on the West Bank to Israel.” Meanwhile, the president of the right-wing Zionist Organization of America crowed that “Friedman has the potential to be the greatest US Ambassador to Israel ever.”

Friedman’s positions are well-known from his time as columnist for the right-leaning online Israeli magazine Arutz Sheva. It was there that he casually pointed to a “hundred year history of anti-Semitism” at the US State Department, and it was in Arutz Sheva that he said, “Peace will come if and when Palestinians learn to stop hating us and to embrace life rather than worship death.”

Friedman’s opposition within the Jewish community does not stem solely from his far-right positions on Israel. It comes, as well, from the often combative ways he has expressed those positions.

He has been particularly scathing and brutal in his name calling of those on the opposite side of the political spectrum with whom he disagrees. He has called the Anti-Defamation League “morons.” He accused Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) of “validating the worst appeasement of terrorism since Munich” for considering approving the Iran nuclear deal. He also accused former President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry of “blatant anti-Semitism.”

Most infamously, he called supporters of J Street, the left-leaning pro-Israel (“and pro-peace,” as their tagline goes) lobby group “far worse than kapos — Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps.” For Jews, especially those who are descendants of Holocaust survivors, there can be no worse accusation. It is a violent description, even a form of incitement, and it is meant to be.

Indeed, his use of that term raised the ire of dozens of Holocaust survivors themselves, who along with 29 Holocaust historians and a number of rabbis wrote letters to the senators involved in his confirmation hearing, calling on them to factor Friedman’s use of the term into their considerations.

For all these moments and more, Friedman was called upon again and again during his hearings to repudiate his language. It was pointed out that diplomats are required to be judicious in their speech, and their positions, as a mechanism of diplomacy. Friedman claimed during the hearing:

Some of the language that I used during the highly charged presidential campaign that ended last November has come in for criticism and rightfully so. While I maintain profound differences of opinion with some of my critics, I regret the use of such language. I want to assure you that I understand the critical difference between the partisan rhetoric of a political contest and a diplomatic mission. Partisan rhetoric is not appropriate in achieving diplomatic progress, especially in a sensitive and strife-torn region like the Middle East.

But being forced to walk back each contentious comment resulted in some dry skepticism from the senators at the hearing. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) asked why Friedman even wants the ambassador position if it means he has to “recant every single strong belief you’ve had.”

It is rare to choose someone with such a specific, well-defined, and controversial political opinion about an area of the world to be an ambassador to that region. Indeed, until the Clinton administration, it was thought that the US ambassador to Israel should not necessarily even be a Jew. Martin Indyk, the first Jewish person to serve in the role, was seen as an unusual pick at the time, both for his faith and because he was not a career diplomat.

A pick like Friedman, a Jewish lawyer from Long Island with no diplomatic experience and extremely divisive views on some of the most controversial issues he’ll be dealing with on a daily basis, is far more unusual."You know what uranium is, right? It's this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like lots of things are done with uranium."Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, is clearly an intelligent and well-informed man. During the first six hours or so of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Tillerson was polished, articulate, and clearly knowledgeable about countries ranging from Saudi Arabia to North Korea to Equatorial Guinea.

The hearing went badly for him anyway.

There was one issue, above all others, that mattered in these hearings: Russia. Tillerson, the former head of Exxon’s division in that country, has more than a decade and a half of associations with Vladimir Putin personally, and his opposition to sanctions against Russia is a matter of public record. Republican committee members who are hawkish on Russia, most notably Marco Rubio, came into today’s hearing with serious reservations about Tillerson’s ties to the Kremlin. And without their votes, Tillerson faces a low chance of making it out.

Tillerson did a poor job of reassuring them. He refused to label Putin a “war criminal” when prompted to do so by Rubio, did nothing to clear up the nature of his personal relationship with Putin, refused to take a clear position on new Russia sanctions, and may have outright lied about his company lobbying against the current ones.

Part of the issue is that Tillerson’s (and Exxon’s) record on Russia record is, in fact, hard to defend to a Russia hawk. But the bigger problem is that Trump’s record on Russia is hard to defend.

Any pick for secretary of state would have been forced to toe his prospective boss’s weird, admiring line on the Kremlin — and would have been subject to withering questions as a result. The hearings highlight just how much Trump’s refusal to see Russia as an adversary isolates him from congressional Republicans, and how many problems it could create for his administration in the coming years.

And as for Tillerson personally, whether he makes it through is still very much an open question.

The hearing started badly on Russia

In his opening statement, Tillerson tried to appease the committee’s Russia hawks — arguing that the Obama administration had been too weak in responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But once questions began, Tillerson’s line on Russia started to change.

Rubio was one of the first senators to get to question Tillerson, and he went right for the jugular on Russia, asking Tillerson whether he’d support sanctions on any Russian officials involved in hacks on the United States.

“I would want to examine all the corners, all four corners of that,” Tillerson answered.

“Those are the four corners,” Rubio replied. “We would sanction people who are involved in cyberattacks against the United States and interfering in our elections.”

Tillerson still refused to provide a more concrete answer. A visibly irritated Rubio then read out a list of documented atrocities committed by Russian military forces, including intentionally bombing Syrian civilians in the city of Aleppo, and asked Tillerson if he considered them to be war crimes. Tillerson, once again, refused to answer definitively.

“You are ... not prepared to say that Vladimir Putin and his military have violated the rules of war and have conducted war crimes in Aleppo?” Rubio asked.

“Those are very serious charges to make,” Tillerson said, adding that he needed “to be fully informed” before making such a determination.

“There’s so much information out there. It should not be hard to say that Vladimir Putin’s military has conducted war crimes in Aleppo, because it is never acceptable to target civilians,” Rubio replied. “I find it discouraging, your inability to cite that.”

Then it got worse

After being dressed down by the most important vote on the committee — Rubio plus all the Democrats would be enough to block his confirmation — Tillerson jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. When asked if he or Exxon Mobil had lobbied against Russia sanctions, he said no, categorically.

“I have never lobbied against sanctions,” Tillerson said. “To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.”

This seems very hard to believe. As CEO, Tillerson spearheaded a series of deals in Russia valued at hundreds of millions of dollars — which means that sanctions against Russia could potentially have cost his company hundreds of millions of dollars. In June 2014, when Russia sanctions were being considered on Capitol Hill, Tillerson told reporters that his company was making its views about sanctions clear to the United States government. “Our views are being heard at the highest levels,” he said.

Tillerson’s dubious claim that neither he nor Exxon ever lobbied against sanctions began to unravel almost immediately. Sen. Bob Corker, the committee chair, pulled at the string: "I think you called me at the time,” he said, referring to when Russia sanctions were being debated on the Hill.

Ouch.

A bit later, after a short break, Corker gave Tillerson a chance to finesse his response. Tillerson argued that he and Exxon never lobbied against sanctions per se, but merely engaged with Congress to understand how Exxon’s business would be affected. “Exxon Mobil participated in understanding how the sanctions were going to be constructed,” he said.

As questioning went on, this claim became flimsier and flimsier. Sen. Bob Menendez cited four separate lobbying reports showing Exxon Mobil lobbying on sanction bills covering both Russia and Iran — lobbying reports that companies only file if they have engaged in actual lobbying, and not just the sort of basic information gathering that Tillerson was describing.

“Were we lobbying for the sanctions or against them?” Tillerson asked Menendez, somehow keeping a straight face.

“I know you weren’t lobbying for the sanctions,” Menendez replied. Tillerson had no real reply to this, and just kept deflecting until Menendez finally moved on.

This whole line of questioning was brutal, because it forced Tillerson to try to square a circle. In order to satisfy his questioners, he would have needed to show that he had supported sanctions against Russia. Otherwise, they would have a (reasonable) suspicion that as secretary of state, he might potentially try to undermine the sanctions regime against Russia, which they see as an essential bulwark against Russian expansionism and interference in the American political process.

But Tillerson has always opposed these sanctions, because he’s always thought about the world through the lens of what’s good for Exxon — as most CEOs would. And banning commerce with Russian oil giants is very, very bad for Exxon’s bottom line. So Tillerson took a wishy-washy line on current sanctions, saying, "I would recommend maintaining the status quo until we are able to engage with Russia and understand better what their intentions are.”

If he took a stronger pro-sanctions stance in the hearing, Tillerson would have contradicted himself and sold out his corporate buddies. If he outright opposed Russian sanctions, as he had in the past, then he would have given Rubio and Democrats every reason to spike his nomination.

He thus tried to avoid both pitfalls by simply giving vague, qualified answers and dissembling about Exxon’s record on sanctions. But no one was fooled, and he just ended up looking ridiculous.

The perils of being a Trump appointee

At around the same time Tillerson was being hammered by Rubio and Menendez, Trump was hosting his first press conference since being elected president. It centered, naturally, on recent unverified reports that Russia may have a blackmail file on the president-elect. Trump, naturally, denied all of the allegations and went on the offensive.

“If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset, not a liability,” he said, referring to himself in the third person.

This has been Trump’s line for months — and needless to say, it is not a popular opinion on Capitol Hill. This puts Tillerson, a man who received the Order of Friendship medal from Putin in 2013 in recognition of oil partnerships, in yet another very awkward position. He either backs Trump’s praise for Putin, rendering himself radioactive as a candidate for secretary of state, or he contradicts his prospective boss — a dangerous move for any Trump employee.

So Tillerson, once again, backed away, demurring on repeated attempts to get him to comment on Trump’s Russia statements. At one point, Menendez asked him whether he had discussed Russia with Trump. “That has not occurred yet,” he said.

"That's pretty amazing,” Menendez replied.

Trump’s bizarrely friendly approach to Moscow would be a problem for anyone in Tillerson’s position. No nominee would be able to give a satisfactory answer to questions about sanctions, at least in public, without countermanding their boss. Tillerson’s background makes the problem particularly acute, as his record on Russia is objectively eyebrow-raising, but it’s not unique to him.

This shows one of the primary ways Trump has marginalized himself right from the get-go: By taking such outlandish positions on such an important issue as Russia — positions that directly contradict the view of the GOP establishment — he has set himself up for conflict after conflict with people who nominally ought to be his allies.

Whether it’s secretary of state hearings, a new Russia sanctions bill supported by some Republicans, or an inquiry into Russian hacking during the US election, Trump has tweeted and blustered his way into a presidential term that will almost certainly be defined by conflict over Russia. In that sense, then, the surprisingly brutal Tillerson hearing is a preview of what’s to come.

Will Tillerson be confirmed?

It’s hard to say what this conflict means for Tillerson’s confirmation. On the one hand, his performance was clearly not satisfying to a lot of senators. On the other hand, he reportedly did better on Russia in his private meetings with members of the committee.

But he doesn’t have a lot of room for error. Democrats are inclined to oppose his nomination, both because he’s a Trump appointee and because Exxon Mobil is one of the world’s biggest contributors to climate change. When Sen. Tim Kaine pressed Tillerson on Exxon’s long history of funding climate change deniers, Tillerson got downright defensive.

"Senator, since I’m no longer with Exxon Mobil, I’m in no position to speak on their behalf,” he said.

"Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or refuse to answer my question?" Kaine replied.

"A little of both,” Tillerson said.

The secretary of state should, in theory, have a great deal of influence over climate policy. Solving climate change requires international cooperation — big emitters like the US and China need to agree to move away from carbon together, or else the realities of international competition mean nobody probably will. The 2015 agreement struck in Paris is, for that reason, widely seen as one of the Obama administration’s most significant foreign policy achievements — it created a framework for that kind of crucial cooperation down the line.

Trump has said he wants to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, which would effectively scuttle it. Tillerson, given his position, could very well help shape how Trump acts on this idea, or whether he does anything at all. Given the stakes — human civilization — the Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee seemed understandably nervous about entrusting this critical position to a former oil executive.

If Democrats decide to take a consistent party line against Tillerson, due to his position on climate, then he needs near-total Republican support. And if Rubio’s harsh questioning on Russia is any indication of party sentiment, he may not get it. After the hearing, Rubio told reporters that he was “prepared to do what's right” — meaning he might well vote against Tillerson’s confirmation.

Now, none of this may come to pass. Democrats may decide this is about as good as they’re going to get with Trump, and Republicans might decide to back their president.

But they also might not. And given this uncertainty, Tillerson can’t be very happy about his dismal performance today.‘I Will Vote No’ — Susan Collins Says She’ll Oppose Scott Pruitt to Lead the EPA

After careful consideration, Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine says she will oppose the confirmation of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

Collins tells Maine Public Radio she met at length with Pruitt and reviewed testimony from his confirmation hearing. She says he’s “an accomplished attorney with considerable knowledge about environmental laws,” and if he were nominated for another position in the federal government, Collins says she might support him.

But when it comes to the role and mission of the EPA, Collins says she and the nominee have very different visions.

“Specifically, I have significant concerns that Mr. Pruitt has actively opposed and sued the EPA on numerous issues that are of great importance to the state of Maine, including mercury controls for coal-fired power plants and efforts to reduce cross-state air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,” she says. “His actions leave me with considerable doubts about whether his vision for the EPA is consistent with the agency’s critical mission to protect human health and the environment.”

Collins joins independent U.S. Sen. Angus King of Maine in her opposition to Pruitt as EPA administrator. In announcing his decision last month, King said there’s no record that he can find of Pruitt being “affirmative and strong” in enforcing environmental laws as attorney general.

“I just can’t, in good conscience, as somebody who’s taken seriously environmental protection all my life, approve the appointment of someone who is so manifestly opposed to the mission of the agency,” King said.

Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times, and according to a letter from more than 400 former EPA workers last week, issued more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants, reduce smog and haze, clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse gases.

Pruitt’s record, they wrote, “raises serious questions about whose interests he has served to date and whether he agrees with longstanding tenets of U.S. environmental law.”

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Pruitt was grilled over a series of letters he sent to federal agencies on state stationery that were critical of the economic effects of environmental rules, and drafted, almost word for word, by energy lobbyists. He has also been criticized as a climate change denier and someone who has indicated that he would like to see a limited role for the EPA.

For her part, Collins says she has not agreed with every regulatory action that EPA has issued, either.

“At times, I have found the agency difficult to work with,” she says.

But she says she is also worried about the potential for weakening a federal agency that works to implement and enforce landmark environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Clean Power Plan.

As an example, Collins points to Maine’s geographic location, near the end of what’s often described as the nation’s “air pollution tailpipe,” because it’s on the receiving end of pollution that’s generated by coal-fired power plants in other states. Reducing these air pollutants, Collins says, is important in a state like Maine, which has one of the highest rates of asthma in the country.

“And no matter what Maine does, unless we address the out-of-state sources of pollution, we cannot make the kind of progress that needs to be made,” she says.

Collins says another factor in her decision was the opposition to Pruitt expressed by the Friends of Acadia. With about 5,000 members around the country, the group wrote a letter to Collins about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a way to lessen the effects of climate change in Acadia National Park in Maine.

Stephanie Clement, conservation director for the friends’ group, says the effects of climate change are wide-ranging. For example, Acadia receives about five additional inches of rain on an annual basis than it did 100 years ago. Clement says there are also threats to the park’s infrastructure and to predator-prey relationships that could be affected by warming temperatures.

According to a 2016 survey by the Center for American Action, one-third of the members of Congress are skeptical that greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change. Collins is not among them.

“I’ve talked to a lot of individuals throughout our state — scientists, environmental advocates, fishermen and boaters — and all of them are telling me of their concerns about how the environment is changing in our state,” she says. “And the changes we are already seeing in Casco Bay and the Gulf of Maine, for example, are cause for alarm.”

Both Collins and King’s offices have been inundated with calls and letters critical of Pruitt and other cabinet choices in recent weeks. Collins’ Portland office has also been the scene of several demonstrations against the EPA nominee.

At a recent Super Bowl-themed protest, Glenn Brand of the Sierra Club said he hoped Collins would vote against Pruitt.

“But we’re going to be here a lot,” he said. “Because there’s going to be opportunities for her to stand up for Maine repeatedly and show her true independence.”

Collins says she’s seeing bipartisan support for rolling back regulations that apply to coal-fired power plants, which she says is unfortunate since they are some of the most serious polluters.

“I reject the false choice of pitting the environment against the economy because for much of the state of Maine, the economy and the environment are inextricably linked,” she says.

"We are very excited that Sen. Collins and Sen. King have both announced their opposition to the confirmation of Scott Pruitt," says Lisa Pohlman, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. "We know that thousands of Mainers have called both of their offices and sent letters because there's really so much at stake here for Maine."

A vote to confirm Pruitt is expected later this week. Collins says in keeping with her past practice, regardless of which party is in the White House, she will vote for cloture on Pruitt’s nomination so that every member of the Senate can have a clear, up or down vote.

“But I will vote no on Mr. Pruitt’s confirmation,” she says.Abstract

One effect of the Affordable Care Act’s “Cadillac tax” (now delayed until 2020) is to undo part of the existing federal tax preference for employer-sponsored insurance. The specific features of this tax on high-cost health plans—notably, the inclusion of tax-favored savings vehicles such as health savings accounts (HSAs) in the formula for determining who is subject to the tax—are designed primarily to maximize revenue and minimize coverage disruptions, not to reduce health spending. Thus, at least initially, these savings accounts, rather than enrollee cost-sharing or other plan features, are likely to be affected most by the tax as employers act to limit their HSA contributions. Because high earners are the ones benefiting most from tax-preferred accounts, the high-cost plan tax will probably be more progressive than prior analyses have suggested, while having only a modest impact on total health spending.

BACKGROUND

The Affordable Care Act’s high-cost plan tax (HCPT), popularly known as the “Cadillac tax,” is a 40 percent excise tax on employer plans exceeding $10,200 in premiums per year for individuals and $27,500 for families. The tax is scheduled to take effect in 2020. Employer and employee premium contributions will count against the threshold, as will most employer and (pretax) employee contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), flexible spending accounts (FSAs), and health reimbursement accounts (HRAs).1 Guidelines for determining which coverage is taxed are partly subject to interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the information provided here reflects the most up-to-date guidance.2,3

Previous studies have highlighted several problems with the HCPT. Its effect is likely to vary according to regional differences in wages, input prices, and other factors that affect premiums, many of which are beyond the control of employers and employees.4 The tax will probably also disproportionately affect workers with high health care costs and those who have negotiated generous benefit packages, such as public-sector union workers.5

This brief focuses on how the HCPT is likely to affect health care spending. Initially, the tax will probably have little impact on plan offerings but is likely to affect tax-preferred savings vehicles. Our analysis of data from the National Compensation Survey and the Survey of Consumer Finances suggests that the tax will be more progressive than prior analyses have indicated and will have smaller short-term effects on health spending.

History of Favorable Tax Treatment of Employer-Sponsored Insurance (ESI)

1954

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) clarifies earlier administrative ruling by adding provision to tax code formally excluding ESI from taxable employee income.6

1978

IRS formally recognizes “cafeteria plans,” which allow employees to choose from array of benefits and exclude value of these benefits from gross income.7

Late 1970s to early 1980s

Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) become popular.8 Established by employers, they typically involve pretax salary-reduction arrangements.

1987 to 2003

Tax treatment of ESI extended to self-employed individuals.9

1996

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) establishes Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs)10 for self-employed persons, employees of small firms, and workers enrolled in high-deductible health plans. Employees and employers can contribute on pretax basis.11

2002

IRS formally acknowledges health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), established and funded solely by employers.12

2003

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 authorizes health savings accounts (HSAs), allowing employee and employer pretax contributions.13

THE TAX CODE’S HEALTH INSURANCE EXCLUSION: EFFECTS ON COVERAGE AND SPENDING

By reducing the price of health benefits relative to other goods, the tax exclusion for health insurance encourages employers to offer insurance and employees to obtain coverage.14–18 Economic theory suggests that the tax exclusion encourages people to buy more generous plans than they otherwise would.

By increasing plan generosity, the tax exclusion may lead to higher spending through greater demand for medical care.19 The relationship between plan generosity and medical spending depends on how responsive spending is to out-of-pocket costs. Research suggests that consumers respond to higher cost-sharing by reducing their use of services, particularly for more discretionary expenditures,20 rather than by seeking less costly providers.21–24

In contrast to the effect of the general tax exclusion, favorable tax treatment of savings vehicles encourages people to choose less generous health insurance with higher coinsurance and deductibles. This is certainly the case for MSAs and HSAs, which can be used only in conjunction with high-deductible plans, and may also be true of FSAs, which do not impose such restrictions.25 At the same time, among people with similar coverage, those with savings accounts are likely to use more services than those who do not have such accounts.26

Both the tax exclusion of health insurance and the favorable tax treatment of savings vehicles are regressive in nature. High-income workers benefit the most because they have the highest tax rates and also have access to generous benefits, take up these benefits, and contribute to savings accounts.

EFFECTS OF THE CADILLAC TAX

Health Coverage

The HCPT affects only health expenses above a threshold. There is still a strong tax benefit below this threshold, making it unlikely that employers will respond to the tax by eliminating offerings altogether. This tax benefit is maximized at the threshold ($10,200 for single coverage) (Exhibit 1).

Tax-Favored Savings Vehicles

The range of spending types covered by the HCPT may encourage employers to reduce costs by reducing payments to savings accounts, for several reasons. First, these plans have little intrinsic insurance value—higher-income workers (the group most likely to have these plans) can usually use other savings to pay for expenditures.

Second, these savings vehicles are quite widespread and often hold balances that are quite large relative to premiums, so employers can substantially reduce their exposure to the HCPT by adjusting the contribution limits. The most recent estimates suggest that about half of all American workers had access to an FSA. In 2015, 26 percent of firms offering benefits offered at least one HSA or HRA compatible plan, and 24 percent of covered workers were enrolled in such plans.27 The latter figure has increased by 11 percentage points since 2010.28

Employer contributions to HSAs averaged $568 for single coverage and $991 for family coverage in 2015.29 Since some of these accounts go unfunded, these figures rise to $809 and $1,412, respectively, when including only funded accounts.30 Employer contributions to HRAs followed similar patterns, with employers contributing an average of $1,079 for single coverage and $2,001 for family coverage.31 These contributions constituted a significant proportion of employer spending on employee health benefits altogether. Employer HSA contributions accounted for approximately 11 percent of total employer contributions (including premiums) to single plans and 8 percent of contributions to family plans.32 For HRA plans, these figures were 18 percent for single plans and 14 percent for family plans.33

Third, in addition to these employer contributions, employees can choose how much to deposit into their FSA or HSA (up to predefined limits established by the IRS and the employer), but employers are responsible for making HCPT payments if total costs exceed the limits.34 Thus, employers face increased exposure to unexpected tax liabilities. Surveys have indicated that employers might eliminate or limit savings accounts because of their concern about these liabilities.35,36

The availability of savings accounts may encourage people to enroll in less generous health insurance plans with lower-than-average premiums, offsetting the costs associated with savings accounts. In principle, this might mean that offering tax-favored savings accounts reduces overall payments for employer-based health care plans. In practice, however, the value of applicable coverage from these plans—which includes employee contributions—often exceeds that of traditional preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). In 2015, the average premium savings of $1,008 for single coverage was less than the average contribution to an HSA (including both contributors and noncontributors). By 2018, the total cost of the average HSA-compatible high-deductible health plan, including premiums and account contributions, is projected to be $1,653 more than the cost of the average HMO plan.37 The combined cost is even higher with FSAs, which are usually coupled with PPO-type plans—the most costly plan types.38,39

Reducing tax-favored contributions to FSAs and HSAs will raise tax revenues. Paradoxically, these changes may not reduce health care spending. The immediate effect will be increased out-of-pocket costs because more of these costs will have to be met with after-tax dollars, which is likely to reduce total spending. But the changes will ultimately slow participation in high-deductible plans, which is likely to increase spending, since people with higher cost-sharing plans, such as the high-deductible plans required for HSAs, use less medical care than do those with conventional plans.

WHO WILL THE TAX AFFECT MOST?

Prior analyses of the HCPT have shown that it is relatively progressive.40,41 However, these analyses may understate its progressivity, at least in the early years, because information about health savings account ownership and contributions is not readily available. Ownership and funding of FSAs and HSAs are more skewed toward high-income workers than are health benefits more broadly. Studies show that high earners are much more likely to fund savings accounts and to fund them fully.42,43

One measure of the use of FSAs and HSAs is whether an employer offers the accounts to employees. Employers of highly paid employees are most likely to offer such accounts (Exhibit 2).44

Exhibit 2. Workers’ Access to Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Savings Accounts, by Wage Percentile, 2015

Note: FSA = flexible spending account; HSA = health savings account.

However, many employees who are offered savings accounts do not use them or do not make significant contributions to them. Our analysis of the available data show that account ownership is skewed toward higher-income earners and that account balances are highest among the highest earners (Exhibit 3).45 High earners benefit most from making contributions to these accounts because they have both the highest tax rates and the most discretionary income available for saving.

HOW COULD PLAN DESIGN CHANGE?

As noted above, employers are initially likely to respond to the HCPT by limiting employer and employee contributions to FSAs and HSAs. This change will have the greatest effect on high-income employees, who are most likely to be contributing substantially to these accounts and who face the greatest gap between pre- and post-tax dollars.

The data suggest that in addition to the primary effect of reducing contributions to savings accounts, the HCPT will have secondary effects on employee plan choices. With reduced contributions, employees will favor plans with lower premium and out-of-pocket costs, since they will have to pay for these costs with after-tax dollars.46 This preference, in turn, will encourage employers to offer plans with similar attributes.

In general, employers have two options for reducing the cost of employee health coverage: increasing cost-sharing or offering plans with more restrictive provider networks. Since the HCPT makes higher cost-sharing less attractive to employees, it will probably lead to somewhat greater participation in plans with narrow networks than previously projected.

CONCLUSION

The HCPT was designed to maximize revenues and minimize the possibility that employers will drop health insurance coverage. By taxing only the portion of plan costs that exceeds a threshold, the HCPT ensures that most employer-sponsored benefits will remain intact. However, the HCPT limits the tax benefits of health savings accounts, which may reduce the appeal of high-deductible plans. While the HCPT does not erase the distortionary effects of the favorable tax treatment of health insurance, it is a more progressive tax. Finally, employers may respond to the HCPT by offering plans with narrow networks rather than increased cost-sharing.Hazel Heyer, Special to eTN Sep 15, 2008

The executive vice president of Development and Acquisitions for the Trump Organization, Donald Trump Jr., is the eldest child and son of famed real estate developer Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana Trump. He currently works with his siblings in buying, selling and franchising prime commercial real estate including hotel towers spanning the entire globe, from the US to Dubai.

Trump, Jr. began work for the Trump Organization on projects such as the West Side Yards and Trump Place on Riverside Drive. Recently, he has focused on the redevelopment of the old Delmonico Hotel and the Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago project seen on television show The Apprentice.

At the recent Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, Don Jr. (as he is fondly called) revealed his company’s serious intent in getting into the emerging markets world over.

For Trump, Russia is the emerging market worth investing in currently, however in caveat into the high-end sector he counts on his international experience in the market. Trump said: “The emerging world in general attributes such brand premium to real estate that we are looking all over the place, primarily Russia. There are countries that have not been fully tapped by us such as Thailand, Vietnam and Argentina. We are currently looking at potential deals. Our interest is really everywhere because there is a lot of new money in the emerging markets which appeal to certain brands whether ego-driven or having the life-jacket effect that we feel gives added-value to our investment.” According to him, he has been to basically all the emerging markets in the last six months or this summer searching for good deals.

If he were to choose his top A-list for investments in the emerging world, Trump said his firm would choose China and Russia. “Given what I’ve seen in Russia’s real estate market as of late relative to some of the emerging markets, the country seems to have a lot more natural strength, especially in the high-end sector where people focus on price per square-meter,” he said.

“In Russia, I really prefer Moscow over all cities in the world. Unlike other countries in the world, this country has five major cities where people would at least be happy being close to living in the metro.

“In Russia, if one has made money anywhere in the country, you would want your place in Moscow.”

However, to a certain degree, some US investors have had concerns over Russia. “Well, that’s happening, too. After spending half a dozen trips to Russia in the last 18 months, several buyers have been attracted to our projects there and everything associated therewith. But it is definitely not an issue of being able to find a deal – but an issue of ‘Will I ever see my money back out of that deal or can I actually trust the person I am doing the deal with?' As much as we want to take our business over there, Russia is just a different world. Though the legal structure is in place for what we have today, and even 99 percent is covered, that 1 percent not covered could be 100 percent covered over there because it is a question of who knows who, whose brother is paying off who, etc.,” Trump said, adding, “It really is a scary place.”

Despite a current government that projects a ramrod posture, to Trump the current leaders even make the scene more scary. Holding back his grin, he said, “It’s so transparent – everything’s so interconnected that it really does not matter what is supposed to happen as what it is they want to happen is ultimately what happens.” He has had multiple deals but he’s open with his partners despite what it is that keeps him up at night has to do with knowing that he has to face the “issues forever including money coming back...or not.

"And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. There's indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the Russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble," he said.

Trump Jr. also oversees the Trump International Hotel and Tower SoHo project along with The Apprentice reality show winner Sean Yazbeck. The organization has launched last year the sale of penthouses in the Trump SoHo Hotel Condominium in New York in the UAE market. This property is the only luxury hotel condo in Manhattan’s fashionable SoHo neighborhood.

Aside from the former Soviet state, India is also another place in which Trump thinks investment opportunities are ripe. He said that he likes India as much as China. But he said, “I don’t know if there’s much growth potential as China’s. Yet at the same time, with India gaining some of the benefits of colonial rule for a long time, India’s legal structure is a little simpler for Western investors to get in. It has a different mentality while there is still natural corruption like we see in many emerging markets. India, I think, is a little bit more refined than China and Russia which remain the Wild West."

From a boutique perspective, Trump Jr. said they would like to expand their hotel brands and spend much time focusing on the management side. “We tend to look at Vietnam and we’re doing a couple of projects in Thailand. We’ve had incredible focus too in the Middle East, launching in Dubai with a force to reckon with,” he said.

The Trump Organization and Nakheel Properties, the developer of more than $30 billion in real estate in Dubai, have signed a deal in October 2005 creating Trump’s International Hotel and Tower. Both companies have invested substantially in the pioneering $US600 million development spread across a portfolio of eight hotels and resorts including the 800-unit condo-hotel of the US mogul. Trump’s tower is the initial development in Nakheel and The Trump Organization's exclusive joint venture in the Middle East. Further, Trump Organization's agreement with Nakheel includes exclusive rights for 19 countries in the Middle East region and 17 major brands.On Monday afternoon, the Obama administration released its Clean Power Plan, a major new EPA rule that aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the nation's electric power plants.

A bunch of media outlets are referring to this as "Obama's climate plan." But that's not quite right. More precisely, this rule is just one piece of a much broader Obama agenda to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade. The Clean Power Plan is certainly a significant component, but it isn't even expected to account for a majority of the cuts Obama's envisioning. So keep an eye on all those other rules and policies, as well.

Obama's climate agenda involves a whole slew of rules and regulations

Broadly speaking, President Obama's climate change plan boils down to a simple set of numbers. The United States is currently taking part in international talks to address global warming. And as part of those talks, the Obama administration has vowed that US greenhouse gas emissions will decline 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025:

Tax Policy Center)" data-chorus-optimize-field="main_image"> Tax Policy Center)"> Tax Policy Center)" data-chorus-optimize-field="main_image">

That's not an easy task. As of 2013, US greenhouse gas emissions had fallen just 8.5 percent below 2005 levels, a drop that largely happened due to the recession, to a natural gas boom that pushed out dirtier coal power, and to a rise in vehicle efficiency. But that's still not enough. And more recently, emissions have started creeping up again. Plus, Congress has no interest in passing climate legislation of any sort.

So to push down emissions even further, the Obama administration has been issuing an array of new rules and regulations through the EPA and other executive-branch agencies. A partial list includes:

Stricter fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, which will steadily rise through 2025.

Stricter fuel economy standards for heavy trucks, buses, and vans, which will steadily rise through 2027.

Proposed CO2 emission standards for any new coal- and gas-fired power plants built in the United States. This rule, when finalized, will make it extremely difficult to build any new coal plants that don't capture and bury their carbon dioxide emissions (a still-nascent technology).

Standards to curtail methane leaks from all new oil and gas wells, as well as voluntary partnerships to limit methane from agriculture.

Various initiatives to curtail hydrofluorocarbons, another potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners and refrigeration.

None of the above has gone through Congress — most of it is being done under legal authority that the Supreme Court granted the EPA back in 2007.

You can also throw in other policies enacted throughout Obama's presidency that have helped reshape the energy landscape and curtail emissions. There were the expanded tax credits for wind and solar power in the 2009 stimulus bill. The Energy Department has been setting new energy efficiency standards for household appliances. The EPA crafted a rule cracking down on mercury pollution, which has pushed utilities to retire many of their oldest, dirtiest coal plants. Meanwhile, states like California and New York have conducted their own policies to boost clean energy and curtail emissions. It all adds up.

The Clean Power Plan is just one part of that climate agenda

Now, on top of all that, the EPA is finalizing its Clean Power Plan, which will directly address carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.

This is certainly one of the more ambitious climate rules the Obama administration has done, given that power plants account for 31 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions. And the Clean Power Plan is expected to have a serious impact on the electricity sector, reducing power plant emissions roughly 20 percent from today's levels by 2030.

But in the grand scheme of things, that amounts to a 6 percentage point cut in US greenhouse gases — or about one-quarter of the emission cuts necessary to hit Obama's 2025 climate goal. Significant? Yes. The whole story? No.

So will Obama's broader climate plan solve climate change?

Not by itself, no. Even Obama's broader climate plan is only one piece of an even bigger global effort. And that global plan has a whole lot of moving parts.

First, the United States actually needs to hit those 2025 targets — and that's not yet guaranteed, even with the Clean Power Plan in place. A recent analysis from the World Resources Institute suggests that the US will need either more climate policies from Congress (which looks unlikely right now) or new regulations from the next president. Those additional rules could involve things like emissions cuts from refineries, cement plants, airplanes, and so on, as well as strengthening some of Obama's existing policies. So a lot depends on the next president.

Second, other countries would have to take their own climate measures. After all, the United States only accounts for about 17 percent of global emissions. We certainly can't solve anything by ourselves. The Obama administration is hoping that its recent efforts — including the Clean Power Plan — will spur other countries to respond in kind. Over the past year, for instance, China and Brazil have put out their own pledges for curbing emissions. The ultimate goal is for all these proposals to get stitched together into a global climate agreement at UN talks in Paris in December 2015.

But ultimately, the whole world will need to step up its climate ambitions if we want to avoid significant temperature increases. The International Energy Agency recently estimated that even if you take every nation's current climate pledges seriously, we're still on pace for around 3°C of warming by 2100 — well above the 2°C limit that most countries have set as a goal. Everyone needs to do more.

So that's where the Clean Power Plan fits in the broader scheme of things. It's a major policy, yes, but stabilizing global temperatures and "fixing" climate change will require a lot of moving parts.

A decade after the original 2006 series wowed audiences with its artfully filmed, high-definition footage of elusive snow leopards and hyrdoplaning dolphins and adorable polar bear cubs, the highly anticipated six-part follow-up promises an even more stunning adventure, albeit one that comes with a grave warning.

The spirit of the series remains the same: Planet Earth II travels from deserts to swamplands to even the nooks and crannies of towering skyscrapers to showcase the wonders of the animal kingdom as few people have ever seen them. And thanks to the technology advancements of the past 10 years, the picture definition is higher than ever. But so are the stakes of the stories.

Related How Planet Earth II filmed its thrilling "Snake Island" chase scene

In this sequel, David Attenborough’s iconic narration often takes a melancholy turn as he explains why an island’s crab population is deteriorating, or why a family of lanky lemurs has lost much of its habitat. It’s only been a decade since Planet Earth debuted, but in that time period, the impact of humans on the animals and landscapes Planet Earth II covers is so significant that the series is forced to acknowledge it over and over again. And in its final episode, it takes on “Cities,” making humans’ role in climate change abundantly clear, and often heartbreaking to watch.

To gain some insight into how the creators of Planet Earth II decided to broach the topic, I spoke with executive producer Mike Gunton and director Elizabeth White about the storytelling challenges they faced and the inevitability of integrating climate change into the series’ latest iteration. Here’s what they had to say.

This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Caroline Framke

Before you started shooting Planet Earth II, had you already planned to be more explicit about the impact of climate change on animals and their habitats? Or was there a point during filming when it became clear that you didn’t have a choice?

Elizabeth White

In each of the different habitats, we do address an issue. “Cities” is very obvious, the pros and cons of cities with lights and all that kind of stuff. But with all these shows, it felt as if, if you’re trying to tell a complete story — or as much as you can with 10 or 12 stories in a 47-minute film — all of us producers felt that there was an issue that we were going to have to bring up.

For “Islands,” I felt that invasive species and extinction on islands was a big one. Because when we were trying to find stories, it was like, “Oh, god, just imagine if you could do the elephant bird in Madagascar,” or, “Why are there no big mammals?” And a lot of it is because extinctions that have happened. So it felt like you couldn’t tell a story about islands without mentioning something of rats, cats, and in this case, we went for the story of the yellow crazy ant, because that’s actually massively destructive all across Indonesia and Malaysia, but [the story of how it’s devastated the native crab communities] hasn’t been told.

Mike Gunton

It’s also quite a surprise that an ant can do that. So again, we’re picking a story that tells quite an intense and thought-provoking environmental story, yet it’s still a fascinating biologically natural history piece that’s visually fascinating as well. It’s even a little bit gruesome. Whereas a rat just eating an egg...

Elizabeth White

It wouldn’t captivate people. If people turn it off, you’re not going to get the rest of your film’s message through.

I think it just felt at some point that [for example] you couldn’t make a jungle film without talking about deforestation. Those stories sort of naturally felt like part of the piece.

Mike Gunton

[Also] putting them into context rather than just sort of doing a handbrake turn ... the crabs had a story, and then the twist was, “Actually, they’re now suffering from the perils of invasive species.” We’re doing a story about the indri [lemurs], and then we do a little twist and say, “Of course, in the 10 years since this indri was born, the amount of forest it has to live in has [dramatically] reduced.”

We were quite pleased with being able to evoke some sense of the fragility of the planet whilst not breaking the structure and the grammar of the series.

Elizabeth White

Yeah. It’s not a doom-and-gloom show, but it’s a thought-provoking show. It’s like, “These places are special, look how wonderful this is — but this is fragile. Think about these things.”

The final piece at the end of the series, “Cities,” very much says that we need to create a planet not just for us but all life on Earth. It’s about sowing those seeds that’ll make people walk away mulling it over. We have no control over what they choose to do, but you want to sow a seed that makes people feel connected, and empowered to do something.

"I will not be deterred in executing the vital mission of the Department of Education," DeVos says

(CNN) Protesters briefly blocked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as she tried to enter a public school in Washington on Friday morning.

Demonstrators holding signs greeted DeVos when she arrived at Jefferson Middle School Academy in southwest Washington, not far from the Department of Education building.

When she headed toward the school's entrance, the protesters stood in front of her, video from CNN affiliate WJLA showed.

DeVos then turned around and walked away, the video showed, with one protester walking beside her shouting, "Go back! Shame, shame" as she got into an SUV and drove off.

Protesters gather outside Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington to oppose a visit by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

In a statement issued Friday afternoon, DeVos said she subsequently got inside the school to meet with students, faculty and administrators.The Supreme Court today denied an industry request to reconsider a lower court ruling against a Bush administration rule on mercury emissions from power plants.



The court announced today that it would not review a decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, requested by the Utility Air Regulatory Group, to overturn the Clean Air Mercury Rule.



The utility group asked the court to review the case last fall, arguing that the Bush administration had legally decided not to regulate power plants under the Clean Air Act's Section 112, which requires the strictest emission controls, in order to allow for a more flexible cap-and-trade approach favored by utilities.



Attorneys for the Bush administration's Justice Department also requested a Supreme Court hearing on the mercury case last fall, but the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to drop the request for review.



The court today also granted the Obama administration's request to dismiss the Bush administration's appeal.



Obama's EPA this month announced plans to develop maximum achievable control technology, or MACT, standards for electric utilities that force each individual plant to curb their emissions, as opposed to the Bush administration's cap-and-trade approach that the federal appeals court struck down.



John Walke, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Obama administration would end eight years of efforts to stave off mercury controls for power plants.



"That shameful era is at an end, but thankfully now we can all look forward to strong MACT standards that will sharply reduce mercury emissions from power plants," Walke said.



The utility group maintains that EPA had lawfully decided not to regulate coal- and oil-fired power plants under the stricter section of the Clean Air Act, said Lee Zeugin, the industry group's counsel and an attorney at Hunton & Williams.



"I guess we're going to move forward with MACT [standards]," Zeugin said, adding that the group remains concerned about whether EPA has the legal authority to require stricter controls from power plants.



The agency will now embark on several years of MACT rulemaking for power plants with no mercury regulations in place in the meantime, Zeugin said. When the final rule is released, "I'm sure UARG will challenge EPA's authority to do any of it," he said.

Reprinted from Greenwire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500An Oklahoma judge on Thursday ordered Scott Pruitt, the state's attorney general and President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, to turn over thousands of emails related to his communication with the oil, gas and coal industry.

The Center for Media and Democracy has been seeking the release of Pruitt's correspondence with fossil-fuel representatives under public records laws for more than two years. The group filed suit over Pruitt's refusal to turn over the documents and requested the expedited hearing that led to the judge's decision, which was first reported by E&E News.

The ruling by District Court Judge Aletia Timmons, who said there had been "an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested," came a day before the Senate is expected to vote on confirming Pruitt to head the EPA, an agency that he has sued repeatedly during former President Barack Obama's years in the White House.

Timmons gave the attorney general's office until Tuesday to release the records, meaning they likely won't come to light until after he is sworn in to his new position.

"It should never have come to this," Nick Surgey, the advocacy group's director of research, said in an interview. "We shouldn't have had to go to court to force the release of emails that were requested more than two years ago. . . . It makes it pretty difficult for people to vet his record."

The ruling led environmental groups and some Senate Democrats to immediately call for a delay of Pruitt's confirmation vote until lawmakers and the public have a chance to review the emails.

"A rushed Senate vote to confirm Pruitt as EPA Administrator right now would be a travesty," Elizabeth Thompson, president of climate and political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. "The documents in question are related to Pruitt's fitness to serve as head of EPA. Senators should exercise due diligence when confirming nominees, and they can't do that when they've been denied access to relevant information."

But those calls are likely to fall on deaf ears among Senate Republicans. Formal debate on Pruitt's nomination was already underway on the Senate floor Thursday.

"Attorney General Pruitt has been more thoroughly vetted than any nominee for EPA administrator," Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. "Democrats have been stalling nominees across the Senate. The EPA needs an administrator. It is time to confirm him."

Pruitt's close ties with the fossil fuel industry have long been the focus of criticism from environmental advocates.

He has received more than $300,000 from oil and gas companies during his campaigns over the years. He also led the Republican Attorneys General Association, which received substantial sums of money from Koch Industries, ExxonMobil, Murray Energy and other firms. In 2014, the New York Times reported that a letter ostensibly written by Pruitt alleging the EPA had overestimated air pollution from natural gas drilling was actually written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of Oklahoma's largest oil and gas companies.

"That's actually called representative government in my view of the world," Pruitt later said of the letter.

He has continued to defend his alliances with fossil fuel firms, saying during his recent confirmation hearing that he has never sought to represent a single company but rather stand up for the concerns of one of his state's largest industries.

During that same hearing, Pruitt told lawmakers that as EPA administrator, he would steer the agency away from what he called an era of overzealous and unlawful regulation during the Obama years. He said the EPA under his leadership would respect the authority of states and be open to a "full range of views."

Thursday evening, the attorney general's office said it "remains committed to following the letter and spirit of the Open Records Act." Spokesman Lincoln Ferguson said that in light of the court ruling, "we are reviewing all of our options in order to ensure fairness to all requestors rather than elevating the importance of some requests over others."The Central Appalachian region has been the heart of coal country for as long as anyone can remember. But in recent years, Kentucky and West Virginia's coal industries have been facing a painful decline — and that decline is starting to get widespread attention.

(Ed Reinke/Associated Press)

The House Energy and Commerce Committee held a big hearing last week on how coal communities in the area are suffering, with Republicans blaming Environmental Protection Agency regulations for the damage. In a related vein, our former colleague Suzy Khimm had an in-depth piece for MSNBC looking at eastern Kentucky, which is being hit hard by both the coal industry's decline and sharp budget cuts from sequestration.

It's worth taking a closer look at why, exactly, coal communities in Central Appalachia have suffered so heavily in recent years. Regulations aren't the whole story. The entire U.S. coal industry is under pressure from a variety of forces — from the shale gas boom to coal-plant retirements — and the Appalachian region in particular is getting hurt by trends that have been building for decades.

The decline of Appalachia

First, as Patrick Reis reported over at National Journal, coal jobs in West Virginia and Kentucky have been vanishing for decades — long before Barack Obama became president. So there are some long-term trends at work here:

Why have Kentucky and West Virginia lost 38,000 coal jobs since 1983? For one, coal mining has become increasingly automated in recent decades, particularly as companies have shifted to techniques such as mountaintop-removal mining, which are less labor intensive. (An EPA crackdown on mountaintop removal in 2009 actually led to a small bump in coal employment in West Virginia.)

Another big problem for Appalachia's coal industry has been competition from cheaper, low-sulfur coal out West — particularly from Wyoming's Powder River Basin. Here's a good chart from Scientific American's David Wogan showing this shift:

On top of everything else, Central Appalachia's coal now appears to be running out, as many of the thick, easy-to-mine seams have vanished. The Energy Information Administration estimates that coal production in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia will soon be just half of what it was in 2008, plunging from 234 million tons down to 112 million tons in 2015.

Problems in the broader coal industry

And this is all before delving into the pressures that the entire U.S. coal industry is facing. A combination of cheap natural gas from shale fracking and new pollution regulations from the EPA have been elbowing aside coal in the electricity sector.

As a result, one recent report from the Energy Information Administration found that U.S. plant owners and operators are getting ready to retire 27 gigawatts' worth of coal generation, or about 8.5 percent of the coal fleet, between now and 2016:

So far, the coal-mining industry has weathered this storm by exporting more coal abroad, especially to Europe. But the future for coal exports is murky. Environmentalists have protested planned export terminals in the Northwest. And analysts at Goldman Sachs think the overseas market for coal — particularly in China — could stagnate in the years to come.

That means the U.S. coal industry as a whole is facing pressure from a variety of fronts — both regulatory pressures and competition from cheaper sources like natural gas. (There was also the Sierra Club's "Beyond Coal" campaign in the 2000s, which was particularly effective at blocking new coal plants.) Yet Appalachia is particularly vulnerable, in part due to headwinds that have been gathering strength for decades.

The cost of coal's decline

So what does that mean for coal-reliant communities in Central Appalachia and elsewhere? In the short term, nothing good.

While the coal industry directly employs just 21,000 workers in West Virginia, the industry itself added about $5.9 billion to state GDP in 2008 and generated $670 million in taxes — a whopping 15 percent of the state’s budget.

Those funds won’t vanish tomorrow, but they will slowly slip away. A 2010 report by the consulting firm Downstream Strategies noted that coal's decline would lead to sharp decreases in tax revenue for Kentucky and West Virginia. (By contrast, coal production in Northern Appalachia, including parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania, is expected hold steady for years.)

And there will likely be knock-on effects for years to come. As I reported here, many retired miners in Appalachia are getting hurt by the disruptions in the coal industry, as companies file for bankruptcy and try to shed pension and health obligations for retirees. Suzy Khimm's piece details the many ways in which Eastern Kentucky has been ravaged by coal's decline.

Some experts have suggested that Central Appalachia could eventually thrive from shifting away from its single-minded focus on coal. The Downstream Strategies report observes that the region has a wealth of clean-energy resources, from wind to solar to sustainable biomass. West Virginia, for one, is looking to get into shale-gas drilling. Still, it’d be a mistake to gloss over how disruptive — and painful — that transition could be. Just look at Detroit’s struggles in shifting away from its longstanding reliance on the auto industry.

And, so far, the federal government hasn't helped much. Here's a telling line from Suzy's piece: "[Obama] promised in June to 'give special care to people and communities that are unsettled by the transition' to cleaner energy. But so far, little extra help has arrived in eastern Kentucky."Ezra Klein: You’re a big science fiction fan, so I'm curious if you have apocalyptic fears that lurk outside the policy window.

Paul Krugman: If you look at the long sweep of history, global integration has tended to bring mass pandemics in its wake. My understanding is that you basically got waves of major plagues in the ancient world, pretty much whenever somebody controlled the steppes of Central Asia well enough that substantial commerce between China and the West could take place. Pretty soon afterwards, lots of people died. In the opening of the New World, it wasn't the conquistadors, it was the microbes that really did it here.

Now we have this very integrated world with very uneven levels of public health. You have to think that a pandemic is at least a possibility. I think we can be reasonably sure that it won't actually involve zombies, but aside from that, it's a real threat.

Ezra Klein: I worry about that too, but I worry about it because I think it’s still hard for us to grok the level of bacterial integration we really have in the modern world. When I see the efforts to make sure that unauthorized immigrants can't access government healthcare programs, I always wonder what folks think is going to happen if these people get sick? These are the people who are preparing our food and taking care of our children. And it just gets worse when you’re talking about threats outside our borders.

Paul Krugman: Yeah, the way Ebola was covered was about at the same level as media coverage of shark attacks. The public would have learned nothing. Maybe we would have learned we need to close the borders or we need to fear people who don't look like us. I guess Time just named the Ebola responders their person of the year. Good for them, but the public has no idea of how much we depend upon this pretty much invisible line of defense that is looking pretty shabby these days.

Ezra Klein: A fear I hear about a lot lately is the idea that we’ll build a self-improving artificial intelligence that will ultimately destroy us.

Paul Krugman: The history of artificial intelligence is that it's always ten years ahead, and that's been true for about 50 years.

Ezra Klein: But let’s assume it does emerge. A lot of smart people right now seem terrified by it. You've got Elon Musk tweeting, "Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable." Google's Larry Page is reading Nick Bostrom’s new book Superintelligence. I wonder, reading this stuff, whether people are overestimating the value of analytical intelligence. It’s just never been my experience that the higher you go up the IQ scale, the better people are at achieving their goals.

Our intelligence is really lashed to a lot of things that aren’t about intelligence, like endless generations of social competition in the evolutionary fight for the best mates. I don’t even know how to think about what a genuinely new, artifical intelligence would believe is important and what it would find interesting. It often seems to me that one of the reasons people get so afraid of AI is you have people who themselves are really bought into intelligence as being the most important of all traits and they underestimate importance of other motivations and aptitudes. But it seems as likely as not that a superintelligence would be completely hopeless at anything beyond the analysis of really abstract intellectual problems.

Paul Krugman: Yeah, or one thing we might find out if we produce something that is vastly analytically superior is it ends up going all solipsistic and spending all its time solving extremely difficult and pointless math problems. We just don't know. I feel like I was suckered again into getting all excited about self-driving cars, and so on, and now I hear it's actually a lot further from really happening that we thought. Producing artificial intelligence that can cope with the real world is still a much harder problem than people realize.

How broken is Washington?

Ezra Klein: What do you think about the argument that’s playing out on the left between the vision of the Democratic Party represented by Hillary Clinton and the vision represented by Elizabeth Warren? Do you think they’re that different?

Paul Krugman: I would say at this point it looks mostly like symbolism. Among liberals in America, there’s actually fairly widespread dismay over actually what I think of as Clinton-Blairism; the kind of ‘90s liberalism that is not really taking on economic inequality, not really taking on Wall Street. And there’s a sense that Hillary Clinton might be a return to that.

But I don’t think Hillary Clinton is going to try and make it 1999 again. I remember in 2008 —as a Times columnist, I can't do endorsements, so you have no idea which party I favor in general elections — but I was skeptical of Obama at a time when a lot of people on the Left were very, very high on him. I heard a number of people saying, oh, god, if Hillary is elected, she's going to bring in the old Rubin crowd, people like Larry Summers, to run the economy. And then Obama got elected and did exactly that. I think, if anything, he was more conventional on economics than she was.

I think at this point, Elizabeth Warren is now the visible embodiment of the wing of the Democratic Party that’s determined not to return to Clinton-Blairism. That makes her useful even if she doesn’t run, as — I don't know — a ghost or something looming over Hillary.

Ezra Klein: Do you think it is possible at this point for a president to be successful amidst divided government in Congress?

Paul Krugman: I’d say basically no, but it depends on your definition of success. You can have the economy expanding, no foreign crises, and you can preside over a time of prosperity, which is kind of what happened with Bill Clinton. But if anything actually has to be done, no. Everybody in Washington has learned this very damaging lesson, which is that if somebody else holds the White House, but you have blocking power, sabotage works.

I think we are in for a very ugly time until one party or the other establishes a strong enough hold that the other party finally has an Eisenhower moment of essentially accepting the changes and going back to some kind of politics around a relatively narrow range of issues.

Ezra Klein: When you say it that way, it sounds like we're in a dangerous period in American politics. You have an electoral system that is biased a bit towards Democrats at the presidential level and heavily biased towards Republicans at the House level. So you're likely in for a really long period of divided government. And I agree with you, I think you have a level of political polarization that makes successful legislating very, very difficult amidst divided government. It seems possible that we’re looking at a decade or more in which we have a political system that is essentially unable to make any forward motion on major problems. It might be able to respond to a crisis, but it cannot affirmatively legislate.

Paul Krugman: Well, I'm not even sure about responding to a crisis. I find myself in meetings with international financial types. It's all the usual discussions, and they don't like to talk domestic U.S. politics, but then at some point, somebody says, what if we had another major financial crisis? What if we really needed something like TARP again? What are the chances that something like TARP could actually happen in this political environment? And everybody goes quiet, and looks down at their blotter.

Ezra Klein: I'd push on that a little bit. I think back to TARP, and it failing the first time, but then the crushing market reaction moving Congress. I still think market reactions can move Congress. What scares me is that you can really screw up a country by not doing things you should have done. But then the crisis doesn't come in a sharp moment where you can identify the cause. It’s just in lost percentage points of economic growth over a long period of time where nobody can be clearly blamed, and there’s not an easy, obvious fix.

Paul Krugman: One of my pet peeves actually is that people talk about policy as if, as long as you've avoided a hot crisis, things are okay even when they’re obviously not. The pet peeve that affects me personally is the cancellation of the Hudson Rail Tunnel in New York City, and it’s kind of perfect. Essentially, because of political partisanship, we still have the world's greatest city totally dependent on a tunnel completed in 1910 for all public transit linkage to the west. That doesn't show up in an abrupt collapse, but those sorts of things show up in a steady degradation of our prospects.

The future of American politics

Ezra Klein: What do you think are the big stories for the next five years in American politics? What do you think it is that people should be paying attention to but they’re ignoring?

Paul Krugman: We have the continuing toll of a weak labor market. Yes, the unemployment rate is down, but we still have a lot of long-term unemployment. We still have a really lousy environment for new college graduates. This doesn't show up in any dramatic event, but it means that we're seeing a lot of dreams getting killed in ways that are going to take a toll on national morale, with hardly any focused political pressure to do anything about it.

Then there are the environmental issues. I think crashing oil prices are going to put the brakes on fracking, but as best as I can make out, done right, shale can in fact be an important, very positive force. But that requires that there be adequate regulation to make sure that it is done right. Given the current environment, it's very unlikely that that'll happen. So we're going to be seeing a lot more stories of poisoned wells, of earthquakes. These ongoing environmental issues that will probably produce a lot of local rage. You drive into certain parts of Pennsylvania and there's obviously huge local anger, but it's not likely to move things on a wider front.

Then there’s the trend towards inequality, which has not reversed, let’s put it that way. You might wonder at what point at which there's enough revulsion to be politically effective. I remember when we were writing stories about 30,000 square-foot mansions, and we're talking about those being torn down for 80,000 square-foot mansions. So it goes on.

Ezra Klein: Do you worry more about wealth inequality or income inequality?

Paul Krugman: Income inequality, but I don't think they're separable issues. We need to worry a lot more about lagging incomes in the bottom half or bottom two-thirds of the income distribution than we worry about soaring incomes at the top. And the people in the bottom two-thirds of the income distribution have hardly any wealth. For them, wealth has gone from essentially zero 30 years ago to essentially zero now. So for them, it's income that is crucial.

The wealth inequality measures are useful because they are, in some ways, a more reliable gauge of what's happening at the top. If incomes fluctuate a lot at the top, you can argue, though it's overstated, that it's a changing cast of people. But the top 0.1 percent in wealth is not an ever-shifting cast of characters.

Ezra Klein: Do you think the story of median and lower-than-median wage stagnation and the story of income inequality are the same story, or different? It seems to me that you can see different patterns. The story of the huge changes in income inequality seems to really be focused in the top three or four percent, and it seems to start about 10 years after media wage stagnation. Or, I guess, to put it another way, do you think we could solve wage stagnation without solving income inequality?

Paul Krugman: Probably not. I think if you really did something about wage stagnation you would find that it would have a pretty strong effect in curbing incomes at the top as well. I think if you try to understand the factors behind soaring incomes at the top, they are many of the same forces that are leading to stagnating incomes for workers. The idea that we can totally separate these things is wrong. It almost harkens back to the Clinton-Blairism. You did have, in the UK at least, a fairly serious attempt in Blair/Brown to tackle poverty and to reduce income inequality, combined with a sympathetic, laissez faire attitude towards the top one percent. It produced results for a while, but in the end, it seems to be economically and politically unsustainable. It gave rise, eventually, to a regime that's doing its best to increase inequality on all fronts.

Ezra Klein: Have you seen plans from any politicians, or even any think tanks, for addressing income inequality that feel to you equal to the scale of the problem? I feel like you hear politicians rail on income inequality as a defining challenge of our time, and then they want to raise the top marginal tax rate by three percent or something. There's a real gap between the scale of the problem people are describing and the solutions they’re willing to embrace. Do you think this is a problem we actually know how to solve?

Paul Krugman: I think it is, but we know that it takes an extraordinary political environment to change it. The Great Compression took place under FDR. They took a society that was about as unequal as what we have now, maybe more so because of a weaker social safety net, and turned it into a broadly middle-class society that lasted for more than a generation. But that was done through a combination of a dramatic increase in unionization, extremely high rates of progressive taxation, and wage controls during the war that were used to compress the wage distribution.

So we can describe a set of policies that will restore a middle-class society, but they take FDR-sized majorities in Congress, and even then, it took a war to really bring those changes about. Which is why everybody, me included, talks about chipping away at the margins and hopes that, cumulatively, you're going to get something done.Republican legislators need a way to pay for their eventual Obamacare replacement plan. One leading contender is capping the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, which shows up in multiple replacement plans as well as recent interviews with legislators. It’s going to be a huge fight.

Right now, companies and their workers pay no taxes on health benefits. This means the federal government misses out on a lot of potential revenue — $260 billion in 2013, according to Congressional Budget Office data.

Capturing a fraction of that would go a long way toward paying for some of the other things Republicans want to do, like continue subsidizing the individual market. But it won’t be easy: An aggressive lobbying campaign has already begun against the policy, which Republicans have not officially endorsed.

Representatives of large companies are already swarming Capitol Hill, meeting with legislators to argue that this would amount to a significant tax on America’s middle class. Some have retained new lobbying firms and launched new coalitions devoted to making sure the proposal never sees the light of day.

“I think it’s being considered very seriously, and we’ve recently ratcheted up our message to make sure that legislators understand the unintended consequences of a policy like this,” says Jim Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which lobbies on behalf of major corporations offering health benefit programs.

His organization has, for years now, fought against the Affordable Care Act’s “Cadillac tax.” In mid-February, they shifted focus and started a second campaign: Don’t Tax My Health Care, targeted at new Republican efforts.

Both conservative and liberal economists tend to like the idea of capping (or eliminating) the exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage. They argue that the exclusion is regressive, creating a tax benefit only for higher-income people who are more likely to get coverage at work. It encourages companies to provide more generous benefit packages that drive up health spending, because the tax preference makes their dollars go further.

But even if the economic consensus is against the tax exclusion, the political consensus is completely for it. Repealing it could drive up the cost of health coverage for millions of Americans — not exactly a winning campaign slogan.

“This is one of the oldest issues in all of health policy,” says Joe Antos, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. “We’re not seeing anything new, as far as the politics are concerned: Nobody is in favor of creating a new tax.”

The employer-sponsored tax exclusion, explained

America is exceptional in that we are the only developed country with an employer-based health insurance system — and our tax code completely explains why.

The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 codified the policy that companies can provide health insurance benefits to workers tax-free. This affirmed a 1943 Tax Court ruling that had also decreed health benefits to be nontaxable.

"It’s a huge discount off the price of health insurance," says Melissa Thomasson, an economist at Ohio’s Miami University who has written extensively on the history of health insurance. "And it happened very quietly. I looked a few years ago to find out the name of who made the decision, and it's been lost to history."

Flash-forward about 80 years or so, and the health insurance tax break is the biggest in the federal budget. It’s regressive; we've created a tax system wherein the people with good jobs are getting their health care subsidized by the people with worse jobs or even no jobs.

The tax exclusion also drives up demand for expensive health insurance. This is partly because of the subsidy. But it's partly because employees usually don't know the real prices of their health benefits. Though ultimately economists believe that the money employers spend on health benefits comes from the money they would have spent on wages, workers don't feel the direct cost of their health insurance choices, so they have little reason to try to keep spending low.

Economists hate the tax break for health insurance. Politicians love it.

Doing away with the tax exclusion might seem like a no-brainer, but it's very politically difficult. It would mean a huge price increase on employer-sponsored insurance, which is not a popular platform to run on.

John McCain got nailed for suggesting capping the tax exclusion in his 2008 campaign. He was targeted with what became the most frequently aired political ad of the past decade.

“McCain would tax health insurance for the first time ever,” the spooky voiceover warns. “His plan would raise costs for employers offering health care, so your coverage could be reduced or dropped completely.”

That experience left many conservatives skittish about going down this road again. As former Republican Senate staffer Chris Jacobs tweeted, “conservative health wonks” still have “PTSD” from the McCain experience.

Ironically, President Obama’s health law managed to make some inroads on the issue. It includes a 40 percent tax on the most expensive insurance plans. Know as the Cadillac tax, this fine will hit any insurance plans that cost more than $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family.

But whether it will come into effect is still unclear: In late 2015, Obama pushed its implementation back from 2018 to 2020.

Republican legislators, meanwhile, are now being treated to some of the pushback that McCain faced when he suggested capping the tax exclusion.

The insurance broker firm Lockton helps negotiate health benefits for large companies that collectively employee 10 million people. Last week, it hired the DC-based lobbying firm BGR to help make its message clear on Capitol Hill: Don’t mess with the employer market.

“During meetings on Capitol Hill last week, there were acknowledgements of the role of the group market and a commitment to not disrupting that,” says Ed Fensholt, a senior vice president at Lockton. “I think there was, however, a lack of understanding that certain things they do might have a disruptive effect.”

All of this is happening before Republicans have even introduced their Obamacare replacement. This lobbying frenzy makes people like Antos, who has watched this battle before, skeptical that the current crop of legislators will have any more success capping the employer-sponsored tax exclusion.

“This is one fight you’re not going to be able to get through the Senate,” he says. “You can spend a lot of political capital on it, but you’re not going to make any progress.”Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Thinkstock, Library of Congress.

Before the election, when Donald Trump was still just an unlikely presidential nominee, a conservative under the pseudonym “Publius Decius Mus,” wrote a remarkable essay in support of Trump. The pseudonym alone gave a glimpse into the writer’s thinking. The real-life Decius was a Roman consul who sacrificed himself to the gods for the sake of his embattled army. And in the same way, our internet Decius called on conservatives to embrace Trump—to back the vulgarian who mocked their ideals—for the sake of saving the country as they knew it. “The ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle,” he wrote, hailing the real estate mogul as the only figure who understood the stakes, who would beat back these “foreigners” and preserve America’s democratic tradition as Decius saw it. Not a tradition of pluralism, but one of exclusion, in which white Americans stand as the only legitimate players in political life. A dictatorship of the herrenvolk.

Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.

“Decius”—since revealed as Michael Anton, a former George W. Bush administration speechwriter—now works for President Trump. And he isn’t the only figure in the Trump circle who holds these views. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, his former aide Stephen Miller, and right-wing media mogul Stephen Bannon occupy prominent positions in the present administration. Like Anton, they hold deep antagonism to immigrants and immigration, opposition to their equality within American society, and nostalgia for a time when prosperity was the province of the native-born and a select few “assimilated” immigrants. But these aren’t just ideologues with jobs in a friendly administration. They are the architects of Trump’s policy, the executors of a frighteningly coherent political ideology.

What is that ideology? Most Americans think of “racism” in individualized terms. To call someone a “racist,” then, is to pass judgment on his or her character—a declaration that this person doesn’t belong in polite society. It’s why, when faced with the accusation, Americans often rush to deny any prejudice. I don’t have a racist bone in my body, goes the cliché. But individualized prejudice is just one way to think of racism. There’s also institutional bias or systemic outcomes—the things that lead critics to deem the criminal justice system as “racist.” And beyond the material, there’s racism as ideology—a structured worldview defined by support for race hierarchy and racial caste.

Racist ideology ebbs and flows through our history, changing with the shape of American society and the contours of American life. When the South was a vast archipelago of human bondage and labor camps, racist ideology took the form of a widespread belief in black inferiority and underlay the forceful defenses of slavery. When segregation was law and legislators defended lynching on the Senate floor—even though anti-racism had claimed a small foothold in the national consciousness—racist ideology was a virulent and violent “white supremacy.” America still has white supremacists, and they still terrorize nonwhites with harassment and violence. But now that most Americans share a nominal commitment to racial equality—such that the country celebrated at the election of its first black president, more than eight years ago—explicitly racist ideology has cloaked itself in a kind of “nationalism,” outside the mainstream, but not far from its borders.

This nationalism, white nationalism, was the ideology of Anton’s essay, driven by contempt for immigrants and foreigners of all stripes. A century ago, in the preface to Madison Grant’s The Passing of the Great Race, a then-popular work of scientific racism, American eugenicist Henry Fairfield Osborn ably summed up this worldview, which now holds the White House.

Thus conservation of that race which has given us the true spirit of Americanism is not a matter either of racial pride or of racial prejudice; it is a matter of love of country, of a true sentiment which is based upon knowledge and the lessons of history rather than upon the sentimentalism which is fostered by ignorance. If I were asked: What is the greatest danger which threatens the American republic to-day? I would certainly reply: The gradual dying out among our people of those hereditary traits through which the principles of our religious, political and social foundations were laid down and their insidious replacement by traits of less noble character.

This is Decius’ view. It was essentially the ideology behind Trump's campaign, defined by its hostility toward Muslims, marked by its reliance on racist stereotypes of Hispanic immigrants, and not so subtly contemptuous of black Americans. Now, it all but drives Trump’s administration, voiced by key figures and expressed through policy.

The ideological leader of the Trump movement is Sessions, hailed by Bannon for “developing populist nation-state policies” from his somewhat isolated perch in the Senate. Bannon, who avoids the spotlight, gives away the game in his praise of Sessions. “In America and Europe, working people are reasserting their right to control their own destinies,” he wrote in a recent statement to the Washington Post, blasting the “cosmopolitan elites in the media that live in a handful of our larger cities.” Given the demographics of Trump’s support—given the demographics of Europe—this definition of “working people” can mean only one thing: white people. And “cosmopolitan elites” has a long history as a euphemism for Jews and other minorities.

Sessions at least does us the service of being clear about his ideas and priorities. “In seven years we’ll have the highest percentage of Americans, non-native born, since the founding of the republic,” he said in a 2015 interview with Bannon. He continued:

Some people think we’ve always had these numbers, and it’s not so; it’s very unusual; it’s a radical change. When the numbers reached about this high in 1924, the president and Congress changed the policy, and it slowed down immigration significantly. We then assimilated through 1965 and created really the solid middle class of America, with assimilated immigrants, and it was good for America.

In 1924, Congress passed the Johnson–Reed Act, which placed strict limits on immigration. But these weren’t neutral limits, broadly applicable to migrants from all parts of the globe. They were national limits—racial limits. The stakes, for proponents of the law, were nothing less than the survival of an Anglo-Saxon America. In Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925, the late historian John Higham notes how lawmakers and legislators conceived of the project of immigration restriction. “Its champions now largely ignored the economic arguments they had advanced in behalf of the first quota law three years before,” he writes. “Instead, they talked about preserving a ‘distinct American type,’ about keeping America for Americans, or about saving the Nordic race from being swamped.”

To that end, the Johnson–Reed Act placed tight quotas on Southern and Eastern Europeans, particularly Italians and Jews, Africans, and Middle Easterners. It barred Asian immigration entirely. “Without offense, but with regard to the salvation of our own, let us shut the door and assimilate what we have, and let us breed pure American citizens and develop our own American resources,” declared South Carolina Sen. Ellison DuRant Smith during debates over the law. This, for Sessions, is the right approach. Or, as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said to the Post, “Sen. Sessions laid a bit of groundwork ... on matters like trade and illegal immigration. It was candidate Trump then who was able to elevate those twin pillars in a way that cast it through the lens of what’s good for the American worker.”

White nationalism ties the refugee ban to efforts to deny government benefits to legal residents and to Trump’s promise to protect entitlements for those who receive them.

That Sessions brings herrenvolk ideology to American politics is even more apparent from his history beyond the Senate. As the NAACP Legal Defense Fund details in its report on the Alabama lawmaker, “An unrelenting hostility toward civil rights and racial justice has been the defining feature of Jeff Sessions’ professional life.” As a federal prosecutor, Sessions went after black activists for voting rights; as a lawmaker, he praised the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County, which opened the door to laws that disproportionately disadvantage and discourage black voters. This mix of restrictive voting and restrictions on immigration is almost tailor-made to enhance the voting power of one group: white Americans.

As for Bannon, he’s not just an informal spokesperson for President Trump; he is the president’s chief ideologist, and along with Sessions and Stephen Miller, has had a huge hand in crafting the administration’s agenda. To lawmakers, observers, and ordinary Americans, the first two weeks of the Trump era were a blitzkrieg. In short order, and working entirely through executive authority, Trump has launched an ambitious plan to transform American policy toward immigrants, refugees, and the Islamic world, all shaped by someone who once called legal immigration “the beating heart” of the problem in the United States. Thus far, Trump has directed Customs and Border Patrol to “secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall”; he has directed the hiring of 5,000 more border officers, and cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities.

Trump has used his discretion over immigration enforcement to give those officers almost unlimited discretion in instituting deportation proceedings, to include any noncitizen who is deemed a “risk to public safety or national security,” whether they’ve committed a crime or not. And most infamously, he’s declared a ban on refugee admission to the United States and a moratorium on entry from seven majority-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. And in the days since that move, thousands of people—students, professionals, medical patients, and entire families—have been barred from the United States, held in administrative limbo, or sent back to their countries of origin, even if they have valid visas or legal permanent residence in the country.

These weren’t the only executive orders from the first weeks of Trump’s presidency, but they were the most visible—the most controversial. They fulfill key promises of the Trump campaign: a wall, a Muslim ban, and a general crackdown on immigrants and immigration. In keeping with the white-nationalist ideas of that campaign and of the president’s brain trust, they target the stated threats to white hegemony. And they advance the white-nationalist narrative: that America will be made “great again” by preserving the integrity of white America.

If this seems unfair, consider Bannon’s views of Islam. “Islam is not a religion of peace—Islam is a religion of submission,” he said on his Breitbart radio show. “To be brutally frank, Christianity is dying in Europe and Islam is on the rise.” Likewise, in a 2014 speech to a meeting at the Vatican, he declared that the “Judeo-Christian West” was in the midst of a civilizational war with the Muslim world. “There is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global,” he said. “Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act.” Despite the facts of history, which show a complicated and often symbiotic relationship between Islam and the West, Bannon sees nothing but conflict, defined in racial and religious terms.

He’s echoed in more virulent and racist terms by figures outside the White House with strong ties to the administration. Frank Gaffney Jr. is an anti-Muslim activist who, notes the New York Times, worked with Conway when she was a pollster for his organization, sat with Bannon as a frequent guest on his show, and appeared in public addresses by Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser. In an interview with the Times, Gaffney gave his view of Muslims. “They essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions,” he said, in starkly dehumanizing terms, “for the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed.”

Beyond these views is the simple fact that Bannon was once CEO of Breitbart, a media consortium that openly caters to anti-Semites, white nationalists, and various elements of the extreme right wing. The website once featured a “black crime” section and openly praises white supremacists. The website’s most visible contributor, Milo Yiannopoulos, is a racist and misogynist provocateur who delights in Nazi iconography and other fascist kitsch.

Stephen Miller has a lower profile than either Sessions or Bannon, but he’s made his mark as a staffer for the former. “You could not get where we are today with this movement if it didn’t have a center of gravity that was intellectually coherent,” said Bannon of Miller in an interview with Politico Magazine. “And I think a ton of that was done by Sen. Sessions’ staff, and Stephen Miller was at the cutting edge of that.” As a student at Duke University, the now–30-year-old Miller worked closely with Richard Spencer, then a graduate student who would leave the academy and become an intellectual leader for the “alt-right,” an online movement of white nationalists. And as a columnist for the campus paper, Miller worried that “immigrants from non-European countries were not assimilating.”

Last year, as a key member of Trump’s presidential team, Miller had a strong hand in guiding the Republican nominee’s rhetoric on Muslim immigration. My colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley notes that Miller likely wrote the Trump speech that “complained darkly that Muslim communities within the United States were sheltering terrorists.” “[I]mmigration is probably the most, in Stephen’s view, one of the most existential issues facing us right now,” says a former colleague of Miller in an interview with the Atlantic. He is just as instrumental to the direction of the Trump White House as Sessions and Bannon, just as committed to an ideology of exclusion and white hegemony.

We can’t know for certain how many Americans voted for these ideas and this approach. What we can say is that tens of millions experienced Donald Trump’s campaign, heard his racist appeals, and set them aside to take a chance on an “outsider.” Now we’re faced with the extraordinary: A White House whose chief thinkers and architects are white nationalists, keepers of a dangerous tradition in our history, with an unprecedented opportunity to pull the United States back a century to an era of unvarnished nativism and prejudice. The past three weeks are likely just the beginning; we are sure to see even more action against immigrants and Muslims, even more tolerance for the worst forces in American life.

In this usage, white nationalist isn’t a pejorative; it’s the best term we have for the ideology of the Trump administration, one that gives coherence to its actions and approach. White nationalist helps us see how the expansive refugee ban is tied to the efforts to deny government benefits to legal residents and is tied to the promise by Trump to protect entitlements for those who receive them. It helps us see how his “populism” excludes tens of millions of Americans, and why he seems more interested in narrow enthusiasm versus broad popularity. And it gives a sense of what might follow in a Trump administration: not just demonization of disfavored minorities but possible attempts to expand the welfare state for the “deserving,” defined by race—a kind of welfare chauvinism. As he did during the campaign, Trump may adopt slogans and ideas from the left and right, not because he’s really a conservative or really a liberal, but because white nationalism exists outside the familiar divide. It confounds the left-right spectrum as we understand it in the United States. Trumpish policy won’t fall neatly into our old categories of liberal and conservative. Instead, it will turn on the question of what strengthens this basic notion that ours is a white nation.

Democrats, liberals, leftists, and dissident conservatives can dissent and resist, but the only party with the power to challenge Trump and win is the Republican Party, which controls Congress and may soon (again) have a majority on the Supreme Court. But the GOP is too complacent and complicit in the rise of Trump, too willing in its past and present to tolerate or even encourage appeals to white racial tribalism and ethno-nationalism. Indeed, in some regards, Trump is the logical conclusion of a process that began when Barry Goldwater opened his arms to Southern segregationists in his crusade for “liberty.” Besides, Republican leaders like Paul Ryan have embraced Trump as a vehicle for their conservative ideological agenda, content to back the president’s agenda for racial exclusion as long as he cuts health care, cuts taxes, and delivers the federal judiciary.

Defenders of pluralism have a tremendous struggle ahead of them. But as they mobilize and defend, they must understand the stakes. This is a fight to protect our multiracial democracy. It’s the latest in an old fight, one that goes back to our Reconstruction, when freedmen, freemen, and their white allies tried to build true democracy in the former Confederacy. They lost that battle, beat back by reaction, by “redeemers.” A century later, with the civil rights movement, we thought we had won the war. Not quite.

“There is beauty in art, in literature, in science, and in every triumph of intelligence, all of which I covet for my country,” said Charles Sumner in his appeal for a national civil rights bill in the fall of 1871. “But there is a higher beauty still—in relieving the poor, in elevating the downtrodden, and being a succor to the oppressed. There is true grandeur in an example of justice, making the rights of all the same as our own, and beating down prejudice, like Satan, under our feet.” He continued: “Humbly do I pray that the republic may not lose this great prize, or postpone its enjoyment.”

We seem to have entered a time where, by choice, we have postponed the enjoyment of that higher beauty. Let us pray, like Sumner, that we do not lose the prize altogether.President Donald Trump’s rambling, off-the-cuff news conference on Thursday focused a lot on attacking the media, but it especially focused on attacking CNN, which Trump said was full of “anger and hatred” and “fake news” — largely because the cable news network had reported on Trump’s bizarre ties to Russia.

Shepard Smith, an anchor at rival media organization Fox News, was not having it. In a brief message to the president, Smith blasted Trump for his treatment of the media and specifically CNN reporters:

It’s crazy what we’re watching every day. It’s absolutely crazy. He keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we’re some kind of fools for asking the question. Really? Your opposition was hacked, and the Russians were responsible for it, and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening, and we’re fools for asking the questions? No, sir. We’re not fools for asking these questions. And we demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the American people. Your supporters will support you either way. If your people were on the phone with her, what were they saying? We have a right to know. We absolutely do. And that you call us “fake news” and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential. The people deserve that answer at very least.

For Trump, this moment has to sting a bit. Although he has criticized CNN, he has said that Fox News is friendly and “very nice” to him. For a Fox News anchor to go out of his way to slam Trump’s reactions to basic questions, then, might carry more weight for the president.

Watch: How should the media cover a White House that isn’t afraid to lie?Democrats don’t have the votes to stop Scott Pruitt’s confirmation, but they signaled at his hearing Wednesday that they will seek to damage him politically as much as possible.

Pruitt was hammered for his record as Oklahoma’s attorney general, including his fundraising from fossil fuel companies and lawsuits against the agency he now looks to lead.

Republicans only need 50 votes to confirm him, and there have been no signs of GOP defections.

Here are five takeaways from his confirmation hearing.

Pruitt says climate change is not a hoax

Pruitt’s hearing took place the same day news reports said that 2016, as expected, was the hottest year on record.

It was more evidence of the danger of climate change for Democrats on the panel.

Pruitt broke with Trump, who has said that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese to hobble United States manufacturing.

“I do not believe climate change is a hoax,” Pruitt told Sen.

At the same time, Pruitt suggested it is unclear to what degree humans are affecting the climate.

Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersAT&T, Time Warner defend deal Top union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race Overnight Finance: Meet Trump's new Labor pick | Consumer bureau gets new day in court | Senate confirms Trump budget chief MORE (I-Vt.) repeatedly pushed Pruitt to endorse the scientific consensus that humans are the main contributor to climate change, via greenhouse gases.

Pruitt refused, instead calling for “more debate” on the subject.

His position aligns with many Republicans and Trump nominees. It makes it harder to label Pruitt a “denier,” while leaving significant room for him to resist regulating greenhouse gas emissions.

Pruitt said the EPA has an “obligation” to regulate carbon dioxide under a 2007 Supreme Court decision and the EPA’s “endangerment finding,” a 2009 decision establishing carbon emissions as a threat to public health.

But Trump has said he would reconsider the endangerment finding, and Pruitt himself joined a failed lawsuit in 2012 to undo it.

“The endangerment finding is there and needs to be enforced and respected,” he said. “There is nothing I know that would cause a review of it.”

Pruitt wants to give power to the states

The phrase of the day was “cooperative federalism,” Pruitt’s preference for a regulatory scheme in which the EPA and states share the burden of executing air and water laws.

“Cooperative federalism is at the heart of many environmental statutes passed by this body,” Pruitt said. “The reason for that is it’s the states that have the resources, the expertise and the understanding of the unique challenges facing the environment.”

The proposal is a welcome one for Republicans, who have long said that the EPA, under Obama, is a heavy-handed agency that has reached beyond the power granted to it under the law.

Democrats argue federal regulations protect states from pollution that they shouldn’t be blamed for, such as emissions that drift across state lines or water pollution that flows along the nation’s rivers.

“That’s not what I’m advocating,” he said. “We need a partnership, a true partnership, between the EPA in performing its role and the states performing theirs.”

Dems are linking Pruit to the oil industry

Democrats pressured Pruitt on the donations he’s taken from the oil industry, suggesting it had too much influence over his work in Oklahoma.

“That was a step that I was taking as attorney general representing the interests of our state,” he said. “That was an effort to protect the state’s interest in making the voice of all Oklahomans heard on a very important issue for our state.”

Merkley responded: “How can you present that as representing the people of Oklahoma when you only consulted with an oil company?”

GOP looks to reshape the EPA

Republican members of the committee indicated they expect Pruitt to overhaul the EPA, an agency they have long targeted as too broad.

Throughout the hearing, they parsed his answers to reveal a nominee who, like them, oppose many of the rules issued by the EPA under Obama.

While Democrats slammed him for suing the agency more than a dozen times as attorney general, Republicans worked to cast those lawsuits as a counterweight to federal overreach, and Pruitt was receptive to their framing.

“The country is divided on a lot of the issues in and around involving what you’re endeavoring to headline here at the EPA,” she said. “Those are the faces of the issues that I try to address.”China, for the past few years, has been asserting ever greater control over faraway waters that were previously considered international or were claimed by other countries. For example, it has seized small land formations or reefs, sometimes dredging up underwater sediment to make the islands large enough to support small military installations.

China’s naval forces have also grown more aggressive in patrolling these claims and chasing off non-Chinese ships. That is part of why its neighbors see this as an effort by China to dominate the region.

This is also about whether China will comply with international laws and norms, which Beijing sometimes views as a plot to constrain the country’s rise.

The United States has gotten involved, sending the Navy to patrol waters it insists are international and backing international mediation efforts. Washington says it wants to maintain free movement and rule by international law. The risk of outright conflict is extremely low, but the militarization of these heavily trafficked and heavily fished waters is still dangerous.

2. What does this week’s ruling mean?

The tribunal ruled almost categorically in favor of the Philippines, which had challenged some of China’s territorial claims. It also said China had broken international law by endangering Philippine ships and damaging the marine environment.

Maybe most important, the tribunal largely rejected the nine-dash line that China has used to indicate its South China Sea claims. This could open the way for other Asian states to challenge China’s claims.

So the letter of international law seems to say that China could be compelled to abandon many of its South China Sea claims.

But while the ruling is considered binding, there is no enforcement mechanism. China boycotted the proceedings, saying that the tribunal had no jurisdiction and that it would ignore any decision — a position it reiterated after the ruling came out.

Still, China is facing international pressure. Whether China chooses to defy or comply with that pressure, though, could help to shape its place in the international community.

3. What is the ‘nine-dash line’?

This little line has shown up on official Chinese maps since the 1940s (it began with 11 dashes). It demarcates a vast but vague stretch of ocean from China’s southern coast through most of the South China Sea.

China has never clarified the line’s exact coordinates. But it sweeps across waters — and some small islands — that are claimed by five other nations. It seems to go many miles beyond what is allowed under the United Nations treaty on maritime territorial issues, which China signed.

These are the areas where China has been building islands, installing runways and running patrols.

For China, the line represents long-lost historical claims that the country, after two centuries of weakness, is finally strong enough to recover. For the other nations, the line is a symbol of what they characterize as a naked power grab by China.

4. Why is the South China Sea so important?

The United States Energy Information Agency estimates there are 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in deposits under the sea — more than exists in the reserves of some of the world’s biggest energy exporters.

The waters also contain lucrative fisheries that account for, according to some estimates, 10 percent of the global total. But this means that a lot of fishing boats are cruising around in waters contested by several different navies, increasing the risk of conflict.

The area’s greatest value is as a trade route. According to a 2015 Department of Defense report, $5.3 trillion worth of goods moves through the sea every year, which is about 30 percent of global maritime trade. That includes huge amounts of oil and $1.2 trillion worth of annual trade with the United States.

5. Why does it matter who controls those trade routes?

This gets to a core contradiction in the South China Sea dispute: It is driven by territorial competition, yet all countries involved want open sea routes. Everyone benefits from the free flow of goods between Asia and the rest of the world, and everyone suffers if that is disrupted.

This is part of why the United States stresses freedom of movement in international waters. While it is very unlikely that China would ever want to close off trade, the United States would still rather not allow Beijing even the ability to hold the global economy hostage.

But, from China’s perspective, the United States itself has that ability, because of American naval dominance; the Chinese also suspect that the global status quo is engineered to serve Western interests first. So it is hardly surprising that China is seeking greater control over waterways it relies on for economic survival.

This is a dynamic that has permeated Sino-American relations throughout China’s rise over the past two decades. In theory, both nations understand they are better off cooperating. But in practice, they often treat each other as competitors or potential threats — a cycle that is difficult to break.

6. So this is about China’s rise?

In some ways, yes.

China sees itself as a growing power that has a right to further its interests in its own backyard, just as Western powers have done for centuries. Beijing considers the South China Sea an area of traditional Chinese influence, and sees its control as a way to assert greater power over the region.

Something Americans often miss is that for China, this is in part defensive. The history of Western imperialism looms large. Chinese leaders often distrust the United States’ intentions, and consider their country to be the far weaker party. Extending Chinese control is a way to stave off perceived threats.

This insecurity also contributes to Chinese skepticism of international institutions such as the South China Sea tribunal, which Chinese state media portray as a plot to weaken China.

7. Why is the United States so involved in this?

The United States has a treaty obligation to the Philippines, an ally. As the world’s largest economy, it also has a real interest in maintaining open sea lanes — and, as the world’s biggest naval power, it often assumes the role of policing them. Plus, as the world’s only superpower, the United States often acts as a balancer in regional disputes.

But this is also, for Washington, about shaping what sort of major power China becomes.

American officials insist that they do not oppose China’s rise. Their concern is whether China will work within what scholars call the liberal order — the postwar system of international laws and institutions — or seek to overturn it.

The South China Sea, and particularly this week’s ruling, are a test case for whether China becomes the kind of power that works within that system, or against it.

While that order has helped promote peace and prosperity globally, it also undeniably serves American interests.

Everyone agrees that the status quo in Asia and eventually the world will evolve to accommodate China’s emergence as a major international power. The South China Sea is very important in its own right, but it is maybe most important in helping to determine what sort of role China plays in the world.On Thursday morning, Americans woke up to the news that their president had gratuitously insulted the prime minister of Australia and maybe threatened to invade Mexico.

In a call with Australian leader Malcolm Turnbull, Trump reportedly bragged about his election victory and railed against a deal the Obama administration had struck with the Australian government to take in a small number of refugees currently trying to enter Australia. According to a Washington Post piece published on Wednesday night, Trump then told Turnbull “this was the worst call by far” he’d had with a foreign leader so far, before abruptly cutting the call short.

Related The Australian refugee deal that has Donald Trump so angry, explained

What happened on the call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is less clear. On Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported that Trump had threatened to send US troops into Mexico to deal with the “bad hombres” on the border if Peña Nieto didn’t get the situation under control. Both the White House and the Mexican government subsequently denied that, and later reporting by CNN backed them up, suggesting Trump had merely offered US military assistance to the Mexican military in dealing with “tough hombres.”

Either way, it’s clear Trump used awkward pidgin Spanish in his call with Mexico’s leader.

There’s part of this that’s kind of funny. In both calls, the Post reports, Trump used precious diplomatic time to brag about the size of his crowds on Inauguration Day, which is just a ridiculous thing to do on a diplomatic call with a foreign leader. And of course, the calls aren’t likely, in and of themselves, to destroy America’s relationship with either Australia or Mexico.

But there’s also part of this that’s really, really scary. It shows that Trump is so temperamental and thin-skinned that it’s hard to know when he’ll fly off the rails, even when speaking to a longstanding American ally like Australia or an important neighbor like Mexico.

“None of this is normal,” Dan Nexon, a professor at Georgetown University who studies American grand strategy, says. “It’s not just that the president is apparently acting like a petulant bully with these people. It’s also that it’s for no obvious policy purpose.”

This kind of behavior generates a deep uncertainty on the part of other countries about whether they can trust America — and trust in America is the foundation on which much of the current world order is structured. If Trump continues to behave this erratically, the consequences could be, well, unpredictable — and that’s scary.

Trump’s Australia call would be hilarious if it weren’t so serious

The issue that appears to have set Trump off on his call with the Australian prime minister is a prior US commitment to take in 1,250 refugees currently housed in offshore detention centers near Australia. The conditions on these island detention centers, as my colleague Dara Lind explains, are horrific, so the Obama administration agreed to take in a relatively small number of refugees on basically humanitarian grounds.

Trump, in his call with Turnbull, called this arrangement “the worst deal ever,” and said he was “going to get killed” for abiding by it. He refused to commit unequivocally to accepting the refugees, merely saying it was “my intention” to abide by the deal Obama struck. Later, he tweeted angrily about it (a tweet that suggests, incidentally, that he only just learned about this agreement during his call with Turnbull):

Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017

There are a few things to note about this. The first, and perhaps clearest, is that this is a truly bizarre way to treat a vital ally.

Australia has fought alongside the US in nearly every major war in the past 100 years, including ones like Iraq and Vietnam that many other US allies were (rightly) hesitant to support. It’s a hugely important partner in the current coalition fight against ISIS — with several hundred on the ground in the Middle East contributing to the counter-ISIS campaign.

Australia is also a member, along with the US, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, of the so-called Five Eyes alliance, a close-knit intelligence-sharing arrangement. And Australia plays a critical role in America’s contingency plans in the event of war against China, serving as a Pacific base that’s outside the range of China’s dangerous land-based missiles.

Which means that angering the Australians isn’t just rude; it jeopardizes vital US national security interests — especially at a time when Trump’s rhetoric toward China is getting more aggressive and his administration is planning to step up the war on ISIS.

“I could not have imagined Donald Trump crapping on Australia,” Steve Saideman, a political scientist at Ottawa’s Carleton University, says. “Australia, in most ways, could be considered one of the very, very closest of allies.”

The second thing to note is that the import of the call isn’t just limited to Australia. Generally, presidents follow through on promises made by their predecessors. Without this principle, countries have no way of knowing whether they can make durable bargains with the United States.

Trump is blithely calling this into question. Even if he ends up following through on his end of the bargain, publicly questioning it undermines other countries’ faith in the deals they made with past administrations. Countries that thought they could depend on the United States on issues ranging from security to trade might start thinking about the need to look to other partners — like, say, China.

“There’s an old kind of cliché that countries look for signals about what a president will do based on ... early signaling,” Nexon says. “It’s not like you can’t overcome that stuff. But I would think that if you’re an American ally looking at this kind of behavior, contrasting it with reports about [Trump’s] conversations with Putin, you would be wondering how much you can trust the United States.”

Finally, this incident shows how thoroughly Trump’s concerns about immigration and Islam dominate his overall foreign policy thinking.

Many of the refugees in the Australia deal come from the countries covered in Trump’s recent “Muslim ban” — Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia. And, of course, that same policy bans all refugee entry for 120 days. According to the Post, Trump actually accused Turnbull of trying to export the “next Boston bombers” to the United States.

Trump’s deep commitment to excluding these people seems to have taken precedence over the need to maintain good relations with a vital American ally.

“The refugees coming from Australia are brown,” Saideman says bluntly. “There’s this racism undercurrent to all of this that probably should not be denied.”

Sure, let’s maybe send US troops to Mexico, why not

Normally, calls between a new president and a foreign leader are pro forma kinds of things. You say hi, exchange a few pleasantries, reaffirm the need for close cooperation on issues of mutual concern, and then hang up the phone.

You don’t start mouthing off about “hombres” with the Mexican president, and suggesting that US troops will soon enter Mexico (either with or without Mexico’s consent, depending on whose reporting you believe). But this awkward conversation with Peña Nieto is looking less like a one-off and more like a pattern with Trump.

Think back to the days shortly after Trump’s win. At the time, Trump was receiving calls from leaders around the world who were calling to congratulate him and talk about his plans for relations with their countries. We didn’t get a lot of details on those calls, but the details we did were super weird.

His call with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is the clearest example. According to this readout provided by the Pakistani government, which sounded a hell of a lot like a verbatim transcript of the president’s remarks, Trump assured Sharif that “Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people”:

Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called President-elect USA Donald Trump and felicitated him on his victory. President Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems. It will be an honor and I will personally do it. Feel free to call me any time even before 20th January that is before I assume my office. On being invited to visit Pakistan by the Prime Minister, Mr. Trump said that he would love to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people, said Mr. Donald Trump.

This implies, of course, that there are some nations that Trump considers among the least intelligent. This kind of vaguely racialist rhetoric almost directly mirrors the weird “hombres” comment that we saw in the Peña Nieto call.

This is why the initial AP report that seemed to suggest Trump had threatened to invade Mexico was seen as plausible rather than almost certainly a mistake (that, and his longstanding hostility toward America’s southern neighbor).

Trump has a long pattern of continuing to say weird, ad hoc stuff that is awkward and potentially dangerous. His professional staff is either uninterested in making Trump into a more normal president or they’re unable to. Whichever one it is, it illustrates that the way that US foreign policy is being formulated so far has a lot more to do with Trump’s personal impulses than with any sort of adherence to America’s traditional diplomatic stances.

“[This administration] is a kind of barely controlled chaos from a policy perspective,” Nexon says.

The terrifying uncertainty of Donald Trump

The common thread between the Australia and Mexico calls, above all else, is uncertainty. Trump acts in such a strange way, so alien from the way American diplomacy has been conducted for basically its entire history, that foreign leaders simply don’t know what to expect from the United States anymore.

“I have taken to calling Trump an uncertainty engine,” Saideman says. “And that is really bad.”

Broadly speaking, US foreign policy for the past 70 years has depended on consistency. America has made formal alliances, most notably NATO, that work because US allies have faith that the United States will come to their aid if attacked. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, underwriting the global financial system, because nations the world over have faith in American stability. Dozens of countries count on America to keep the peace globally and keep trade routes open, so they mostly go about their own business.

Under Trump, though, it’s just not clear whether the United States will remain committed to this core approach to the world. The president is so temperamental, so willing to threaten to renege on past agreements if he doesn’t see an upside in them, that trust in America’s traditional commitments is fraying. The starkest examples of this are Trump’s threats to back out of defending Baltic NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia and to leave the World Trade Organization if he thinks trade deals aren’t getting any better for the US.

But this may not be an accident. Indeed, Trump seems to see unpredictability as a strategic virtue.

“We must as a nation be more unpredictable,” Trump said in a summer 2016 speech to the Center for the National Interest. “We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.”

These strange, angry phone calls with foreign leaders might not be quite as disturbing if they happened in isolation. But given this background, they give American allies the world over more evidence that they need to be thinking about a world outside the American-led global order.

It’s impossible to predict what this means in practice. But foreign policy experts have floated scary hypotheticals ranging from US allies cozying up with China to Japan developing nuclear weapons. (During the campaign, Trump seemed to actually encourage the latter.) If you can’t trust America to provide for your security, the thinking goes, you might just have to do it yourself.

None of this will likely happen immediately, and it’s not inevitable. The Trump administration has time to reverse the perception of instability it has created, and to firm up its commitment to the normal international order. But there’s no guarantee Trump is actually going to do that — and these calls are a sign that he may not. The consequences could potentially be catastrophic.

“The United States has been the bedrock for the international order that provided peace and prosperity, with some bumps along the way, for 70-plus years,” Saideman says. “And now that bedrock has become liquefied, as though there was an earthquake. And the international order is resting on ... on what?”Right after Donald Trump won the election, a number of observers worried that having a climate denier in the White House would be a crushing setback for efforts to tackle global warming. Here’s a sample hyperventilating headline from, uh, me: “There’s no way around it: Donald Trump looks like a disaster for the planet.”

Since then, though, there’s been a bunch of optimistic reappraisals suggesting that perhaps not all is lost (see here, here, here, or here). The US, these optimists point out, is in the midst of an unstoppable clean-energy transition, with coal in decline and natural gas, wind, and solar on the rise. Power plant emissions are plummeting faster than anyone expected. States like California and New York are pursuing serious climate policies, as are countries like China. Even under Trump, this will all continue. Hence the hope. As Bloomberg put it, “Trump Can’t Stop the Energy Revolution.”

So who’s right — the pessimists or the optimists? Both make decent points. But it’s worth taking time to square the two views, to understand what’s really at stake in the Trump era.

On the one hand, yes, the greening of the US electric sector is fully underway, driven by forces that Trump is powerless to reverse. But what’s often overlooked is that electricity is just a fraction of the larger climate problem. To halt global warming, we’ll need sweeping changes in virtually every corner of the economy — and fast. And few states are really doing that right now. The federal government was the natural locus for a “deep decarbonization” push, but Trump and the GOP Congress plan to neuter many of the key tools here. That’s the disaster, especially with so little time left to avoid 2°C of warming.

Now, this doesn’t mean the planet is doomed, or that there are no options for pushing for further decarbonization in the years to come. But the first step in thinking about the road ahead for climate policy under Trump is understanding why federal action was so significant — and then figuring out what’s still possible if Trump rolls it back.

What the states are doing isn’t nearly enough for deep decarbonization

The case for optimism is understandable if you mainly focus on trends in the US electricity sector. In 2016, America’s power plants emitted 27 percent less carbon dioxide than they did in 2005. That’s genuinely impressive: President Obama’s much-hyped Clean Power Plan, which is still stalled in court, merely aimed for a 30 percent cut by 2030. We’re nearly there already.

This emissions decline has been driven in part by an influx of cheap natural gas from fracking that, when combined with Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency rules on pollution, has forced hundreds of coal plants into retirement. It’s also been driven by the stunning growth of wind and solar power, which have been bolstered by state renewable standards, federal tax credits, and steep cost reductions. States like Iowa, Texas, Maine, and Oklahoma now get at least 10 percent of their power from wind.

Trump probably can’t undo these trends even if he scraps the Clean Power Plan. His administration might try to weaken those EPA rules (though this isn’t easy), but he has no desire to halt the fracking boom (in fact, he wants to expand it), and Congress is unlikely to repeal those popular renewable tax credits. And most state renewable policies will remain in place, which means that wind and solar will keep chugging along.

That said, it’s awfully premature to call this state of affairs “good news for the planet,” as the New York Times recently did. Because it comes with two massive caveats:

1) Current electricity trends aren’t nearly sufficient for deep decarbonization. If the US wants to do its part to halt global warming, it’s not enough for electricity emissions to dip moderately. They have to go to zero — within a couple of decades. That’s a staggeringly arduous task, and we’re not really on track to do it.

Late last year, the White House put out a big report on deep decarbonization sketching out four different scenarios for a near-zero-CO2 power sector in 2050. The chart below shows what sorts of electric capacity we’d need to be adding between now and then to meet one such decarbonization scenario:

As the graph on the left shows, the US has mainly been building natural gas (in brown), wind (in blue), and solar (in yellow) capacity in recent years. That’s the current “energy revolution.” But that won’t suffice for deep decarbonization. As the graphs on the right show, annual natural gas additions need to decline, not continue. Wind and solar need to ramp up dramatically — not just maintain their course. On top of that, we’d likely need to start adding significant nuclear capacity as well as carbon capture for coal, gas, and biomass every single year through 2050. Right now we’re barely building any.

Only a handful of states are even beginning to grapple with this reality. Yes, California and New York both aim to get 50 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2030, (though neither has plans to expand nuclear or carbon capture, and California wants to shut down its last nuclear plant by 2025). But those two blue states, while important, account for less than 10 percent of the nation’s emissions.

Meanwhile, other large states, like Texas or Florida or Ohio, aren’t making any plans at all for similarly drastic reductions in electricity emissions. A large chunk of states in the South don’t even have renewable standards. That’s why federal action was such a big deal. Obama’s Clean Power Plan set initial weak targets, but it was conceivably something to build on through 2050, nudging states like Georgia or Louisiana toward the sort of decarbonization pathways that, say, New York is contemplating. Now Trump plans to dismantle that policy, leaving states to fumble (or not) on their own.

2) Electricity is only part of the decarbonization challenge anyway. What’s more, even if trends in the power sector look promising, electricity is only responsible for about 30 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions. The rest comes from a vast array of different sectors, including cars and trucks, industries like steel and cement, refineries, natural gas use for heating in buildings, methane from agriculture and landfills, and so on:

In most of these other sectors, the United States has made frustratingly little headway. Emissions from transportation have been rising since 2012, with electric vehicles still just 0.7 percent of the total fleet. Agriculture emissions haven’t budged for decades. Emissions from buildings and industry have been ticking upward of late.

To meet US climate goals, overall greenhouse gas emissions need to fall 80 percent or more by 2050. But apart from California, which is developing a comprehensive plan to tackle non-electric sectors, few states are really thinking about transportation or industry or agriculture. For the most part, that’s been the purview of the federal government, which under Obama has set stricter emissions standards for cars, trucks, household appliances, landfills, methane leaks from oil and gas, and so on. Now Trump plans to undo many of those rules — or at least refrain from strengthening them.

So that’s the climate landscape in the United States: decent progress on electricity emissions coupled with scant progress in most other sectors. Even if states keep doing what they’ve been doing under Trump, that won’t be nearly enough to slow global warming. Not even close.

Why federal policy was so important for decarbonization

President Obama’s climate policy, for all its shortcomings, was an attempt to speed up the sluggish progress on emissions described above — using any and all executive branch tools he could find. The Clean Power Plan would prod more states to focus on decarbonizing. And other EPA regulations would tackle the neglected non-electric sectors. Trump plans to scuttle that, and those features won’t be easy to replace.

Another key aspect of Obama’s climate strategy was ramping up R&D for new energy tech that could help us achieve deeper emissions cuts down the road. That included research for advanced solar, wind, and battery technology; loan guarantees for a carbon capture project in Texas and companies like Tesla; research into long-shot tech like advanced biofuels under ARPA-E; support for grid modernization; and more.

These early-stage projects take time to show results — if they ever do. Federal investments in hydraulic fracturing technology began in the 1970s and didn’t pay off until the mid-2000s. But the hope was that today’s R&D would eventually help provide vital new tools for the wrenching energy shifts we desperately need in the 2030s and beyond. Under Trump and the Republican Congress, many of those R&D programs are now endangered.

Then there’s the international stage. Stopping global warming obviously requires every nation to take action, not just the US. And here, the Obama administration has played a more proactive role than is often acknowledged. As David Victor, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego, told me, US bilateral talks with China were vital for framing the Paris climate deal and helping to get them comfortable with the accord. A breakthrough in talks between the US and India also helped pave the way for a landmark deal under the Montreal Protocol to phase out hydrofluorocarbons.

Trump, of course, has said he wants to abandon the Paris deal. While that won’t scuttle the treaty, and other countries will still pursue their own policies, the loss of the US involvement will be felt. The Obama administration, for instance, was a key advocate for a more robust review of individual country climate pledges. “That was a place where US leadership was important,” Victor says. “I’m not concerned that Trump will kill the Paris climate deal, but I am concerned that a lot of the practical momentum and important detailed procedural work could be severely harmed.”

To be clear, US climate policy was much too weak under Obama and likely would have been much too weak under Clinton (particularly so long as Congress refused to pass climate legislation). But both politicians at least envisioned a path toward lower emissions, pushing in the general direction of decarbonization. It’s no small thing that the US now has a president who wants to abandon or disable many of those tools.

So is there any hope for climate policy under Trump?

I mentioned in the beginning that Trump’s election doesn’t have to be the end of the world for climate policy, and I (mostly) do believe that. But a key starting point is to think seriously about what deep decarbonization entails — and not get too complacent about the encouraging electric-sector trends of the past eight years.

How to move forward on climate policy under Trump is obviously a huge topic, larger any one piece can tackle. But based on the above, here are a few ideas:

1) States need to think harder about decarbonization outside of electricity. The greening of the utility sector via renewables and natural gas is promising, but there’s a lot more to do. California passed a law last year, SB32, that will begin aggressively tackling emissions from sectors like industry, agriculture, and buildings. Other states concerned about climate change could follow suit. (New York’s recent efforts on electric vehicles are another possible model.) The same goes for cities, which can have a large impact on emissions through urban planning and infrastructure.

2) Preserving EPA authority over greenhouse gases for future presidents. The Trump administration is likely to start dismantling Obama’s federal climate policies, from the Clean Power Plan to methane rules, and that will be difficult to stop. Yet the EPA will still have legal authority over greenhouse gases — unless Congress amends the Clean Air Act to take this away. So long as that authority remains intact, future presidents could conceivably redouble efforts to cut emissions through federal initiatives. Democrats in the Senate could filibuster any attempts to amend this policy with 41 votes.

3) Protecting energy R&D programs. As the White House deep decarbonization report notes, driving sharp reductions in emissions past 2030 will almost certainly require new tools and technologies that are still unproven, from batteries to carbon capture. Current R&D programs, particularly out of the Department of Energy, are likely to play a key role in bringing some of this tech forward. While Trump’s views on energy R&D are still a bit murky, the House GOP has long signaled that it would like to slash programs like DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Over the long term, the fate of these programs could be far more significant to climate policy than, say, individual appliance efficiency regulations. (Private sector funding for energy R&D, à la Bill Gates’s new initiative, could also prove worthwhile.)

4) Working with the GOP on energy programs that could pay off later. The current Republican Party is overwhelmingly hostile toward efforts to fight global warming. Most don’t even think it’s real (it is). But there are nuances here and there. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has been working with key Republican senators like Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and even Jim Inhofe (R-OK) on policies to facilitate the development of a new generation of (hopefully) safer, cheaper, low-carbon nuclear reactors. Similarly, at least some Republicans seem interested in carbon capture technology. This stuff seems small-bore, but it could reap benefits down the road.

This list barely scratches the surface of how climate policy can survive or evolve under Trump. Environmental activists will likely continue fighting for coal plant closures or blocking fossil-fuel infrastructure. Plus, there’s always the prospect of unforeseen policy surprises over the next four years: Some of the most important climate tools of the Obama era, such as EPA authority over greenhouse gases and CAFE standards, were put in place during the Bush era. Perhaps the Trump era has similar plot twists in store.

Finally, there’s the big picture to consider. A Trump administration may be able to delay US and global climate action long enough to put the world on pace to blow past the much-feared 2°C global warming threshold. (Our margin for error for avoiding 2°C was already razor-thin.) But even if that happens, there’s still ample reason to try to decarbonize to avoid 2.5°C or 3°C or whatever level is attainable. That’s still one of the biggest long-term policy challenges of the 21st century — and will be long after Trump is gone.

Watch: A history of inaction on climate changeNational security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”

On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

Flynn’s contacts with the ambassador attracted attention within the Obama administration because of the timing. U.S. intelligence agencies were then concluding that Russia had waged a cyber campaign designed in part to help elect Trump; his senior adviser on national security matters was discussing the potential consequences for Moscow, officials said.

[FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit]

The talks were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said. In a recent interview, Kislyak confirmed that he had communicated with Flynn by text message, by phone and in person, but declined to say whether they had discussed sanctions.

The emerging details contradict public statements by incoming senior administration officials including Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. They acknowledged only a handful of text messages and calls exchanged between Flynn and Kislyak late last year and denied that either ever raised the subject of sanctions.

“They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence said in an interview with CBS News last month, noting that he had spoken with Flynn about the matter. Pence also made a more sweeping assertion, saying there had been no contact between members of Trump’s team and Russia during the campaign. To suggest otherwise, he said, “is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”

Neither of those assertions is consistent with the fuller account of Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak provided by officials who had access to reports from U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies that routinely monitor the communications of Russian diplomats. Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.

“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.

A third official put it more bluntly, saying that either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke. An administration official stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn. The sanctions in question have so far remained in place.

The nature of Flynn’s pre-inauguration message to Kislyak triggered debate among officials in the Obama administration and intelligence agencies over whether Flynn had violated a law against unauthorized citizens interfering in U.S. disputes with foreign governments, according to officials familiar with that debate. Those officials were already alarmed by what they saw as a Russian assault on the U.S. election.

U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.

Officials also cited political sensitivities. Prominent Americans in and out of government are so frequently in communication with foreign officials that singling out one individual — particularly one poised for a top White House job — would invite charges of political persecution.

Former U.S. officials also said aggressive enforcement would probably discourage appropriate contact. Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that he was in Moscow meeting with officials in the weeks leading up to Obama’s 2008 election win.

“As a former diplomat and U.S. government official, one needs to be able to have contact with foreigners to do one’s job,” McFaul said. McFaul, a Russia scholar, said he was careful never to signal pending policy changes before Obama took office.

On Wednesday, Flynn said that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. Kislyak helped coordinate that trip, Flynn said.

Flynn said that he spoke to Kislyak on a range of subjects in late December, including arranging a call between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Trump after the inauguration and expressing his condolences after Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated. “I called to say I couldn’t believe the murder of their ambassador,” Flynn said. Asked whether there was any mention of sanctions in his communications with Kislyak, Flynn said, “No.”

Kislyak characterized his conversations with Flynn as benign during a brief interview at a conference this month. “It’s something all diplomats do,” he said.

Kislyak said that he had been in contact with Flynn since before the election, but declined to answer questions about the subjects they discussed. Kislyak is known for his assiduous cultivation of high-level officials in Washington and was seated in the front row of then-GOP candidate Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April of last year. The ambassador would not discuss the origin of his relationship with Flynn.

In his CBS interview, Pence said that Flynn had “been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That’s exactly what the incoming national security adviser should do.”

Official concern about Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak was heightened when Putin declared on Dec. 30 that Moscow would not retaliate after the Obama administration announced a day earlier the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and the forced closure of Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York.

Instead, Putin said he would focus on “the restoration of ­Russia-United States relations” after Obama left office, and put off considering any retaliatory measures until Moscow had a chance to evaluate Trump’s policies.

Trump responded with effusive praise for Putin. “Great move on the delay,” he said in a posting to his Twitter account. “I always knew he was very smart.”

Putin’s reaction cut against a long practice of reciprocation on diplomatic expulsions, and came after his foreign minister had vowed that there would be reprisals against the United States.

Putin’s muted response — which took White House officials by surprise — raised some officials’ suspicions that Moscow may have been promised a reprieve, and triggered a search by U.S. spy agencies for clues.

“Something happened in those 24 hours” between Obama’s announcement and Putin’s response, a former senior U.S. official said. Officials began poring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications and diplomatic cables, and saw evidence that Flynn and Kislyak had communicated by text and telephone around the time of the announcement.

Trump transition officials acknowledged those contacts weeks later after they were reported in The Washington Post but denied that sanctions were discussed. Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said Jan. 13 that Flynn had “reached out to” the Russian ambassador on Christmas Day to extend holiday greetings. On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

Other officials were categorical. “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever,” a senior transition official told The Post at the time. When Pence faced questions on television that weekend, he said “those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.”

Current and former U.S. officials said that assertion was not true.

Like Trump, Flynn has shown an affinity for Russia that is at odds with the views of most of his military and intelligence peers. Flynn raised eyebrows in 2015 when he appeared in photographs seated next to Putin at a lavish party in Moscow for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network.

In an earlier interview with The Post, Flynn acknowledged that he had been paid through his speakers bureau to give a speech at the event and defended his attendance by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels, including CNN.

[Trump adviser Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and why Russia Today is just like CNN]

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn served multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — tours in which he held a series of high-level intelligence assignments working with U.S. Special Operations forces hunting al-Qaeda operatives and Islamist militants.

Former colleagues said that narrow focus led Flynn to see the threat posed by Islamist groups as overwhelming other security concerns, including Russia’s renewed aggression. Instead, Flynn came to see America’s long-standing adversary as a potential ally against terrorist groups, and himself as being in a unique position to forge closer ties after traveling to Moscow in 2013 while serving as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Flynn has frequently boasted that he was the first DIA director to be invited into the headquarters of Russia’s military intelligence directorate, known as the GRU, although at least one of his predecessors was granted similar access. “Flynn thought he developed some rapport with the GRU chief,” a former senior U.S. military official said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say they have tied the GRU to Russia’s theft of troves of email messages from Democratic Party computer networks and accuse Moscow of then delivering those materials to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published them in phases during the campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival.

Flynn was pushed out of the DIA job in 2014 amid concerns about his management of the sprawling agency. He became a fierce critic of the Obama administration before joining the Trump campaign last year.

Trump and Putin: A relationship where mutual admiration is headed toward reality

Trump’s national security adviser shared secrets without permission, files showI plan to write a great deal about the short-term prospects for clean energy, both economic and political, but I want to begin life here at Vox with an imaginative exercise, a bit of musing about what energy might look like in the future — not 10 or 20 years from now, but 50, 70, even 100 years ahead.

Obviously, predicting the far future is a mug's game if you take it too seriously. This post is more about storytelling, a way of seeing the present through a different lens, than pure prognostication. But storytelling is important. And insofar as one can feel confident about far-future predictions, I feel pretty good about this one.

Here it is: solar photovoltaic (PV) power is eventually going to dominate global energy. The question is not if, but when. Maybe it will happen radically faster than anyone expects — say, by 2050. Or maybe it won't be until the year 3000, or later. But it'll happen.

The main reason is pretty simple: solar PV is different from every other source of electricity, in ways that make it uniquely well-suited to 21st-century needs. (Among those needs I count abundance, resilience, and sustainability.)

Solar PV is different from other electricity sources — in one crucial way

Every other commercial source of electricity — besides solar PV — generates energy through roughly the same means: by spinning a turbine.

Coal plants, gas plants, nuclear plants, and concentrated solar power plants are all just different ways of boiling water to produce steam that spins a turbine. Wind power harnesses the wind to spin a turbine. Hydropower dams use flowing water to crank a turbine. These spinning turbines, in turn, provide mechanical force to an electric generator, which translates it into electrical current (this is done by moving electrical conductors through magnetic fields — see Faraday's Law).

Solar PV works differently: it converts sunlight directly into electricity. Photons of light excite the surface of a semiconductor, knocking electrons loose to become part of a charged electrical field, generating electromotive force that can be tapped by wires. (See: the photovoltaic effect.)

This difference sounds technical, but it is enormously consequential. It brings three obvious advantages, often touted by solar proponents.

First, a solar cell has no moving parts, so operation and maintenance costs tend to be very low. It has to be kept clean, but that's about it.

Second, a solar cell requires no fuel — so fuel costs are zero. Once the initial investment is paid off, and subtracting modest O&M costs, the power produced is free.

And third, a solar cell generates power without any pollution.

(Note: the manufacture and disposal of solar cells currently requires fuel and produces waste, so the above claims require a rather large footnote. But there's no reason in principle that solar PV cannot eventually be made using solar energy and composed entirely of recyclable or nontoxic components.)

Solar is the only truly distributed electricity source

Solar PV's unique way of generating power has another important consequence: it can be highly distributed. Many utilities currently rely on big solar — constructing fields of panels miles long — but solar can also scale down to feet, even inches. Anywhere sun hits, some of it can be harvested for energy.

But not much energy. Indeed, skeptics of solar power often cite this feature as a weakness of PV technology. Even though there's enough cumulative sunlight to power human civilization thousands of times over, they note, it is still highly diffuse. The amount of energy in any given patch of sunlight is modest. So to gather the large amounts of energy necessary to run industrial civilization, solar cells would have to cover an enormous amount of surface area.

To understand solar's true potential, we have to project out past current technology

Solar skeptics are convinced that this puts an upper limit on solar's contribution. They believe civilization will always require concentrated fuels of some sort, simply because energy consumption is concentrated. They believe there's no way to gather enough diffuse renewable resources to power factories, hospitals, and other mainstays of Western life, which means the future of energy will either entail fossil fuels or nuclear power, both of which are energy-dense.

I think that's a mistake. In fact, being a passive harvester of diffuse energy will work to solar's advantage, not its disadvantage, in the long run.

To understand why, we have to project out past the limitations of today's solar PV technology. Current silicon panels — the ones that have been plunging in price thanks to China's largesse — are still relatively bulky and heavy. Their manufacture and disposal involves toxic chemicals. And the efficiency with which they convert sunlight to energy is low, around 10 to 15 percent.

But these limitations are not inherent to PV. Researchers are already experimenting with new, less-toxic materials. There are mass-produced panels hitting 20 percent efficiency. In lab conditions, solar cells have reached as high as 46 percent efficiency, more than three times today's average:

Most current solar cells come embedded in big black panels, but as they get smaller, they are starting to be integrated into other things — everything from buildings and roofs to roads, bus stops, and backpacks.

How solar power could become a dominant energy source

So let's try to think beyond the limitations of today's PV to a possible future — after another, say, 20 or 30 years of intense research, development, and deployment.

Imagine small, modular, highly efficient solar cells embedded in all newly built infrastructure as a matter of course — buildings, bridges, parking lots, vehicles. Solar PV would no longer be a category of product in itself, but a routine feature of other products. As energy storage also gets cheaper, smaller, and better integrated, it will be worthwhile to capture and discharge small amounts of energy continuously.

In the future we may expect all our devices to be connected to a distributed energy net

The transfer of energy could become more distributed, as well, to better take advantage of all this solar power. For example, it will soon be possible for ordinary consumers to charge their electric vehicles without wires, just by parking in the right spot. According to a recent report by Navigant Research, "It is now clear that several major automakers are planning to bring wireless systems to market within the next few years, and a significant portion of the industry believes that wireless technology represents the future of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging."

After a few decades of development, presumably wireless charging will get more efficient and smaller, as well. Imagine urban infrastructure in which wireless charging is everywhere — in curbs, benches, and buses — in which all electric devices are always being charged with sunlight that's always being collected and stored. Energy distribution could effectively become ambient.

Just as we expect all our devices to be connected to the internet today, uploading and downloading information, in the future we may expect all our devices and structures to be connected to this distributed energy net, harvesting, storing, and sharing the sun's power.

A future with distributed energy could look radically different from today

One often hears energy experts talk about "distributed energy," but insofar as that refers to electricity, it usually just means smaller gas or wind turbines scattered about — except in the case of solar PV. Only solar PV has the potential to eventually diffuse into infrastructure, to become a pervasive and unremarkable feature of the built environment.

That will make for a far, far more resilient energy system than today's grid, which can be brought down by cascading failures emanating from a single point of vulnerability, a single line or substation. An intelligent grid in which everyone is always producing, consuming, and sharing energy at once cannot be crippled by the failure of one or a small group of nodes or lines. It simply routes around them.

Will solar PV provide enough energy? Right now, you couldn't power a city like New York fully on solar PV even if you covered every square inch of it with panels. The question is whether that will still be true in 30 or 50 years. What efficiencies and innovations might be unlocked when solar cells and energy storage become more efficient and ubiquitous? When the entire city is harvesting and sharing energy? When today's centralized, hub-and-spoke electricity grid has evolved into a self-healing, many-to-many energy web? When energy works like a real market, built on millions of real-time microtransactions among energy peers, rather than the crude statist model of today's utilities?

Systems that use energy will co-evolve alongside this new model of energy production, storage, and sharing. They will be smarter and more efficient, not only in the incremental ways current technologies are becoming more efficient, but in stepwise, nonlinear ways, replacing whole systems rather than parts.

My optimistic view is that global energy demand will peak and start declining later this century, even as supply from ubiquitous solar PV and storage is rising. Eventually they'll meet in the middle, relegating other energy sources to the periphery, as backup.

This solar future is inevitable — the key question is how long it will take

This is all sci-fi for now, I realize, about changes that will certainly take many decades to unfold. But the changes follow inexorably from the logic of PV. As research, development, and deployment continue, as solar PV and storage become more integrated and omnipresent, they will fill the cracks left empty by a flawed and unjust global energy system. And from there, they will seep up and out, displacing dirty combustion, creating new models and energy services along the way.

It will be a long, fraught process. Any number of things could make a mockery of my prediction. Nuclear fusion or (just as likely) Tony Stark's arc reactor could render the conversation moot. A meteor could hit. Humanity could decide to abandon Earth for other planets. Whatever.

But if energy keeps evolving roughly along the paths that are visible now, the unique properties of solar PV will eventually propel it to dominance. We will find that in energy, as in so many other human systems, distributed power works better, to more people's advantage, than the concentrated kind.The Department of Homeland Security considered — but says it rejected — letting governors in 11 states decide whether to deputize their National Guards to enforce immigration law, including helping to detain and deport unauthorized immigrants.

The memo, first reported by the Associated Press Friday, matches the description of a memo leaked to Vox. The memo lays out several possible policies to help implement President Donald Trump’s executive order regarding border enforcement.

The White House strongly denied the report, calling it “100% not true.” A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security says the memo was a very early draft, and the idea for National Guard mobilization was “never seriously considered.”

A DHS official says memo was "a very early, pre decisional draft... and was never seriously considered by the Department" — Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) February 17, 2017

The memo described by the AP and the memo leaked to Vox were both dated January 25, 2017 — the same day that President Trump signed the executive order in question. That’s consistent with DHS’s statement that it’s an “early draft.”

DHS has not yet formalized its plan to implement the executive order for border enforcement. The memo reported by the AP and posted by Vox appears to still be under consideration in some form, but it’s not clear how substantially it’s been revised.

It’s uncertain whether the National Guard provision has survived in any form — including mobilizing National Guard units for border enforcement, as happened under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Nor is it clear whether any of the other policies considered in the draft memo will be implemented.

But the fact that it was floated at all is still significant. President Trump arrived in office on the promise of a sweeping crackdown on immigration enforcement, and proceeded to sign executive orders that made substantial changes — but didn’t always provide details.

The suggestion to deputize the National Guard indicates that the federal government is trying to think big about what implementing Trump’s vision on immigration would look like — even if it ends up rejecting some of its most aggressive ideas.

Using the National Guard to arrest unauthorized immigrants in the US would be unprecedented

The federal government has signed agreements to deputize other government officials to arrest and detain immigrants before. But those agreements, known as “287(g) agreements” under the provision of federal law that authorizes them, have traditionally been signed with local law enforcement agencies: police departments and sheriff’s offices.

Under George W. Bush, 287(g) agreements allowed police officers to engage in immigration arrests and raids as part of “task forces.” Obama curbed the use of those task forces, which had been widely criticized for inspiring fear in immigrant communities and chilling immigrants’ willingness to report crimes to police, as well as raising constitutional concerns about local versus federal authority.

It’s been widely expected that the Trump administration would start deputizing local police to start enforcing immigration law again.

But deputizing National Guard members to do so would have gone much farther — and could raise questions about posse comitatus, which is intended to draw a sharp line between the military and domestic law enforcement.

According to the draft memo, the National Guard option would be given to governors in “states adjacent to the land border with Mexico and […] those states adjoining such border States,” per the draft memo. As the AP has pointed out, this covers 11 states — from Oregon in the Northwest to Louisiana in the Southeast.

Here’s the relevant passage from the memo:

I am directing the Commissioner of CBP and the Director of ICE to immediately engage with the Governors of the States adjacent to the land border with Mexico and to those states adjoining such border States for the purpose of entering into agreements of section 287(g) of the INA to authorize qualified members of the state National Guard, while such members are not in federal service, or qualified members of a state militia or state defense force under the command of the Governor, to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the apprehension, investigation and detention of aliens in the United States.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) is the primary federal law that regulates the environmental effects of coal mining in the United States.

SMCRA created two programs: one for regulating active coal mines and a second for reclaiming abandoned mine lands. SMCRA also created the Office of Surface Mining, an agency within the Department of the Interior, to promulgate regulations, to fund state regulatory and reclamation efforts, and to ensure consistency among state regulatory programs.[1]

Passage [ edit ]

SMCRA grew out of a concern about the environmental effects of strip mining. Coal had been mined in the United States since the 1740s, but surface mining did not become widespread until the 1930s. At the end of that decade, states began to enact the first laws regulating the coal mining industry: West Virginia in 1939, Indiana in 1941, Illinois in 1943, and Pennsylvania in 1945. Despite those laws, the great demand for coal during World War II led to coal being mined with little regard for environmental consequences. After the war, states continued to enact and expand regulatory programs, some of which required mining permits or the posting of bonds to ensure that the land could be reclaimed after mining was complete. But these state laws were largely unsuccessful at stemming the environmental impacts of surface mining. One problem was that the law varied from state to state, enabling mining operations to relocate to states where regulations were less strict. Meanwhile, surface mining became increasingly common: in 1963 just 33 percent of American coal came from surface mines; by 1973 that figure reached 60 percent.

In 1974 and 1975 Congress sent mining regulation bills to President Gerald Ford, but he vetoed them out of concern that they would harm the coal industry, increase inflation, and restrict the energy supply. As Jimmy Carter campaigned in Appalachia in 1976, he promised to sign those bills. Congress sent him a bill that was even more stringent than those vetoed by Ford, and President Carter signed it into law on August 3, 1977.

Regulatory program [ edit ]

The regulation of active mines under SMCRA has five major components:

Standards of Performance . SMCRA and its implementing regulations set environmental standards that mines must follow while operating, and achieve when reclaiming mined land.

. SMCRA and its implementing regulations set environmental standards that mines must follow while operating, and achieve when reclaiming mined land. Permitting . SMCRA requires that companies obtain permits before conducting surface mining. Permit applications must describe what the premining environmental conditions and land use are, what the proposed mining and reclamation will be, how the mine will meet the SMCRA performance standards, and how the land will be used after reclamation is complete. This information is intended to help the government determine whether to allow the mine and set requirements in the permit that will protect the environment.

SMCRA requires that mining companies post a bond sufficient to cover the cost of reclaiming the site. This is meant to ensure that the mining site will be reclaimed even if the company goes out of business or fails to clean up the land for some other reason. The bond is not released until the mining site has been fully reclaimed and the government has (after five years in the East and ten years in the West) found that the reclamation was successful.

Inspectors can issue "notices of violation," which require operators to correct problems within a certain amount of time; levy fines; or order that mining cease.

SMCRA prohibits surface mining altogether on certain lands, such as in National Parks and wilderness areas. It also allows citizens to challenge proposed surface mining operations on the ground that they will cause too much environmental harm.

Reclamation program [ edit ]

SMCRA created an Abandoned Mine Land (AML) fund to pay for the cleanup of mine lands abandoned before the passage of the statute in 1977. The law was amended in 1990 to allow funds to be spent on the reclamation of mines abandoned after 1977. The fund is financed by a tax of 31.5 cents per ton for surface mined coal, 15 cents per ton for coal mined underground, and 10 cents per ton for lignite. 80% of AML fees are distributed to states with an approved reclamation program (see below) to fund reclamation activities. The remaining 20% are used by OSM to respond to emergencies such as landslides, land subsidence, and fires, and to carry out high priority cleanups in states without approved programs. States with approved programs can also use AML funds to set up programs to insure homeowners against land subsidence caused by underground mining.

State/federal relationship [ edit ]

In Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Association, Inc., 452 U.S. 264 (1981) the Supreme Court of the United States found the SMCRA does not violate the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[2] Like most environmental statutes passed in the 1960s and 1970s, SMCRA uses a cooperative federalism approach under which states are expected to take the lead in regulation while the federal government oversees their efforts.

Under SMCRA, the federal government can approve a program, which gives the state the authority to regulate mining operations, if the state demonstrates that it has a law that is at least as strict as SMCRA, and that they have a regulatory agency with the wherewithal to operate the program. Currently, most coal-mining states have approved programs. Those states issue their own permits, inspect their mines, and take enforcement action themselves when necessary. In the two states without approved programs (Tennessee and Washington) and on Indian Reservations, the Office of Surface Mining performs those functions. The federal government is required to regulate surface coal mining on federal lands (which include 60 percent of the coal reserves in the West), but can enter into cooperative agreements with states with approved programs.

Self-bonding [ edit ]

Many states do not require large mining companies to post a surety bond for the costs of mine reclamation.[3] Instead, these companies can hold their own assets as “self-bonding”.[4] The bankruptcy of large coal mining companies may imperil the $3.7 billion state regulators have allowed in self-bonding.[5] For example, shortly before it declared bankruptcy Peabody Energy held $1.47 billion in self-bonding liabilities, including $900.5 million in Wyoming alone.[6]

L.J. 531 (1997)During his chaotic 77-minute press conference on Thursday, President Donald Trump was on the defensive about his relationship with Russia. One key point he made, attempting to prove that that he wasn’t soft on Moscow, was to paint the previous administration as weak in handling the Kremlin — by claiming again that Hillary Clinton gave Russia “20 percent of our uranium” as secretary of state.

Here’s what he actually said during a rambling attempt to convince reporters that his Russia strategy was sound and not the product of some covert relationship that compromises the integrity of his policies:

By the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia. Just so you understand that. Tomorrow, you will say, "Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia; this is terrible." It is not terrible. It is good. We had Hillary Clinton try to do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It’s this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like lots of things are done with uranium. Including some bad things. But nobody talks about that. I did not do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?

The very first part of what Trump said, about it being desirable to get along with Russia, makes sense. It might seem counterintuitive during a time when much of the American public is enraged at Russia for allegedly engaging in election-related cyberattacks and finds the idea of cooperating with its authoritarian government to be distasteful. But powerful countries getting along as well as they can with their powerful rivals can be a good thing, as it makes it less likely that they'll end up in costly conflict with each other, even if their interests are at odds on many matters. And that is indeed why, as he points out, the Obama administration made serious attempts to try to improve US-Russian ties.

But the claim that Clinton gave 20 percent of America’s uranium to Russia is incorrect and clearly misleading. Trump is referring to Russia’s nuclear power agency purchasing a majority stake in a Toronto-based energy company between 2009 and 2013. The company had mines and land in a number of US states with huge uranium production capacity — a move the US State Department signed off on. But PolitiFact did a thorough fact-check of the claim last year when Trump first made it on the campaign trail, and found the following faults with it:

The mines, mills, and land the company holds in the US account for 20 percent of the US’s uranium production capacity, not actual produced uranium. The State Department was one of nine federal agencies and a number of additional independent federal and state regulators that signed off on the deal. President Obama, not Secretary Clinton, was the only person who could’ve vetoed the deal. Since Russia doesn’t have the legal right to export uranium out of the US, its main goal was likely to gain access to the company’s uranium assets in Kazakhstan. Crucially, the main national security concern was not about nuclear weapons proliferation, as Trump suggests, but actually ensuring the US doesn’t have to depend too much on uranium sources from abroad, as the US only makes about 20 percent of the uranium it needs. An advantage in making nuclear weapons wasn’t the main issue because, as PolitiFact notes, “the United States and Russia had for years cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched fuel from decommissioned warheads to be used in American nuclear power plants in return for raw uranium.”

Trump is desperate to repudiate claims that he’s Putin’s stooge

The general inaccuracy of Trump’s claim isn’t surprising; at this point, it would be more shocking if he strung together five minutes’ worth of sentences that weren’t packed with falsehoods and lies.

But his misleading comments are in service of a broader goal: to push back against the notion that he’s at Vladimir Putin’s beck and call. Trump wants to make the case that the Obama administration is the real culprit when it comes to being too easy on the Kremlin by catering to its geopolitical interests for little in exchange. And he’s exaggerating points about uranium to make that case.

By contrast, Trump vows that he’s ”done nothing for Russia.” That’s not really true. Trump has constantly pushed back against the intelligence community’s claims about Russia’s interference with the US election, and said that even if they’re true, he doesn’t understand all the fuss about it — making it less likely that the GOP will investigate Russia’s conduct rigorously. And his open embrace of Putin in the public sphere for many years has helped boost the Russian leader’s stature among the nationalist right in the US and Europe as a strong leader and a vital ally against Islamist terrorism around the world.

There’s also the possibility that Trump’s team has in fact floated concrete gifts to Putin. We know that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, spoke about sanctions with the Russian ambassador on the phone the very day that Obama slapped new sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies for their role in using cyberattacks to interfere with the presidential election. While we can’t confirm the substance of the call, two government officials claimed in interviews with the Washington Post that Flynn cautioned Russia against reciprocating Obama’s sanctions because Trump would be in a position to lift them when he entered office. If that’s true, that might in part explain why Putin overrode his own foreign minister in declaring that he’d wait for the next administration before reacting to sanctions.

There’s plenty of evidence that suggests Trump simply really likes Russia. He’ll use whatever points he can to distract from it.

Watch: Unbelievable statements from press conferenceNational security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”

On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

Flynn’s contacts with the ambassador attracted attention within the Obama administration because of the timing. U.S. intelligence agencies were then concluding that Russia had waged a cyber campaign designed in part to help elect Trump; his senior adviser on national security matters was discussing the potential consequences for Moscow, officials said.

[FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit]

The talks were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said. In a recent interview, Kislyak confirmed that he had communicated with Flynn by text message, by phone and in person, but declined to say whether they had discussed sanctions.

The emerging details contradict public statements by incoming senior administration officials including Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. They acknowledged only a handful of text messages and calls exchanged between Flynn and Kislyak late last year and denied that either ever raised the subject of sanctions.

“They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence said in an interview with CBS News last month, noting that he had spoken with Flynn about the matter. Pence also made a more sweeping assertion, saying there had been no contact between members of Trump’s team and Russia during the campaign. To suggest otherwise, he said, “is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”

Neither of those assertions is consistent with the fuller account of Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak provided by officials who had access to reports from U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies that routinely monitor the communications of Russian diplomats. Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.

“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.

A third official put it more bluntly, saying that either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke. An administration official stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn. The sanctions in question have so far remained in place.

The nature of Flynn’s pre-inauguration message to Kislyak triggered debate among officials in the Obama administration and intelligence agencies over whether Flynn had violated a law against unauthorized citizens interfering in U.S. disputes with foreign governments, according to officials familiar with that debate. Those officials were already alarmed by what they saw as a Russian assault on the U.S. election.

U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.

Officials also cited political sensitivities. Prominent Americans in and out of government are so frequently in communication with foreign officials that singling out one individual — particularly one poised for a top White House job — would invite charges of political persecution.

Former U.S. officials also said aggressive enforcement would probably discourage appropriate contact. Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that he was in Moscow meeting with officials in the weeks leading up to Obama’s 2008 election win.

“As a former diplomat and U.S. government official, one needs to be able to have contact with foreigners to do one’s job,” McFaul said. McFaul, a Russia scholar, said he was careful never to signal pending policy changes before Obama took office.

On Wednesday, Flynn said that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. Kislyak helped coordinate that trip, Flynn said.

Flynn said that he spoke to Kislyak on a range of subjects in late December, including arranging a call between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Trump after the inauguration and expressing his condolences after Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated. “I called to say I couldn’t believe the murder of their ambassador,” Flynn said. Asked whether there was any mention of sanctions in his communications with Kislyak, Flynn said, “No.”

Kislyak characterized his conversations with Flynn as benign during a brief interview at a conference this month. “It’s something all diplomats do,” he said.

Kislyak said that he had been in contact with Flynn since before the election, but declined to answer questions about the subjects they discussed. Kislyak is known for his assiduous cultivation of high-level officials in Washington and was seated in the front row of then-GOP candidate Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April of last year. The ambassador would not discuss the origin of his relationship with Flynn.

In his CBS interview, Pence said that Flynn had “been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That’s exactly what the incoming national security adviser should do.”

Official concern about Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak was heightened when Putin declared on Dec. 30 that Moscow would not retaliate after the Obama administration announced a day earlier the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and the forced closure of Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York.

Instead, Putin said he would focus on “the restoration of ­Russia-United States relations” after Obama left office, and put off considering any retaliatory measures until Moscow had a chance to evaluate Trump’s policies.

Trump responded with effusive praise for Putin. “Great move on the delay,” he said in a posting to his Twitter account. “I always knew he was very smart.”

Putin’s reaction cut against a long practice of reciprocation on diplomatic expulsions, and came after his foreign minister had vowed that there would be reprisals against the United States.

Putin’s muted response — which took White House officials by surprise — raised some officials’ suspicions that Moscow may have been promised a reprieve, and triggered a search by U.S. spy agencies for clues.

“Something happened in those 24 hours” between Obama’s announcement and Putin’s response, a former senior U.S. official said. Officials began poring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications and diplomatic cables, and saw evidence that Flynn and Kislyak had communicated by text and telephone around the time of the announcement.

Trump transition officials acknowledged those contacts weeks later after they were reported in The Washington Post but denied that sanctions were discussed. Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said Jan. 13 that Flynn had “reached out to” the Russian ambassador on Christmas Day to extend holiday greetings. On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

Other officials were categorical. “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever,” a senior transition official told The Post at the time. When Pence faced questions on television that weekend, he said “those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.”

Current and former U.S. officials said that assertion was not true.

Like Trump, Flynn has shown an affinity for Russia that is at odds with the views of most of his military and intelligence peers. Flynn raised eyebrows in 2015 when he appeared in photographs seated next to Putin at a lavish party in Moscow for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network.

In an earlier interview with The Post, Flynn acknowledged that he had been paid through his speakers bureau to give a speech at the event and defended his attendance by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels, including CNN.

[Trump adviser Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and why Russia Today is just like CNN]

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn served multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — tours in which he held a series of high-level intelligence assignments working with U.S. Special Operations forces hunting al-Qaeda operatives and Islamist militants.

Former colleagues said that narrow focus led Flynn to see the threat posed by Islamist groups as overwhelming other security concerns, including Russia’s renewed aggression. Instead, Flynn came to see America’s long-standing adversary as a potential ally against terrorist groups, and himself as being in a unique position to forge closer ties after traveling to Moscow in 2013 while serving as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Flynn has frequently boasted that he was the first DIA director to be invited into the headquarters of Russia’s military intelligence directorate, known as the GRU, although at least one of his predecessors was granted similar access. “Flynn thought he developed some rapport with the GRU chief,” a former senior U.S. military official said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say they have tied the GRU to Russia’s theft of troves of email messages from Democratic Party computer networks and accuse Moscow of then delivering those materials to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published them in phases during the campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival.

Flynn was pushed out of the DIA job in 2014 amid concerns about his management of the sprawling agency. He became a fierce critic of the Obama administration before joining the Trump campaign last year.

Trump and Putin: A relationship where mutual admiration is headed toward reality

Trump’s national security adviser shared secrets without permission, files showMichael Flynn resigned as US national security advisor on Monday amid concerns about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US. Carlos Barria / Reuters ID: 10544841

WASHINGTON — As anonymous officials leak explosive details on President Donald Trump and his White House’s alleged ties to Russia, the usually-quiet Senate Intelligence Committee has found itself in the spotlight, pushing forward on its probe into Russian meddling in the US election.

In the last week, leaks from unknown corners have brutally yanked the question of the Trump inner circle’s ties to Russia back into the spotlight. But despite speculation that an underground cohort of intelligence officials is orchestrating the narrative, a coherent national security voice on the Trump-Russia question is missing. The Director of National Intelligence’s office is director-less. CIA director Mike Pompeo has retreated into the dark shadow of Langley, and little information is trickling out through official FBI or Department of Justice channels.

The only shared turf for these various intelligence players is the Senate’s Intelligence Committee. And now, it’s their unenviable job to try and figure out what, exactly, is going on. Wearily, they’re trudging forward on a probe littered with potential political landmines.

As recently as last Friday, staff were going to off-site locations to review intelligence related to the probe. But amidst a barrage of leaks over the last week — which even committee lawmakers said they first learned of from news reports — they’re scrambling to differentiate fact from fiction.

“Leaks are a tough thing to plug,” one official said, requesting to speak on background about the sensitive investigation. Asked if they were concerned the intelligence committee was learning of significant counterintelligence issues from newspapers rather than the government, the official anxiously said, “Yes.”

Officials speculated Tuesday that the leaks are likely coming from former Obama Administration officials.

Asked how the committee is parsing through the competing developments, the official said “very carefully.”

The early stages of the Intelligence Committee’s probe, first announced in early December, were hamstrung by standard, if wildly inefficient jockeying on the Hill over which of the Senate’s many committee’s had jurisdiction over the Trump-Russia issue. Both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on Russia’s efforts to manipulate the election, and some democrats have pushed for a wholly separate “select” committee to handle the issue. Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats backed off that demand on Wednesday, at least for the immediate future.

The scope of the Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe has been debated through the weeks, but has now been settled and agreed upon by both Republican and Democrat leaders. Its timeline will include everything from the post-election transition period to the year leading up to the election, and both Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner have left open the possibility that Obama and Trump administration officials will be called to testify.

Burr, who chairs the Senate committee, and Warner, the committee’s top democrat, said Tuesday that the investigation would include the Russian effort to manipulate the election, connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials and any Russian efforts to undermine the transition period, including former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador.

Though the inquiry is only in its nascent stages, conversations with staffers from both sides of the aisle suggest it’s the most cooperative, cordial and bipartisan the committee has been on a major, politically charged investigation in recent memory.

There was brief, if fiery, politicking over the committee’s investigation in January, when Burr — breaking from the initial announcement of the inquiry — told reporters that the panel wouldn’t probe connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, and would instead focus on the broader Russian intelligence effort to undermine the election. His comments caused a headache behind closed doors, as democrats and reporters furiously scrambled to find out what had changed.. The back-and-forth played out in press releases until both Burr and Warner said in a joint statement that yes, of course the investigation would include the campaign.

One official said in the days just after lawmakers had returned to the Hill in January, there was concern that committee Republicans would back off of the probe. But Warner, in a significant departure from his usually quiet demeanor, stepped up and unequivocally said the inquiry was of solemn import, and compared the situation to the Watergate and Church Committee eras of the 1970s. The official, who also requested anonymity to discuss the committee’s investigation, said it was a profoundly encouraging moment for the panel’s democrats. It was a clear indication, the official said, that Warner would be an advocate for the committee’s inquiry.

In recent days, Burr too has underscored the seriousness of the investigation, if not as publicly as his democratic colleagues. He’s closely monitored developments on Flynn’s ouster, and was noticeably troubled early this week that so little of the information had ever trickled up to the Hill.

That he’s now in charge of the sweeping Russia inquiry puts the North Carolina Republican in between a rock and a hard place. Since taking over the helm of the intelligence committee, Burr has pressed for more active and aggressive oversight, and has kept a rigorous travel schedule to match. But his decisive reelection victory in November came at a cost — throughout the contentious race, Burr towed Trump’s line, and hasn’t yet directly criticized the White House publicly.

But Burr has shown no indication that he’s ever angled for a Trump administration job, and says he’s not running for re-election. How seriously he takes his obligation to carry his president’s water remains to be seen.

Burr has been slammed by colleagues in recent days, who fear he’s slow-rolling an investigation into a fast-moving story. But much of the inquiry’s slow start was due to bureaucratic wrangling — some intelligence agencies insisted products be viewed on site rather than sent to the Hill, and some of the intelligence was so tightly controlled that it was unclear if staffers could even view it.

Much of those complications have since been negotiated, and the investigation is moving forward, if not as quickly as non-Intelligence committee lawmakers might prefer.Conservatives just can’t stop comparing protests against President Donald Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, to segregation.

Here is the latest example, from political cartoonist Glenn McCoy:

my god pic.twitter.com/AhN1R4eRgX — Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) February 14, 2017

This cartoon is an explicit reference to Ruby Bridges, who was the first black child to desegregate the all-white William Frantz Elementary School in Louisiana. Her heroic actions were captured in this painting by Norman Rockwell, which is now an iconic image of the civil rights era of the 1960s, depicting US Marshals escorting her to the school due to the threats of violence she faced:

As people on social media quickly pointed out pointed out, McCoy is not the first to use this talking point. Several conservative pundits made similar comparisons when protesters blocked DeVos from entering a Washington, DC, school:

apparently there was a memo. (via @felixgilman) pic.twitter.com/EBoysQbWNT — Bae Talese (@elongreen) February 10, 2017

It is incredible that this requires any explanation whatsoever, but protests against DeVos and racial segregation in American schools are not the same. The protests are politically motivated demonstrations against a single government official — the kind of person whom the public is supposed to hold accountable — who couldn’t answer basic education policy questions at Senate hearings. Segregation, meanwhile, was a racist policy that ostracized an entire race of people, forcing them into neighborhoods mired by poverty and crime and schools that were so underresourced that they doomed generations of kids from breaking out of socioeconomic stagnation.

And whereas Bridges, a 6-year-old, literally put her life in danger by trying to end this system that came out of centuries of racist policies, DeVos was simply trying to attend a public event, and her life was never in danger in the face of peaceful protests — and she reportedly managed to get into the school later on.

So to compare the two is simply ridiculous.

Watch: The myth of race, debunkedWatch the video above for everything you need to know about "Megalodon," "Submarine," and the Discovery Channel's controversial new shark documentaries.It’s safe to say there’s an enormous amount of panic — and confusion — about what’s going on with the Trump administration and the Environmental Protection Agency right now.

Over the past few days, we’ve seen reports that Trump’s team ordered EPA employees not to speak to the press or use social media for a period of time. They’ve imposed a (temporary) freeze on new grants and contracts. Trump’s political appointees even reportedly asked the EPA to remove parts of the agency’s climate change website — before receiving pushback from career staffers and then clarifying publicly that they merely planned on “scrubbing [the website] up a bit, putting a little freshener on it.” Within the agency, morale among career staff is low.

Now, on one level, the initial media furor around these stories has been a bit overblown. It’s really not that unusual for a new president to come in and put agency actions on hold temporarily while political appointees get a feel for their departments — and figure out how to align agency actions and messaging with the administration’s policy priorities. There’s a totally benign interpretation of many of these moves.

Indeed, Trump’s spokespeople have clarified that many of these EPA “blackouts” are likely to be short-lived — both the freeze on grants and the political review of outgoing scientific press releases are expected to be lifted by Friday, January 27.

Some of the disarray here may stem from the fact that Trump’s transition team got a later start and moved more slowly than Bush’s or Obama’s did. In previous transitions, for instance, an incoming administration would’ve reviewed EPA grants and contracts before the inauguration — so there wasn’t a need to suddenly freeze new grants on week one, explains Scott Fulton, who was the EPA’s general counsel during the Obama administration and is now president of the Environmental Law Institute.

But on another level, even if some of the early outrage has been overheated, it’s hardly a mystery why there’s a lot of dread and uncertainty about the EPA right now. You just have to look at what happened at the agency during the George W. Bush years — and also at what Trump’s team have explicitly said they want to do. The widespread fear that we might soon see a Trump “war on science” at the agency is hardly unfounded.

If the Bush years are any indication, there’s a lot to worry about with Trump’s EPA

The EPA is required, by law, to enforce and continually update air, water, and climate pollution regulations in accordance with the best available science. To that end, the agency employs a variety of scientists who sort through and synthesize the relevant research in order to inform this process.

Different administrations obviously have different ideas about what those regulations should look like — and the law gives the EPA a certain amount of leeway there. But what made the George W. Bush administration so striking is that it often attacked the underlying science itself, either by muzzling scientists or by ignoring or suppressing the relevant research.

The Union of Concerned Scientists has a long, long list of examples here. In 2003, the administration suppressed an EPA analysis showing that a Senate air pollution bill would save more lives than a bill that Bush favored. In 2005, an EPA report showing the fuel efficiency of US cars had declined was also suppressed until after Congress voted on an energy bill. In 2006, an EPA scientist was barred from participating in a conference on soil science, because the talk might have touched on climate change. The list goes on and on — and the pattern was repeated across other federal agencies.

Perhaps the most consequential example came in 2008, as the EPA was crafting new regulations for ground-level ozone pollution, or smog, as required by the Clean Air Act. Scientists at the EPA had reviewed some 1,700 papers on the effects of ozone and recommended that the standards be tightened — only to have the White House overrule their findings and set a weaker standard. (That rule was eventually redone by the Obama administration, which set stricter ozone standards.)

The Obama administration came in vowing to protect EPA’s scientists and improve transparency, and it hasn’t exactly been perfect on this score — it has, for instance, still been difficult for reporters to speak to EPA scientists over the past eight years. But the Bush era was in another category altogether.

That sort of thing is what EPA scientists and career staff are concerned about as the Trump administration gets underway. Sure, it may be normal and mostly harmless that Trump’s political appointees are reviewing all outgoing press scientific releases this week. But there’s a larger context to consider too. And Trump has given agency employees every reason to worry — if they want to quell those fears, his political appointees have a lot of work to do.

Trump’s advisers have already hinted they’ll go after EPA’s scientists

The Trump administration has made its plan for the EPA perfectly clear — it wants to roll back a wide variety of Obama-era climate rules and cut the agency’s budget considerably. Trump has been very explicit about easing the regulatory burden on coal-fired power plants and oil and gas producers. That’s a top priority.

Now, if that were all there was to it, you might say, okay, those are mainly policy issues. You can agree or disagree, but Trump is president, and he has some latitude to reorient the agency (as long as the EPA follows the laws that underpin the agency, like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act).

But Trump’s team hasn’t just talked about making regulatory changes through the usual federal rulemaking channels. They’ve also talked about going after EPA’s scientists and scientific process. Jonathan Swan and Mike Allen of Axios got a look at an “agency action plan” for the EPA written by Trump’s transition team. It has a section called “Addendum on the problems with EPA science” that includes this striking paragraph:

EPA does not use science to guide regulatory policy as much as it uses regulatory policy to steer the science. This is an old problem at EPA. In 1992, a blue-ribbon panel of EPA science advisers that [sic] 'science should not be adjusted to fit policy.' But rather than heed this advice, EPA has greatly increased its science manipulation.

The document follows up with recommendations that the EPA stop funding science altogether and that “EPA's science advisory process needs to be overhauled to eliminate conflicts of interest and inherent bias.”

Now combine that with the Trump team’s well-known (and scientifically unfounded) hostility toward climate change research. You have the president himself saying global warming is “bullshit.” You have Trump’s pick to head the EPA, Scott Pruitt, refusing to say that human activity is the main cause of global warming (the evidence is overwhelming that it is). You have a Trump transition team official like Chris Horner, who has spent years hounding climate scientists and accusing them of manipulating data. When you put this together, it’s not hard to see why people are fearful that Trump’s team might come in and distort the scientific process.

In theory, the EPA should have new safeguards to protect its scientists from undue Bush-style political interference. The agency’s “scientific integrity policy,” enacted in 2012, notes that it is “essential that political or other officials not suppress or alter scientific findings.” The agency now has a “Scientific Integrity Official,” a career position, to enforce this policy, working with the EPA’s inspector general. Still, these integrity guidelines weren’t written into law by Congress — and outsiders fear that they may not be robust enough to withstand a White House intent on heavy interference.

It’s hard to know exactly how the Trump era at the EPA will play out, although Michael Halpern, the deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, suggests watching what happens at EPA’s scientific advisory boards. These advisory boards are supposed to independently synthesize scientific research that is then used by policymakers to inform the shape of regulations. What happens to them under Trump?

Those sorts of decisions will be quieter and garner far less press attention than a website edit or a temporary grant freeze (unless career employees decide to leak what’s happening to the press). But they could end up being far, far more important. So pace yourself, everyone. It’s week one, there are still four years to go, and we haven’t even begun to see what will happen to the EPA under Trump.

Top House and Senate Democrats are ratcheting up their calls for an independent investigation into communications between President Donald Trump’s associates and Russian intelligence agents — but Republicans show no sign of acquiescing.

“If an investigation is not independent, nonpartisan, and most of all, transparent, there is no guarantee this administration will take the decisive and immediate actions necessary to keep our country safe,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday.

"They’re stonewalling this," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday of GOP leaders’ refusal to back an independent probe. “The American people deserve better.”

So far Republicans have resisted the calls a for new inquiry. But the dramatic allegations about Trump team-Russia talks during the 2016 campaign, first reported by the New York Times — after the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his own Russian connections — has created a crisis atmosphere on Capitol Hill.

Democrats also laid down markers for what they’d consider a “complete” investigation by the House intelligence committee into the Trump administration's Russia connections.

Schumer urged the creation of two independent investigations: one by Congress and the other by the executive branch, where he urged newly sworn-in Attorney General Jeff Session to appoint an independent investigator.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, any investigation would have to look at Flynn's actions, the transcripts of his phone calls and his testimony as a witness. He also expressed concern that the Senate intelligence committee’s investigation has a broader scope than the House counterpart. "I don’t think the House investigation can be cabined in a way the Senate investigation is not," he said. "We have to follow the facts wherever they may lead."

Schiff said he’s meeting with House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes later Thursday to discuss the committee’s investigation. He also dismissed the Republican emphasis on seeking the source of leaked intelligence, which Trump decried earlier Wednesday. Schiff said he shares GOP concerns about leaks but that “there are far bigger fish to fry.”

“I would hate to see us go on a tangent,” he said.

Republicans have taken a scattershot approach on how to respond to the latest revelations. And Democrats have attempted to fill that vacuum by raising up pressure on the Republicans leading existing investigations — and to launch a new, independent investigation. Nearly a dozen Senate Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called for an independent counsel to probe the matter Wednesday morning.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said in a brief interview Wednesday that committee staff began reviewing documents for its Russia probe last week, declining to offer a timetable for its first public hearing on Russia. The committee has yet to reach out to Flynn, Burr added, but said it's "very likely" Flynn will be invited to testify.

Nunes reacted angrily in an interview with POLITICO about calls for a new probe. He vowed to continue his panel’s ongoing probe of Russia and accused Democrats of politicizing the issue.

Asked about the possibility of a select committee, Nunes said, “There is not going to be one; I can tell you there is absolutely not going to be one. And I am not going to be lectured by people who are speaking out of both sides of their mouths."

Senate Democrats held an emergency caucus meeting Wednesday morning called by Schumer to discuss the reports as well as the fallout from the resignation of Michael Flynn as White House national security adviser. Flynn’s resignation, Schumer said on the floor, is “a beginning of a much longer story.”

Democrats came out of the meeting unified in asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from an investigation into Russia and to continue a public pressure campaign on Republicans.

"There's a clear conflict of interest when it comes to the Department of Justice guidelines," said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin. He said Democrats are calling on the White House to present evidence and not destroy emails or communications. Asked how they get that result he said: "We're using public appeals and we hope the attorney general will respond in a positive way."

Before the meeting began, West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin — the only Democrat who backed Sessions' confirmation — told reporters that the attorney general had a potential conflict and should consider stepping aside from any Russia investigation.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) dismissed calls for Sessions to recuse himself on the matter. "I would think he would have the independence to do it," he said. "We shouldn't assume that he can't."

Sen. John McCain said in an interview Wednesday that he will send a list of questions to the White House to find out how Pence was "lied to" by Flynn.

"First we need to ask questions and get answers and then decide" what to do, the Arizona Republican said. "We will be doing that."

Two senior House Democrats also aimed a new line of inquiry Wednesday at White House counsel Don McGahn, seeking answers about why Flynn continued to sit in on sensitive briefings and meetings even after White House officials learned he had given misleading answers about his contacts with Russian officials.

“These reports raise more than ‘trust’ issues — they also raise significant national security concerns,” wrote Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), the ranking members of the House oversight and judiciary committees, respectively. “[E]ven in the face of strong warnings and evidence that he was vulnerable to being blackmailed, the White House appears to have considered General Flynn fit to continue serving as the National Security Advisor.”

The Democrats asked McGahn to respond to 15 questions, including whether the White House took any steps to curb Flynn’s access to classified information, whether White House officials have been interviewed by the FBI on the matter and who approved Flynn’s security clearance.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who brushed off calls for an expanded investigation after Flynn’s departure on Tuesday, took a slightly harder line on Wednesday, saying that he could support McCain's bipartisan effort to convert Obama-era sanctions against Russia into law if the Trump administration attempted to roll them back.

"If those sanctions were to be watered down, I would for sure support codifying them," Ryan told MSNBC.

Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), whom Trump once considered for secretary of state, outlined the president's problems in stark terms on Wednesday. "Is the White House going to have the ability to stabilize itself?" Corker asked on MSNBC.

The controversy over the Trump team's Russia connections "affects us, not just with international issues that are brewing all around the world," Corker added, "but the domestic agenda here.”

Minutes after President Donald Trump’s press conference concluded on Thursday afternoon, CNN’s Jake Tapper called it “unhinged” and “wild.”

Here are nine quotes from the presser that back up that assessment.

1) At the beginning of the press conference, Trump blasted intelligence community leaks about his campaign’s alleged contact with Russia as “fake news.” A reporter asked Trump to clarify whether he meant the leaks were fake.

Here’s the exchange:

REPORTER: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well, the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them; I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it, and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit, but the reporters, good reporters.

2) After reporter April Ryan asked Trump about the Congressional Black Caucus, the president asked if she could set up a meeting with them. Ryan, who is black, is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks in Baltimore.

RYAN: When you say the inner cities, are you going — are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President? In your conversations with your — your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as — TRUMP: Am I going to include who? RYAN: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional — TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting? RYAN: No, no, no. I’m not — TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? RYAN: I'm just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then set up the meeting. RYAN: I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now. TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great.

3) Trump also used the question about fake news as an opportunity to criticize the ratings of CNN, saying he no longer watches the network because of its “anger and hatred.” At one point, CNN’s Jim Acosta began trying to ask a question before Trump told his employer to be “straight.”

TRUMP: I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred, and just the hatred. I don’t watch it anymore because it’s not very good. ... I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually — I think that’d actually be better. I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good — he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim. It’s OK, Jim, you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be frankly more interesting

4) At another point in the press conference, Trump explained why he wouldn’t explain whether he will retaliate against reports of Russian provocation.

I'm not going to tell you anything about what I’m going to do. I'm not going to talk about military stuff. I will not say, “We are going to attack Mosul in four months. We are going to attack in one month. Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.” In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult — you know why? I don't talk about military and certain other things. You were going to be surprised to hear that, by the way, my whole campaign I said that. I don't have to tell you.

5) Trump was also asked whether by attacking “fake news,” he’d be undermining the press. It’s hard to summarize his answer, which touched on the negativity of the press, the importance of the institution, and whether he’d be a good reporter.

REPORTER: When you call it "fake news," you're undermining confidence in our news media. ... TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. Okay. I understand what you're — and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, "Wow, that's going to be a great story." And I'll get killed ... But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive — sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press — the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?

6) At another point, Trump talked about how the press would misrepresent the press conference he was giving. He said that he was not “ranting and raving,” but that the media coverage would say he had been. (The precise wording of the question in the exchange below is unclear.)

I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, "Donald Trump rants and raves at the press." I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, "Donald Trump rants and raves." I'm not ranting and raving.

7) Trump was also asked if “there was anything” he could reveal to convince the media and public that the leaks over Russia and Flynn amounted to “fake news.” He began by citing a Rasmussen poll showing his approval rating north of 50 percent, before talking about the dangers of uranium and how Hillary Clinton had a “stupid plastic button” as part of her Russian reset.

By the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia. Just so you understand that. Tomorrow, you will say, "Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia; this is terrible." It is not terrible. It is good. We had Hillary Clinton try to do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It’s this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like lots of things are done with uranium. Including some bad things. But nobody talks about that. I did not do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?

8) Later, Trump was asked if Vladimir Putin was “testing” him with military provocations. Trump’s response included a warning about how nuclear war “would be like no other”:

If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

9) In one of his most relaxed moments, Trump ruminated on a career he decided not to pursue. “I'd be a pretty good reporter,” he said. “Not as good as you.”Now, Mr. Pruitt, tapped to head Donald J. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, will have the opportunity to engineer a radical shift in Washington. If confirmed by the Senate, he is expected to shelve the Obama administration’s aggressive environmental enforcement and embrace a more collaborative approach with the industries that the agency is charged with policing, many of which have helped him advance his political career.

The impact would stretch from the nation’s waterways to the planet’s climate, since the E.P.A. carries out and enforces rules to combat global warming.

“He has advocated and stood up for the profits of business, be it the poultry companies or the energy industry and other polluters, at the expense of people who have to drink the water or breathe the air,” said Mark Derichsweiler, who led the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality division responsible for overseeing the poultry-related cleanup. Mr. Derichsweiler retired in 2015 after 40 years with the state, frustrated with Mr. Pruitt’s approach.

Mr. Pruitt declined a request to comment. But his supporters contend that his record demonstrates a deeply held philosophy that states understand their needs best and should be allowed to regulate their own environment. On Thursday, a coalition of 23 powerful conservative advocacy groups endorsed Mr. Pruitt’s nomination, in advance of his confirmation hearing, set for Wednesday.

“Some claim Mr. Pruitt opposes clean air and water. This could not be further from the truth,” wrote the groups, which include the political action committee Club for Growth; the American Energy Alliance, which has advised Mr. Trump on energy policy; and Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by the anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist. Mr. Pruitt, the endorsement said, “understands that many of the nation’s challenges regarding clean air and water are best met at the state and local level.”

Mr. Pruitt, if confirmed, will take over the agency in an odd position: He has spent the last seven years suing it to block regulations that he would be expected to put into effect and enforce. Some legal scholars say he should recuse himself from major pending environmental matters, while groups like the Environmental Defense Fund are urging Congress to reject his confirmation.

“The president’s choices deserve a lot of deference from Congress and even environmental groups,” said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. “But at some point when the nominee has spent his entire career attempting to dismantle environmental protections, it becomes unacceptable. That’s why Mr. Pruitt is the first E.P.A. nominee from either party that the Environmental Defense Fund has opposed in our 50-year history.”

Some experts say that while returning more authority to states can be desirable in some cases, environmental protection is probably not one of them. Smog and toxic chemicals that foul the air and waterways of one state may originate from one or several others, necessitating federal oversight of pollution.

“Pollution doesn’t respect state boundaries,” said Patrick A. Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. “States have limited ability to regulate pollution from outside the state, and almost every state is downstream or downwind from other pollution.”

Case in point: the “Green Country” chicken battle that Mr. Pruitt inherited in eastern Oklahoma. The phosphorus and nitrates in chicken manure were causing algae blooms in the ponds, streams and lakes of the 1.1-million acre Illinois River watershed, which reaches from Arkansas into Oklahoma.

In 2005, Attorney General Drew Edmondson of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt’s predecessor, sued Tyson Food, Cargill Turkey and a dozen other major poultry producers for damages caused by the pollution and to force them to change the way they disposed of 300,000 tons a year of animal waste.

As Mr. Pruitt ran for election, at least $40,000 in contributions poured into his campaign from nearly 30 executives at poultry companies named in the lawsuit or attorneys at law firms representing them, including Mark Simmons, the founder of Simmons Foods; Donald J. Smith, then the chief executive of Tysons Foods; and Gary Weeks, a lawyer listed on the court papers as representing George’s, another company targeted in the lawsuit, according to data assembled by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and confirmed by The New York Times. That money represents about 4 percent of the total $1 million he raised in the 2010 campaign, records show.

After Mr. Pruitt took over, instead of pushing the federal judge for a ruling that, seven years later, still hasn’t been issued, he negotiated an agreement with Arkansas and the poultry companies to conduct a study of the appropriate level of phosphorus in the Illinois River.

“Regulation through litigation is wrong in my view,” Mr. Pruitt told The Oklahoman newspaper in 2015. “That was not a decision my office made. It was a case we inherited.”

J. D. Strong, director of Oklahoma’s Wildlife Department and the state’s former Secretary of Environment, praised Mr. Pruitt for negotiating the settlement.

“You can’t force a judge to rule,” Mr. Strong said. “Pruitt didn’t sit back and wait or badger the judge for a ruling. He worked to get the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas around the table.”

A spokesman from Tyson Food noted that the contributions to Mr. Pruitt’s campaign were made by the company’s executives and employees — including two former chief executives and members of the Tyson family — rather than by the company itself.

“We’ll point out that our employees are encouraged to participate in the election process of public officials at all levels, and are at liberty to make personal contributions to any campaign as they see fit,” Worth Sparkman, the spokesman for Tyson, said.

But Mr. Pruitt quietly allowed the expiration of a 2003 agreement that Mr. Edmondson helped negotiate with Arkansas to reduce poultry waste pollution — and to monitor the progress — without seeking another formal extension of the deal. And Mr. Pruitt shut down the specialized unit of four attorneys and a criminal investigator that had helped initiate the lawsuit against the 14 poultry companies.

That environmental unit had broad jurisdiction, forcing pork-producing farmers to spend millions of dollars on their own cleanups and collecting tens of millions of dollars to clean up toxic sites in the state, including poisonous waste left at an abandoned lead and zinc mine known as Tar Creek.

Mr. Pruitt, in response to questions, provided a list of environmental enforcement actions taken during his tenure, but the list includes cases that were largely initiated under Mr. Pruitt’s predecessor, Mr. Edmondson.

A spokesman for Mr. Pruitt said that while the environmental unit had been closed, environmental cases continued to be handled by the state solicitor general’s unit. “Under the leadership of Attorney General Pruitt, this team has held bad actors accountable and protected stewardship of Oklahoma’s natural resources.”

But Mr. Edmondson said that prosecution of such environmental crimes fell as a result of the shuttering of the unit. “Under his tenure as attorney general, I don’t think environmental crimes have disappeared,” Mr. Edmondson said of Mr. Pruitt, in an interview. “It is just the filing of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely disappeared.”

Residents who live in eastern Oklahoma, where local ponds and streams are still often clogged with algae, said they, too, were frustrated.

Phosphorus levels have declined considerably — a total of about 70 percent between 1998 and 2015 — but the largest reductions took place before Mr. Pruitt became attorney general, as wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and more poultry farmers have shipped chicken waste for proper disposal. Still, the levels remain far above the state standard and the decline in pollution has been slower than some hoped.

“I want an attorney general — and a head of our E.P.A. — who is not averse to protecting Oklahoma’s most outstanding waterways,” said Ed Brocksmith, who is a co-founder of a group called Save the Illinois River.

At the same time that he was retreating from his predecessor’s more aggressive approach, Mr. Pruitt sent a series of letters to federal regulators that in some cases were drafted by industry lobbyists and then put on his state government stationery, open records obtained by The New York Times in 2014 showed. The letters pressed the federal government to back down on proposals to tighten controls over energy production, such as oil and gas wells that can release planet-warming methane.

Mr. Pruitt separately filed a series of lawsuits against the federal government, challenging regulations intended to reduce the discharge of poisonous mercury from coal-burning power plants, carbon dioxide blamed for climate change and other emissions that federal authorities argued were causing unsightly haze in Oklahoma’s air.

In total, Mr. Pruitt filed 14 lawsuits challenging federal environmental regulations. In 13 of those cases, the co-parties included companies that had contributed money to Mr. Pruitt or to Pruitt-affiliated political campaign committees.

Mr. Pruitt separately has served as a leader of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which since 2013 has collected $4.2 million from fossil-fuel related companies, including Exxon Mobil, Koch Industries, Murray Energy and Southern Company, which in many cases have also supported the lawsuits he has filed.

Given the scale of his regulatory challenges, Mr. Pruitt turned to major corporate law firms, which typically defend energy companies fighting these laws, for help. In some cases, that assistance was offered free.

BakerHostetler, the Cleveland-based law firm whose clients have included dozens of energy industry players, assigned five of its lawyers to help Oklahoma overturn President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, intended to combat climate change. The law firm did not charge Oklahoma anything for the work, Mr. Pruitt’s office confirmed.

David B. Rivkin Jr., the lead attorney from BakerHostetler who handled the matter, said that the work was considered charitable, similar to when major law firms give free legal advice to inmates at the Guantánamo Bay military prison.

Environmentalists scoffed.

“The industries and companies, through their corporate lawyers, are renting the state’s seal in order to make it look like their self-interested arguments are being made by Scott Pruitt on behalf of a state,” said David Doniger, director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Counsel. “It is a disgrace.”

Even federal judges are skeptical.

Mr. Pruitt joined with Missouri and several other mostly rural states in one federal suit to beat back California’s regulations requiring egg farms, including those in Oklahoma, that wanted to sell in the state to seek more humane treatment of hens. In rejecting the suit, the federal judge admonished the plaintiffs.

“The court concludes plaintiffs have not brought this action on behalf of their interest in the physical or economic well-being of their residents in general,” Judge Kimberly J. Mueller of the United States District Court wrote in her 2014 opinion, “but rather on behalf of a discrete group of egg farmers whose businesses will allegedly be impacted.”Deep uncertainty and serious divisions within the Republican coalition about the way forward on Obamacare have surfaced in the new Congress, and they’ve put the future of repeal and replace in doubt.

It’s become evident that there is little GOP unity on how much a replacement plan should cost, how to pay for it, whether the Medicaid expansion should be rolled back, or how to fix the individual markets.

Furthermore, there is no evident agreement even on extremely broad questions such as, “What should the goals of the GOP’s replacement plan be?”

Related Republicans can't agree on Obamacare, and it's grinding Congress to a halt

Accordingly, many Republicans in both the House and Senate are increasingly fearful about moving to roll back Obamacare too quickly when so little is settled about what comes after it. And their problems are compounded by the fact that while a reasonably comprehensive repeal bill could be rammed through with just 50 Senate votes plus Vice President Mike Pence, a serious replacement bill would need 60 Senate votes, at least eight of which would have to come from Democrats.

It is not impossible that President Trump and the Republican Party will overcome all these problems. But to do so, they will have to come up with consensus answers to these five very serious unsettled questions.

1) What is the goal here?

When Democrats tackled health reform in 2009 and 2010, their primary goal was to expand useful health coverage to millions more people. Their strategy to achieve that goal was complex in its particulars, but broadly quite simple — they’d spend a lot more government money on health care, and pay for it with new tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere.

Now that Republicans are tackling the issue, their goals are far more muddled.

For instance, the GOP seems to be in agreement that Obamacare is too expensive. Yet when you look a bit more closely, some Republicans are most passionate about cutting government spending on health care, while others (including Trump) tend to cite people’s complaints about their own high premiums and deductibles.

But these are, to some extent, opposite problems with opposite solutions. Realistically, if you slash government spending on health coverage, at least some of those constituents will end up paying much more out of their own pockets. And many Republican health wonks don’t think high deductibles are actually so bad, since they would theoretically incentivize people to spend less on unnecessary care. (Congress members listening to their constituents’ complaints about high out-of-pocket costs may not be so persuaded by this argument.)

Then there’s the crucial question of whether any GOP replacement should maintain Obamacare’s coverage levels, or even seek to expand them. Trump has said he wants his replacement plan to “have insurance for everybody,” even those who “can’t pay for it.” Yet Republican congressional leaders reportedly think the goal should instead be to provide everyone access to coverage — a much more nebulous objective.

The community of conservative health wonks is also divided on this topic. Lanhee Chen and Tevi Troy wrote recently that “the ACA’s replacement ought to have universal coverage as a goal.” But Philip Klein says that if Republicans don’t flat-out say, “We don't believe that it is the job of the federal government to guarantee that everybody has health insurance,” their reform efforts will be “doomed to fail.”

Drafting and passing a comprehensive health reform bill is incredibly difficult even when you do have clear goals, as Democrats found out in 2009. The GOP’s current lack of consensus on coverage goals or just what lowering costs means compounds the difficulty.

2) What will they do about money?

The Affordable Care Act spends more than $100 billion a year toward health coverage. But importantly, Democrats wrote the health law so that this new spending would be paid for — so the ACA also raises a lot of money. It does this through several sources, including new taxes on rich people and fees on health-related industries, which are projected to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 10 years.

Repealing Obamacare naturally means repealing those taxes and fees, and many Republicans are eager to do that. The problem, though, is that if Republicans also replace Obamacare with anything that spends anywhere close to as much on coverage, they’ll need to come up with new sources of funding to pay for it.

Coming up with what in Hill parlance is known as a “pay-for” is tremendously challenging for legislators, because there will be some constituency or group very vocally opposed to essentially any new tax hike, fee, or spending cut that’s proposed.

And while Republicans do have one idea here, it looks to be an extremely tough sell. In leaked audio from Republicans’ closed-door retreat last month, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady said that he’s “looking at” limiting “the biggest tax credits we have ... the tax break you get for health care” provided through employers, to help fund a health care tax credit that would be more portable.

Brady is referring to the fact that all employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are currently exempt from federal taxes, which wonks on both the left and right have long seen as a wasteful subsidy that distorts health spending decisions.

The problem is that changing it is terrible politics. That’s because the majority of Americans who have insurance currently get it through employers and therefore benefit from this tax break. Past administrations have shied away from messing with it as a result, with Obama’s one major attempt to do so — the never-yet-implemented “Cadillac tax” — predictably ending up incredibly unpopular.

The optics of repealing taxes targeting rich people, while capping a tax break enjoyed by a much broader section of Americans, could be devastating. Indeed, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) pushed back against Brady’s idea in the audio from the retreat. “It sounds like we are going to be raising taxes on the middle class,” Cassidy said.

But what Republicans can do on the replacement side will in large part be determined by how much money they can dredge up to pay for it. So if they’re dead set on repealing Obamacare’s pay-fors and can’t come up with their own, they will likely have to deal with a whole lot of people either losing coverage or seeing even greater costs.

3) What’s to be done with Medicaid?

Out of the money question comes another very clear division that splits Republicans in Congress: the fate of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.

The health law expanded coverage to millions more people in two main ways. First is what we generally think of as Obamacare — the restructuring of the individual insurance markets, and the subsidies to help people buy insurance on those insurance exchanges. But second, the law expanded Medicaid eligibility to people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, including childless adults, with the federal government shouldering the vast majority of the cost.

A subsequent Supreme Court ruling allowed states to reject the expansion if they wanted to. But 31 states have opted in. That means a full Obamacare repeal would eliminate health coverage for over 10 million people who gained it through the Medicaid expansion.

Currently, 20 of the 52 Republican senators represent states that expanded the program. Several have been vocal about their lack of interest in rolling this particular part of Obamacare back. “That’s 184,000 people in my state,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) told Politico. “That’s problematic.”

But other Republicans in Congress are from states that didn’t expand, or are ideologically opposed to continuing the expansion. “Getting ahold of the Medicaid expansion and repealing that is absolutely critical if we’re gonna have control of the growth of entitlement spending,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) said in the retreat’s leaked audio. Republicans in states like his, he continued, “want to be proven that they were correct originally, that we can’t afford this when we have a $20 trillion national debt.”

The House Freedom Caucus is reportedly demanding that any repeal bill roll back the Medicaid expansion entirely, and they may have some allies in the Senate. Meanwhile, Republican leaders had planned to use some of the savings from repealing the Medicaid expansion to fund their replacement plan — which means that if they can’t do so, they’ll have to come up with more money elsewhere.

Beyond the question of the Medicaid expansion’s fate in repeal legislation, there’s the question of what will be done with Medicaid as a whole in any replacement for Obamacare. Republicans have long proposed overhauling the program by handing over much more authority to the states to run their Medicaid programs as they see fit. The catch is that such proposals from the GOP are almost always accompanied by changes that would also cut or cap Medicaid spending — which would mean people lose coverage.

Then there’s the further hiccup that if the GOP’s Medicaid overhaul caps payments per enrollee, the states that expanded Medicaid will effectively be rewarded with more federal cash. So you get the potentially bizarre situation where, as Politico’s Jennifer Haberkorn and Rachana Pradhan report, the party might end up having to placate those non-expansion states by throwing more money at them, so they can hopefully cut the program as a whole.

4) How will they try to make the individual markets work better?

When it comes to reforming the individual insurance markets, there is at least some Republican consensus on what to do. Everyone from HHS Secretary Tom Price to Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch agree on the basic premise that the government should give people buying insurance on the individual market a tax credit to help them afford it.

There’s one more thing they have in common: As Sarah Kliff wrote last November, the various GOP replacement plans are all “better for younger, healthy people and worse for older, sicker people.”

Indeed, the fundamental problem at the heart of the GOP’s replacement conundrum is that health care in the US is expensive, and health care for sick people is especially expensive.

One thing Obamacare tried to do was prevent so much of these costs from falling on sick people — by spreading them around to healthy people (by way of regulating how much insurers can charge and what benefits they must provide) and by having the government spend more too.

Now, Republicans have at least a reasonably good case that Obamacare’s individual markets aren’t working well, with insurers pulling out of some areas and costs rising to the point where many healthy people are less likely to find insurance worth their while. Some sort of fix appears to be necessary.

The GOP’s preferred reforms generally involve rolling back Obamacare’s regulations so that insurers have more flexibility to sell different types of insurance products and charge different rates.

But the devil will be in the details. How big should the tax credit be? How much should it vary for different populations (for instance, should it vary by age or income)? What, if any, policy tools will be used to encourage young and healthy people to get insured? Just how many regulations on what products insurers can sell will be rolled back? And if regulations are rolled back, how will the GOP’s replacement avert an outcome in which sick people are charged exorbitant rates or denied coverage altogether?

There are no easy answers to any of these questions. And when Republicans do release a real bill, the Congressional Budget Office will be waiting to issue its estimates on who would lose out from it.

5) Just how committed are they to this thing, anyway?

When Democrats tackled health reform in 2009, expanding health coverage had been a core value of their party for decades. As mentioned above, that was helpful because it helped them clarify their goals for the legislation.

But another important consequence of that is that many in the Democratic coalition, from the president on down, deeply believed they were doing something good that would help people.

Because of that, Democrats were willing to make sacrifices and take risks. So when Tea Party protests swept the nation and it became clear that the Affordable Care Act would be a really tough vote, many Democrats even in moderate states and districts turned out to be willing to walk the plank.

Republicans have gotten a lot of mileage out of criticizing Obamacare. The party is enthusiastic about, in broad terms, cutting taxes, regulations, and government spending.

But health policy specifically has never particularly inspired the GOP coalition. There’s a reason why, in the nearly seven years since Obamacare became law, the party has never managed to get together a consensus replacement plan.

For many, the commitment to repealing Obamacare is only slogan-deep. Accordingly, there’s already a sense of exhaustion and frustration among some Republicans on the Hill who would much rather focus on cutting taxes but instead feel like they’re stuck in an Obamacare mess.

So what happens after a wave of new protests at town halls? What happens if the GOP’s bill gets a bad CBO score? What happens if President Trump derails the process with a tweet?

Will Republicans find the fortitude to keep on pushing ahead — or will they back away?We run down what is known and unknown about today's attack in Ottawa, the verdict in the trial of Blackwater contractors for murders in Iraq, and the debate over Amazon.A day after President Barack Obama imposed sanctions against two Russian intelligence services and expelled 35 Russian operatives from the country in retaliation for allegedly trying to influence the U.S. election, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that he would not respond in kind, going against the recommendations of Russian foreign minister Sergey V. Lavrov, and suggesting that he is waiting on warmer relations with incoming president Donald Trump.

“We will not create any problems for US diplomats. We will not expel anyone,” Putin said in an English-language statement posted on the Kremlin’s Web site, going on to invite the children of American diplomats in Russia to celebrate New Year’s and Russian Orthodox Christmas at the Kremlin with him. “It is regrettable that the Obama Administration is ending its term in this manner. Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, also denied on Friday reports that Russia would close the Anglo-American School of Moscow. “Apparently, the White House has totally lost it and is starting to invent sanctions against their own children,” Zakharova said in a Facebook post. “It is a lie.”

Referring to the actions taken by President Obama as those of “the outgoing U.S. administration,” Putin made it clear that he is holding back from retaliatory actions in expectation of friendlier diplomatic relations when Trump takes over the White House on January 20. “As it proceeds from international practice, Russia has reasons to respond in kind. Although we have the right to retaliate, we will not resort to irresponsible ‘kitchen’ diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration,” the Russian president said. Or, as Putin spokesman Dmitry S. Peskov said Thursday, “We proceed from the premise that these decisions were taken by President Obama, and that in three weeks Donald Trump will be the new head of state.”

By holding back from retaliating, Putin is acting as if he has the upper hand—simultaneously embarrassing Obama and giving Trump an opening to restore relations between the two countries, as he has signaled he will. “This is a perfect step because it makes Obama’s administration look very weak and it opens a new page in relations with Trump,” Vladimir Frolov, an international affairs expert, told The New York Times. “Moscow wanted Trump to have a room to maneuver, this decision is a clear gesture of good will toward him.”

Obama’s decision to impose sanctions on Russia has put Trump in a awkward position. The president-elect, who campaigned in part on improving relations with Russia, has repeatedly denied or dismissed the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Putin was behind efforts to influence the U.S. election by launching cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign earlier this year—hacks which led to the publication of thousands of stolen documents and months of negative press for Hillary Clinton. “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump said in a terse statement Thursday in response to Obama’s retaliatory measures. Trump also promised to “meet with members of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of the situation,” although he has already been briefed on the evidence of Russian election meddling and cast doubt on it anyway. (Russia has denied any involvement in hacking the election.) On Friday, Trump responded to Putin’s gesture in a tweet, praising the Russian president. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!” he said. (As of Friday afternoon, Trump had “pinned” the tweet, ensuring that it remains on top of his feed.)

Several Republican senators have joined Democratic lawmakers in expressing concern over the extensive ties between members of Trump’s inner circle and Russia. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort previously served as a consultant to Pro-Russian groups in Ukraine, where he aided then president Viktor Yanukovych before his ouster. Trump’s national-security-adviser, retired Army general Michael Flynn, flew to Moscow last year to attend a banquet for the state-controlled media organization Russia Today, where he sat at the head table next to Putin. ExxonMobil C.E.O. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee to lead the State Department, has major financial ties to Russia, has been a vocal advocate for lifting the economic sanctions the Obama administration imposed in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and in 2012 was personally awarded by Putin with the Russian Order of Friendship.

Republican senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio, among others, have called for investigations into Russia’s alleged involvement in this year’s cyber-attacks and have said they may break with the G.O.P. over TIllerson’s confirmation. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan even praised Obama’s sanctions against Russia this week. “While today’s action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,” he said in a statement. “And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Trump has promised to improve relations with Putin and Russia, but he may do so at the risk of angering and alienating members of his own party in the Senate.Before former President Obama left office, he made a last-ditch effort to protect Planned Parenthood’s state funding from conservative governors and state legislatures that might seek to take it away.

But Republicans in Congress are working to block that effort using an obscure law called the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress fast-track a resolution to disapprove of new federal agency rules within 60 days of their passage.

On Thursday, the House voted 230-188 to overturn a rule Obama signed in December that would prohibit discriminating against family planning providers for reasons other than the quality of care they offer.

The resolution of disapproval now moves to the Senate, where it will probably pass because it only requires a simple 51-vote majority, and President Trump will probably sign it, since he supports defunding Planned Parenthood.

To be clear, this vote isn’t about the big federal “defund Planned Parenthood” bill that Republicans have promised to pass at the same time as they repeal the Affordable Care Act. That bill, which has yet to be introduced, would block Planned Parenthood from accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicaid reimbursements.

This action is less sweeping, but it also affects more than just Planned Parenthood. It deals with how states can spend federal grant money on other low-income family planning providers, too. Rather than eliminating all federal Planned Parenthood funding nationwide, this is more about giving states the option to deny public funds to Planned Parenthood, and to other family planning clinics like it.

It’s also not about protecting states from being “forced” to fund Planned Parenthood, as some reporting has suggested. The rule Obama signed in December, and that Republicans are now poised to overturn, was about reinforcing existing law and about protecting the integrity of the nation’s safety net for family planning services.

This is the key thing to understand about what Republicans are doing by overturning Obama’s rule. Yes, they’re empowering some states to defund Planned Parenthood and similar providers, partially, if they choose. But that’s only part of the story. “Defunding” Planned Parenthood in this particular way can cause a devastating domino effect on the larger health care network that low-income women rely on for birth control.

Obama’s rule deals with Title X, one of Planned Parenthood’s two major sources of public funding

The Republican Party has been waging war against Planned Parenthood’s public funding for years now, because they object to the fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortions. Even though federal tax dollars don’t pay for Planned Parenthood’s abortion services, Republicans claim that funding other health care services at the organization indirectly helps fund abortion.

In practice, however, defunding Planned Parenthood takes funding away from its mostly low-income patients — who might be forced to seek care elsewhere if the government stopped subsidizing their visits to Planned Parenthood, and who might face delays and worse care elsewhere if other clinics get overbooked from trying to take on Planned Parenthood’s former patients.

Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million annually from the federal government. That money pays for specific health services — things like birth control, cervical cancer screening, or STI prevention, but not abortion — for people who couldn’t afford them otherwise.

Most of the funds (75 percent) are actually reimbursements from Medicaid, the US’s public health insurance program for the poor. Just like with any other insurance, Medicaid patients go to their health care appointment first and then have Medicaid pay all or most of the bill later.

The rest of Planned Parenthood’s federal funds come from Title X, the nation’s only federal family planning program. It serves 4 million low-income people every year, about a third through Planned Parenthood. Many Title X patients can’t qualify for Medicaid but still make so little money that they need subsidies for birth control and other family planning services. About half of Title X patients are women of color, and many young women rely on Title X because it protects their privacy.

Title X funds are competitive grants; they are awarded to the best-qualified health providers that are best suited to meet a community’s specific needs.

Every state awards the grants differently. The grants might go to state and local health departments, hospitals, family planning councils, or nonprofits like Planned Parenthood. Then those grantees choose a network of health care providers to work with and help them provide services.

When Planned Parenthood affiliates and clinics earn Title X grants, it’s because they have proven they can administer better care than other local providers.

But 13 states have decided to “defund” Planned Parenthood by finding creative ways to bar the organization from receiving Title X funds — no matter how much more qualified it is to make use of those funds than other providers in the area.

Obama’s rule told states they can’t deny family planning grants to Planned Parenthood just because it provides abortions

At the time Obama signed the new rule, the Health and Human Services Department said that 13 states kicked Planned Parenthood out of their Title X network just because it offers abortions — not for any reason related to its ability to provide Title X health services.

These state restrictions worked in different ways. Some states banned Planned Parenthood, specifically, from getting any grant money. Some of them gave priority to public entities, which was a more indirect way of excluding Planned Parenthood since it’s a private nonprofit.

Either way, according to HHS, the result was a decrease in health services overall, and especially in geographic areas where adequate health care options were more limited.

None of this was actually supposed to happen under federal law. Title X grants were only supposed to be awarded based on how well a provider could offer Title X services. If Planned Parenthood didn’t offer a full range of birth control options, that might be a reason to deny it a Title X grant. Whether or not it uses separate funds, not supported in any way by Title X, to provide abortions should be irrelevant.

But some states still used the Title X program to discriminate against Planned Parenthood anyway. And those efforts even sometimes withstood court challenges.

That’s why Obama signed the new rule in the first place — to make absolutely clear, to both states and courts, that Title X grants are not to be used as proxies in the abortion wars.

It’s not totally clear what would happen if Congress didn’t overturn the rule. Would all of those 13 states have had to change their laws? Maybe, maybe not. But HHS expected the rule to potentially “reverse” the service reductions and deteriorated outcomes that had resulted from those states’ actions.

Title X is much bigger than Planned Parenthood — but it also needs Planned Parenthood in order to function well

Title X is a network. The grant program supports a wide array of health care providers — not just Planned Parenthood and other nonprofit family planning clinics, but also hospitals, community health centers, and local health departments — that provide family planning services to low-income people at reduced or no cost.

Together, Title X and Medicaid combine to form our nation’s family planning safety net. That safety net helped prevent 1.9 million unintended pregnancies in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and without it the rates of unplanned birth and abortion would have each been 68 percent higher.

Research from the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that studies reproductive health issues, shows Planned Parenthood plays a pivotal role in the family planning safety net that can’t easily be replaced.

For instance, because it specializes in reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood is usually much better at providing birth control than other clinics that focus on primary care:

And in many areas of the country, Planned Parenthood is the only nearby place where low-income women can get subsidized birth control:

When they argue to defund Planned Parenthood, Republicans usually insist that women’s health care would not suffer as a result. They say that Planned Parenthood’s public funding can simply be diverted somewhere else — to the nation’s many community health centers, for instance, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide.

But while many community health centers offer high-quality care, there is just no way that most of them could take on Planned Parenthood’s patients if the organization shut down. They don’t have the capacity; they often struggle just to accommodate the patients they already have, and it would take years of capacity building for more money to actually solve that problem.

And that’s if Republicans actually keep their promises to divert Planned Parenthood’s funding elsewhere. That often doesn’t happen. And when it does, it often doesn’t work.

After Republican lawmakers in Kansas kicked Planned Parenthood out of the state’s Title X program by restricting the grants to public entities in 2011, the number of patients seen in Title X–funded health centers in Kansas dropped dramatically, from 38,461 patients in 2011 to just 24,047 in 2015.

When Republican lawmakers in Texas kicked Planned Parenthood out of the state’s Women’s Health Program in 2013, other providers didn’t step up to fill in the gaps. Women just got less health care. In areas that had been served by Planned Parenthood before defunding, prescriptions for the most effective forms of birth control plummeted by a third, and women on Medicaid had 27 percent more births than normal.

The success of the Title X program as a whole depends significantly on Planned Parenthood’s ability to participate in it. Think of the Title X network as a sweater with pink stripes, where the stripes are Planned Parenthood. If you hate pink and try to yank the stripes out of the sweater, you risk unraveling the whole thing. And in the best-case scenario, you just get a sweater that’s full of holes and doesn’t keep you nearly as warm anymore.

Republicans tell women they can “go somewhere else” if Planned Parenthood is defunded. But they keep trying to defund the “somewhere elses,” too.

The Title X program is woefully underfunded as it is, and for six years the Republican-dominated Congress has refused to increase its budget for delivering services — even as the need for subsidized birth control went up.

And that’s after Republicans have been forced to compromise by Democrats in the Senate. In every budget House Republicans have proposed over the past seven years, they have called for the total elimination of Title X funding.

There’s a cruel irony in this. Again, because many Republicans don’t want to be seen as actively hostile to women’s health, they often claim that women could just “go somewhere else” for reproductive health care if their local Planned Parenthood shut down due to defunding.

Usually, the “somewhere else” Republicans praise the most is our nation’s vast network of thousands of federally qualified health centers and other publicly funded health care providers.

But that network is funded by Title X, the program that Republicans keep trying to weaken by kicking Planned Parenthood out of it — or eliminate entirely.

Anti-abortion Republicans sometimes act like abortion is so morally toxic that any money flowing anywhere near it becomes tainted. Title X’s family planning services, it seems, are tainted by Planned Parenthood, because Planned Parenthood is tainted by its abortion care — never mind that this care isn’t paid for by tax dollars.

This obsession with financial “purity” means that contraception and other family planning services get thrown under the bus.

Some Republicans may think that contraception itself is a moral evil; others may just think it’s acceptable collateral damage in the war on abortion. A few Republicans want no part in a messy funding fight. Still others may really believe their own unlikely story about how if Planned Parenthood went out of business, women could just go somewhere else for care.

But in today’s Republican Party, the moral imperative to stamp out public funding for Planned Parenthood has completely trumped the moral imperative to make sure low-income women, and men, can get comprehensive reproductive health care.7 Cards

Card 1 of 7 The Baltimore protests erupted after Freddie Gray's mysterious death Baltimore was roiled by weeks of tense protests after the April 19 death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died of a spinal cord injury while in police custody. Gray's death and the protests it inspired once again placed a national spotlight on issues of race, justice, police brutality, and the deep distrust between minority communities and their local governments. The protests came about almost immediately following Gray's death, as demonstrators marched to demand answers for what happened to the 25-year-old and to protest police brutality, of which Baltimore has a troubling history. The situation escalated as local authorities refused to release details in their investigation into Gray's death. Riots broke out on April 27, after Gray's funeral, drawing nationwide attention — and even comments from President Barack Obama — over the crumbling situation in the city. But on May 1, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced criminal charges, including second-degree murder and manslaughter, against the six officers involved in Gray's arrest. The announcement calmed tensions in the city, as protesters felt that one of their main goals had been reached. (Ultimately, however, none of the charges stuck.) Much of the anger during protests was focused on the lack of answers surrounding Gray's death, which persisted for weeks. As the investigation dragged on, many people felt that the local government and police were engaging in a cover-up to hide how Gray received the spinal cord injury that killed him and whether the officers that arrested him caused it. But the protests and riots in Baltimore are also part of a much broader national debate about systemic problems that have existed for decades. The protests are specifically about one man in a very troubled neighborhood that gets a disproportionate amount of attention from police, but they also seek to bring attention to the police brutality that all too often afflicts black men in the US.

Card 2 of 7 Freddie Gray died after he suffered a fatal neck injury in a police van Freddie Gray suffered a fatal spinal cord injury on April 12 when he was tossed around the back of a police van. He was shackled by his hands and feet but unrestrained by a seatbelt, which meant he couldn't protect himself from the impact as he crashed into the interior of the vehicle. An autopsy report, which was obtained by the Baltimore Sun's Justin Fenton, found Gray likely received the injury when the van suddenly decelerated. He died a week later, on April 19. On May 1, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced that the death had been ruled a homicide by a medical examiner. Mosby announced 28 criminal charges, including second-degree murder and manslaughter, against the six officers involved in Gray's arrest. A grand jury on May 21 indicted all six officers for Gray's death. But none of the charges stuck in court. Gray was arrested for allegedly possessing a switchblade, but Mosby said Gray's knife wasn't a switchblade and was therefore legal. According to a timeline provided by Mosby, Gray fled at the sight of police presence in an area of town known for drug dealing. Police pursued Gray, eventually catching up and restraining him on the ground. Officers then arrested Gray after they noticed a knife on him. Video footage of the arrest showed officers dragging Gray, who is screaming in apparent pain, to a police van. Police don't use force in the video, but the recording started after the officers already had Gray in custody. One of the people who recorded the arrest, Kevin Moore, described the scene to the Baltimore Sun's Catherine Rentz, claiming that police folded Gray like "origami," contradicting claims that officers peacefully restrained him. "The officer had their knee in his neck. And he was just screaming — screaming for life," Moore said. "He couldn't breathe. He needed an asthma pump, which he let them know… They ignored it." Police transported Gray to the station in a van, in which he reportedly experienced a medical emergency as a result of his neck injury and was eventually transferred to trauma care. Gray wasn't wearing a seat belt while riding in the van, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed in a press conference on April 24. "No excuses for that, period," he said. At several points, Gray pleaded for medical care — including an inhaler for his asthma — but police ignored him. One of the officers thought Gray was faking his injury, according to the Baltimore Sun's Justin George. But Batts said at an April 20 press conference that there were multiple occasions when police should have called medics but didn't, and those failures have prompted a review of police policies to ensure detainees get medical care when they need it. The police van reportedly stopped at least four times before Gray was sent to trauma care — once to place leg shackles on Gray, and later to pick up another detainee, who was separated from Gray by a metal barrier in the back of the van. Combined, the details exposed by Mosby's investigation suggest that Gray shouldn't have been arrested, and the officers involved in Gray's arrest were, at best, negligent and, at worst, abusive.

Card 4 of 7 Baltimore has a troubled history with police brutality The outrage surrounding Freddie Gray's death is rooted in concerns about how cops handle themselves in the city. Not only have police allegedly abused other detainees in their custody, but they have hurt people by placing them in vans without seat belts — similar to what Gray went through, suffering some sort of medical emergency in a police van while not buckled in, then being rushed to the hospital. The Baltimore Police Department has long been subject to allegations of brutality. A September 2014 report by the Baltimore Sun's Mark Puente found that the city had paid about $5.7 million since 2011 to more than 100 people — most of whom were black — who claimed that officers had beaten them. Some of the allegations are truly deplorable, as Vox's Ezra Klein explained: Before Freddie Gray, there was Starr Brown, who was pregnant and walking up the front steps of her home when two girls were attacked on the street. By the time the cops came, the attackers were gone — but Brown, inside her home, could hear the police berating the women who had been attacked. Brown, angry, demanded the cops chase down the attackers rather than yelling at the victims. An argument began, and the police tried to arrest Brown. She grabbed a nearby railing, screaming that she was pregnant. "They slammed me down on my face," Brown later said. "The skin was gone on my face." The city paid Brown $125,000. Police didn't admit fault in the cases, instead paying for the settlements, the local police union said, to avoid the higher costs of full-blown lawsuits. But the high number of cases and payouts has fed a perception that police officers in Baltimore are corrupt and violent — and these 100 cases likely cover a small fraction of the overall complaints in the city. Baltimore police have also been accused of taking people in "rough rides" in which handcuffed detainees are driven in a reckless manner while they're not wearing seat belts — all to purposely cause injuries. The Baltimore Sun's Puente and Doug Donovan documented several cases in which people were injured in police vans, some of whom won lawsuits against the city. One of them, a 27-year-old assistant librarian who was arrested following a noise complaint, described the experience: "They were braking really short so that I would slam against the wall, and they were taking really wide, fast turns. I couldn't brace myself. I was terrified." Leadership in the Baltimore Police Department has vowed to prevent this kind of behavior. "We will not let officers get away with any wrongdoing," Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez, who joined the agency in January 2013 to lead the new Professional Standards and Accountability Bureau, told the Baltimore Sun. "It will not be tolerated." But many residents and protesters in Baltimore feel the reform and accountability processes have been slow-moving, feeding into the anger that eventually culminated in protests and riots following Gray's death.

Card 5 of 7 Life expectancy in different Baltimore neighborhoods can vary by decades Baltimore suffers from vast economic disparities that have left many of the city's residents without jobs and with even shorter lifespans. "Only six miles separate the Baltimore neighborhoods of Roland Park and Hollins Market," John Hopkins University's Jonathan Bagger explained, "but there is a 20-year difference in the average life expectancy." Take the Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park area, which Freddie Gray called home. A February 2015 report by the Justice Policy Institute and Prison Policy Initiative found that more than half the residents of the Baltimore neighborhood at the center of ongoing unrest didn't have jobs between 2008 and 2012, and nearly one-third of the residential properties in the area were vacant or abandoned in 2012. The report also found the neighborhood had a median household income level ($24,006) that's far lower than the median in Baltimore ($40,803), and a violent crime rate (23 per 1,000 residents) that tops the city average (14.1 per 1,000 residents). These numbers speak to problems in Baltimore that run far deeper than the police treatment of Gray. They expose a city and neighborhoods that have been failed not just by the police, but also by local, state, and federal governments at large.

Card 6 of 7 At the center of the Baltimore protests: racial disparities in the criminal justice system The protests over Freddie Gray's death in Baltimore were part of the "Black Lives Matter" movement that has become prominent since the police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri. Since Brown's death, the rallying call of Black Lives Matter has been pushed in protests over several other police killings — of Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina. These deaths and others have fed into the idea in black communities that their own — even their own sons — could be the next victims of police brutality. An analysis of the available FBI data by Vox's Dara Lind found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete because it's based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force. Black teens were 21 times as likely as white teens to be shot and killed by police between 2010 and 2012, according to a ProPublica analysis of the FBI data. ProPublica's Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, and Eric Sagara reported: "One way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica's analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring — 185, more than one per week." Some researchers have suggested that subconscious racial biases are behind the disparities. Studies show officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor, who conducted the research, said it's possible the bias could lead to more skewed outcomes in the field. "In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training," he said, "we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them." The racial disparities in the criminal justice system go beyond police use of force. Black people are much more likely to be arrested for drugs, even though they're not more likely to use drugs or sell them. And black inmates make up a disproportionate amount of the prison population. The disparities have driven many in minority communities to distrust and fear law enforcement — out of concern that they or their sons could be the next victims. For them, the only way to speak out against these perceived injustices is protest — and, for those who feel truly desperate, violence.We, the undersigned mental health professionals (please state your degree), believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And we respectfully request he be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th amendment to the Constitution, which states that the president will be replaced if he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”In late January, acting Attorney General Sally Yates delivered a startling message to the Trump administration: National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to other top White House officials about his dealings with the Russian ambassador to the US and was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Kremlin.

Now those lies have cost Flynn his job: On Monday night, Flynn resigned amid growing questions about whether he had misled Vice President Mike Pence, and potentially the FBI, about his phone calls with the Russian envoy on December 29, the same day the Obama administration slapped new sanctions on Moscow for its interference in the 2016 presidential elections.

In his resignation letter, Flynn said "the fast pace of events" during the transition meant that he had "inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador." Flynn’s letter didn’t include any further details about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian diplomat.

Flynn had long denied discussing sanctions in his call with Kislyak, but US officials had told the Washington Post and New York Times that Flynn explicitly talked about the sanctions and hinted that Trump might be willing to lift them. That kind of conversation could be a violation of an obscure federal law, the Logan Act, which prohibits people outside the executive branch from making foreign policy on behalf of the US administration.

No one has ever been prosecuted under the Logan Act, but Flynn is facing a second and potentially far more dangerous investigation. The FBI is actively probing his interactions with Kislyak, and resigning from his White House post won’t shield Flynn from potential future criminal prosecution.

Until late Monday night, it wasn’t clear if Flynn’s lies would be enough to force Trump’s hand. On Monday afternoon, White House aide Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC that Flynn "does enjoy the full confidence of the president," while CNN’s Jim Acosta reported that Pence and Flynn had buried the hatchet. Shortly after Conway spoke, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer put out a written statement that conspicuously avoiding giving a vote of confidence to Flynn and instead said, ominously, that "the president is evaluating the situation."

Just hours later, Flynn was gone, replaced at least temporarily by retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, who had served as his chief of staff. The Washington Post reported late Monday night that Kellogg was a finalist for the post along with former CIA Director David Petraeus and Vice Adm. Robert Hayward, a former deputy commander of the Pentagon’s Central Command.

It’s not a reassuring sign when an administration that has been in office for less than a month has to replace its national security adviser, a tacit admission that the new president bungled one of his first major personnel choices. Flynn, though, had been particularly ill-suited to his post, with a personality and temperament that magnified many of Trump’s worst flaws.

Derek Chollet, who held a variety of senior posts during the Obama administration, said Flynn had been "off to the roughest start of any national security adviser in history," but cautioned that his firing wouldn’t be enough to fix all that ails the White House.

"Presidents get the national security process that fits their styles," he said. "Given that erraticism and improvisation seem intrinsic to Trump, I expect that to remain the same regardless of who is sitting in the West Wing."

Put another way, Flynn’s ouster could be a temporary boost for a White House adrift. Whether it’s a permanent one depends on the president himself.

Flynn shared many of Trump’s worst flaws. That’s not a good thing for a national security adviser to do.

Flynn had seemed like a dead man walking for a long time.

In the weeks before the Russia scandal, a series of leaks suggested that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo had lost confidence in Flynn and were holding private meetings expressly designed to exclude him. In a move first reported by Politico, the CIA — with Pompeo’s blessing --- blocked a key Flynn aide from receiving the high-level security clearance he needed to work on the National Security Council (NSC).

Staffers on the NSC, meanwhile, had been privately telling reporters that Flynn wasn’t fulfilling one of the most important part of his job: making sure complex national security policy changes moves were vetted with Cabinet members and other key officials before being presented to the president. Other NSC staffers had begun using encrypted communications because of fears that Flynn and his deputies were monitoring their cellphones and emails to find leakers.

Still, Trump didn’t seem to be in any rush to fire a trusted loyalist who had won a place in his inner circle during the campaign by vigorously defending Trump’s national security bona fides and sharply attacking Hillary Clinton. Flynn went so far as to lead crowds of Republicans at the GOP convention in Cleveland in chants of, "Lock her up," shocking many of his former military colleagues. When Flynn got his new post, two retired officers told me in separate interviews that they considered him to be "unhinged."

In part, that’s because of Flynn’s worldview, which closely aligns with some of the most unsettling parts of Trump’s. As my colleague Zack Beauchamp and I have written, Flynn "swims in the same swamp of hyperpartisan, frequently fabricated, and disturbingly anti-Muslim rhetoric" as Trump and the president’s powerful chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Flynn’s tweets include a video that claims "Islam … wants 80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated," which he captioned "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL."

That means Flynn had been amplifying — rather than moderating — Trump’s anti-Muslim leanings, a belief system that helped bring about the controversial executive order temporarily halting all immigration and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations.

Flynn is believed to have helped fuel Trump’s skepticism about the intelligence community, which he likened to Nazis and publicly mocked for concluding that Russia had tried to interfere in the elections to ensure Trump’s victory.

Flynn was also, if anything, more unsettlingly pro-Putin than his boss, a dynamic that has been visible since the campaign. Flynn has spoken very positively about the prospect of partnering with Putin’s regime to fight terrorism, and repeatedly appeared on Russia’s English-language propaganda outlet, RT. Flynn was so in with RT that he had been paid to give a speech at its 10th anniversary dinner in Moscow — where he sat at the head table with Putin himself.

Flynn’s departure is an opportunity for Trump — if he takes it

Guessing how long Flynn was going to keep his job had become a popular Washington parlor game (my money had, as it turned out correctly, been on him being out by the spring). The next parlor game will be about who replaces him.

Lost in the chaos that has surrounded the first weeks of the Trump administration is that the new president’s national security team is actually quite good. Mattis is beloved inside the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, while Tillerson has strong support from centrist Republican foreign policy experts like former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Flynn was widely seen as the weak link, an ideologue willing to go to war with the US intelligence community and to publicly criticize the Pentagon’s top generals. He had a toxic relationship with Mattis and Pompeo, and the New York Times recently reported that Trump himself was souring on Flynn "because of his sometimes overbearing demeanor" and for "presiding over a chaotic and opaque NSC transition process."

Trump now has the chance to reboot the national security side of his floundering administration and replace the divisive Flynn with a more moderate and well-regarded figure capable of working productively with Mattis and other powerful officials. The question, as always, is what the new president will choose to do with it.Donald Trump’s campaign chair Paul Manafort has officially resigned — after trying to fix the campaign for two months.

Trump announced the news on Friday morning:

This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign. I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.

As my colleague Andrew Prokop explained, Manafort originally came into the Trump campaign to try to bring discipline and professionalism after campaign manager Corey Lewandowski failed to do either.

But the campaign continued to struggle under Manafort. At one point, Trump earned weeks of negative attention after suggesting that a federal judge should recuse himself from the Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage. And after the convention, Trump got into a bizarre feud with the family of a fallen Muslim veteran.

Meanwhile, Manafort himself has become a story because of his extensive ties to Russian interests. On August 14, the New York Times reported on a ledger documenting $12.7 million in payments to Manafort from the party of Ukraine's pro-Russian president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych. Coupled with Trump’s weirdly pro-Russian leanings, that news raised a lot of eyebrows.

In Manafort's place, Trump recently hired Steve Bannon, CEO of the ultra-conservative website Breitbart News, as the new "chief executive" of the campaign.

Bannon will face a huge challenge in trying to turn things around. Trump’s campaign is wildly behind Hillary Clinton in the polls. It was not supposed to be this way: As Vox’s election model shows, political science models suggests this was supposed to be a winning year for Republicans, but Trump is costing the party nearly 6 points — a fatal gap for a presidential candidate.

Watch: This election isn’t just Democrat vs. Republican. It’s normal vs. abnormal.Video

WASHINGTON — The newly minted education secretary, Betsy DeVos, fled a small group of protesters outside a middle school here on Friday, at one point hiding in her sport utility vehicle as a man wielded a cardboard sign, before she finally entered.

Video of the odd episode at Jefferson Middle School Academy from a local television station showed a handful of people heckling and following Ms. DeVos as she tried to enter the school. She turned away with a man escorting her as one demonstrator shouted, “Go back! Shame, shame.”

The exchange could be the first of many such encounters as protesters and opponents of Ms. DeVos say they plan to remind her of the fierce opposition she faced throughout her nomination process and continues to face as she weighs sweeping policies, such as encouraging private school vouchers. Activists have said they would protest her at every opportunity, including during school visits.

Her response to the protesters on Friday could encourage more.

“We will unleash our activists in a way that I don’t think any secretary of education has ever experienced,” said Heidi Hess, a campaign manager for Credo, a mobile phone company with a liberal activist arm. “If she holds field hearings, we will make sure we pack them with activists. If she travels for meetings or if she visits schools, we will confront her with protesters and have people lined up to ask her questions.”

As word spread that Ms. DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, had been blocked from entering the school, Arne Duncan, a former education secretary under President Barack Obama, weighed in.

Ms. DeVos eventually made it into the school and later told reporters the school was “awesome.”

“It was really wonderful to visit this school, and I look forward to many visits of many great public schools, both in D.C. and around the country,” Ms. DeVos said. “Thanks very much.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington also said that the city wants Ms. DeVos to visit its schools.

Democrats have expressed concern about contributions by Ms. DeVos’s family to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people; her donations to Republicans and their causes, which she agreed have totaled about $200 million over the years; and her past statements that government “sucks” and that public schools are a “dead end.”

Education unions and activists flooded senators with emails and phone calls urging them to vote against Ms. DeVos. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Democrats in voting against her. Vice President Mike Pence had to cast a tiebreaking vote to get Ms. DeVos confirmed.As the White House staff tries to put together a budget for President Donald Trump, they face a fundamental problem. Trump has promised to cut taxes, increase spending on the military and infrastructure, and avoid cuts to Social Security and Medicare. The only way to do that without producing an exploding budget deficit is to assume a big increase in economic growth.

And Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal reports that Trump is planning to do just that — by making things up.

Deep into his story about Trump budget hijinks, Timiraos reveals that “what’s unusual about the administration’s forecasts isn’t just their relative optimism but also the process by which they were derived.” Specifically, what’s unusual about them is that they weren’t derived by any process at all. Instead of letting economists build a forecast, Trump’s budget was put together with “transition officials telling the CEA staff the growth targets that their budget would produce and asking them to backfill other estimates off those figures.”

Trump is assuming much faster economic growth

Staff has been ordered to project that inflation-adjusted growth will average between 3 and 3.5 percent over the next decade, eventually settling at around 3.2 percent.

That’s drastically higher than the estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve, both of which see the economy growing at a bit less than 2 percent. The make-believe reasoning the administration is giving for this is that “a regulatory rollback and a tax-code revamp will unleash growth that drives a recovery in productivity, sends business investment higher and draws idled workers back to the labor force.”

At the same time, however, it’s projecting that an uptick in economic growth won’t lead to higher interest rates, “because the U.S. would become a more attractive place to park money.”

This is, in a mechanical sense, the correct way to backfill the numbers. If you want to assume a huge acceleration in growth, the way do it is to assume a productivity boom that increases both wages and the size of the labor force without leading to higher interest rates. And in sum, Trump ends up assuming an economy that, 10 years from now, is 17 percent larger than the current CBO estimate. Since Trump is assuming GDP will be much higher, that naturally means the deficit as a share of GDP will be much lower.

The White House is passing a hot potato to Congress

It’s customary for the White House to produce a budget forecast that is a bit rosier than what Congress, the Federal Reserve, or private sector forecasts generate. It’s unusually for it to be so wildly at odds with the consensus.

That’s in part because most presidents lack Trump’s shamelessness. Another part is that most presidents would worry that if you order CEA staff to make up fake numbers, they will leak that to the Wall Street Journal.

But perhaps the biggest part is that normally presidents are trying, on some level, to work with Congress to get things done. Congress needs to use Congressional Budget Office numbers when legislating, so a fake White House forecast doesn’t help a president’s allies on the Hill. In effect, Trump is simply tossing congressional Republicans a hot potato — telling them that he is disavowing responsibility for any of the trade-offs inherent in governing, and that the responsibility is all on them to work things out.

Watch: Covering a White House that isn't afraid to liePresident Trump’s bizarre, rambling news conference hit an unrivaled low at the mention of an issue that’s continually defined the president down: race.

April Ryan, a black reporter with American Urban Radio Networks in Baltimore, asked Trump if he plans to meet and work with the Congressional Black Caucus — a perfectly legitimate question from a political reporter. His answer was not so legitimate.

Immediately, Trump treated Ryan as if she were personally aligned with the Congressional Black Caucus — even as she insisted that she’s “just a reporter.”

Here’s the exchange:

RYAN: When you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner-city agenda? TRUMP: Am I going to include who? RYAN: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus? TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what: Do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting? RYAN: No, no, no. I’m just a reporter. TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? Set up the meeting. RYAN: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now — TRUMP: Let’s go. Set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great.

The moment is just one example of a critique Trump has faced repeatedly: He genuinely seems to view black people as a monolithic “other” — a group of people who work and behave in exactly similar ways. Not only does this seem to define an entire group of people down to a lowest common denominator, but it’s also simply dehumanizing to treat individuals as only part of a bigger group.

In the press conference, Trump was generally combative with reporters, patronizing them with bizarre comments about nuclear weapons (“You know what uranium is, right? It’s this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like lots of things are done with uranium. Including some bad things.”) and calling reports about his ties to Russia “fake news.”

But the exchange with April Ryan was different. It fits a pattern he’s demonstrated multiple times since he launched his campaign for president. For example, he repeatedly referred to black people with a “the” before he mentioned them — saying “the African Americans” and “the blacks.” As linguist Lynne Murphy of the University of Sussex explained at Quartz, there is a purpose, albeit one Trump may not be totally aware of, to this:

“The” makes the group seem like it’s a large, uniform mass, rather than a diverse group of individuals. This is the key to “othering”: treating people from another group as less human than one’s own group. The Nazis did it when they talked about die Juden (“the Jews”). Homophobes do it when they talk about “the gays.” … I doubt it’s an accident that Trump talks about ethnic groups in the same way that we talk about foreign governments and armies. If that “the” treats ethnic groups as some monolithic cabal, that might ring true with the conspiracy-theory mind-set that characterizes some of his core audience — the audience that Trump has been priming to see and make trouble at polling places “in certain areas.”

Trump also seems convinced that all black people live in inner cities, which, despite living in an inner city himself, he has constantly described as hellholes. In his pitch to black voters during the campaign, for instance, Trump said, “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”

And he argued, “Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education, they have no jobs. I will do more for African Americans and Latinos than [Hillary Clinton] can ever do in 10 lifetimes. All she has done is talk to the African Americans and to the Latinos.”

What Trump is doing here is transcribing coded language — a dog whistle — in a literal manner. Time and time again, politicians have used “urban” and “inner city” as code for black people — and particularly when addressing black crime. Trump has simply mixed all of this code into a very literal interpretation, treating black people as a monolithic group living in cities riddled by crime and devoid of jobs and good schools.

While it is true that black Americans do disproportionately face economic hardship and higher crime as a result of centuries of systemic racism, pointing out such inequality is very different from saying that literally all black people face the exact same problems today.

Only by lumping all black people into this kind of monolithic group can one make sense of how Trump seems to think it’s okay to ask any random black person — even a reporter whose profession fundamentally demands some impartiality — to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus.

Never mind that black people of course live in rural areas, suburbs, exurbs, and, yes, cities, just like everyone else, and they are obviously a diverse group of people with different life experiences and beliefs. In the world of Trump, black Americans can be lumped into a few descriptors — “inner city,” “urban” — and maybe even all work for the Congressional Black Caucus.

Watch: 9 things it’s hard to believe the president just saidWednesday is the first day of Black History Month. Typically, presidents honor the day by talking about the many black heroes who have changed the course of American history — Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and many more.

Trump took a different approach. He did name some of these black heroes. But he also spent a lot of time talking about himself, how CNN is “fake news,” how much everyone loves him, and how he did so well with the black vote (which he lost by more than 10 to 1 to Hillary Clinton).

Take, for example, Trump’s comments about Martin Luther King:

Here is a transcript of President Trump's comments on Dr. Martin Luther King at his Black History Month gathering this morning. pic.twitter.com/qHq9i1Ligg — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) February 1, 2017

One sentence about how great Martin Luther King was, followed by 10 about how a journalist misreported a story about Trump. So when talking about one of the most important men in US history, Trump pivoted his speech to make it all about himself and how he’s so misunderstood by the media.

It doesn’t stop there. Later on in the speech, Trump again briefly mentioned King and other black heroes. Then he spent most of his time on a rant about how the “great friends and supporters” around him for the event have fought for him, including on TV, even as “hostile” and “fake news” outlets like CNN have gone after him — adding that “Fox has treated me very nice.”

This is a full transcript of President Trump's speech to his Black History Month event. pic.twitter.com/uJ9iXvUOGr — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) February 1, 2017

Trump later went on: “If you remember, I wasn’t going to do well with the African-American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting — I won’t go into details — but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.”

It’s unclear what Trump means here. He lost the black vote by quite a bit: According to exit polls, Clinton got 89 percent of the black vote, and Trump got 8 percent of it.

The broader point, however, is that Trump was given an opportunity to talk about Black History Month and he spent most of his time talking about himself and his own problems. (Of course, he left out all the accusations of racism that dogged him during his campaign — from saying a judge should recuse himself from a case because of his “Mexican heritage” to pushing for “stop and frisk,” an aggressive police tactic that was deemed unconstitutional because it was used in a racially biased way.)

This isn’t the first time Trump has done something like this. Last month, when he was asked about his heroes, he spent most of his response talking about himself and how he triumphed in the 2016 campaign despite all the odds against him:

Trump was asked if he has any heroes. Answer: https://t.co/3idRsQFQoN pic.twitter.com/yGyjx1q1Bl — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) January 16, 2017

This can all seem silly at some level, but it’s a seriously concerning character trait for a president. Presidents are supposed to feel the full weight of history and its heroes and villains — to learn from what they did, to gauge the consequences of the office’s actions, to keep himself in check, and so on. That Trump can’t even properly reflect on much of that history when he’s explicitly tasked with the opportunity to do so is a very bad sign.

Watch: How should the media cover a White House that isn’t afraid to lie?

Republicans have long been the party of racial conservatism. Since at least the 1960s, the GOP’s policies, rhetoric, and voters have been less supportive of minorities than have the Democrats’. These partisan differences over race have become especially pronounced during the Obama presidency.

But while white Republicans are more likely than white Democrats to express racially resentful beliefs, racial prejudice is thought to play a larger role in shaping the political preferences of liberals. In other words, racial politics has divided the Democratic Party’s diverse coalition more than it has splintered the overwhelmingly white Republican Party.

Those historical differences have also been present in the two parties’ presidential primaries. Vote choice in the 1984, 1988, 2008 and 2016 Democratic nominations, for example, were all sharply divided by race.

The Republican Party, however, has been more unified in recent decades around a “color-blind policy alliance,” which calls for a diminished role of race in public policies. With the notable exception of Pat Buchanan’s campaigns to preserve white cultural hegemony in the 1990s, few Republican candidates for president have attempted to directly distinguish themselves from their GOP rivals on matters of race and ethnicity.

Until now.

The campaign of the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, is sparking a surge in the number of citizenship applications and voter registrations among Hispanics fearful of his immigration policies. Since January, California alone has seen a boost of 218 percent in Democratic registration and among Hispanics, registration is up 123 percent. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)

Donald Trump’s presidential campaign effectively bucked what the political scientists Donald Kinder and Lynn Sanders adroitly termed the Republican Party’s electoral temptation of race — using implicit racial appeals to win over racially conservative voters without appearing overtly racist. Trump’s play instead was to make several explicitly hostile statements about minority groups.

Trump has been willing to go where most Republican presidential candidates haven’t. That might have made anti-minority sentiments a more potent force in the 2016 GOP primaries than in primaries past. That’s plausible, because campaign appeals to racial and ethnic anxieties have often succeeded in activating support for politicians.

And that’s exactly what the results below show.

In the first graph, I draw on data from the 2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP) and the 2012 CCAP, along with two combined YouGov surveys that were conducted in January and June 2016. The chart compares the relationship between racial resentment and support for the eventual Republican nominee among Republicans (including independent-leaning Republicans). Racial resentment measures beliefs that race-based inequality is due to cultural deficiencies in African American communities with statements like: “Blacks could be just as well off as whites if they only tried harder.”

Consistent with a number of other studies, the chart shows a strong relationship between anti-black attitudes and support for Trump. Republicans who scored highest on racial resentment were about 30 percentage points more likely to support Trump than their more moderate counterparts in the bottom quartile of the party in racial conservatism.

That pattern is noticeably different from 2008 and 2012, when racial conservatism had a slightly negative relationship with support for the eventual GOP nominees. The upshot is that Trump was significantly more popular among the most racially resentful Republican voters than were his immediate predecessors, John McCain and Mitt Romney.

A similar pattern emerges in the next graph, which considers attitudes about Muslims. Republicans with very unfavorable views of Muslims were substantially more likely than their fellow partisans to support Trump in both RAND’s Presidential Election Panel Survey and the 2016 American National Election Study Pilot Survey.

Attitudes toward Muslims were not a factor in the 2008 and 2012 Republican primaries. It appears, then, that Trump’s hostile policies and rhetoric regarding Islam helped make him much more popular than prior nominees among the roughly 30 percent of Republicans who have a very unfavorable opinion of Muslims.

Along with Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, his hawkish immigration positions of mass deportation, ending birthright citizenship, and making Mexico pay for a border wall provide perhaps his strongest contrast with prior GOP nominees. In that light, it’s not surprising that he performed much better than Romney and McCain with the substantial majority of Republicans (63 percent in the YouGov surveys) who want to deport unauthorized immigrants. That’s depicted in the graph below.



Note: 2016 analyses based on seven pooled YouGov/Economist Surveys from May 6-July 11.

To be sure, Trump is not the first presidential candidate whose support in the primaries was fueled by opposition to immigration. Buchanan, whose nativist presidential campaigns are frequently compared to Trump’s, also performed well among anti-immigrant Republicans.

The results below from a CBS/NYT poll conducted immediately after Buchanan won the 1996 New Hampshire primary show him polling even with the eventual nominee, Bob Dole, among GOP voters who said that immigrants take jobs from U.S. citizens and that the country cannot afford to open its doors to any more newcomers.

But less than one-fifth of Republican voters agreed with both statements in the 1996 survey. That percentage would almost certainly be higher today, as Republicans have become more racially resentful and more opposed to immigration in the past 20 years.

The party’s growing conservatism on matters of race and ethnicity provided fertile ground for Trump’s racial and ethnic appeals to resonate in the primaries. So much so, in fact, that Donald Trump is the first Republican in modern times to win the party’s presidential nomination on anti-minority sentiments.

MOSCOW — You don't have to be a close friend of President Vladimir Putin to be awarded Russia's Order of Friendship, much less the globe-trotting head of one of the world's most powerful corporations.

You can be a basketball coach who couldn't cut it in Cleveland. Or a museum director in Minnesota who's just happy to know that Putin isn't angry at him for holding on to a large collection of Russian paintings.

So although there may be plenty of valid concerns about the Russian entanglements of Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of ExxonMobil, who has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be the next secretary of state, his 2013 Order of Friendship award, based on its own merits, isn't necessarily one of them.

[Trump picks ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state]

Tillerson won the award after signing deals with the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft, whose chief, Igor Sechin, is seen as Putin's loyal lieutenant. The partnership had begun a drilling program in the Arctic’s Kara Sea, where Exxon made a find, and had agreed to explore shale oil areas of West Siberia and the deep waters of the Black Sea. But then U.S. sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea kicked in, and the partnership was put on hold.

ExxonMobil spent $650 million to drill an exploratory well in the Kara Sea and had gotten just a measly sample of oil, said Mikhail Krutikhin, co-owner of RusEnergy, an independent oil and gas consultancy. (The head of the Italian oil major Eni also won a 2013 Order of Friendship.)

President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of state. Here's what you need to know about Tillerson. (Thomas Johnson,Victoria Walker,Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)

Note to Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, the Republican from South Carolina, who called Putin's honoring of Tillerson “unnerving.” The Wichita Falls native isn't even the first “Texan who conquered Russia” to earn one.

That would be the late pianist Van Cliburn, to whom Putin awarded an Order of Friendship in 2004, for, among other things, his 1958 first-place showing in the Tchaikovsky International Competition. The people most unnerved by that were the organizers of the event, who never dreamed that a 23-year-old raised in Kilgore, Tex., could swoop into Moscow and walk away with the prize in an event that was supposed to showcase Soviet piano mastery.

Since it was established in 1994 by Russia's president at the time, Boris Yeltsin, the order has gone out to a number of less-prominent Americans, historians and business figures, as well as one arguably unsuccessful National Basketball Association coach.

David Blatt was fired midway through his second season in January, even though his Cleveland Cavaliers were in first place and would eventually go on to win the NBA title. What wasn't good enough for Cleveland was perfectly fine for the Kremlin. Blatt was awarded an Order of Friendship in 2014 for his successes as the head coach of the Russian national team between 2006 and 2012, which included a gold medal in the 2007 European Championship and Olympic bronze in 2012.

Not only do you not have to be a friend of Putin to get the award, you can also be someone worried about getting on the Kremlin leader's bad side.

In 2006, Raymond E. Johnson, founder of the Museum of Russian Art in Minneapolis, was awarded an Order of Friendship in recognition of 20 years of efforts to enhance cultural understanding between Russia and the United States.

Johnson and his wife, Susan, according to the museum's website, “have acquired what is believed to be the largest privately owned collection of Russian Realist paintings outside the borders of the former Soviet Union.”

In a 2012 interview, Johnson recalled that his Order of Friendship brought relief that Russia didn't consider him an enemy.

“What this meant to me was that they were proud of what we were doing and not angry about our having a large part of their art history,” he said.

Russia’s obsession with whether Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev is asleep or not14 Cards

EDITED BY Alissa Wilkinson

2016-12-29 13:07:00 -0500

Card 1 of 14 Arrival: a stunning science fiction drama about linguistics, aliens, and how we live today Based on the 1998 award-winning novella Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang, Denis Villeneuve's science fiction drama Arrival seems tailor-made for November 2016. Starring Amy Adams as a linguist who's trying to communicate with a group of extraterrestrials, it's concerned with deep truths about language, imagination, and human relationships. It's also one of the best movies of the year, a moving, gripping film with startling twists and fascinating imagery. "If this all sounds very tone-poem-y to you — dreamlike alien encounters, forlorn scientists, elliptical puzzles of language itself — that's because it is. But it also speaks to why Villeneuve is such a good fit for the material: He can ground the metaphysical and the metaphorical without undermining the mood he's created." —Bilge Ebiri, the Village Voice Release date: November 11, 2016 Metacritic score: 82 out of 100

Card 2 of 14 Fences: Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are outstanding in an adaptation of August Wilson's play Denzel Washington and Viola Davis star in Fences, which Washington also directed. The story of a middle-aged sanitation worker in Pittsburgh and his family, Fences is adapted from August Wilson's Pulitzer-winning play. It’s a bit static on screen, a serious movie most interested in showcasing its stars’ outstanding performances. But its story also feels fresh, as if it were written to slot itself into the concerns of 2016: Questions of race and privilege, agency, and responsibility are all here. If the sound were to suddenly fail — or if the dialogue were dubbed into Martian — the impact of the performances would still be palpable. The stories Troy and Rose tell about their lives up until this point are inscribed in their bodies. — A.O. Scott, The New York Times Release date: December 16, 2016 Metacritic score: 70 out of 100

Card 3 of 14 Hidden Figures: Inspirational, buoyant historical drama about three black women at NASA in the 1960s Hidden Figures is an inspirational, family-friendly historical drama about three black women whose work at NASA was instrumental in putting John Glenn into orbit around Earth. That could have been the recipe for a much hokier film, but the story — based on a book by Margot Lee Shetterly — is just Hollywood enough to stay entertaining, while smart enough to know how important its story is. Director Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent) sticks to every convention of the genre, but sometimes conventions exist for a reason. The story works, and the characters shine. The result is delightful, and surprisingly timely. Hidden Figures blends contemporary conversations about race, gender, diversity in STEM fields, and patriotism and presents them in a thought-provoking historical package. And most of all, the film boasts three terrific leading ladies (and a few great supporting actors too). Hidden Figures, both a dazzling piece of entertainment and a window into history, bucks the trend of the boring-math-guy movie. Stephanie Zacharek, Time Release date: December 25, 2016 Metacritic score: 74 out of 100

Card 4 of 14 I Am Not Your Negro: A vital, uncomfortable guide to America through James Baldwin's eyes The stunning documentary I Am Not Your Negro (which made box office history when it was released in New York) was directed by Raoul Peck. But it was written by writer and social critic James Baldwin — who died 30 years ago, in 1987. This isn’t a documentary about James Baldwin, though it certainly is about him. Instead, it gives new life and voice to Baldwin. All of the film’s narration (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) was written by Baldwin, mostly drawn from letters and notes he made toward a novel called Remember This House that was never published, as well as other books and essays. By pulling together Baldwin’s own words with footage — both images he would have known well and clips of Baldwin himself, talking with interviewers, politely tearing them to shreds — I Am Not Your Negro becomes a document of a country by way of a keen observer and unsparing thinker. It is a cinematic essay-memoir, and a vital, uncomfortable one. "I Am Not Your Negro" is a thrilling introduction to [Baldwin's] work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics — a concise, roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie, but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. A.O. Scott, The New York Times Release date: February 3, 2017 Metacritic score: 96 out of 100

Card 5 of 14 La La Land: a glorious throwback to classic movie musicals with a distinctly modern flair La La Land, from Whiplash director Damien Chazelle, is equal parts frothy musical, in the manner of Fred and Ginger, and a sweet but melancholy story about love, regret, and chasing your dreams in the city of stars. The music is catchy, the stars (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone) are great, and the costumes and colorful sets are equal parts nostalgic and subtly contemporary. It's a magical throwback and a lot of fun, too. "La La Land" is a film you simply never want to stop watching. It has wisdom and joy and sadness and such magic, from the evocative power of music to the transportive power of movies. It is a heartfelt lament for the fact that the place where those things meet — the movie musical — all but disappeared from our screens, and a passionately argued, utterly convincing manifesto for its return. —Jessica Kiang, The Playlist Release date: December 9, 2016 Metacritic score: 89 out of 100

Card 6 of 14 The Lego Batman Movie: a terrifically fun, playful addition to the Batman canon If a bunch of 10-year-olds who'd obsessively watched every Batman movie were equipped with a ridiculously excellent, eclectic Lego set, the result might be The Lego Batman Movie. It’s everything you could want from a Batman movie and, in some respects, from any movie: goofy, self-aware, very funny, and imaginative, with a sincere message that has both personal and political implications. There are explosions and parties and dinosaurs and chases. And it’s simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary: Both Lego and Batman have entertained kids for generations, which means The Lego Batman Movie is for pretty much everyone. The first thing to say about "The Lego Batman Movie" is that it’s kicky, bedazzling, and super-fun. Owen Gleiberman, Variety Release date: February 10, 2017 Metacritic score: 77 out of 100

Card 7 of 14 Manchester by the Sea: heartbreaking, often hilarious drama that treats grief with complexity Beautifully shot, and full of knockout performances from a cast led by Casey Affleck, Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea is a remarkable film in almost every respect. But its greatest achievement might be not just portraying, but embodying the complicated inner lives of the men at its center. It’s still rare to find American films that treat men as emotionally complex, especially men in rural or working-class areas. The film's deep tragedy is shot through with some truly excellent comedic writing. The result is hard to categorize: Is it drama? melodrama? tragedy? comedy? What's certain is this: It's a masterpiece. It’s this combination — those unexpected minor jolts of life amid the major jolts of grief, along with the director’s visual poetry — that keeps Manchester by the Sea from becoming just another sad story. Its world is cruel and chaotic, but it unfolds with purpose and grace. Bilge Ebiri, New York magazine Release date: November 18, 2016 Metacritic score: 95 out of 100

Card 8 of 14 Moana: Disney's latest princess is a luminous, plucky Polynesian heroine everyone can love Moana is the story of a brave teenage girl (and future chief) who sets sail beyond the reef that rings her island in order to save her people, along with her sidekick, a scrawny chicken named Heihei. In other words, it's another Disney princess movie. But this one is worth seeing for a number of reasons: innovative animation, an oversized demigod voiced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, murderous pirate coconuts, no need of a romantic interest for our luminous heroine, and a deep interest in how tradition and family shape our future. With catchy tunes penned by musicians including Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda, Moana is a great deal of fun and a thoughtful meditation on tradition, too.

Card 9 of 14 Moonlight: a jewel-like masterpiece about growing up black in America A movie like Moonlight doesn't come along often, and it's no wonder: A film this carefully crafted can't be hurried along. A triptych of vignettes centered on Chiron, a young black boy in Miami living with his mother and grappling with the cards life has dealt him — addiction, an absentee father, bullies, abuse, and a growing realization of his sexual identity — Barry Jenkins's Moonlight (based on a story by playwright Tarell McCraney) is gentle, complex, and above all, filled with grace. With a cast that includes Mahershala Ali, Janelle Monae, Naomie Harris, and three actors who play Chiron at different ages (Jaden Piner, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes), and a dynamite score, it's certainly one of the best films of 2016. "Jenkins deeply understands that it is human connection that forms us, that changes our trajectory and makes us who we are." —Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com Release date: October 21, 2016 Metacritic score: 99 out of 100

Card 10 of 14 Paterson: Adam Driver stars in a stellar movie a bus-driving poet in New Jersey Paterson, written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, is a gentle fable, a small myth, and the rare philosophical film that captures the balance of work and art that so many artists — especially poets — have to navigate. But Paterson doesn’t feel the need to romanticize it as a struggle or downplay work as just a "day job." In Paterson, work and art is all of a piece. Whether laced with small joys or defeats, it’s all a good life. The nature of Paterson’s poetic gift is in no rush to reveal itself. And Jarmusch, whose own art seems to draw as much from disciplines like medieval engraving and Buddhist meditation as it does from the traditions of Hollywood filmmaking, works to his own similarly unhurried rhythms. Justin Chang, The Los Angeles Times Release Date: December 28, 2016 Metacritic score: 89 out of 100

Card 11 of 14 The Salesman: a haunting recasting of Death of a Salesman, in Tehran Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman is nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year, though the filmmaker himself won't attend because of President Trump's travel ban. It’s a haunting film that both recasts Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman (one storyline has the film’s characters rehearsing a production of the play) and tells its own empathetic story of life in Tehran. After Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) is assaulted in her home, she becomes fearful of being home alone. Her husband, Emad (Shahab Hosseini), becomes obsessed with finding out who committed the crime. And then their relationship begins to unravel. The Salesman is a typically wrenching film for Farhadi, one that morphs from a quiet family drama to a low-key tale of revenge, and is all the more impressive for how seamlessly it executes that shift. David Sims, The Atlantic Release date: February 3, 2017 Metacritic score: 85 out of 100

Card 12 of 14 Silence: a searing Scorsese film about faith, doubt, and Jesuits in 17th century Japan Martin Scorsese has been trying for decades to make Silence, based on Shūsaku Endō's 1966 novel. He's finally succeeded, and it's one of the most haunting movies about faith and doubt ever made. Silence is the story of two young Portuguese Catholic priests, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garrpe (Adam Driver). They learn from their superior (Ciarán Hinds) that their mentor and former confessor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who had gone to Japan as a missionary, is reported to have apostatized — that is, repudiated his faith. They go to find him, but Christianity is outlawed in Japan, and so they're met with the opposition of Inquisitor Inoue (Issei Ogata), who orders Christians to trample on an image of Christ or be tortured. It's an unsettling and beautiful film, a challenge for everyone in the audience. As the purest exploration of the director’s great Catholic themes ... it’s inevitably something of a challenge. It is slow and solemn in stretches and often remote, but it rewards patience with a transcendent epilogue that departs from the main character’s point-of-view to find a glimmer of meaning. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, The AV Club Release date: December 23, 2016 Metacritic score: 81 out of 100

Card 13 of 14 Toni Erdmann: Expertly constructed German comedy about a father, a daughter, and absurd modern life Rather than taking the joke-a-minute slapstick approach, the German comedy Toni Erdmann slow-burns its humor, winding up to the punch with care and pathos that renders the punchline all the more poignant. But more than that, Toni Erdmann is about a father who refuses to do what’s expected of him, and a daughter whose drive to be nothing like him has driven her to the verge of hysterics. Their relationship is a hothouse in which the absurdity of modern life can be both exposed and forgiven. Delving into microeconomics and macroaggressions, Toni Erdmann, the dynamite, superbly acted third feature from writer-director Maren Ade, is social studies at its finest. Melissa Anderson, The Village Voice Release Date: December 25, 2016 Metacritic score: 96 out of 100Collect all the portraits lining the many profile pieces of white supremacist Richard Spencer, and you might think you were holding the proofs for a slightly down-market GQ. A soft-faced white man in a too-tight peacoat, posing in a DC park. In a tweed sports jacket, standing in a brass-and-glass elevator. In dark-wash jeans, propping his leather ankle boots on a hotel room desk.

A recent Mother Jones profile is an exemplar of this beneath-the-hood reporting on white supremacy. It lingers over the details: the private school pedigree, the “slivers of togarashi-crusted ahi” that Spencer orders at the upscale hotel lounge, his “‘fashy’ (as in fascism) haircut.” The left-wing magazine does not truck in Spencer’s white nationalist politics — quite the opposite. But like many profiles of the alt-right leader, it contains an air of surprise. He’s a racist, but he wears some swank cufflinks.

Such coverage isn’t new to the alt-right. Operating from the flawed assumption that white supremacy is the provenance of poor whites and troglodytes, journalists have long had a tendency to get enamored of repackaged racism. Since the 1970s, the national press has fallen, again and again, into the trap of missing the substance of racism for its style.

The alt-right exploits these weaknesses in journalistic coverage of racism. In their primer on the alt-right, which appeared on Breitbart, two of its leading figures, Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos, framed the phenomenon not as one of de-sheeted Klansman but creative free-speech radicals “eager to commit secular heresies.”

“They have no real problem with race-mixing, homosexuality, or even diverse societies,” Bokhari and Yiannopoulos claimed of the alt-right. “It’s just fun to watch the mayhem and outrage that erupts when those secular shibboleths are openly mocked.” Bokhari and Yiannopoulos included the anti-Semitic caricature Shlomo Shekelberg and the slang “remove kebab” (a reference to the ethnic cleansing of Muslims) as examples of the exuberant mockery they endorsed.

Affecting WFB Jr. sartorial style while networking with internet trolls

Spencer, as one of the principal founders of the alt-right, presents himself as a tweedy, scholarly racist. But he has worked hard to promote the meme crowd as well. Radix Journal, which Spencer founded in 2012, features illustrations of Trump as an emperor, sells “Haramche” t-shirts — blending the Harambe gorilla meme with Che Guevara, in a mocking way — and engages with the debates taking place among the Twitter trolls of the alt-right.

As a traditional white nationalist organizer, Spencer’s success is due in part to his ability to play up the unexpected: education, style, inventiveness. Yet he also plays the irony card. When audience members at a gathering of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, responded to the conclusion of his speech (“Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail Victory!”) with Nazi salutes, a widely reported incident, he told a PBS producer that the gestures were “clearly done in a spirit of irony and exuberance.”

The Mother Jones profile of alt-right leader Richard Spencer contains an air of surprise. He’s a racist, but he wears some swank cufflinks.

The blend of racism, misogyny, irony, and hipness has its own history, one that most coverage of the alt-right neglects. As historian Kelly Baker has outlined in the New York Times, white nationalists groups have long been refashioning themselves as cutting-edge modernists. And when they do, when they present themselves as intellectuals, artists, techies, and free-speechers, many journalists cover their modern style with a sense of surprise — even though this sort of hipster racism has been around for decades.

In the 1970s, a quest for new taboos to smash

If in the 1960s, white activists struck back against the establishment by fighting racism, war, and patriarchy, by the late 1970s, the targets had changed. What was taboo was not sitting with a black activist at a white-only lunch counter or staging a sit-in against the bureaucratic machinery of war. For some, it was taboo to assault the new political norms of inclusion, to throw back in the faces of the generation that came before fights against totalitarianism, racism, and misogyny. This was a very specific type of rebellion, limited to white Americans who could view the new taboos against racist epithets not as a crucial step toward basic human rights but as oppressive new norms.

It was not in rural enclaves but at the edges of the urban and suburban punk scene of the 1970s and 1980s that this racist rebellion — and the confusion over how to cover it — first became visible. A handful of punk bands adopted the swastika as well as anti-Semitic and anti-black slurs. Shrapnel had a song called “Hey Little Gook.” Jamie Chance of the Contortions gave an interview dismissing black music as “just a bunch of nigger bullshit.” When confronted with this new phenomenon, the Los Angeles Times asked: “Fascism or Shock Value?”

“These attitudes appear to be primarily one more form of shock value — a commodity important to punks — rather than a deeply-rooted prejudice,” Terry Atkinson wrote for the LA Times in his survey of the punk scene. Atkinson quoted Fear guitarist Philo Cramer on the topic of the band’s use of anti-Semitic slurs: “We don’t mean anything with our jokes — except to offend everybody.” A swastika-sporting punk dismissed her sartorial choice as “just something to shock the normal.”

From skinheads’ swastikas to the “edgy” racism of a Vice founder

Skinheads, too, sometimes got the style treatment. Though more closely associated with racist violence, American skinheads in the 1980s were at times treated as fashionable curiosities. There were only a few thousand skinheads in the US, spreading from Texas and the Midwest to the coasts. They were closely associated with both violence and music, and they were split between racist and anti-racist factions. Dozens of hate crimes, including vicious attacks on immigrants, were attributed to skinheads.

But in 1989, the New York Times coverage of local skinheads began with the visuals: “hair close-cropped, heavy boots with trousers bloused, black leather jackets and epaulets. They wear ties, and the look is neat, but a little Germanic, circa 1939.” Despite the Nazi shade, the writer concluded: “So far, New York’s skinheads have cultivated the style of violence far more than its substance.”

Not everyone was so seduced. In an essay for the Village Voice, published in April 1979, Lester Bangs took on what he called “White Noise Supremacists.” It was a flawed essay — Bangs later apologized for including some quotes and images after the people involved complained that he portrayed ironic jokes as serious racist comments (though of course that’s the problem with ironic racism) — but its analysis of racism and punk was largely sound. Bangs saw racism as ubiquitous, something that lurked just under the surface in everyone. “Which is why,” he argued, “it has to be monitored, made taboo and restrained, by society and the individual.”

Bangs was not blind to differences between hate-fueled groups like the KKK and the neo-Nazi stylings of the punk crowd. “Swastikas in punk are basically another way for kids to get a rise out of their parents and maybe the press, both of whom deserve the irritation.” But he also understood the danger lurking in this hip racism, that “after a while this casual, even ironic embrace of the totems of bigotry crosses over into the real poison.”

The punks and skinheads of the 1970s and 1980s soon faded from the scene. But their cultural posture of racism as rebellion — that endured. And journalists continued to be drawn to the style rather than the substance of hipster racism. In 2003, the New York Times profiled Vice magazine as “a lad magazine for the Williamsburg set,” a bold corrective to political correctness.

Deep into the profile, a portrait of Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes appears. “’No means no’ is puritanism,” he says at one point, invoking one of the slogans of the anti-date-rape movement. Then he shifted into some “daring” racial observations: “I love being white and I think it’s something to be very proud of. I don’t want our culture diluted. We need to close the borders now and let everyone assimilate to a Western, white, English-speaking way of life.”

The fallacy that racism can be “merely” performance

The Times rightly noted that McInnes’s views were white supremacist. But it balanced that statement with other voices claiming “such remarks are posturing, akin to the ethnic and anti-gay slurs that pepper the pages of Vice, establishing its rebel credentials.” Comedian Sarah Silverman backed up this view of Vice. “It harshly makes fun of men, women, all races, nerds, hipsters, the elderly, the short, the tall, the fashionable, the hopeless. It’s without boundaries, which is what makes the playing field even.”

Only it turned out not to be much of a leap between the hipster racism of the 2000s — McInnes has since left Vice — and the posturing of the alt-right in 2016. McInnes was doing Milo Yiannopoulos’s shtick before Milo was. Since 2003, Yiannopoulos’s career has wended through the haunts of the alt-right, places like Taki’s Magazine, a site that presents itself as a post-ideology subverter of the establishment but was originally edited by Richard Spencer and still posts plenty of racist material, and the virulently anti-immigrant and white nationalist site VDARE. He has attacked feminism for making women less happy, argued that “transphobia is perfectly natural,” and suggested that throughout history Jews “were ostracized for a good reason.” He is, unsurprisingly, a big supporter of Trump, whose Muslim ban he has described as “what we need in this day and age.”

McInnes’s trajectory makes clear the curdled assumptions at the heart of an “offend everyone” rebellion. A hipster racist may offend members of the establishment, but actually endangers people of color, Muslims, Jews, and women. There is no functional difference between white supremacy and misogyny as acts of irony or acts of hatred. From the perspective of the targets, it’s all the same. Regardless of intent, the spread of racist and anti-woman view makes them more acceptable, and thus more likely to be acted on.

But the coverage of Vice and McInnes, like that of punks and skinheads in an earlier era, also points to the problem of journalistic wonder at racism that comes in unexpected packages. To fix their coverage of racism, journalists must first confront the false assumption at the core of current coverage: that attitudes like white supremacy are artifacts of a distant past, that they reflect a lack of education, style, and sophistication. Attitudes like white supremacy are about power, and they dress up in whatever way they need to in order to protect that power. Only when that truth is fully understood can journalists set aside their awe at dapper Klansmen and hip racists — and begin to offer clear-eyed accounts of the dangerous ideology still in our midst.

Nicole Hemmer, a Vox columnist, is author of Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics. She is an assistant professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and co-host of the Past Present podcast.Donald Trump has given every sign that he wants to dismantle the multitude of environmental rules President Obama has put in place over the past eight years. He’s vowed to tear up major climate regulations like the Clean Power Plan. His top pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has sued to block nearly every pollution regulation the Obama administration has enacted. Pruitt will no doubt come in looking to make sweeping changes.

That said, it’s not yet clear how far Trump and Pruitt can actually go here. Overhauling the EPA is a surprisingly difficult task that involves navigating a complex bureaucracy bound by powerful laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both came into office hoping to take apart key EPA environmental rules, yet were often stymied by the courts, by green groups skilled at litigation, by career officials, and by sheer inertia.

So what would it actually take for a Trump administration to repeal Obama’s climate and pollution rules?

Jody Freeman, a Harvard law school professor and former climate adviser to Obama, has been looking at this question extensively. Her view is that this won’t actually be easy for Trump — at least not without substantial help from Congress. (Republicans will control Congress next year, and they’d certainly like to dismantle Obama’s climate rules; yet Senate Democrats have also vowed to filibuster any major changes to the Clean Air Act, the source of the EPA’s authority over greenhouse gas emissions.)

I talked with Freeman about the mechanics of a potential Trump administration: how agency rulemaking works, what it would take to revamp Obama’s EPA regulations, why some environmental rules are much more vulnerable than others, and why Trump may not be able to undo everything Obama has done on climate. It’s a little weedy, but these topics are likely to come up again and again in 2017 and beyond. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Brad Plumer

Okay, say you’re Donald Trump and you enter the White House hoping to undo all the different environmental and climate rules that Obama has put in place since 2008 via the executive branch. What is the first thing you do on day one?

Jody Freeman

So the first thing a new White House would do is essentially issue a stop-work order to the federal agencies — they freeze any pending rules coming out of those agencies and review them. In the past, most of those rules have wound up getting finished, and only very few of them usually get rolled back or reconsidered.

Brad Plumer

That explains why we’ve seen the Obama administration rush to finalize a host of regulations this year, like the EPA’s fuel efficiency standards for trucks, finalized in August. They want to get them done before Trump’s White House can fiddle with them.

Jody Freeman

Right. Now, in Trump’s case, there’s a possibility that Republicans in the House and Senate could use a little-used law called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn some of these recent Obama regulations. Basically, any rule under Obama that was finished after late May or early June — it depends how they count it — would be potentially subject to disapproval by a simple majority vote [in both the House and Senate]. [Here is a list of Obama rules that would be vulnerable to CRA disapproval, including emissions standards for landfills, rules around offshore drilling, methane standards for oil and gas drilling, and restrictions on migratory bird hunting.]

The question here is how much they want to prioritize this. The new Congress will have to decide what’s most important on their agenda and do some triage. We’ve been hearing a lot about things they want to do on health care, on infrastructure, on tax reform. So the new Congress will have to ask if they really want to spend the first 30, 60, 100 days on Congressional Review Act fights.

Brad Plumer

As I understand it, if Congress disapproves of a regulation under the CRA, not only does it kill the regulation but the agency can’t actually propose a similar regulation anytime in the future, right?

Jody Freeman

That is what the Congressional Review Act says — the agency can’t come back with anything that’s “substantially similar” in the future. But this has actually never been tested, and no court has ever ruled on it. The CRA has only ever been used once [in 2001, to strike down a Clinton labor rule on ergonomics issued in late 2000]. So there’s a real question about whether it’s legally enforceable. Because some existing environmental laws [like the Clean Air Act] may require a certain type of regulation. So what do you do if that law says you have to regulate and the Congressional Review Act says you can’t do it? This could be a really interesting legal question going forward.

Brad Plumer

Let’s go back to the Trump White House and the Trump EPA. Let’s assume they have halted any ongoing work. And now they’re looking at all these rules that Obama has already put in place and finalized — you’ve got everything from rules on mercury pollution that were finished in 2011 to the Clean Power Plan, which is currently being debated in federal courts. Which rules are the most vulnerable?

Jody Freeman

It’s easiest to just not finish rules that haven’t been finished yet. It’s also straightforward to roll back things that aren’t rules — that is, policies that have not gone through the notice-and-comment process. An example would be the suspension of coal leasing [from federal lands] that President Obama put in place. That was done by secretarial order in the Department of the Interior; you wouldn’t have to go through a long process to lift that suspension.

The rules that are harder to rescind and roll back are rules that have already gone through the time-consuming notice-and-comment process and are final and have gone into legal effect already. For example, the rule on mercury pollution, or the cross-state pollution rule. That takes time and effort to rescind, and in some cases industry would have already started to comply. [Note: Many coal plants have already shut down or spent billions installing scrubbers to comply with the 2011 mercury rule.]

The other category here is rules in legal limbo because they have been stayed by the courts. So that includes the Clean Power Plan and the “Waters of the United States” rule [which redefines which rivers, streams, and lakes fall under Clean Water Act protection]. If those rules get struck down in court, the new Department of Justice in the Trump administration could decide not to defend them or to appeal them any further. In that case, it would fall to the interveners — environmental groups or states, which have to be parties to the case — to take up the mantle and appeal.

Brad Plumer

Let’s take the Clean Power Plan, the rule to cut CO2 from power plants, since that’s the centerpiece of Obama’s climate agenda and the rule Donald Trump has focused on. If this rule is upheld by the court, the stay is lifted and it gets implemented. What can the Trump administration actually do to stop it?

Jody Freeman

The new administration could try to go to the DC Circuit Court — which has heard oral arguments on the Clean Power Plan already but not yet decided its fate — and ask the court to do what’s called a “voluntary remand,” sending the rule back to agency. Assuming the courts agreed, which is not guaranteed, then the EPA could try to rescind the rule and replace it with something new.

But the EPA would have to go out for public comment on that — and that usually takes a year or two. The EPA would also have to address the fact that the agency already had decided the Clean Power Plan, so why are they changing their minds now? What is in the record to support that change? They’d have to make an argument for why they’re reconsidering it, and they would have to defend that in court, because any change would get challenged [either by states or by environmental groups].

[The Trump administration] might try to argue that they don’t think they have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases from existing power plants. Or they could argue that even if they do have that authority, they think there’s a better approach to the standard [than the specific regulation Obama’s EPA set up]. They could say they have a narrower approach to setting the standard, and they might get deference from the court. But that would play itself out in years of litigation.

Brad Plumer

Let’s go deeper on this. How do you actually rescind a rule — like the Clean Power Plan or the mercury pollution rule — that’s already been finalized? What is the step-by-step process a Trump EPA has to go through?

Jody Freeman

There’s a Supreme Court case called FCC v. Fox, which basically says that if an agency changes its mind, it has to come back in and defend the new rule the way it would defend the original rule. You have to be able to defend it as non-arbitrary. And in cases where industry is already relying on the first rule, or where there’s a really strong scientific record for the first rule, the burden on the agency is a little tougher for changing its mind. So there is a legal standard here.

But to change a rule, by law, the agency has to do a public comment period — that’s typically something like 60 days, though it can be up to 120 days. Then the agency has to take time to consider and respond to all the public comments on the proposed rule and develop a record that shows they thought carefully about them. If they try to shortchange this process and rush out a brand new rule, it really will not go well for them when they get into court. The procedural checks the agency has to go through are very important, and a court will invalidate a rule that wasn’t done correctly.

The courts will also invalidate a rule change that, in the substance of it, looks arbitrary to them. So as an example, let’s take the endangerment finding, the first big rule that EPA put out in 2009 that said greenhouse gases endanger the public health and welfare. That has a voluminous scientific foundation behind it. The Trump administration couldn’t just come in and say nope, no more endangerment! There’s almost no chance that would be upheld, because you cannot ignore this record.

Brad Plumer

So if they really wanted to overturn the EPA’s authority over greenhouse gases, they’d need Congress to amend the Clean Air Act — to say something like, “Okay, the Clean Air Act no longer applies to greenhouse gases.” And that all depends on whether a bill like that can get through the Senate, past Democrats who might filibuster.

Jody Freeman

Right.

Brad Plumer

So if we’re just talking about what a president can do all by himself, it seems like there are real limits. We saw this during the George W. Bush era — he had a surprising amount of trouble rolling back many of Clinton’s rules.

Jody Freeman

You saw this when the Bush administration tried to roll back the Roadless Rule [a Clinton-era rule prohibiting road construction and timber harvesting on national forest land]. That went through a long, complicated litigation process, and ultimately the new administration wasn’t successful.

The Bush administration also came out and said they would reject the Clinton administration’s arsenic standard for drinking water, and that proved to be a political disaster for them — because, you know, the public doesn’t like to be poisoned. And that was also litigated, and [after eight years] the Bush administration ended up sticking to the Clinton standard.

So those are cautionary tales. We have seen Republican administrations come in before and try to roll things back. And [a Trump administration] may well be successful on some of these high-profile rules, but it’s going to be trench warfare. They’ll have to pick their battles.

Brad Plumer

So what’s the lowest-hanging fruit for a Trump administration? Where will they have the easiest time prevailing?

Jody Freeman

Well, the Clean Power Plan isn’t low-hanging — it will take a lot of work to change. But because Trump has identified it on the campaign trail, and it’s in the sights of many Republicans in Congress, it’s hard to imagine they won’t take action of some type. There’s also quite a bit of congressional hostility to the Waters of the United States rule, so you’ll likely see something there.

There are easier things to do — like if the Obama administration finishes the stream protection rule [an Interior Department rule that governs mining waste disposal in waterways], you could imagine a Trump administration trying to roll that back before it becomes legally effective. And like I said, the coal leasing moratorium can be lifted with a stroke of a pen.

Brad Plumer

And of course, Trump can withdraw from the Paris climate agreement unilaterally. I’ve seen a few different ways he might do this — like withdrawing from the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the original treaty establishing international climate talks that undergirds the Paris accord. Which seems most likely?

Jody Freeman

It is possible to withdraw from the framework convention — that’s actually faster than withdrawing from the Paris agreement, since Paris takes four years to officially withdraw, whereas withdrawing from the UNFCCC takes one year.

The problem is that the UNFCCC was a treaty unanimously ratified by Congress [in 1992], there was no real dissent, and it was negotiated by a Republican president. The UNFCCC also has no real substantive obligations in it. So it would be a very odd thing to withdraw from — it would do a lot of damage, upset our allies enormously, and you really don’t need to do it [if you’re trying to undermine the Paris deal].

What Trump could much more easily do is simply not meet the US pledge for Paris. Or he can just say, “I’m not going to be bound by that pledge, and I’m going to take apart the key programs domestically that were supposed to get us there, like the Clean Power Plan.”

Brad Plumer

Tell me about the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which is part of the Office of Management and Budget. It seems like this will really change under Trump — with potentially major implications for regulatory agencies like the EPA.

OIRA is the location in the White House where they oversee agency rulemaking. This office oversees the methodology that agencies use to count up costs and benefits for new rules. That can be changed with the stroke of a pen. And it sounds weedy, but it’s the kind of thing that can make it harder to issue new regulations.

So for instance, right now the Obama administration currently uses a “global social cost of carbon” for its climate rules — that means if you have any rule that reduces greenhouse gases, the benefits counted for that rule include the [climate] benefits globally. You could imagine a Trump OIRA saying, “We don’t want to do that anymore. We’re not going to count the social cost of carbon as a benefit.” That changes the calculus for which rules are cost-beneficial.

OIRA is also the place where, if the Trump administration were serious about their idea of trying to repeal or rescind two rules for every new one they issue, that’s where they’d do it — though it’s hard to imagine how [this idea] would possibly work.

Brad Plumer

There are also a whole bunch of executive orders that were issued from the Obama White House, not the agencies themselves. Like this 2013 order that told the agencies to help communities prepare for climate change. Those executive orders can be easily reversed, right?

Jody Freeman

That’s right. That also includes guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality that governs how agencies should consider greenhouse gas emissions when they conduct environmental impact statements. Every agency has to do these environmental impact statements [for instance, the State Department had to do one before approving the Keystone XL pipeline]. So [the new Trump White House] could say, “We don’t want you to consider GHGs anymore.”

That’s stroke-of-a-pen stuff. Every executive order can be replaced with a new executive order, or withdrawn completely. And there’s nothing that the environmental community or the states can do to challenge executive orders directly. Although there’s a twist here: When the executive orders tell agencies to do things, and then the agencies do those things, that’s when they get legally challenged.

Brad Plumer

A slightly different question. Even if the Trump administration has a hard time rescinding specific Obama-era environmental rules, can’t they still weaken enforcement of these rules?

Jody Freeman

There are a lot of ways to slow down implementation and to try to minimize enforcement. Everyone talks about the Reagan administration as a good example of the EPA being “dismantled from within” — by slow-walking regulations, by slow-walking enforcement.

That said, there are a lot of internal checks on this kind of dismantling from within. There’s a very dedicated career staff that knows it has to follow the law, and there are ethics rules that apply to the agencies; there are independent inspectors general that are tasked with making sure there’s not mismanagement or ethics violations. So not only will there be lawsuits from outside when agencies don’t follow the law but there are management rules and procedures inside that should create some obstacles to any real effort to undo them.

That said, a very determined administration that really wants to pull back on implementation and enforcement will find ways to pull back. They can give more leeway to the states, for example, when the states draft their plans for complying with their state implementation plans [for EPA pollution rules like the ground-level ozone standard]. You can imagine ways of making it easier for states that don’t want to work very hard. Or bringing fewer enforcement actions.

The president can also ask for less money. And even if he doesn’t, Congress can just cut the budget [for agencies like the EPA]. Congress can insert, in big omnibus budget bills, little riders that say agencies can’t do specific things. There can be death by a thousand cuts in this way.

So I don’t want to suggest there won’t be retrenchment. But what some people fear is that Trump is sworn into office and he eliminates the EPA. That just can’t happen; he’d need Congress to do it, and I don’t think that kind of dramatic action is anything we’re going to see.

Brad Plumer

Right, it’s hard for Congress to simply abolish the EPA or rewrite the Clean Air Act — that would face a potential filibuster. But it’s far more plausible that we might see the House pass a thousand different riders that change the agency significantly. The GOP House has been trying to pass a bunch of these since 2011.

Jody Freeman

I think it’s realistic to think there will be some of that. We have seen the House try to pass lots of things, though of course that was when they knew they couldn’t succeed. Then again, when you control both houses of Congress and you’ve got the presidency, you have to watch what you do. Because dismantling the nation’s environmental laws is not going to go over well with the public.

Brad Plumer

Trump hasn’t yet said who he would appoint to run any of the key environmental agencies, but what are the things to watch for here? How much leeway does the individual at the head of an agency have to change things?

Jody Freeman

Well, if we see appointees to the EPA and Department of the Interior and Department of Energy, all of whom have disdain for environmental protection, this would be a real potential problem, because it would mean the political appointees at the top are opposed to these agencies’ essential missions. That obviously has an impact on career staff, on the morale.

But at bottom, you have to remember that these agencies are creatures of law, they are tasked with implementing statutes, and they can’t not do it without being threatened by litigation saying they are behaving unlawfully. So even political appointees will be disciplined by legal requirements.

There’s another effect that also happens — and I’m not saying this always happens — but it’s quite standard for political appointees to come in and then be exposed to the mission of the agency, and have senior staff brief them, to learn something about the agency and enlarge their perspective. And they end up moderating some of their views.

Brad Plumer

There’s another side of this, too. The Trump administration isn’t just going to be focused on overturning Obama regulations. There are also laws that were passed by Congress like the Clean Air Act that will continue to require updates of existing regulations over time, on a set schedule. How much can appointees that are philosophically opposed to regulation really drag their heels here?

Jody Freeman

There is some leeway for agencies to miss deadlines; they miss deadlines all the time. And courts don’t strictly enforce every deadline if the agency can show it’s making reasonable progress. At some point, though, courts will step in and require agencies to take some action.

But you’re asking will there be some slippage? Certainly there will be some slippage. Agencies can miss deadlines by a year, two years, and courts will give them a lot of room, because they recognize agencies have a lot of priorities. But if an agency routinely and systematically misses deadlines and it looks like political interference, then courts may become quite skeptical.

What’s interesting is that even courts that are viewed as conservative and have a lot of conservative appointees, they respect the rule of law. And they may well wind up providing an accountability mechanism for any real effort to stymie these agencies systematically.

Brad Plumer

Okay, but what if Trump starts filling the courts with appointees more likely to rule in his favor?

Jody Freeman

Yeah, you may get judges who are more skeptical of ambitious regulations — or regulations that creatively press the boundaries of a statute. But for run-of-the-mill rules and deadlines, it’s just a sort of lawyerly disposition to respect the rule of law. It’s hard to find judges that will systematically turn a blind eye to the core demands of the agency’s mission. There will be some brakes on what they can do.

I realize I sound almost cheerful — I am not! I’m not saying there’s no problem here.

Brad Plumer

It does sound like the main point here is that the federal government is this vast bureaucracy that can’t just be turned around overnight.

Jody Freeman

Yes, that’s exactly it.See the related story: "10 Proposals For Eliminating The Racial Wealth Gap."

The United States is becoming much more racially and ethnically diverse. At the same time, it’s becoming more unequal in terms of wealth and income. These two trends are combining in an uncomfortable way: the wealth and income divide is happening along racial and ethnic lines.

The typical black household now has just 6% of the wealth of the typical white household; the typical Latino household has just 8%, according to a recent study called The Racial Wealth Gap: Why Policy Matters, by Demos, a public policy organization promoting democracy and equality, and the Institute on Assets and Social Policy.

In absolute terms, the median white household had $111,146 in wealth holdings in 2011, compared to $7,113 for the median black household and $8,348 for the median Latino household. (All figures come from the U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation.)

This is what is called the racial wealth gap.

While the disparity might seem only to be a problem for the economically disadvantaged families of color, it actually worsens political and economic outcomes for the entire country.

“Huge subsets of the population are excluded from accessing the avenues toward wealth,” says Catherine Ruetschlin, senior policy analyst for Demos and a co-author of the report, “and that is a problem for political stability. But it’s also a problem for economic stability. As we’ve seen in reports from big international finance organizations like the [International Monetary Fund] or World Economic Forum, increasing inequality is a source of increasing volatility, and wealth inequality means, when the economy hits a volatile patch, people don’t have the resources to withstand those shocks.” That, in turn, makes the economy more volatile, says Ruetschlin.

While not every family can be expected to become wealthy in the jet-setting, Wolf-of-Wall-Street manner, every family needs some amount of wealth for economic security. The racial wealth gap means families of color may not be able to give young members of their households gifts to invest in their future, similar to what their white friends are likely to receive.

(The study did not include households of other races or ethnic groups, such as Asian, Native American, Caribbean, Mexican, African, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, because the populations are too small to produce statistically significant results.)

Federal policies also reinforce the wealth gap, as many of them largely result in increasing the wealth of those who already have it.

Here are the three main factors driving the income gap between white households and black and Hispanic ones.

1. Homeownership

For most U.S. families, a home usually comprises the largest portion of their assets.

“Homeownership is the central vehicle Americans use to store wealth, so homeownership and access to homeownership are at the heart of that widening wealth gap,” says Ruetschlin.

But disparities in homeownership fall along racial and ethnic lines. Seventy-three percent of whites own a home, compared to 47% of Latinos and 45% of blacks.

The median white homeowner’s house is worth $85,800 compared to $50,000 for black homeowners and $48,000 for Latino homeowners.

Much of that disparity comes from the gap in the home values in white neighborhoods versus the neighborhoods where people of color live. The roots of the gulf stem at least as far back as the 1934 National Housing Act, which redlined black neighborhoods, marking them as credit risks. Though redlining was outlawed in the ’60s, the effect persists today in the form of neighborhoods consisting mostly of people of color that have high poverty rates, low home values and declining infrastructure.

Discriminatory lending also exists today: Mortgages obtained by households of color tend to have higher interest rates. Even as recently as 2012, Wells Fargo admitted it had steered black and Latino households into subprime mortgages but had offered white borrowers with similar credit profiles prime mortgages.

Education

A college education is all but required to flourish in the labor market, establish financial stability and build wealth. But the gap in college attainment by whites versus blacks and Latinos has widened over the last decade. In 2011, 34% of whites completed a four-year college degree, whereas just 20% of blacks and 13% of Hispanics did.

One obstacle is the surge in college costs over recent years, forcing households to take on significant debt to send student to college.

But obtaining a bachelor’s isn’t enough for a black or Hispanic person to escape the racial wealth gap. The return on investment in college is much higher for whites than for blacks and Hispanics: A white family at the median sees a return of $55,869 from completing a four-year degree. A black family sees $4,846 and an Hispanic family $4,191.

Contributing factors to this disparity are the higher debt students of color may need to take on to attend college and discrimination in the workplace. “Even if you graduate from college, as a black college graduate, you’re faced with discrimination. So you might have done everything right, achieved the skills you need to succeed, but you won’t see a higher return. The other issue with education is that black college graduates come out with higher debt levels so they start out behind in terms of asset building,” says Ruetschlin.

Less obvious factors have historical roots in prohibitions against teaching slaves to read and the practice of “separate but equal” educational facilities. They continue to matter because parents’ educational level and family income and wealth are strong predictors of children’s educational success.

Another cause is related to homeownership disparities: residential segregation keeps black and Hispanic families in school districts with low-quality, under-resourced schools, which can then influence students' preparedness for college.

Labor Markets

Labor markets can provide economic security through earned income, employer-provided health coverage, paid leave and workplace retirement plans. But inequality in the labor market is responsible for 20% of the growth in the racial wealth gap in the last 25 years, and unemployment another 9%.

Disparate outcomes in the labor market can come from employment discrimination, geographic barriers to jobs and differing levels of social capital.

The typical white family earns $50,400, while the typical black family earns $32,038, and the typical Latino family, $36,840.

“In the labor market, the wealth return to a dollar of income is first determined by how much of that income you have the opportunity to save,” says Ruetschlin. “If you are facing a wealth gap of 80 cents for every dollar a white family makes, that makes you 20% less able to put that dollar into savings, because you may need all of those dollars to fill your consumption needs.”

Additionally, black and Latino families earn a lower return on their incomes, meaning they are less able to turn each additional dollar of income into wealth. A white family will typically see a return of $19.51 for each dollar earned, while a black family will see only $4.80 in return and Latino families $3.63.

Causes include the fact that blacks and Latinos are less likely to have jobs that include employer-sponsored health care, a retirement plan or paid time off. The net result is that families of color spend more of their savings on dealing with life’s emergencies such as out-of-pocket health care. Or, they have fewer wealth-building vehicles, such as tax-advantaged accounts, available to them.

Other factors stem back to homeownership and education: A child whose parents were steered into a low-income neighborhood with a low-quality school has decreased chances of obtaining a four-year degree, which also then cuts off future job opportunities. Additionally, although it is illegal, discrimination on the basis of race or national original endures, whether unconsciously or overtly.

Update 2:55pm Eastern Time, Thursday March 26, 2015: The article has been updated to reflect that the study focused on white, black and Hispanic households and excluded other races and ethnic groups because their populations are too small to produce statistically significant results.

We need to talk about a haircut. Also about identity, and hatred, and maybe about the total end of American civilization — but first about a haircut.

You have seen it. It is short on the sides and long on the top. It is clean and tidy, with a military sheen. It’s been popular among young people for several years. But now this haircut is making us ask ourselves, with seriousness that seems unthinkable in 2016: hipster or Nazi?

The same haircut. The exact same haircut.

In the 1930s, Nazis distinguished themselves by wearing swastikas, an easily identifiable marker that made their odious politics clear. The only defining look of today’s white nationalists — a movement that seeks to form a whites-only state — is the haircut, so popular that the leader of one nationalist group tweets under the handle “Fashy Haircut,” short for “fascist.” And there’s nothing inherently wrong with the haircut — as noted, lots of other guys are wearing it these days, too. But that’s what makes it scary.

For the past half-decade, the haircut, when worn by hipsters, has been known jokingly as the “Hitler Youth,” at least according to a 2011 New York Times fashion article, because of its resemblance to the style popular during Germany’s Third Reich. That off-color nickname, one assumes, started in a different political climate, when it seemed we could be a bit cavalier and ironic with such terminology. Back before we started seeing the haircut on literal white nationalists.

Promoters of white nationalism — or the “alt-right,” as some call it — are coming out of the woodwork now. They say they have been emboldened by Donald Trump’s various calls to ban Muslim immigration into this country and deport millions of undocumented Latin Americans. They have a leader in a man named Richard Spencer, who wears the haircut along with his three-piece Brooks Brothers suits. It’s Hitler Youth rebranded as Hitler Yuppie — an insidious way to blend in.

[After Trump victory, attendance rises at annual white nationalist conference in D.C.]

“I posted on Facebook yesterday that it’s probably time to think about getting rid of my haircut,” says Joseph Phelan, a community organizer and anti-racism activist who lives in Brooklyn and acquired the haircut several years ago at an old-fashioned barber shop. Phelan read a profile on Spencer and was dismayed to learn his haircut is fondly if ironically referred to by many wearers as a “fashy.”

Phelan thinks it’s useful for white nationalists to sport a costume of sorts, so that they might be recognized by the rest of the population. He knows that being upset about a haircut is really being upset about their insidious infiltration into society. “I really wish they would get off my haircut, and get off my people.”

[How America became a grudgeocracy]

The style has its origins in Victorian England, when it was worn by young hooligans known as “scuttlers,” but is most commonly affiliated with the Nazi youth movement of the 1930s and ’40s. Adolf Hitler had a version of it — with a floppy, greasy forelock — and so did his close associate Heinrich Himmler, and so did any young man in a Hitler Youth recruitment poster. Apparently, soldiers requested it because it eased the wearing and removing of their helmets. Flash-forward 70-plus years and there were a whole bunch of those haircuts together at the recent conference of Spencer’s National Policy Institute, worn by men who feel their whiteness has been infringed upon by the “cultural Marxism” of the Americas:

There’s an ironic issue with these men wearing this haircut: Since its long-ago heyday, it has been claimed by others, who are not at all connected to fascist worldview. Quite the opposite. Beginning around 2010 or 2011, it became the haircut of Mackle­more, the Seattle rapper. It became the haircut of several cast members of “Glee,” as well as David Beckham.

The haircut that long ago appealed to the Nazis became, more recently, the choice of fashionable young liberal men, gay and straight. Celebrities sent their high-and-tights, as they called them, around the globe, spawning a generation of imitators and obligatory trend pieces, which noted in 2011 that it had become the preferred cut for the well-coiffed, well-clad, crunchy cosmopolitan.

This is not the first instance of a trademark coiffure that spans political divides. Angry racist skinheads and earnest, lefty straight-edge punks have looked similar for decades. Bushy beards can either signify an artisanal pickler or arsenal-holding survivalist. In this instance, what’s ironic is that the men in white nationalism circles are sporting a hairstyle that’s already been repurposed in the 21st century by young people whose ethos is radical safe-space inclusiveness, not ethnophobic separatism with eugenic undertones.

And it’s probably no coincidence. When these groups look and dress like everyone else, it is easier for their extremism to look outwardly normal.

“We call them ‘nipsters’ — neo-Nazi hipsters,” says Long Nguyen, the co-founder of style magazine Flaunt, using a term that became popular in a 2014 Rolling Stone article. “It’s really important for them to make inroads into young people’s culture, in order to expand their base. It’s a lot easier to do that when they’re stealing the look of a familiar hipster style.”

Nguyen says he first noticed this trend in Germany about a decade ago, when young white nationalists were dressing as hipsters, but also as metal heads and hip-hop aficionados. “It’s a little scary.”

Until a few weeks ago, you saw a man with that haircut and assumed he might be a good person to hit on, or to buy small-batch beer from, or to ask the whereabouts of the nearest bicycle shop. Now you see him and wonder if he’s trying to deport half the nation.

As one hipster wearer of the haircut noted, exasperatedly, on Twitter:

When the Hitler Youth haircut is actually for literal Hitler Youths again so you start planning your mullet. — Scott 🐙 (@scott_riley) November 22, 2016

We say this is the wrong attitude. Let’s just make the white nationalists get a different haircut — so the rest of us can identify them. We even have a few recommendations:

The Dorothy Hamill wedge cut. No one’s really worn it since 1980, so it’s all yours.

The double man bun. We really just want to create a taboo around this look.

The Rachel. Remember how every teenage girl in the ’90s wanted to look like Jennifer Aniston on “Friends”? Nazis, you may now have it.

The Trump. The president-elect remains the only practitioner of this hairstyle, which has been described many different ways. Perhaps it’s time your scalp throws its support behind the man you see as your hero.

So all in all, a good day for America’s largest oil and gas firm.

Using the little-known Congressional Review Act, the House GOP voted on Wednesday to kill an Obama-era regulation that would require publicly traded oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose any payments that they made to foreign governments, including taxes and royalties.

The rule itself dates back to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act — when senators from both parties included a provision requiring greater disclosure from mining and drilling companies working abroad. The hope was to cut down on corruption in resource-rich developing countries by increasing transparency. At the time, as Michael Grunwald reports for Politico, Tillerson was Exxon Mobil’s CEO and flew to Washington, DC, to lobby against this provision, arguing that the rule would put his company at a competitive disadvantage and make it harder to do business in places like Russia.

Tillerson lost that battle, and Congress passed Dodd-Frank with the provision intact. Over the next six years, the Securities and Exchange Commission worked to craft a rule that would give the legislation teeth. But the SEC’s first attempt at regulation was struck down by the courts in 2012, and crafting a replacement was a long, tangled process. The rule didn’t actually get finished until June 27, 2016.

That foot-dragging proved significant: Under the Congressional Review Act, the House and Senate can basically vote to repeal any Obama-era regulation finalized after June 13, 2016, by a simple majority vote — as long as the president agrees. And the SEC’s “resource extraction rule,” detested by the oil industry, was one of the first rules the GOP decided to target using the CRA.

The American Petroleum Institute has long argued that the rule is unnecessary — after all, it’s already illegal for oil and gas companies to bribe governments under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These new disclosure requirements would simply add extra costs and make it harder for US mining and drilling companies to operate overseas. Publicly traded oil companies like Exxon Mobil were also concerned that the disclosure forms would reveal valuable information about individual projects, giving their state-owned and privately held competitors an unfair advantage.

Supporters of the rule, for their part, argued that the rule wasn’t substantially different from similar requirements in Canada and Europe. Foreign companies like BP and Royal Dutch Shell now regularly report taxes, bonuses, and other payments to foreign governments. Why shouldn’t American oil majors like Chevron and Exxon Mobil?

“The US had been at the forefront on the transparency issue, with more than 30 countries following in its footsteps to pass similar legislation,” said Isabel Munilla of Oxfam International, in a statement. “State-owned companies from Brazil, China, and Russia are all now required to disclose their payments. If the Senate follows suit in overturning this rule, the US will go from a leader into a laggard.”

Now that the House has voted to kill the rule, the Senate will take it’s own vote — and no filibuster is allowed. If the rule does get overturned, there’s some uncertainty on what happens next. Under the Congressional Review Act, the SEC is barred from crafting a new rule that has “substantially the same form” as the repealed regulation. But Dodd-Frank technically still requires the SEC to come up with a transparency rule. The CRA has only been used once before, so it’s unclear how this might play out in future litigation.

Further reading:CORBIN, Kentucky — Kathy Oller is so committed to her job signing up fellow Kentuckians for Obamacare that last Halloween, she dressed up as a cat, set up a booth at a trick-or-treat event, and urged people to get on the rolls. She’s enrolled so many people in the past three years that she long ago lost count.

Update: Watch interview with President Obama on the future of Obamacare

“Must be somewhere in the thousands,” she said to me one morning at a local buffet restaurant where she’d just finished an enrollment event with the staff.

The health care law has helped lots of people in Whitley County, where Oller works. The uninsured rate has fallen from 25 percent in 2013 to 10 percent today, according to data from the nonprofit Enroll America. Overall, Kentucky is now tied with West Virginia for the biggest increase in health coverage.

But Obamacare’s success in Whitley County and across Kentucky hasn’t translated into political support for the law. In fact, 82 percent of Whitley voters supported Donald Trump in the presidential election, even though he promised to repeal it.

Oller voted for Trump too.

“I found with Trump, he says a lot of stuff,” she said. “I just think all politicians promise you everything and then we’ll see. It’s like when you get married — ‘Oh, honey, I won’t do this, oh, honey, I won’t do that.’”

I spent last week in southeastern Kentucky talking to Obamacare enrollees, all of whom supported Trump in the election, trying to understand how the health care law factored into their decisions.

Many expressed frustration that Obamacare plans cost way too much, that premiums and deductibles had spiraled out of control. And part of their anger was wrapped up in the idea that other people were getting even better, even cheaper benefits — and those other people did not deserve the help.

There was a persistent belief that Trump would fix these problems and make Obamacare work better. I kept hearing informed voters, who had watched the election closely, say they did hear the promise of repeal but simply felt Trump couldn’t repeal a law that had done so much good for them. In fact, some of the people I talked to hope that one of the more divisive pieces of the law — Medicaid expansion — might become even more robust, offering more of the working poor a chance at the same coverage the very poor receive.

The political reality in Washington, however, looks much different: Republicans are dead set on repealing the Affordable Care Act. The plans they have proposed so far would leave millions of people without insurance and make it harder for sicker, older Americans to access coverage. No version of a Republican plan would keep the Medicaid expansion as Obamacare envisions it.

The question is not whether Republicans will end coverage for millions. It is when they will do it. Oller’s three years of work could very much be undone over the next three years.

In southeastern Kentucky, that idea didn’t seem to penetrate at all — not to Oller, and not to the people she signed up for coverage.

“We all need it,” Oller told me when I asked about the fact that Trump and congressional Republicans had promised Obamacare repeal. “You can’t get rid of it.”

“I’m really having a problem with the people that don’t want to work”

Corbin is a small town in southeastern Kentucky, a place where cross-country truckers driving up and down I-75 will stop for the night. Its biggest tourist attraction is the first Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, which boasts an impressive collection of Harland Sanders memorabilia.

Oller has traveled around Corbin enrolling residents in health care plans since the coverage expansion started in 2014. And lately, she says, she’s watched the plans get more and more expensive.

“I like being able to give people good news, but it’s not always good news with Healthcare.gov, with the amount that premiums went up and the larger deductibles,” she says.

Premiums for midrange plans increased 22 percent nationally this year. That is, however, before the premium subsidies, which 80 percent of marketplace enrollees use — and which significantly lower the cost of coverage.

Narrow networks have become a problem in the area too. When Oller hosted an enrollment event at a hospital, she had to warn the enrollees that they couldn’t use their insurance at that particular facility.

Oller renewed a 59-year-old woman’s coverage (who asked her personal information be left out of this story) just after lunchtime on a Tuesday. She and her husband received a monthly tax credit that would cover most of their premium. But they would still need to contribute $244 each month — and face a $6,000 deductible.

The woman said she had insurance before the Affordable Care Act that was significantly more affordable, with $5 copays and no deductible at all. She said she paid only $200 or $300 each month without a subsidy.

The deductible left her exasperated. “I am totally afraid to be sick,” she says. “I don’t have [that money] to pay upfront if I go to the hospital tomorrow.”

Her plan did offer free preventive care, an Obamacare mandate. But she skips mammograms and colonoscopies because she doesn’t think she’d have the money to pay for any follow-up care if the doctors did detect something.

The woman said she only buys insurance as financial protection — “to keep from losing my house if something major happened,” she says. “But I’m not using it to go to the doctor. I’ve not used anything.”

The woman was mad because her costs felt overwhelmingly expensive. These are some of the most common frustrations with the Affordable Care Act. Surveys show that high deductibles are the top complaint; 47 percent of enrollees told the Kaiser Family Foundation they were dissatisfied with their deductible.

A study from the Commonwealth Fund earlier this year found that four in 10 adults on Affordable Care Act plans didn’t think they could afford to go to the doctor if they got sick. Fewer than half said it was easy to find an affordable plan.

But her frustration isn’t just about the money she has to pay. She sees other people signing up for Medicaid, the health program for the poor that is arguably better coverage than she receives and almost free for enrollees. She is not eligible for Medicaid because her husband works and they are above the earnings threshold.

Medicaid is reserved for people who earn less than 138 percent of the poverty line — about $22,000 for a couple. This woman understood the Medicaid expansion is also part of Obamacare, and she doesn’t think the system is fair.

“They can go to the emergency room for a headache,” she says. “They’re going to the doctor for pills, and that’s what they’re on.”

She felt like this happened a lot to her: that she and her husband have worked most their lives but don’t seem to get nearly as much help as the poorer people she knows. She told a story about when she used to work as a school secretary: “They had a Christmas program. Some of the area programs would talk to teachers, and ask for a list of their poorest kids and get them clothes and toys and stuff. They’re not the ones who need help. They’re the ones getting the welfare and food stamps. I’m the one who is the working poor.”

Oller, the enrollment worker, expressed similar ideas the day we met.

“I really think Medicaid is good, but I’m really having a problem with the people that don’t want to work,” she said. “Us middle-class people are really, really upset about having to work constantly, and then these people are not responsible.”

Oller had told me earlier that she had enrolled on Medicaid for a few months, right before she started this job. She was taking some time off to care for her husband, who has cancer and was in chemotherapy treatment. I asked how she felt about enrolling in a program she sometimes criticizes.

“Oh, no,” she said quickly. “I worked my whole life, so I know I paid into it. I just felt like it was a time that I needed it. That’s what the system is set up for.”

“I guess I thought that, you know, he would not do this”

Before I went to Kentucky, I did about half a dozen interviews with experts on why the state had voting so resoundingly for politicians who want to dismantle Obamacare.

I kept hearing the same theory over and over again: Kentuckians just did not understand that what they signed up for was part of Obamacare. If they had, certainly they would have voted to save the law.

Kentucky had been deliberate in trying to hide Obamacare’s role in its coverage expansion. The state built a marketplace called Kynect where consumers could shop for the law’s private plans, in part to obscure the fact that it had anything to do with the unpopular federal law.

“We wanted to get as far away from the word Obamacare as we could,” Steve Beshear, the former Kentucky governor who oversaw the effort, says. “Polls at the time in Kentucky showed that Obamacare was disapproved of by maybe 60 percent of the people.”

I heard from Obamacare enrollment counselors who had seen this confusion play out firsthand, too. “When we’re approaching people about getting signed up on health care, one of the first questions they have is, ‘Is this Obamacare?’” says Michael Wynn, one of Oller’s co-workers. “So we would tell them, ‘No, this is not Obamacare. This is a state-run plan.’”

This was a story I heard a lot, but it was not the one that fit the Obamacare enrollees I met. All but one knew full well that the coverage was part of Obamacare. They voted for Trump because they were concerned about other issues — and just couldn’t fathom the idea that this new coverage would be taken away from them.

“I guess I thought that, you know, he would not do this, he would not take health insurance away knowing it would affect so many peoples lives,” says Debbie Mills, an Obamacare enrollee who supported Trump. “I mean, what are you to do then if you cannot pay for insurance?”

Mills and her husband run a furniture store. They used to buy their own health insurance in the early 2000s, but the premiums became unaffordable, surpassing $1,200. They had gone without coverage for two years, paying cash for doctor visits, until the Affordable Care Act began.

“It’s made it affordable,” Mills says of Healthcare.gov. This year, she received generous tax credits and paid a $115 monthly premium for a plan that covered herself, her husband, and her 19-year-old son.

Earlier this year, Mills’s husband was diagnosed with non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. He is now on the waiting list for a liver transplant. Obamacare’s promise of health coverage, she says, has become absolutely vital in their lives.

Her enrollment process wasn’t seamless; there were calls back and forth to different insurance companies and hospitals to make sure certain providers were in network. But she ultimately finished the process pretty happy, selecting a more robust plan for 2017 with a $280 monthly premium for herself, her husband, and her son.

As Mills waited to fill out the enrollment paperwork, we began to talk about her vote for Donald Trump one month earlier.

“We were wanting change,” she said. “We’re in an area with a lot of coal. When people aren’t in the coal mines, they’re not spending and buying in our area.” She said she thought Trump, a successful businessman, would have a better shot at fixing all that.

I asked her if she had followed the campaign and heard the candidates talk about repealing Obamacare. “I did, yeah,” she said. “That was the only thing I did not like about him.”

This was the conversation that followed, beginning with another question I asked:

Are you surprised how much Republicans are talking about repeal? No. ﻿Did you expect — do you think they'll do it, or do you think it'll be too hard? I'm hoping that they don't, ’cause, I mean, what would they do then? Would this go away? Yes, possibly. The insurance? ﻿It will go, if they repeal it. I mean, that's what they promised to do in so many elections. Right ... so ... I don't know. ...

We spoke a good deal longer about the Affordable Care Act, and the possibility of repeal. Mills said she had gone into the voting booth confident that Republicans wouldn’t dismantle the law, despite their promises. How could they, when people like her had become so reliant on it?

Mills’s expectation that Trump would keep the Affordable Care Act, on the one hand, feel unrealistic: Of course Republicans would dismantle the law they spent six years campaigning against.

But it is also understandable: Legislators typically don’t dismantle large health coverage programs that serve millions. Since their creation in 1965, Medicare and Medicaid have certainly faced some opposition but never threats of outright repeal.

“I assumed it was impossible to repeal the ACA with 20 million people covered,” Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, recently tweeted. “I may have been wrong about that.”

Donald Trump, meanwhile, made promises during campaign interviews that sharply diverged from his actual campaign stances. He promised, "I am going to take care of everybody,” during an interview with 60 Minutes — even though his health plan would leave 21 million without coverage.

The day after talking to Mills, I started to think about a headline I wrote for Vox a few years ago.

It was right after the Supreme Court upheld the health law in the King v. Burwell decision. “Obamacare’s final test: it survived the Supreme Court, and is here to stay,” the headline read. I quoted experts who said that because Obamacare had so many enrollees, of course Republicans wouldn’t dare dismantle it. One leading Obamacare advocate promised that “the ACA is a permanent part of the American health care system."

We used the same logic that Mills did. We thought, of course you can’t take away a program that millions of Americans rely on.

I spent election night frantically reporting and calling sources, trying to understand what parts of Obamacare Republicans could and couldn’t dismantle. I didn’t know at the time, nor had I devoted the necessary time to learn, until election night.

Mills was wrong about what Republicans would do to Obamacare. But then again, I write about it for a living. And I was wrong too.

“It was Russian roulette, but I felt that we needed change”

The Kentucky voters I spoke with constantly mentioned “change” as a reason they supported Trump.

“That man has a head for business,” one enrollee said. “He will absolutely do his best to change things.”

Still, Oller acknowledged she took a leap of faith with Trump.

“It was Russian roulette,” Oller said of her vote. “But I felt that we needed change.”

Trump will almost certainly bring change to Obamacare. Republicans are moving quickly on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a new policy. The current proposals suggest that policy will be better for the young, rich, and healthy — but worse for the poor, sick, or old. The type of people I spoke with in Kentucky are those at risk of being disadvantaged by some of the replacement ideas.

Consider the case of the 59-year-old who was frustrated with the cost of coverage under Obamacare.

The Republican plans might do some things that would be good for her. They would likely stop requiring insurers to cover a specific set of benefits, like the preventive care that she doesn’t use. That would drive down her premiums, but wouldn’t get her any closer to better health care access.

And there are plenty of changes that make it more likely her premiums would go up.

Right now she and her husband will receive $8,496 in subsidies toward their insurance premiums in 2017. Under the plan proposed by Rep. Tom Price, the Georgia Congress member whom Trump has selected to run the Health and Human Services Department, their subsidy would drop to $6,000.

Obamacare increases her tax credit if her income goes down. But the Republican plans don’t do that. The Price plan, for example, gives everyone over the age of 50 — whether that is this woman in Kentucky or Bill Gates out in Seattle — the exact same tax credit on the individual market.

Obamacare currently limits how much insurers can charge older patients like Ruby. It says that insurance companies can only charge its oldest patients three times as much as the youngest ones. But the Price plan would get rid of that requirement and let insurers charge older patients — who tend to need more health care — whatever they want.

Debbie Mills and I spoke for about an hour about Obamacare. By the end of the conversation, it had moved from me interviewing her to her asking a few questions about what might change and whether the coverage she would sign up for in a few minutes would still be valid.

I ended up reassuring Mills that nothing would change for her coverage in 2017, and likely not 2018 — but that wasn’t a guarantee. I didn’t know what would happen either.

Our interview began to make her a bit nervous.

“You’re scaring me now on the insurance part,” she said. “I’m afraid now that the insurance is going to go away and we’re going to be up a creek.”

Watch: Repealing Obamacare could change millions of livesOn Tuesday, Donald Trump tapped ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be his secretary of state. And one eyebrow-raising aspect of this pick is that Exxon could potentially have billions of dollars at stake in one of the biggest foreign policy decisions Trump will consider over the next few years — whether to maintain sanctions on Russia.

Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, has long had its eye on Russia’s vast oil and gas deposits. Between 2011 and 2013, Exxon signed a series of deals with the Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft to explore the Black Sea, develop shale resources in western Siberia, and — most importantly — drill for oil in the Arctic, one of the biggest untapped fossil fuel resources left in the world.

For Exxon, which famously missed out on the massive US fracking boom, these deals were crucial for the company’s future. “Arctic oil in particular would’ve been a game changer for Exxon,” says Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. The company hoped this would be a decades-long investment worth many billions.

But Exxon’s Arctic dreams fell apart in 2014, after the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia’s oil industry over Russian incursions into Ukraine. Despite having just made a tantalizing oil discovery in the Kara Sea, Exxon was forced to stop work — and exploration in the Russian Arctic has been on hold ever since.

At the time, Tillerson told shareholders that he was opposed to targeted sanctions on Russia: “We do not support sanctions, generally, because we don’t find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented comprehensively,” he said in May 2014. His new boss appears to agree: Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, recently said Trump was not yet sure whether he’d keep those Russian sanctions in place.

The potential conflicts of interest here are considerable: Tillerson himself owns $218 million in Exxon stock and a pension reportedly worth $70 million, though it’s not clear what he’ll do with those investments once he joins the Trump administration. What we do know is that Tillerson could soon find himself in a position of influence over the sanctions question — and that lifting them could prove a major boon to Exxon. It’s conceivable Tillerson could stay impartial and judge the issue purely on its policy merits, but this conflict will be looming in the background.

The issue is also of keen interest to Russian President Vladimir Putin (not to mention those keeping an eye on global warming). If those sanctions aren’t lifted, and if Russia can’t lure back Western oil companies, then the country is facing an inexorable decline in its oil and gas production in the coming years — which, if handled poorly, could devastate the government budget and the economy. In a lot of ways, Putin and Exxon need each other. And Tillerson is now in the middle.

How Exxon became so deeply invested in Russian oil

ExxonMobil has been interested in Russia ever since the 1990s, when former CEO Lee Raymond tried (and failed) to buy a stake in the Russian energy giant Yukos. During that period, Tillerson was overseeing an Exxon oil and gas project on Russia’s Sakhalin island and reportedly came to know Putin well during that time.

Tillerson took the helm of Exxon in 2006, at a time when global oil prices were rising and many of the easiest-to-drill fields around the world were already developed. Increasingly, energy companies were looking to new frontiers like Russia, which has more than $8.2 trillion in untapped oil and gas, according to Bloomberg, particularly in the icy Arctic. For its part, Russia needed Western expertise to develop these resources.

Other Western companies, including Chevron and BP, tried to pitch themselves as the answer to Russia’s woes. But it was Tillerson and Exxon that finally managed to ink a series of deals with Rosneft to explore for oil in the Black Sea, to exploit shale resources in western Siberia, and to develop three blocks in the Kara Sea in the Arctic— a region that Rosneft claims could hold more oil than the entire Gulf of Mexico.

Exxon and Rosneft invested $3.2 billion in the Kara Sea project — with the hope that this bet would eventually be repaid many times over. The next year, Putin awarded Tillerson Russia’s Order of Friendship medal for his company's oil work in the country.

But everything hit a snag in 2014 after Russian forces moved into Ukraine and annexed Crimea. In response, the Obama administration put in place US sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas industry that forbid technology transfers and told Exxon it was to halt all offshore drilling work with Rosneft by the end of September.

The timing was brutal for Exxon: The company was drilling a pilot borehole in Block 1 of the Kara Sea — and had just discovered rock containing an estimated 750 million barrels of oil, Rosneft claimed. Igor Sechin, the CEO of Rosneft and a close Putin ally, had christened the field “Pobeda,” or Victory.

Although Tillerson was opposed to the sanctions, Exxon did not fight the policy (apart from asking for a short extension to wind down its affairs). The company ended its work in the Kara Sea in late September and left the country. Rosneft has put its Arctic exploration on hold.

Why the end of US sanctions could be a huge deal for Exxon — and a bigger deal to Russia

It’s still unclear what Donald Trump plans to do about US sanctions on Russia. But he’s certainly offered hints that he’d seriously consider lifting them. “If we can make a great deal for our country and get along with Russia, that would be a tremendous thing. I would love to try it," he said in April. In December, when asked about sanctions directly, Trump’s chief of staff cryptically said, “You have to just wait and see.”

For Russia, the lifting of sanctions could be a huge win. The country is currently one of the world’s largest producers of crude, pumping out 10 million barrels per day (about 10 percent of global supply). But its older fields are in decline, and the country is unlikely to sustain current levels of production past 2020 unless it develops its untapped fields, a recent report from the Wilson Center found. Given that oil and tax revenues fund half of Russia’s national budget, a long-term decline would have severe repercussions for the country, perhaps even risking political instability.

To avoid that fate, Russia desperately needs to bring back Western companies with the expertise to drill in harder-to-access areas like the Arctic. “If Russia could do this all by itself, without Western help, they already would’ve done it,” says Edward Chow, a longtime industry veteran who is now an energy policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But they can’t.”

If Trump ends up lifting the sanctions, Exxon is likely to resume its Arctic exploration efforts with Rosneft in short order, ExxonMobil’s head of operations in Russia, Glenn Waller, said back in April. Analysts say the company is unlikely to be deterred by current low oil prices. “Exxon realizes this is a long-term decision, and they need to be patient,” says Gheit. “We’re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over the next 30 to 40 years.” (Though, to be sure, there’s no guarantee Exxon can succeed in producing oil from the Arctic — note that Shell famously came up empty after investing billions in the treacherous Chukchi Sea north of Alaska.)

Exxon would also likely resume its exploration for oil in the Black Sea — and try to tap the untapped shale formations in western Siberia. “They’d basically try to bring some of the tight oil techniques perfected in the United States into Russia,” says Chow.

For Exxon, the stakes are also high. The company currently has proven reserves of nearly 25 billion barrels of oil equivalent. But it needs to keep adding to those reserves to keep share prices high, and it’s struggled to do so since 2006. The company was late to the shale boom sweeping the United States — and when it finally tried to get into the action, it overpaid in 2010 for a shale gas company, XTO.

Russia is one of the few big prizes still available for Exxon. “The Arctic is the equivalent of shale in the US — and they’d be the first company to claim they had potential there,” says Gheit. “It’s absolutely very important to them.”

The resumption of Arctic oil exploration would also have potentially large ramifications for climate change. If the world wants to keep global warming below 2°C, the internationally agreed-on goal, it needs to sharply reduce fossil fuel use. The opening up of a vast new reservoir — by some accounts, 20 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and gas lie in the Arctic — could make those efforts much more difficult.

Yet there’s little indication that this would be a serious consideration for Tillerson. While he has said that climate change is real, he has also scoffed at efforts to reduce oil and gas use. “To say that you’re addicted to oil and natural gas,” he once told Fortune magazine, “seems to me to say you’re addicted to economic growth.”

The big question: What will Tillerson actually do about sanctions?

Now, to be clear: We still don’t know whether Tillerson will lobby to lift sanctions as secretary of state — let alone that he would do so solely to help Exxon. He hasn’t said anything on the subject since being picked. And the Trump administration has been hinting about removing sanctions since long before Tillerson was announced.

But this conflict will very much hang in the air: Tillerson has worked at Exxon his entire adult life, and his retirement plan is tied up in the company’s fortunes unless he sells off his stocks. When his nomination comes before the Senate next year, Democrats and Republicans alike will have every reason to question whether he can really be impartial on this issue.Two hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jim Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal. Thirty-five years of racist housing policy. Until we reckon with our compounding moral debts, America will never be whole.

— John Locke, “Second Treatise” By our unpaid labor and suffering, we have earned the right to the soil, many times over and over, and now we are determined to have it. — Anonymous, 1861 I. “So That’s Just One Of My Losses” Clyde Ross was born in 1923, the seventh of 13 children, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, the home of the blues. Ross’s parents owned and farmed a 40-acre tract of land, flush with cows, hogs, and mules. Ross’s mother would drive to Clarksdale to do her shopping in a horse and buggy, in which she invested all the pride one might place in a Cadillac. The family owned another horse, with a red coat, which they gave to Clyde. The Ross family wanted for little, save that which all black families in the Deep South then desperately desired—the protection of the law. In the 1920s, Jim Crow Mississippi was, in all facets of society, a kleptocracy. The majority of the people in the state were perpetually robbed of the vote—a hijacking engineered through the trickery of the poll tax and the muscle of the lynch mob. Between 1882 and 1968, more black people were lynched in Mississippi than in any other state. “You and I know what’s the best way to keep the nigger from voting,” blustered Theodore Bilbo, a Mississippi senator and a proud Klansman. “You do it the night before the election.”

The state’s regime partnered robbery of the franchise with robbery of the purse. Many of Mississippi’s black farmers lived in debt peonage, under the sway of cotton kings who were at once their landlords, their employers, and their primary merchants. Tools and necessities were advanced against the return on the crop, which was determined by the employer. When farmers were deemed to be in debt—and they often were—the negative balance was then carried over to the next season. A man or woman who protested this arrangement did so at the risk of grave injury or death. Refusing to work meant arrest under vagrancy laws and forced labor under the state’s penal system. Well into the 20th century, black people spoke of their flight from Mississippi in much the same manner as their runagate ancestors had. In her 2010 book, The Warmth of Other Suns, Isabel Wilkerson tells the story of Eddie Earvin, a spinach picker who fled Mississippi in 1963, after being made to work at gunpoint. “You didn’t talk about it or tell nobody,” Earvin said. “You had to sneak away.” “Some of the land taken from black families has become a country club in Virginia,” the AP reported. When Clyde Ross was still a child, Mississippi authorities claimed his father owed $3,000 in back taxes. The elder Ross could not read. He did not have a lawyer. He did not know anyone at the local courthouse. He could not expect the police to be impartial. Effectively, the Ross family had no way to contest the claim and no protection under the law. The authorities seized the land. They seized the buggy. They took the cows, hogs, and mules. And so for the upkeep of separate but equal, the entire Ross family was reduced to sharecropping.

This was hardly unusual. In 2001, the Associated Press published a three-part investigation into the theft of black-owned land stretching back to the antebellum period. The series documented some 406 victims and 24,000 acres of land valued at tens of millions of dollars. The land was taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism. “Some of the land taken from black families has become a country club in Virginia,” the AP reported, as well as “oil fields in Mississippi” and “a baseball spring training facility in Florida.” Clyde Ross was a smart child. His teacher thought he should attend a more challenging school. There was very little support for educating black people in Mississippi. But Julius Rosenwald, a part owner of Sears, Roebuck, had begun an ambitious effort to build schools for black children throughout the South. Ross’s teacher believed he should attend the local Rosenwald school. It was too far for Ross to walk and get back in time to work in the fields. Local white children had a school bus. Clyde Ross did not, and thus lost the chance to better his education. Then, when Ross was 10 years old, a group of white men demanded his only childhood possession—the horse with the red coat. “You can’t have this horse. We want it,” one of the white men said. They gave Ross’s father $17. “I did everything for that horse,” Ross told me. “Everything. And they took him. Put him on the racetrack. I never did know what happened to him after that, but I know they didn’t bring him back. So that’s just one of my losses.”

The losses mounted. As sharecroppers, the Ross family saw their wages treated as the landlord’s slush fund. Landowners were supposed to split the profits from the cotton fields with sharecroppers. But bales would often disappear during the count, or the split might be altered on a whim. If cotton was selling for 50 cents a pound, the Ross family might get 15 cents, or only five. One year Ross’s mother promised to buy him a $7 suit for a summer program at their church. She ordered the suit by mail. But that year Ross’s family was paid only five cents a pound for cotton. The mailman arrived with the suit. The Rosses could not pay. The suit was sent back. Clyde Ross did not go to the church program. reporter’s notebook

Elegant Racism

“If you sought to advantage one group of Americans and disadvantage another, you could scarcely choose a more graceful method than housing discrimination.”

Read more It was in these early years that Ross began to understand himself as an American—he did not live under the blind decree of justice, but under the heel of a regime that elevated armed robbery to a governing principle. He thought about fighting. “Just be quiet,” his father told him. “Because they’ll come and kill us all.”

Clyde Ross grew. He was drafted into the Army. The draft officials offered him an exemption if he stayed home and worked. He preferred to take his chances with war. He was stationed in California. He found that he could go into stores without being bothered. He could walk the streets without being harassed. He could go into a restaurant and receive service. Ross was shipped off to Guam. He fought in World War II to save the world from tyranny. But when he returned to Clarksdale, he found that tyranny had followed him home. This was 1947, eight years before Mississippi lynched Emmett Till and tossed his broken body into the Tallahatchie River. The Great Migration, a mass exodus of 6 million African Americans that spanned most of the 20th century, was now in its second wave. The black pilgrims did not journey north simply seeking better wages and work, or bright lights and big adventures. They were fleeing the acquisitive warlords of the South. They were seeking the protection of the law. Clyde Ross was among them. He came to Chicago in 1947 and took a job as a taster at Campbell’s Soup. He made a stable wage. He married. He had children. His paycheck was his own. No Klansmen stripped him of the vote. When he walked down the street, he did not have to move because a white man was walking past. He did not have to take off his hat or avert his gaze. His journey from peonage to full citizenship seemed near-complete. Only one item was missing—a home, that final badge of entry into the sacred order of the American middle class of the Eisenhower years.

In 1961, Ross and his wife bought a house in North Lawndale, a bustling community on Chicago’s West Side. North Lawndale had long been a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, but a handful of middle-class African Americans had lived there starting in the ’40s. The community was anchored by the sprawling Sears, Roebuck headquarters. North Lawndale’s Jewish People’s Institute actively encouraged blacks to move into the neighborhood, seeking to make it a “pilot community for interracial living.” In the battle for integration then being fought around the country, North Lawndale seemed to offer promising terrain. But out in the tall grass, highwaymen, nefarious as any Clarksdale kleptocrat, were lying in wait. From the 1930s through the 1960s, black people across the country were largely cut out of the legitimate home-mortgage market. Three months after Clyde Ross moved into his house, the boiler blew out. This would normally be a homeowner’s responsibility, but in fact, Ross was not really a homeowner. His payments were made to the seller, not the bank. And Ross had not signed a normal mortgage. He’d bought “on contract”: a predatory agreement that combined all the responsibilities of homeownership with all the disadvantages of renting—while offering the benefits of neither. Ross had bought his house for $27,500. The seller, not the previous homeowner but a new kind of middleman, had bought it for only $12,000 six months before selling it to Ross. In a contract sale, the seller kept the deed until the contract was paid in full—and, unlike with a normal mortgage, Ross would acquire no equity in the meantime. If he missed a single payment, he would immediately forfeit his $1,000 down payment, all his monthly payments, and the property itself.

The men who peddled contracts in North Lawndale would sell homes at inflated prices and then evict families who could not pay—taking their down payment and their monthly installments as profit. Then they’d bring in another black family, rinse, and repeat. “He loads them up with payments they can’t meet,” an office secretary told The Chicago Daily News of her boss, the speculator Lou Fushanis, in 1963. “Then he takes the property away from them. He’s sold some of the buildings three or four times.” Ross had tried to get a legitimate mortgage in another neighborhood, but was told by a loan officer that there was no financing available. The truth was that there was no financing for people like Clyde Ross. From the 1930s through the 1960s, black people across the country were largely cut out of the legitimate home-mortgage market through means both legal and extralegal. Chicago whites employed every measure, from “restrictive covenants” to bombings, to keep their neighborhoods segregated. Their efforts were buttressed by the federal government. In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA insured private mortgages, causing a drop in interest rates and a decline in the size of the down payment required to buy a house. But an insured mortgage was not a possibility for Clyde Ross. The FHA had adopted a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability. On the maps, green areas, rated “A,” indicated “in demand” neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked “a single foreigner or Negro.” These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated “D” and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red. Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered. Black people were viewed as a contagion. Redlining went beyond FHA-backed loans and spread to the entire mortgage industry, which was already rife with racism, excluding black people from most legitimate means of obtaining a mortgage. Explore Redlining in Chicago “A government offering such bounty to builders and lenders could have required compliance with a nondiscrimination policy,” Charles Abrams, the urban-studies expert who helped create the New York City Housing Authority, wrote in 1955. “Instead, the FHA adopted a racial policy that could well have been culled from the Nuremberg laws.”

The devastating effects are cogently outlined by Melvin L. Oliver and Thomas M. Shapiro in their 1995 book, Black Wealth/White Wealth: Locked out of the greatest mass-based opportunity for wealth accumulation in American history, African Americans who desired and were able to afford home ownership found themselves consigned to central-city communities where their investments were affected by the “self-fulfilling prophecies” of the FHA appraisers: cut off from sources of new investment[,] their homes and communities deteriorated and lost value in comparison to those homes and communities that FHA appraisers deemed desirable. In Chicago and across the country, whites looking to achieve the American dream could rely on a legitimate credit system backed by the government. Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport. “It was like people who like to go out and shoot lions in Africa. It was the same thrill,” a housing attorney told the historian Beryl Satter in her 2009 book, Family Properties. “The thrill of the chase and the kill.” reporter’s notebook

The American Case Against a Black Middle Class

“When a black family in Chicago saves up enough to move out of the crowded slums into Cicero, the neighborhood riots.”

Read more The kill was profitable. At the time of his death, Lou Fushanis owned more than 600 properties, many of them in North Lawndale, and his estate was estimated to be worth $3 million. He’d made much of this money by exploiting the frustrated hopes of black migrants like Clyde Ross. During this period, according to one estimate, 85 percent of all black home buyers who bought in Chicago bought on contract. “If anybody who is well established in this business in Chicago doesn’t earn $100,000 a year,” a contract seller told The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, “he is loafing.”

Contract sellers became rich. North Lawndale became a ghetto. Clyde Ross still lives there. He still owns his home. He is 91, and the emblems of survival are all around him—awards for service in his community, pictures of his children in cap and gown. But when I asked him about his home in North Lawndale, I heard only anarchy. “We were ashamed. We did not want anyone to know that we were that ignorant,” Ross told me. He was sitting at his dining-room table. His glasses were as thick as his Clarksdale drawl. “I’d come out of Mississippi where there was one mess, and come up here and got in another mess. So how dumb am I? I didn’t want anyone to know how dumb I was. “When I found myself caught up in it, I said, ‘How? I just left this mess. I just left no laws. And no regard. And then I come here and get cheated wide open.’ I would probably want to do some harm to some people, you know, if I had been violent like some of us. I thought, ‘Man, I got caught up in this stuff. I can’t even take care of my kids.’ I didn’t have enough for my kids. You could fall through the cracks easy fighting these white people. And no law.” Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport. But fight Clyde Ross did. In 1968 he joined the newly formed Contract Buyers League—a collection of black homeowners on Chicago’s South and West Sides, all of whom had been locked into the same system of predation. There was Howell Collins, whose contract called for him to pay $25,500 for a house that a speculator had bought for $14,500. There was Ruth Wells, who’d managed to pay out half her contract, expecting a mortgage, only to suddenly see an insurance bill materialize out of thin air—a requirement the seller had added without Wells’s knowledge. Contract sellers used every tool at their disposal to pilfer from their clients. They scared white residents into selling low. They lied about properties’ compliance with building codes, then left the buyer responsible when city inspectors arrived. They presented themselves as real-estate brokers, when in fact they were the owners. They guided their clients to lawyers who were in on the scheme.

The Contract Buyers League fought back. Members—who would eventually number more than 500—went out to the posh suburbs where the speculators lived and embarrassed them by knocking on their neighbors’ doors and informing them of the details of the contract-lending trade. They refused to pay their installments, instead holding monthly payments in an escrow account. Then they brought a suit against the contract sellers, accusing them of buying properties and reselling in such a manner “to reap from members of the Negro race large and unjust profits.”

In return for the “deprivations of their rights and privileges under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments,” the league demanded “prayers for relief”—payback of all moneys paid on contracts and all moneys paid for structural improvement of properties, at 6 percent interest minus a “fair, non-discriminatory” rental price for time of occupation. Moreover, the league asked the court to adjudge that the defendants had “acted willfully and maliciously and that malice is the gist of this action.”

Ross and the Contract Buyers League were no longer appealing to the government simply for equality. They were no longer fleeing in hopes of a better deal elsewhere. They were charging society with a crime against their community. They wanted the crime publicly ruled as such. They wanted the crime’s executors declared to be offensive to society. And they wanted restitution for the great injury brought upon them by said offenders. In 1968, Clyde Ross and the Contract Buyers League were no longer simply seeking the protection of the law. They were seeking reparations. II. “A Difference of Kind, Not Degree” According to the most-recent statistics, North Lawndale is now on the wrong end of virtually every socioeconomic indicator. In 1930 its population was 112,000. Today it is 36,000. The halcyon talk of “interracial living” is dead. The neighborhood is 92 percent black. Its homicide rate is 45 per 100,000—triple the rate of the city as a whole. The infant-mortality rate is 14 per 1,000—more than twice the national average. Forty-three percent of the people in North Lawndale live below the poverty line—double Chicago’s overall rate. Forty-five percent of all households are on food stamps—nearly three times the rate of the city at large. Sears, Roebuck left the neighborhood in 1987, taking 1,800 jobs with it. Kids in North Lawndale need not be confused about their prospects: Cook County’s Juvenile Temporary Detention Center sits directly adjacent to the neighborhood.

North Lawndale is an extreme portrait of the trends that ail black Chicago. Such is the magnitude of these ailments that it can be said that blacks and whites do not inhabit the same city. The average per capita income of Chicago’s white neighborhoods is almost three times that of its black neighborhoods. When the Harvard sociologist Robert J. Sampson examined incarceration rates in Chicago in his 2012 book, Great American City, he found that a black neighborhood with one of the highest incarceration rates (West Garfield Park) had a rate more than 40 times as high as the white neighborhood with the highest rate (Clearing). “This is a staggering differential, even for community-level comparisons,” Sampson writes. “A difference of kind, not degree.”

In other words, Chicago’s impoverished black neighborhoods—characterized by high unemployment and households headed by single parents—are not simply poor; they are “ecologically distinct.” This “is not simply the same thing as low economic status,” writes Sampson. “In this pattern Chicago is not alone.”

The lives of black Americans are better than they were half a century ago. The humiliation of Whites Only signs are gone. Rates of black poverty have decreased. Black teen-pregnancy rates are at record lows—and the gap between black and white teen-pregnancy rates has shrunk significantly. But such progress rests on a shaky foundation, and fault lines are everywhere. The income gap between black and white households is roughly the same today as it was in 1970. Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, studied children born from 1955 through 1970 and found that 4 percent of whites and 62 percent of blacks across America had been raised in poor neighborhoods. A generation later, the same study showed, virtually nothing had changed. And whereas whites born into affluent neighborhoods tended to remain in affluent neighborhoods, blacks tended to fall out of them. This is not surprising. Black families, regardless of income, are significantly less wealthy than white families. The Pew Research Center estimates that white households are worth roughly 20 times as much as black households, and that whereas only 15 percent of whites have zero or negative wealth, more than a third of blacks do. Effectively, the black family in America is working without a safety net. When financial calamity strikes—a medical emergency, divorce, job loss—the fall is precipitous. And just as black families of all incomes remain handicapped by a lack of wealth, so too do they remain handicapped by their restricted choice of neighborhood. Black people with upper-middle-class incomes do not generally live in upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Sharkey’s research shows that black families making $100,000 typically live in the kinds of neighborhoods inhabited by white families making $30,000. “Blacks and whites inhabit such different neighborhoods,” Sharkey writes, “that it is not possible to compare the economic outcomes of black and white children.” A national real-estate association advised not to sell to “a colored man of means who was giving his children a college education.” The implications are chilling. As a rule, poor black people do not work their way out of the ghetto—and those who do often face the horror of watching their children and grandchildren tumble back.

Even seeming evidence of progress withers under harsh light. In 2012, the Manhattan Institute cheerily noted that segregation had declined since the 1960s. And yet African Americans still remained—by far—the most segregated ethnic group in the country. With segregation, with the isolation of the injured and the robbed, comes the concentration of disadvantage. An unsegregated America might see poverty, and all its effects, spread across the country with no particular bias toward skin color. Instead, the concentration of poverty has been paired with a concentration of melanin. The resulting conflagration has been devastating. One thread of thinking in the African American community holds that these depressing numbers partially stem from cultural pathologies that can be altered through individual grit and exceptionally good behavior. (In 2011, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, responding to violence among young black males, put the blame on the family: “Too many men making too many babies they don’t want to take care of, and then we end up dealing with your children.” Nutter turned to those presumably fatherless babies: “Pull your pants up and buy a belt, because no one wants to see your underwear or the crack of your butt.”) The thread is as old as black politics itself. It is also wrong. The kind of trenchant racism to which black people have persistently been subjected can never be defeated by making its victims more respectable. The essence of American racism is disrespect. And in the wake of the grim numbers, we see the grim inheritance.

The Contract Buyers League’s suit brought by Clyde Ross and his allies took direct aim at this inheritance. The suit was rooted in Chicago’s long history of segregation, which had created two housing markets—one legitimate and backed by the government, the other lawless and patrolled by predators. The suit dragged on until 1976, when the league lost a jury trial. Securing the equal protection of the law proved hard; securing reparations proved impossible. If there were any doubts about the mood of the jury, the foreman removed them by saying, when asked about the verdict, that he hoped it would help end “the mess Earl Warren made with Brown v. Board of Education and all that nonsense.” An unsegregated America might see poverty spread across the country, with no particular bias toward skin color. The Supreme Court seems to share that sentiment. The past two decades have witnessed a rollback of the progressive legislation of the 1960s. Liberals have found themselves on the defensive. In 2008, when Barack Obama was a candidate for president, he was asked whether his daughters—Malia and Sasha—should benefit from affirmative action. He answered in the negative. The exchange rested upon an erroneous comparison of the average American white family and the exceptional first family. In the contest of upward mobility, Barack and Michelle Obama have won. But they’ve won by being twice as good—and enduring twice as much. Malia and Sasha Obama enjoy privileges beyond the average white child’s dreams. But that comparison is incomplete. The more telling question is how they compare with Jenna and Barbara Bush—the products of many generations of privilege, not just one. Whatever the Obama children achieve, it will be evidence of their family’s singular perseverance, not of broad equality.

III. “We Inherit Our Ample Patrimony” In 1783, the freedwoman Belinda Royall petitioned the commonwealth of Massachusetts for reparations. Belinda had been born in modern-day Ghana. She was kidnapped as a child and sold into slavery. She endured the Middle Passage and 50 years of enslavement at the hands of Isaac Royall and his son. But the junior Royall, a British loyalist, fled the country during the Revolution. Belinda, now free after half a century of labor, beseeched the nascent Massachusetts legislature: The face of your Petitioner, is now marked with the furrows of time, and her frame bending under the oppression of years, while she, by the Laws of the Land, is denied the employment of one morsel of that immense wealth, apart whereof hath been accumilated by her own industry, and the whole augmented by her servitude. WHEREFORE, casting herself at your feet if your honours, as to a body of men, formed for the extirpation of vassalage, for the reward of Virtue, and the just return of honest industry—she prays, that such allowance may be made her out of the Estate of Colonel Royall, as will prevent her, and her more infirm daughter, from misery in the greatest extreme, and scatter comfort over the short and downward path of their lives. Belinda Royall was granted a pension of 15 pounds and 12 shillings, to be paid out of the estate of Isaac Royall—one of the earliest successful attempts to petition for reparations. At the time, black people in America had endured more than 150 years of enslavement, and the idea that they might be owed something in return was, if not the national consensus, at least not outrageous. “A heavy account lies against us as a civil society for oppressions committed against people who did not injure us,” wrote the Quaker John Woolman in 1769, “and that if the particular case of many individuals were fairly stated, it would appear that there was considerable due to them.”

As the historian Roy E. Finkenbine has documented, at the dawn of this country, black reparations were actively considered and often effected. Quakers in New York, New England, and Baltimore went so far as to make “membership contingent upon compensating one’s former slaves.” In 1782, the Quaker Robert Pleasants emancipated his 78 slaves, granted them 350 acres, and later built a school on their property and provided for their education. “The doing of this justice to the injured Africans,” wrote Pleasants, “would be an acceptable offering to him who ‘Rules in the kingdom of men.’ ” Edward Coles, a protégé of Thomas Jefferson who became a slaveholder through inheritance, took many of his slaves north and granted them a plot of land in Illinois. John Randolph, a cousin of Jefferson’s, willed that all his slaves be emancipated upon his death, and that all those older than 40 be given 10 acres of land. “I give and bequeath to all my slaves their freedom,” Randolph wrote, “heartily regretting that I have been the owner of one.” In his book Forever Free, Eric Foner recounts the story of a disgruntled planter reprimanding a freedman loafing on the job: Planter: “You lazy nigger, I am losing a whole day’s labor by you.” Freedman: “Massa, how many days’ labor have I lost by you?” In the 20th century, the cause of reparations was taken up by a diverse cast that included the Confederate veteran Walter R. Vaughan, who believed that reparations would be a stimulus for the South; the black activist Callie House; black-nationalist leaders like “Queen Mother” Audley Moore; and the civil-rights activist James Forman. The movement coalesced in 1987 under an umbrella organization called the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N’COBRA). The NAACP endorsed reparations in 1993. Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, has pursued reparations claims in court.

But while the people advocating reparations have changed over time, the response from the country has remained virtually the same. “They have been taught to labor,” the Chicago Tribune editorialized in 1891. “They have been taught Christian civilization, and to speak the noble English language instead of some African gibberish. The account is square with the ex‑slaves.” Not exactly. Having been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, “Never again.” But still we are haunted. It is as though we have run up a credit-card bill and, having pledged to charge no more, remain befuddled that the balance does not disappear. The effects of that balance, interest accruing daily, are all around us. Broach the topic of reparations today and a barrage of questions inevitably follows: Who will be paid? How much will they be paid? Who will pay? But if the practicalities, not the justice, of reparations are the true sticking point, there has for some time been the beginnings of a solution. For the past 25 years, Congressman John Conyers Jr., who represents the Detroit area, has marked every session of Congress by introducing a bill calling for a congressional study of slavery and its lingering effects as well as recommendations for “appropriate remedies.”

A country curious about how reparations might actually work has an easy solution in Conyers’s bill, now called HR 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. We would support this bill, submit the question to study, and then assess the possible solutions. But we are not interested. reporter’s notebook

What We Should Be Asking About Reparations

“Any contemplation of compensated emancipation must grapple with how several counties, and some states in the South, would react to finding themselves suddenly outnumbered by free black people.”

Read more “It’s because it’s black folks making the claim,” Nkechi Taifa, who helped found N’COBRA, says. “People who talk about reparations are considered left lunatics. But all we are talking about is studying [reparations]. As John Conyers has said, we study everything. We study the water, the air. We can’t even study the issue? This bill does not authorize one red cent to anyone.” That HR 40 has never—under either Democrats or Republicans—made it to the House floor suggests our concerns are rooted not in the impracticality of reparations but in something more existential. If we conclude that the conditions in North Lawndale and black America are not inexplicable but are instead precisely what you’d expect of a community that for centuries has lived in America’s crosshairs, then what are we to make of the world’s oldest democracy?

One cannot escape the question by hand-waving at the past, disavowing the acts of one’s ancestors, nor by citing a recent date of ancestral immigration. The last slaveholder has been dead for a very long time. The last soldier to endure Valley Forge has been dead much longer. To proudly claim the veteran and disown the slaveholder is patriotism à la carte. A nation outlives its generations. We were not there when Washington crossed the Delaware, but Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze’s rendering has meaning to us. We were not there when Woodrow Wilson took us into World War I, but we are still paying out the pensions. If Thomas Jefferson’s genius matters, then so does his taking of Sally Hemings’s body. If George Washington crossing the Delaware matters, so must his ruthless pursuit of the runagate Oney Judge. Black families making $100,000 typically live in the kinds of neighborhoods inhabited by white families making $30,000. In 1909, President William Howard Taft told the country that “intelligent” white southerners were ready to see blacks as “useful members of the community.” A week later Joseph Gordon, a black man, was lynched outside Greenwood, Mississippi. The high point of the lynching era has passed. But the memories of those robbed of their lives still live on in the lingering effects. Indeed, in America there is a strange and powerful belief that if you stab a black person 10 times, the bleeding stops and the healing begins the moment the assailant drops the knife. We believe white dominance to be a fact of the inert past, a delinquent debt that can be made to disappear if only we don’t look.

There has always been another way. “It is in vain to alledge, that our ancestors brought them hither, and not we,” Yale President Timothy Dwight said in 1810. We inherit our ample patrimony with all its incumbrances; and are bound to pay the debts of our ancestors. This debt, particularly, we are bound to discharge: and, when the righteous Judge of the Universe comes to reckon with his servants, he will rigidly exact the payment at our hands. To give them liberty, and stop here, is to entail upon them a curse. IV. “The Ills That Slavery Frees Us From” America begins in black plunder and white democracy, two features that are not contradictory but complementary. “The men who came together to found the independent United States, dedicated to freedom and equality, either held slaves or were willing to join hands with those who did,” the historian Edmund S. Morgan wrote. “None of them felt entirely comfortable about the fact, but neither did they feel responsible for it. Most of them had inherited both their slaves and their attachment to freedom from an earlier generation, and they knew the two were not unconnected.” When enslaved Africans, plundered of their bodies, plundered of their families, and plundered of their labor, were brought to the colony of Virginia in 1619, they did not initially endure the naked racism that would engulf their progeny. Some of them were freed. Some of them intermarried. Still others escaped with the white indentured servants who had suffered as they had. Some even rebelled together, allying under Nathaniel Bacon to torch Jamestown in 1676.

One hundred years later, the idea of slaves and poor whites joining forces would shock the senses, but in the early days of the English colonies, the two groups had much in common. English visitors to Virginia found that its masters “abuse their servantes with intollerable oppression and hard usage.” White servants were flogged, tricked into serving beyond their contracts, and traded in much the same manner as slaves. This “hard usage” originated in a simple fact of the New World—land was boundless but cheap labor was limited. As life spans increased in the colony, the Virginia planters found in the enslaved Africans an even more efficient source of cheap labor. Whereas indentured servants were still legal subjects of the English crown and thus entitled to certain protections, African slaves entered the colonies as aliens. Exempted from the protections of the crown, they became early America’s indispensable working class—fit for maximum exploitation, capable of only minimal resistance. For the next 250 years, American law worked to reduce black people to a class of untouchables and raise all white men to the level of citizens. In 1650, Virginia mandated that “all persons except Negroes” were to carry arms. In 1664, Maryland mandated that any Englishwoman who married a slave must live as a slave of her husband’s master. In 1705, the Virginia assembly passed a law allowing for the dismemberment of unruly slaves—but forbidding masters from whipping “a Christian white servant naked, without an order from a justice of the peace.” In that same law, the colony mandated that “all horses, cattle, and hogs, now belonging, or that hereafter shall belong to any slave” be seized and sold off by the local church, the profits used to support “the poor of the said parish.” At that time, there would have still been people alive who could remember blacks and whites joining to burn down Jamestown only 29 years before. But at the beginning of the 18th century, two primary classes were enshrined in America. “The two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black,” John C. Calhoun, South Carolina’s senior senator, declared on the Senate floor in 1848. “And all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.” In 1860, the majority of people living in South Carolina and Mississippi, almost half of those living in Georgia, and about one-third of all Southerners were on the wrong side of Calhoun’s line. The state with the largest number of enslaved Americans was Virginia, where in certain counties some 70 percent of all people labored in chains. Nearly one-fourth of all white Southerners owned slaves, and upon their backs the economic basis of America—and much of the Atlantic world—was erected. In the seven cotton states, one-third of all white income was derived from slavery. By 1840, cotton produced by slave labor constituted 59 percent of the country’s exports. The web of this slave society extended north to the looms of New England, and across the Atlantic to Great Britain, where it powered a great economic transformation and altered the trajectory of world history. “Whoever says Industrial Revolution,” wrote the historian Eric J. Hobsbawm, “says cotton.” The wealth accorded America by slavery was not just in what the slaves pulled from the land but in the slaves themselves. “In 1860, slaves as an asset were worth more than all of America’s manufacturing, all of the railroads, all of the productive capacity of the United States put together,” the Yale historian David W. Blight has noted. “Slaves were the single largest, by far, financial asset of property in the entire American economy.” The sale of these slaves—“in whose bodies that money congealed,” writes Walter Johnson, a Harvard historian—generated even more ancillary wealth. Loans were taken out for purchase, to be repaid with interest. Insurance policies were drafted against the untimely death of a slave and the loss of potential profits. Slave sales were taxed and notarized. The vending of the black body and the sundering of the black family became an economy unto themselves, estimated to have brought in tens of millions of dollars to antebellum America. In 1860 there were more millionaires per capita in the Mississippi Valley than anywhere else in the country. Beneath the cold numbers lay lives divided. “I had a constant dread that Mrs. Moore, her mistress, would be in want of money and sell my dear wife,” a freedman wrote, reflecting on his time in slavery. “We constantly dreaded a final separation. Our affection for each was very strong, and this made us always apprehensive of a cruel parting.” Forced partings were common in the antebellum South. A slave in some parts of the region stood a 30 percent chance of being sold in his or her lifetime. Twenty-five percent of interstate trades destroyed a first marriage and half of them destroyed a nuclear family. When the wife and children of Henry Brown, a slave in Richmond, Virginia, were to be sold away, Brown searched for a white master who might buy his wife and children to keep the family together. He failed: The next day, I stationed myself by the side of the road, along which the slaves, amounting to three hundred and fifty, were to pass. The purchaser of my wife was a Methodist minister, who was about starting for North Carolina. Pretty soon five waggon-loads of little children passed, and looking at the foremost one, what should I see but a little child, pointing its tiny hand towards me, exclaiming, “There’s my father; I knew he would come and bid me good-bye.” It was my eldest child! Soon the gang approached in which my wife was chained. I looked, and beheld her familiar face; but O, reader, that glance of agony! may God spare me ever again enduring the excruciating horror of that moment! She passed, and came near to where I stood. I seized hold of her hand, intending to bid her farewell; but words failed me; the gift of utterance had fled, and I remained speechless. I followed her for some distance, with her hand grasped in mine, as if to save her from her fate, but I could not speak, and I was obliged to turn away in silence. In a time when telecommunications were primitive and blacks lacked freedom of movement, the parting of black families was a kind of murder. Here we find the roots of American wealth and democracy—in the for-profit destruction of the most important asset available to any people, the family. The destruction was not incidental to America’s rise; it facilitated that rise. By erecting a slave society, America created the economic foundation for its great experiment in democracy. The labor strife that seeded Bacon’s rebellion was suppressed. America’s indispensable working class existed as property beyond the realm of politics, leaving white Americans free to trumpet their love of freedom and democratic values. Assessing antebellum democracy in Virginia, a visitor from England observed that the state’s natives “can profess an unbounded love of liberty and of democracy in consequence of the mass of the people, who in other countries might become mobs, being there nearly altogether composed of their own Negro slaves.” V. The Quiet Plunder The consequences of 250 years of enslavement, of war upon black families and black people, were profound. Like homeownership today, slave ownership was aspirational, attracting not just those who owned slaves but those who wished to. Much as homeowners today might discuss the addition of a patio or the painting of a living room, slaveholders traded tips on the best methods for breeding workers, exacting labor, and doling out punishment. Just as a homeowner today might subscribe to a magazine like This Old House, slaveholders had journals such as De Bow’s Review, which recommended the best practices for wringing profits from slaves. By the dawn of the Civil War, the enslavement of black America was thought to be so foundational to the country that those who sought to end it were branded heretics worthy of death. Imagine what would happen if a president today came out in favor of taking all American homes from their owners: the reaction might well be violent. “This country was formed for the white, not for the black man,” John Wilkes Booth wrote, before killing Abraham Lincoln. “And looking upon African slavery from the same standpoint held by those noble framers of our Constitution, I for one have ever considered it one of the greatest blessings (both for themselves and us) that God ever bestowed upon a favored nation.” In the aftermath of the Civil War, Radical Republicans attempted to reconstruct the country upon something resembling universal equality—but they were beaten back by a campaign of “Redemption,” led by White Liners, Red Shirts, and Klansmen bent on upholding a society “formed for the white, not for the black man.” A wave of terrorism roiled the South. In his massive history Reconstruction, Eric Foner recounts incidents of black people being attacked for not removing their hats; for refusing to hand over a whiskey flask; for disobeying church procedures; for “using insolent language”; for disputing labor contracts; for refusing to be “tied like a slave.” Sometimes the attacks were intended simply to “thin out the niggers a little.” Terrorism carried the day. Federal troops withdrew from the South in 1877. The dream of Reconstruction died. For the next century, political violence was visited upon blacks wantonly, with special treatment meted out toward black people of ambition. Black schools and churches were burned to the ground. Black voters and the political candidates who attempted to rally them were intimidated, and some were murdered. At the end of World War I, black veterans returning to their homes were assaulted for daring to wear the American uniform. The demobilization of soldiers after the war, which put white and black veterans into competition for scarce jobs, produced the Red Summer of 1919: a succession of racist pogroms against dozens of cities ranging from Longview, Texas, to Chicago to Washington, D.C. Organized white violence against blacks continued into the 1920s—in 1921 a white mob leveled Tulsa’s “Black Wall Street,” and in 1923 another one razed the black town of Rosewood, Florida—and virtually no one was punished.

The work of mobs was a rabid and violent rendition of prejudices that extended even into the upper reaches of American government. The New Deal is today remembered as a model for what progressive government should do—cast a broad social safety net that protects the poor and the afflicted while building the middle class. When progressives wish to express their disappointment with Barack Obama, they point to the accomplishments of Franklin Roosevelt. But these progressives rarely note that Roosevelt’s New Deal, much like the democracy that produced it, rested on the foundation of Jim Crow. “The Jim Crow South,” writes Ira Katznelson, a history and political-science professor at Columbia, “was the one collaborator America’s democracy could not do without.” The marks of that collaboration are all over the New Deal. The omnibus programs passed under the Social Security Act in 1935 were crafted in such a way as to protect the southern way of life. Old-age insurance (Social Security proper) and unemployment insurance excluded farmworkers and domestics—jobs heavily occupied by blacks. When President Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, 65 percent of African Americans nationally and between 70 and 80 percent in the South were ineligible. The NAACP protested, calling the new American safety net “a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.” The oft-celebrated G.I. Bill similarly failed black Americans, by mirroring the broader country’s insistence on a racist housing policy. Though ostensibly color-blind, Title III of the bill, which aimed to give veterans access to low-interest home loans, left black veterans to tangle with white officials at their local Veterans Administration as well as with the same banks that had, for years, refused to grant mortgages to blacks. The historian Kathleen J. Frydl observes in her 2009 book, The GI Bill, that so many blacks were disqualified from receiving Title III benefits “that it is more accurate simply to say that blacks could not use this particular title.” In Cold War America, homeownership was seen as a means of instilling patriotism, and as a civilizing and anti-radical force. “No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist,” claimed William Levitt, who pioneered the modern suburb with the development of the various Levittowns, his famous planned communities. “He has too much to do.” But the Levittowns were, with Levitt’s willing acquiescence, segregated throughout their early years. Daisy and Bill Myers, the first black family to move into Levittown, Pennsylvania, were greeted with protests and a burning cross. A neighbor who opposed the family said that Bill Myers was “probably a nice guy, but every time I look at him I see $2,000 drop off the value of my house.” The neighbor had good reason to be afraid. Bill and Daisy Myers were from the other side of John C. Calhoun’s dual society. If they moved next door, housing policy almost guaranteed that their neighbors’ property values would decline. Whereas shortly before the New Deal, a typical mortgage required a large down payment and full repayment within about 10 years, the creation of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in 1933 and then the Federal Housing Administration the following year allowed banks to offer loans requiring no more than 10 percent down, amortized over 20 to 30 years. “Without federal intervention in the housing market, massive suburbanization would have been impossible,” writes Thomas J. Sugrue, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “In 1930, only 30 percent of Americans owned their own homes; by 1960, more than 60 percent were home owners. Home ownership became an emblem of American citizenship.” That emblem was not to be awarded to blacks. The American real-estate industry believed segregation to be a moral principle. As late as 1950, the National Association of Real Estate Boards’ code of ethics warned that “a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood … any race or nationality, or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values.” A 1943 brochure specified that such potential undesirables might include madams, bootleggers, gangsters—and “a colored man of means who was giving his children a college education and thought they were entitled to live among whites.” The federal government concurred. It was the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, not a private trade association, that pioneered the practice of redlining, selectively granting loans and insisting that any property it insured be covered by a restrictive covenant—a clause in the deed forbidding the sale of the property to anyone other than whites. Millions of dollars flowed from tax coffers into segregated white neighborhoods. One man said his black neighbor was “probably a nice guy, but every time I look at him I see $2,000 drop off the value of my house.” “For perhaps the first time, the federal government embraced the discriminatory attitudes of the marketplace,” the historian Kenneth T. Jackson wrote in his 1985 book, Crabgrass Frontier, a history of suburbanization. “Previously, prejudices were personalized and individualized; FHA exhorted segregation and enshrined it as public policy. Whole areas of cities were declared ineligible for loan guarantees.” Redlining was not officially outlawed until 1968, by the Fair Housing Act. By then the damage was done—and reports of redlining by banks have continued. The federal government is premised on equal fealty from all its citizens, who in return are to receive equal treatment. But as late as the mid-20th century, this bargain was not granted to black people, who repeatedly paid a higher price for citizenship and received less in return. Plunder had been the essential feature of slavery, of the society described by Calhoun. But practically a full century after the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the plunder—quiet, systemic, submerged—continued even amidst the aims and achievements of New Deal liberals. VI. Making The Second Ghetto Today Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the country, a fact that reflects assiduous planning. In the effort to uphold white supremacy at every level down to the neighborhood, Chicago—a city founded by the black fur trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable—has long been a pioneer. The efforts began in earnest in 1917, when the Chicago Real Estate Board, horrified by the influx of southern blacks, lobbied to zone the entire city by race. But after the Supreme Court ruled against explicit racial zoning that year, the city was forced to pursue its agenda by more-discreet means. Like the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, the Federal Housing Administration initially insisted on restrictive covenants, which helped bar blacks and other ethnic undesirables from receiving federally backed home loans. By the 1940s, Chicago led the nation in the use of these restrictive covenants, and about half of all residential neighborhoods in the city were effectively off-limits to blacks. It is common today to become misty-eyed about the old black ghetto, where doctors and lawyers lived next door to meatpackers and steelworkers, who themselves lived next door to prostitutes and the unemployed. This segregationist nostalgia ignores the actual conditions endured by the people living there—vermin and arson, for instance—and ignores the fact that the old ghetto was premised on denying black people privileges enjoyed by white Americans. In 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled that restrictive covenants, while permissible, were not enforceable by judicial action, Chicago had other weapons at the ready. The Illinois state legislature had already given Chicago’s city council the right to approve—and thus to veto—any public housing in the city’s wards. This came in handy in 1949, when a new federal housing act sent millions of tax dollars into Chicago and other cities around the country. Beginning in 1950, site selection for public housing proceeded entirely on the grounds of segregation. By the 1960s, the city had created with its vast housing projects what the historian Arnold R. Hirsch calls a “second ghetto,” one larger than the old Black Belt but just as impermeable. More than 98 percent of all the family public-housing units built in Chicago between 1950 and the mid‑1960s were built in all-black neighborhoods. Governmental embrace of segregation was driven by the virulent racism of Chicago’s white citizens. White neighborhoods vulnerable to black encroachment formed block associations for the sole purpose of enforcing segregation. They lobbied fellow whites not to sell. They lobbied those blacks who did manage to buy to sell back. In 1949, a group of Englewood Catholics formed block associations intended to “keep up the neighborhood.” Translation: keep black people out. And when civic engagement was not enough, when government failed, when private banks could no longer hold the line, Chicago turned to an old tool in the American repertoire—racial violence. “The pattern of terrorism is easily discernible,” concluded a Chicago civic group in the 1940s. “It is at the seams of the black ghetto in all directions.” On July 1 and 2 of 1946, a mob of thousands assembled in Chicago’s Park Manor neighborhood, hoping to eject a black doctor who’d recently moved in. The mob pelted the house with rocks and set the garage on fire. The doctor moved away. In 1947, after a few black veterans moved into the Fernwood section of Chicago, three nights of rioting broke out; gangs of whites yanked blacks off streetcars and beat them. Two years later, when a union meeting attended by blacks in Englewood triggered rumors that a home was being “sold to niggers,” blacks (and whites thought to be sympathetic to them) were beaten in the streets. In 1951, thousands of whites in Cicero, 20 minutes or so west of downtown Chicago, attacked an apartment building that housed a single black family, throwing bricks and firebombs through the windows and setting the apartment on fire. A Cook County grand jury declined to charge the rioters—and instead indicted the family’s NAACP attorney, the apartment’s white owner, and the owner’s attorney and rental agent, charging them with conspiring to lower property values. Two years after that, whites picketed and planted explosives in South Deering, about 30 minutes from downtown Chicago, to force blacks out.

When terrorism ultimately failed, white homeowners simply fled the neighborhood. The traditional terminology, white flight, implies a kind of natural expression of preference. In fact, white flight was a triumph of social engineering, orchestrated by the shared racist presumptions of America’s public and private sectors. For should any nonracist white families decide that integration might not be so bad as a matter of principle or practicality, they still had to contend with the hard facts of American housing policy: When the mid-20th-century white homeowner claimed that the presence of a Bill and Daisy Myers decreased his property value, he was not merely engaging in racist dogma—he was accurately observing the impact of federal policy on market prices. Redlining destroyed the possibility of investment wherever black people lived. VII. “A Lot Of People Fell By The Way” Speculators in North Lawndale, and at the edge of the black ghettos, knew there was money to be made off white panic. They resorted to “block-busting”—spooking whites into selling cheap before the neighborhood became black. They would hire a black woman to walk up and down the street with a stroller. Or they’d hire someone to call a number in the neighborhood looking for “Johnny Mae.” Then they’d cajole whites into selling at low prices, informing them that the more blacks who moved in, the more the value of their homes would decline, so better to sell now. With these white-fled homes in hand, speculators then turned to the masses of black people who had streamed northward as part of the Great Migration, or who were desperate to escape the ghettos: the speculators would take the houses they’d just bought cheap through block-busting and sell them to blacks on contract. To keep up with his payments and keep his heat on, Clyde Ross took a second job at the post office and then a third job delivering pizza. His wife took a job working at Marshall Field. He had to take some of his children out of private school. He was not able to be at home to supervise his children or help them with their homework. Money and time that Ross wanted to give his children went instead to enrich white speculators. “The problem was the money,” Ross told me. “Without the money, you can’t move. You can’t educate your kids. You can’t give them the right kind of food. Can’t make the house look good. They think this neighborhood is where they supposed to be. It changes their outlook. My kids were going to the best schools in this neighborhood, and I couldn’t keep them in there.” Mattie Lewis came to Chicago from her native Alabama in the mid-’40s, when she was 21, persuaded by a friend who told her she could get a job as a hairdresser. Instead she was hired by Western Electric, where she worked for 41 years. I met Lewis in the home of her neighbor Ethel Weatherspoon. Both had owned homes in North Lawndale for more than 50 years. Both had bought their houses on contract. Both had been active with Clyde Ross in the Contract Buyers League’s effort to garner restitution from contract sellers who’d operated in North Lawndale, banks who’d backed the scheme, and even the Federal Housing Administration. We were joined by Jack Macnamara, who’d been an organizing force in the Contract Buyers League when it was founded, in 1968. Our gathering had the feel of a reunion, because the writer James Alan McPherson had profiled the Contract Buyers League for The Atlantic back in 1972.

Weatherspoon bought her home in 1957. “Most of the whites started moving out,” she told me. “‘The blacks are coming. The blacks are coming.’ They actually said that. They had signs up: Don’t sell to blacks.” Before moving to North Lawndale, Lewis and her husband tried moving to Cicero after seeing a house advertised for sale there. “Sorry, I just sold it today,” the Realtor told Lewis’s husband. “I told him, ‘You know they don’t want you in Cicero,’ ” Lewis recalls. “ ‘They ain’t going to let nobody black in Cicero.’ ” In 1958, the couple bought a home in North Lawndale on contract. They were not blind to the unfairness. But Lewis, born in the teeth of Jim Crow, considered American piracy—black people keep on making it, white people keep on taking it—a fact of nature. “All I wanted was a house. And that was the only way I could get it. They weren’t giving black people loans at that time,” she said. “We thought, ‘This is the way it is. We going to do it till we die, and they ain’t never going to accept us. That’s just the way it is.’ “The only way you were going to buy a home was to do it the way they wanted,” she continued. “And I was determined to get me a house. If everybody else can have one, I want one too. I had worked for white people in the South. And I saw how these white people were living in the North and I thought, ‘One day I’m going to live just like them.’ I wanted cabinets and all these things these other people have.” White flight was not an accident—it was a triumph of racist social engineering. Whenever she visited white co-workers at their homes, she saw the difference. “I could see we were just getting ripped off,” she said. “I would see things and I would say, ‘I’d like to do this at my house.’ And they would say, ‘Do it,’ but I would think, ‘I can’t, because it costs us so much more.’ ” I asked Lewis and Weatherspoon how they kept up on payments. “You paid it and kept working,” Lewis said of the contract. “When that payment came up, you knew you had to pay it.” “You cut down on the light bill. Cut down on your food bill,” Weatherspoon interjected. “You cut down on things for your child, that was the main thing,” said Lewis. “My oldest wanted to be an artist and my other wanted to be a dancer and my other wanted to take music.” Lewis and Weatherspoon, like Ross, were able to keep their homes. The suit did not win them any remuneration. But it forced contract sellers to the table, where they allowed some members of the Contract Buyers League to move into regular mortgages or simply take over their houses outright. By then they’d been bilked for thousands. In talking with Lewis and Weatherspoon, I was seeing only part of the picture—the tiny minority who’d managed to hold on to their homes. But for all our exceptional ones, for every Barack and Michelle Obama, for every Ethel Weatherspoon or Clyde Ross, for every black survivor, there are so many thousands gone. “A lot of people fell by the way,” Lewis told me. “One woman asked me if I would keep all her china. She said, ‘They ain’t going to set you out.’ ” VIII. “Negro Poverty is not White Poverty” On a recent spring afternoon in North Lawndale, I visited Billy Lamar Brooks Sr. Brooks has been an activist since his youth in the Black Panther Party, when he aided the Contract Buyers League. I met him in his office at the Better Boys Foundation, a staple of North Lawndale whose mission is to direct local kids off the streets and into jobs and college. Brooks’s work is personal. On June 14, 1991, his 19-year-old son, Billy Jr., was shot and killed. “These guys tried to stick him up,” Brooks told me. “I suspect he could have been involved in some things … He’s always on my mind. Every day.” Brooks was not raised in the streets, though in such a neighborhood it is impossible to avoid the influence. “I was in church three or four times a week. That’s where the girls were,” he said, laughing. “The stark reality is still there. There’s no shield from life. You got to go to school. I lived here. I went to Marshall High School. Over here were the Egyptian Cobras. Over there were the Vice Lords.” Brooks has since moved away from Chicago’s West Side. But he is still working in North Lawndale. If “you got a nice house, you live in a nice neighborhood, then you are less prone to violence, because your space is not deprived,” Brooks said. “You got a security point. You don’t need no protection.” But if “you grow up in a place like this, housing sucks. When they tore down the projects here, they left the high-rises and came to the neighborhood with that gang mentality. You don’t have nothing, so you going to take something, even if it’s not real. You don’t have no street, but in your mind it’s yours.”If nothing else, Big Little Lies, HBO’s dive into the “salacious small-town melodrama” genre, captures the loneliness of car rides.

Rating 3.5



The vehicles are luxurious, sleek, elegant, and expensive. But the wealthy women who drive them always seem isolated. Their children might be having the best time in the back seat, but the mothers are always singularly focused and alone. Yes, that’s because they’re concentrating on the road. But Big Little Lies suggests it’s also because, no matter where these women go or whom they surround themselves with, they’re surprised to find they’re ultimately alone with themselves.

Big Little Lies is being sold on the strength of its all-star cast, and it does, indeed, have an all-star cast. With Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, and Shailene Woodley in the three lead roles and great performers like Adam Scott, Alexander Skarsgård, and Laura Dern in supporting roles, you’re guaranteed to see at least one actor you love. And for the most part, they’re very, very good.

But Big Little Lies also lets those performers down, with simplistic scripts that lack subtext and seem to tread water between big moments. The show feels trapped between something trashy and something more upscale, too scared to move in either direction and ultimately the poorer for it. It’s got Peak TV presentation — the stars, the high-toned direction — and scripts that would fit right in on the ’90s dramas of its writer, David E. Kelley.

Ultimately, it’s a flashy, well-acted show, but often in spite of itself. Here’s what’s good, bad, and weird about Big Little Lies.

Good: the actors are phenomenal

One of the most riveting scenes you’ll see on TV this season is a rather gentle two-hander between Kidman (as lawyer turned stay-at-home mom Celeste Wright) and longtime character actress hero Robin Weigert as her therapist. On paper, not much happens. The therapist is trying to convince Celeste to do something Celeste doesn’t want to do. But to watch Kidman dance around all of Celeste’s layers of self-defense and denial is to be reminded how much an actor can elevate rote material.

This high level of performance echoes throughout every key role in Big Little Lies. Woodley, an actress I’ve rarely warmed to, is great as Jane, a single mother who’s carefully compartmentalized the darkness in her life to keep moving forward. Scott turns his “supportive but kinda dull husband” into something surprisingly moving. And Dern, as always, walks a high wire between camp and despair as a queen bee parent at the upper-class school around which much of the miniseries’ action revolves.

But it’s Witherspoon who shines the brightest, thanks to one simple but bold choice: She dials up her Reese Witherspoon-ness — that brittle, slightly overbearing quality she’s had in all her best roles, stretching back to 1999’s Election — as far as she can, even though everything around her is much more naturalistic and her storyline is the least outwardly salacious. (Her character, Madeline Martha Mackenzie, is just feeling kinda unfulfilled with her life.)

It works because Witherspoon plays Madeline as stuck between the way she thinks the world should work and her utter lack of control over its proceedings. She’s “a Reese Witherspoon character,” but one who’s been beaten down by life and responded by becoming flintier and more sharp-edged. She’s genuinely caring and kind sometimes, but she’s also not above waging war with other moms via their young children.

It’s easy to see why so many excellent actors were attracted to Big Little Lies. The show’s inspiration — the Liane Moriarty novel of the same name — offers a bunch of complex, nuanced characters who sit in line in their expensive cars to pick up their kids from school, which is precisely the place nuanced characters usually go to die. And there’s just enough genre fun (would you believe there’s a murder involved?) to keep the story engaging. It’s a pity, then, who’s adapting the book.

Bad: why is David E. Kelley adapting this thing?

Kelley, who was king of television in the ’90s, is an immense talent on occasion, still to this day. But his skills and style best align with series where his characters can offer grand pronouncements about Justice or Life or God, which is why he tends to work best in the courtroom drama genre. (See also: Last year’s Amazon series Goliath, which was his best show in years.)

But the small-town melodrama requires either an extraordinarily deft touch or a willingness to go full bore into camp. It’s easy enough to imagine a version of this series from Parenthood’s Jason Katims that’s tremendous, or a very different version from American Horror Story’s Ryan Murphy that’s just as good.

But Kelley awkwardly tries to blend the two tones, resulting in confusing mishmashes where the show cuts from Jane living in her despair to, uh, Madeline imagining being attacked by an enemy who’s wielding puppets and pushing her to her doom.

What Kelley is good at doesn’t particularly match up with either the text or the subtext of Moriarty’s tale, and there were long stretches of each episode (I’ve seen six of seven in total) where I just didn’t buy what any of the characters were saying to each other. Lots of times, they would baldly state what they were thinking or feeling, leaving nothing to the imagination, and even 6-year-old children were often deeply aware of their buried psychological motivations.

The cast’s performances are good enough to compensate for much of this, but it’s still a bummer to get to the end of a juicy scene and have it conclude with dialogue that’s desperate to sum up everything that preceded it. Kelley too often doesn’t trust the viewers to figure stuff out on their own, and that’s the case in Big Little Lies.

Good: Jean-Marc Vallée directed the entire miniseries, and it’s gorgeous

Jean-Marc Vallée, who’s probably best known in the United States for the movies Dallas Buyers Club and Wild, is a director whose charms have mostly eluded me to this point. His films — especially Dallas Buyers Club — rarely feel as if they’ve met a bit of subtext they couldn’t hammer into the text, and he seems to favor broad and showy when small and intimate might be a better tack.

And yet he turns out to be a perfect fit for Big Little Lies, where he uses lots and lots of wide shots filled with negative space to underline the characters’ isolation. Somewhere in the third episode, I realized Vallée was capturing the feeling of loneliness as well as I’ve seen it depicted on television, and so much of that stems from his willingness to feature his actresses in long, wordless sequences where they just live with their pain, all alone. (He’s especially good at this when filming them against the rich interiors of their homes, or the crashing waves of the Monterey Bay shoreline.)

Television also brings out Vallée’s skill with actors, perhaps even more than film does. On TV, Vallée seems careful to modulate more — or he knows that his Wild stars Witherspoon and Dern will always be the biggest presences in any room and adjusts from there — which leads to work that keeps peeling back layers. Vallée intuitively understands that TV performances can rarely start at level 10 and stay at that volume indefinitely (unless you’re Reese Witherspoon, apparently). You need room to grow, and he leaves everybody in Big Little Lies exactly that.

Bad: a flash-forward structure doesn’t work at all

In order to keep watching a drama that’s occasionally as internally focused as Big Little Lies, we need something to pull us forward through the less immediately gripping scenes. In this series, as in so many other small-town melodramas, that “something” is a murder.

Here, it’s a murder that will happen, and the series is occasionally peppered with short flash-forwards of other characters offering their observations on the show’s central ensemble to the police. (I’ve seen six of seven episodes, and I still haven’t seen the murder happen, nor do I know who was murdered — though I’m pretty sure I’ve figured it all out, since Kelley’s not a very subtle writer.) It’s easy to see what’s intended here: We’re meant to speculate about what’s going to happen, and the various witnesses act as a kind of Greek chorus, offering commentary on the action swirling around them.

In practice, it doesn’t work at all. The chorus members keep butting into scenes we’ve just watched to reiterate what we just saw. They’re not there to provide illumination — they’re there to hold our hands and make sure we got it. It’s a bad idea, executed poorly, and these scenes easily could have been cut without losing anything.

The weird: all of the characters seem to share David E. Kelley’s pop culture tastes

Everybody listens to ’60s rock and consumes the sorts of bland movies and TV shows you’d expect a guy in his 60s to be into. This applies even to Woodley’s 20-something and Witherspoon’s show-tune-obsessed character. Hell, this applies to the 6-year-olds.

I mean, sure, this is a rich enclave of mostly white people, who would probably be into this sort of hopelessly middlebrow pop culture, but it’s kinda weird that everybody is into what (I assume) David E. Kelley is into.

Big Little Lies debuts Sunday, February 19, at 9 pm Eastern on HBO.A replica of Bayrock/Sapir’s Trump Soho hotel may be Moscow’s first big new hotel in ten years.

Alex Sapir and Rotem Rosen of the Sapir Organization, co-developers on the Soho hotel at 246 Spring Street, met with Russian developer Aras Agalarov and Donald Trump over the weekend to discuss plans for the new project — Trump’s first in Russia.

“The Russian market is attracted to me,” Trump told Real Estate Weekly. “I have a great relationship with many Russians, and almost all of the oligarchs were in the room.”

Trump told REW that he is in talks with Agalarov and three other groups, and that there is no rush on a timeline for the project. He also did not disclose the hotel’s planned height or square footage, saying only that “it has to be a large development, big enough to justify the travel.”

In the meantime, Rosen and Sapir have picked up several big office tenants at 260 and 261 Madison Avenue in recent months. [REW] — Julie StricklandWhen do outlandish statements by a political personality cross over from merely disagreeable to outright pathological? More directly: Does Donald Trump’s undeniable self-regard, aggressive attention seeking, and inability to admit error suggest that we’re dealing with not just a shameless self-promoter but someone in the grips of a personality disorder — a mental illness?

Many political commentators have responded to Trump’s seemingly unique rise by resorting to distinctly medical language. Trump’s ghostwriter Tony Schwartz says that, were it up to him, he would now rename the bestselling The Art of the Deal as The Sociopath.

Other writers quote tweets as evidence for Trump’s "narcissistic personality disorder." Indeed, when it comes to narcissism, one clinical psychologist told Vanity Fair last fall, "He’s so classic that I’m archiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there’s no better example."

The American Psychiatric Association’s ethical guidelines forbid its members from diagnosing public figures from a distance. (This so-called Goldwater rule was introduced after numerous psychiatrists publicly pronounced Barry Goldwater unfit for the presidency.) In the Atlantic, James Hamblin — an MD but not a psychiatrist — acknowledges these ethical constraints but goes on to remark that "certain extenuating circumstances seem to make this exercise worthwhile."

He then embarks on linking definitions from the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to Trump’s public statements and private correspondence. When the DSM-V cites "antagonism" as a personal trait necessary for a diagnosis of "antisocial personality disorder," Hamblin cites Trump’s extended feuds with journalists such as Fox’s Megyn Kelly, BuzzFeed’s McKay Coppins (who dared to call the Mar-a-Lago hotel "slightly dated"), and Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter (co-coiner of "short-fingered vulgarian").

The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd has used her creative license to imagine Trump institutionalized after an election he loses — though he thinks he won. He ends up being ushered by orderlies into "impulse control/delusion reduction therapy."

While bizarre statements and extreme personality traits make a pathologizing impulse understandable, it is ultimately misguided. It’s counterproductive for our understanding and treatment of mental illness — and it doesn’t help us achieve our political aims, either.

Undermining the scientific legitimacy of psychology

For professionals, diagnosing public figures from afar undermines the value of expertise and of the instruments used to diagnose. A structured clinical interview — private and anonymous — along with reliable and valid questionnaires allows clinicians to collect data and compare responses to others.

The reliability of such procedures is based on sound science. Perhaps one day we will be able to diagnose a disorder from a set of tweets, but for now, a structured clinical interview and other standardized instruments are the ones with the most solid scientific foundation.

When a clinician diagnoses Trump from his public statements, she is undermining the science of the mind — just as a doctor who claimed he or she could diagnose diabetes or multiple sclerosis or cancer by just looking at my behavior and public statements would undermine the trust in the scientific basis of their discipline.

Public behavior offers clues for a psychiatrist or psychologist — indeed, medical maladies such as diabetes or cancer have outward signs as well — but every time a clinician diagnoses from afar, he detracts from the scientific credibility of his field.

But let’s say you aren’t a licensed clinician. Why shouldn’t you let loose, calling Trump insane, deranged, mentally ill — whatever you want? Even if you are not a clinical professional, you should refrain from pathologizing Trump, because using terms for mental illness to denote morally outrageous acts, poor judgment, or the crass statements of an Olympic-class jerk stigmatizes mental disorders and undermines efforts to alleviate suffering.

Saying "he’s crazy" as a stand-in for "I find those personality traits insufferable and those statements reprehensible" reinforces the link in the public’s mind between mental illness and moral failing.

But mental illness is about medical issues, not moral failure. That’s an argument that advocates for the mentally ill have had to make for decades. The millions of people with mental illness in this country are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators, more likely to be the bullied than to be bullies.

A political attack with collateral damage

Implying that Trump’s toxic personality results from mental illness may well stigmatize him, but it also leads to needless collateral damage to people with psychiatric problems.

And one can oppose a politician just as strongly without the language of mental illness as with it. The 50 Republican national security leaders who signed a recent letter opposing Trump called him "dangerous" and alarmingly ignorant. When describing his temperament, they said he "lacks self-control and acts impetuously"— statements describing behavior, not mental health.

There’s also a basic misunderstanding at the heart of all this diagnosis-from-a-distance. Hallmarks of any mental disorder include dysfunction and suffering. We all get sad, but only some of us are unable to get out of bed, hold a job, or maintain relationships because of depression.

And Donald Trump certainly does not seem to be suffering. He eats well, sleeps regularly, and holds gainful employment. (We won’t know just how gainful until he releases his tax forms.) He seems to have a supportive family. His doctor claims his physical health is excellent. He is singularly successful in his current chosen profession, having won the presidential nomination of what was once a major US political party. He is accomplished, and claims to be healthy and happy.

Letting our political culture off the hook

Efforts to label Trump with a mental disorder let us off the hook in thinking about the kinds of personalities our culture rewards — and about the state of our politics. The very traits that many claim are toxic and dysfunctional have not only failed to harm him but have contributed to his success.

His grandiosity and bombast make him an entertaining media personality. His aggressiveness has brought him better real estate deals. Some are offended by his arrogance, but it’s gained him approval among his supporters.

It might be comforting to think that Trump’s long-running intimations that President Obama is a foreigner, or has secret sympathy for terrorists, are the product of a delusional mind. But in fact, these statements tap into a potent undercurrents on the American right. (It has also earned him lavish attention from major news networks.)

Diagnosing Donald Trump singles him out in a way that absolves his fellow citizens. Even if he continues his abysmal polling, at least 30 percent of the people in this country are likely to vote for him this fall, many enthusiastically so.

This support says more about our politics, and our citizens, than it does about Donald Trump’s psychology. As Sarah Kendzior aptly describes it in a recent piece on "Donald Trump’s America," whether Trump wins or loses, the America of his supporters will likely remain "suffering, anxious, and violent."

Trump’s arrogance and aggressive personality fits with his arrogant and aggressive political solutions. His angry bullying appeals to people who are angry and feel they need a bully "on their side." The success of the dark narcissistic elements of Trump’s personality depends on the dark nationalistic forces of our current politics.

But political problems demand political solutions, not medical ones. To put a fresh twist on a phrase used by President Obama in a recent speech: "Don’t diagnose. Vote."

Rating 4.5



They’re on the run from people who are attempting to round up mutant children who were created in a lab. One of those children — dubbed Laura by the nurses at the lab — is technically Logan's daughter, though he’s only just realized she exists. (He’s ditched the Wolverine moniker, hence the film's title, which is the character’s given name.) Taking a couple of hours to rest up in a hotel and watch a classic Western is a huge risk.

Shane, in case you’re unfamiliar, ruminates on the incompatibility of open violence with civilization. It’s about a gunslinger who saves a little farm, then has to leave, while the child who’s come to love him shouts his name endlessly after his retreating form. Filmed out in the great wide open of the Rocky Mountains, it’s a classic of elemental Western storytelling.

So when I saw that film — and its most earnest, schmaltziest portions — quoted in an X-Men movie, as big and cynical a corporate machine as you could ever imagine, I rolled my eyes. “Jesus,” I thought. “What are they even doing here?”

It turns out the filmmakers are calling their shot. By the end of Logan, I was deeply, genuinely moved. It’s not as great a film as Shane, but it’s not embarrassed by the comparison, at least. Here are five reasons Logan is the best X-Men movie since 2003’s X2.

1) Logan places an emphasis on character drama instead of action

If there’s an obvious complaint to be made about Logan, it’s that at 136 minutes, it’s probably a little long. But since the extra scenes all seem to build up the story and develop the characters, rather than ladle on action-packed spectacle (as in 2016’s X-Men: Apocalypse), I’m inclined to forgive them.

At heart, Logan is a father-daughter story, or a story of parent-child reconciliation, or just a story about learning to forgive others and yourself for transgressions. It’s about trying to outrun your demons, first on a figurative and then on a very literal level.

Related How the X-Men changed my life

The movie spends most of its time on the road with Logan (who’s working as an El Paso limo driver in the film’s near-future, pre-apocalyptic setting, where mutants are mostly extinct), Laura (terrific newcomer Dafne Keen), and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) himself. Logan needs to get Laura from El Paso to North Dakota, where she can slip across the border to Canada and avoid mutant-hunting squads.

Logan’s self-healing body is running out of steam, Laura doesn’t understand how to fit into human society, and Professor X is in his 90s and suffering from an undisclosed mental ailment. This setup provides the fodder for either a serious melodrama or a kind of goofy road trip movie. That Logan manages to split the difference between the two is truly impressive.

And it’s all thanks to the three actors, who spend a lot of time just bonding in a car. Where director James Mangold (and his co-screenwriters Scott Frank and Michael Green) could insert big action beats, they mostly eschew them in favor of people just talking to each other. That’s something superhero movies increasingly lack, and it’s more than welcome here.

2) The movie knows we know how superhero movies work

One of the best things about Logan is that it strips away most of the over-explanatory bullshit that bogs down too many modern superhero films. Gone are the scenes where somebody explains another person’s powers in detail. Mangold trusts his filmmaking — or our now voluminous knowledge of the X-Men universe, learned from the many other films set within it — to get the point across.

In one scene, a character simply suggests that a degenerative brain disease could be a big problem in a brain as powerful as Professor X’s, and that’s all we need to know to understand why certain things happen throughout the film. Incidents in the past are referred to but never entirely spelled out, instead becoming part of the tapestry of Logan’s generalized guilt. And Laura’s struggle to reconcile her humanity with her powers is illustrated without dialogue. “You know this story,” Mangold seems to be saying. “You don’t need more exposition.”

In many ways, Logan reminds me of Westerns made in the ’50s and ’60s, when audiences were so familiar with the rules of the genre that they welcomed more iconoclastic takes on these stories. I don’t think Logan has broken free entirely from its comic book trappings — it’s still a little too enamored of secret plots by corporations and/or the government — but it feels like a huge step in the right direction.

3) The movie is bloody and violent, but with a purpose

Logan is R-rated, which means its fights are darker and bloodier than in typical PG-13-rated superhero flicks. Gore flies through the air, and both Logan and Laura (who has sets of retractable claws in her hands and feet) spend a fair amount of time stabbing people in the head.

But around the movie’s midpoint — when the central trio stops to rest on a little farm with a friendly family headed up by actors Eriq La Salle and Elise Neal — all of that violence starts to gain a terrible weight.

People die in Logan, yes, but there’s a focus on the moments of their deaths, on their struggles to maintain honor in the face of doom. And the film’s focus also falls on those who kill them, and on how it feels to commit murder, even with a righteous cause.

Unlike many superhero movies, this is a film where the deaths of random individuals, including villains, have meaning. As the bodies start to pile up, and as Logan is responsible for more and more of those deaths, the film genuinely digs into the moral exhaustion inherent in being a killing machine, as well as a father’s hope that his daughter might not follow in his footsteps, even though she’s perfectly equipped to do so.

Like the Westerns it emulates, Logan at least tries to address what it means to be a hero, rather than assuming something is good because its main character does it.

4) Mangold has settled into the Wolverine world with aplomb

I quite liked 2013’s The Wolverine — Jackman and Mangold’s previous collaboration — but its action sequences were a little lacking. Its climax was especially muddled, and kept a solid film from becoming the very good one it occasionally flirted with being.

In Logan, Mangold seems as if he’s better equipped to complete the task at hand. The director has always been good at character interplay and at orchestrating stripped-down scenes that economically reveal who the people in his movies are. (Notably, he had great success with the 2007 Western 3:10 to Yuma, which feels like a dry run for this film.)

What’s changed here is that his action sequences are, for the most part, inventively filmed and smartly choreographed.

In one, late in the film, he announces Logan’s arrival in the vicinity of the action simply with the sound of Jackman bellowing in the woods somewhere offscreen, then pauses to prolong the tension of when he might finally join the fray. When he does — for, again, what might be his final fight as the character — it feels suitably epic.

But Mangold and his co-writers have also created a nicely structured story, where problems pile up on each other, complications ensue, and Chekhov’s adamantium bullet will inevitably be fired. I was particularly enamored of their choice to have Laura know her father’s exploits mainly from X-Men comic books — a neatly underplayed bit of meta-commentary on how threadbare some superhero tropes have become.

5) The performances are, top to bottom, terrific

Mangold’s skill at directing actors in all sorts of films didn’t always shine through in The Wolverine, but Logan is another story. Yes, the central trio is great. But every role in the film boasts a talented actor who brings something to the story.

Elizabeth Rodriguez pops up briefly as the nurse caring for Laura, while Stephen Merchant takes the role of mutant Caliban, now working as Professor X’s caretaker. The bad guys include such malevolent presences as Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, the latter of whom turns out to be much better at playing a villain than he is a cop on Narcos. Even the film's little side trips into other characters’ stories — as with that stop on the farm with La Salle and Neal — boast great acting.

Too many superhero films turn the characters who aren’t superheroes into props or love interests. They’re often used as props to serve the story, and rarely have their own lives independent of the main characters.

What sets Logan apart and makes it so impressively moving in the end is the way it suggests that everyone — from its hero down to characters with only a handful of lines — is fumbling through existence like the rest of us. The ultimate goal by film’s end isn’t to beat the bad guys or even to connect with a long-lost child; it’s to find ultimate meaning in life, to figure out how to define oneself as both a person and a good person. It’s, unexpectedly, resonant, bittersweet, and maybe even profound.

Logan opens in theaters Friday, March 3.One of the littlest words in the English language gives the biggest clue about where Donald Trump’s head is at: his use of the word “the.”

In the second US presidential debate on Oct. 9, Trump promised, “I’m going to help the African-Americans. I’m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. [Clinton has] done a terrible job for the African-Americans.” Trump’s unusual use of “the” hasn’t gone unnoticed.

Normally innocuous, this definite article is now causing serious offense. The hashtag #theAfricanAmericans has been trending since the debate with angry and sardonic comments on Trump’s linguistic choice.

I REALLY need him to stop calling me "THE African-Americans" because ARE YOU KIDDING ME? — shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) October 10, 2016

Wondering if #TheAfricanAmericans are meeting up tomorrow somewhere in the inner city. Let a sister know where to be. I'll keep the minutes. — Kelly Wickham Hurst (@mochamomma) October 10, 2016

If Trump had said, “I’m going to help African-Americans,” we’d assume he meant African-Americans in general—whichever ones need help. Under normal circumstances, saying “the African-Americans” would raise the question: Which African-Americans? In the context of the debate, we have to assume he intends to refer to all African-Americans, and so “the” seems unnecessary. But it is doing something. It takes that plural, “African-Americans,” and makes the group into more of an undifferentiated whole.

For example, if we say “African-Americans work in the auto industry,” we’re not saying that all African-Americans do one kind of work. In this case, putting “the” before “African-Americans” makes it sound like all African-American people work in one industry: “The African-Americans work in the auto industry.”

Trump’s “the” works as a dog-whistle to disaffected rural white voters attracted to his message. “The” makes the group seem like it’s a large, uniform mass, rather than a diverse group of individuals. This is the key to “othering:” treating people from another group as less human than one’s own group. The Nazis did it when they talked about die Juden (“the Jews”). Homophobes do it when they talk about “the gays.” In my research on British and American cultural relations, I’ve found that British writers’ views on American English are a good predictor of whether they’ll write “Americans say it that way” or “The Americans say it that way.” Those who feel that American English threatens British English use “the” to hold Americans at arm’s length (possibly while holding their noses).

Neither candidate refers to the general American public as “the Americans”—to do so would be deeply weird, since it would seem like they did not include themselves in the group. (Trump does have a penchant for talking about “the people of this country” and how they are furious, but if he had said “the Americans are furious,” we’d know for sure we had a Manchurian candidate.)

But both candidates sometimes say “the” before the names of nationalities and ethnicities. The difference is that when Clinton talks about the Russians, the Syrians, the Iranians, and the Kurds, she’s talking about governments or military groups, not everyone of that particular nationality. Trump’s use of the African-Americans and the Latinos feels different.

I doubt it’s an accident that Trump talks about ethnic groups in the same way that we talk about foreign governments and armies. If that “the” treats ethnic groups as some monolithic cabal, that might ring true with the conspiracy-theory mind-set that characterizes some of his core audience—the audience that Trump has been priming to see and make trouble at polling places “in certain areas”.

Trump’s “the” works as a dog-whistle to disaffected rural white voters attracted to his message. At the very least, he is demonstrating to those voters that he is keeping other groups distanced—that, like them, he sees African-Americans and Latinos as something over there, in the inner cities (and the White House), rather than as millions of individual Americans with as much invested in the future of this country as its white citizens.

We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson has agreed to sever all ties with Exxon Mobil (Swiss: XOM-USD.SW - news) , putting deferred stock awards in an independently managed trust, the company he headed until last week said.

The agreement was reached in consultation with federal ethics regulators to comply with conflict of interest requirements, it said in a statement late Tuesday.

Under the arrangement reached with Exxon Mobil's board of directors, Tillerson will place the value of some two million company shares that he would have received over the next ten years in an independently managed trust.

He will give up $4.1 million in cash bonuses that had been scheduled to be paid out over the next three years, as well as other benefits.

"The net effect of the agreement is a reduction of approximately $7 million in compensation owed to Tillerson," the company said in a statement.

Additionally, Tillerson has committed to selling the more than 600,000 Exxon shares he currently owns.

The trust will not be permitted to hold Exxon stock, and Tillerson will be barred from working in the oil and gas industry for the next 10 years.

Tillerson, who was nominated last month to be President-elect Donald Trump's chief diplomat, retired December 31 after more than forty years at Exxon Mobil, the last ten years as CEO.

Although highly respected as a globe-trotting dealmaker for Exxon Mobil, Tillerson is regarded as a controversial choice as secretary of state because of his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

He has also been criticized for deals struck on behalf of Exxon Mobil that were at odds with US foreign policy.Donald Trump’s supporters deserve to have their concerns taken seriously.

If the media and commentators in 2016 can agree on nothing else, it’s this. It’s a bit of an odd meme. I can remember literally no one in 2012 dwelling on the importance of taking the concerns of Mitt Romney voters seriously, even though they made up a considerably larger share of the population than Trump supporters. No one talks about taking the interests of Hillary Clinton supporters, a still larger group, seriously.

But Trump supporters, a smaller group backing a considerably more loathsome agenda, have received an unprecedented outpouring of sympathy, undertaken as a sort of passive-aggressive snipe at unnamed other commentators and politicians perceived to not be taking their concerns seriously.

“Trumpism has, in part, made the rest of the nation all the more eager to ignore the millions of white voters living on the edges of the economy,” Michelle Cottle worries at the Atlantic.

“Many decent, sincere people who feel disregarded, disrespected, and left behind — in ways that I do not feel and have never felt — can disproportionately embrace political opinions that I view as bigoted or paranoid,” David Blankenhorn empathizes at the American Interest. “Today’s upscale Americans are less and less likely even to interact with, much less actually give a damn about, those other Americans.”

“Their problems should still be addressed,” Michael Brendan Dougherty writes at the Week, “not because the elite views them as virtuous and thus deserving of the help of the state and its political class, but by virtue of our common citizenship.”

I agree with a lot of this. The government should help people who are materially struggling. Globalization definitely left some segments of the population struggling, and they deserve help. White people, while still economically dominant over black and Latino Americans in basically every way possible, can suffer from poverty too.

But there’s something striking about this line of commentary: It doesn’t take the stated concerns of Trump voters, and voters for similar far-right populists abroad, seriously in the slightest.

Trump’s supporters are not the wretched of the earth

The press has gotten extremely comfortable with describing a Trump electorate that simply doesn’t exist. Cottle describes his supporters as “white voters living on the edges of the economy.” This is, in nearly every particular, wrong.

There is absolutely no evidence that Trump’s supporters, either in the primary or the general election, are disproportionately poor or working class. Exit polling from the primaries found that Trump voters made about as much as Ted Cruz voters, and significantly more than supporters of either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Trump voters, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver found, had a median household income of $72,000, a fair bit higher than the $62,000 median household income for non-Hispanic whites in America.

A major study from Gallup's Jonathan Rothwell confirmed this. Trump support was correlated with higher, not lower, income, both among the population as a whole and among white people. Trump supporters were less likely to be unemployed or to have dropped out of the labor force. Areas with more manufacturing, or higher exposure to imports from China, were less likely to think favorably of Trump.

This shouldn’t be surprising. Lower-income whites are always likelier to support Democrats than other whites. It’d be very odd if Trump singlehandedly reversed that longstanding trend in American public opinion. But it suggests that the image of Trump supporters as whites on the economic margins, being failed by the elites in Washington and New York, is wrong.

So what is driving Trump supporters? In the general election, the story is pretty simple: What’s driving support for Trump is that he is the Republican nominee, a little fewer than half of voters always vote for Republicans, and Trump is getting most of those voters.

In the primary, though, the story was, as my colleague Zack Beauchamp has explained at length, almost entirely about racial resentment. There’s a wide array of data to back this up.

UCLA's Michael Tesler has found that support for Trump in the primaries strongly correlated with respondents' racial resentment, as measured by survey data. Similarly, Republican voters with the lowest opinions of Muslims were the most likely to vote for Trump, and voters who strongly support mass deportation of undocumented immigrants were likelier to support him in the primaries too.

In April, when the Pew Research Center asked Republicans for their views on Trump, and their opinions on the US becoming majority nonwhite by 2050, they found that Republicans who thought a majority nonwhite population would be "bad for the country" had overwhelmingly favorable views of Trump. Those who thought it was a positive or neutral development were evenly split on Trump.

By contrast, John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 got less primary support from voters with high racial resentment and anti-immigration scores than they did from less racially resentful or anti-immigrant voters. Those two primaries were lost by the white nationalist wing of the Republican Party at a time when that wing was gaining in number. As New America's Lee Drutman has found, Republicans’ views of blacks and Latinos plummeted during the Obama years:

The white nationalist wing was gaining in strength, and due for a win. It got one in Trump.

Even in the general election, while support for Trump is correlated most strongly with party ID, the second biggest factor, per the analysis of Hamilton College political scientist Philip Klinkner, was racial resentment. Economic pessimism and income level were statistically insignificant.

The message this research sends is very, very clear. There is a segment of the Republican Party that is opposed to racial equality. It has increased in numbers in reaction to the election of a black president. The result was that an anti–racial equality candidate won the Republican nomination.

Given that the US is one recession away from a Republican winning the presidency, this is a concerning development.

Taking Trump supporters seriously means not pretending their concerns are about the economy

The American press is overwhelmingly made up of left-of-center white people who live in large cities and have internalized very strong anti-racist norms. As a result, it tends to be composed of people who think of racism as a very, very serious character defect, and who are riddled with anxiety about being perceived as out of touch with “real America.” “Real America” being, per decades of racially charged tropes in our culture, white, non-urban America.

So in comes Donald Trump, a candidate running on open white nationalism whose base is whites who — while not economically struggling compared with poor whites backing Hillary Clinton and doing way better economically than black or Latino people backing Clinton — definitely live in the “real America” which journalists feel a yearning to connect to and desperately don’t want to be out of touch with.

Describing these people as motivated by racial resentment, per journalists’ deep-seated belief that racism is a major character defect, seems cruel and un-empathetic, even if it’s supported by extensive amounts of social scientific research and indeed by the statements of Trump’s supporters themselves.

So it becomes very, very tempting to just ignore this evidence and insist that Trump supporters are in fact the wretched of the earth, and to connect them with every possible pathology of white America: post-industrial decay, the opioid crisis, labor force dropouts, rising middle-age mortality rates, falling social mobility, and so on. This almost always fails (globalization victims and labor force dropouts are less likely to support Trump, per Rothwell), but if there’s even a small hint of a connection, as when Rothwell found a correlation between Trump support and living in an area with rising white mortality, you’re in luck. If you can squint hard enough, the narrative will always survive.

There’s a parallel temptation among leftists and social democrats who, in their ongoing attempt to show that neoliberal capitalism is failing, attempt to tie that failure to the rise of Trump. If economic suffering among lower-class whites caused Trump, the reasoning goes, then the solution is to address that suffering through a more generous welfare state and better economic policy, achieved through a multiethnic working-class coalition that includes those Trump supporters. Yes, these supporters may be racist, but it’s important not to say mean things about them lest they fall out of the coalition.

I actually agree that the current capitalist regime is failing. We need truly universal health care, universal child care, a universal child allowance or basic income, and programs to address deep poverty. Redistribution is a very good, necessary thing.

But we have a good case study we can examine to see if Western European–style welfare states can prevent far-right racist backlashes from popping up. It’s called Western Europe. And Sweden’s justly acclaimed welfare state did not prevent the rise of the viciously anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, which has its origins in the Swedish neo-fascist and white supremacist movements and is now the third-largest party in Swedish parliament.

Nor did Austria’s welfare state prevent the far-right Freedom Party — led by Jörg Haider, who praised Hitler for having a “proper employment policy” — from entering government in 1999. France’s crèches and best-in-the-world government health care didn’t prevent Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been repeatedly convicted of Holocaust denial, from reaching the runoff for the 2002 presidential elections. It has not stopped his successor and daughter Marine from leading polling for next year’s presidential elections. The Netherlands’ comprehensive welfare state has not prevented first Pim Fortuyn and then Geert Wilders from becoming major political forces, with the latter leading most polls for the next elections.

Nor has Germany’s strong, manufacturing-heavy and export-oriented economy, arguably the strongest in Europe, kept the far-right AfD party from gaining in recent local elections. It’s telling to note that while economically thriving Germany is facing a far-right menace, Spain, where unemployment is 20 percent (similar to the US in the Great Depression), has no far-right movement of much consequence.

Comprehensive welfare states are very, very good. They do not solve racism. Whites in both Europe and America have made it very clear that they will not accept becoming a demographic minority without a fight, and will continue to vote for candidates that speak to that concern and promise immigration policies that put off white minority status for as long as possible.

Accepting that Trumpism is about race does not mean giving up

One thing this analysis decidedly does not imply is “Hey, Trump supporters are just racists, let’s give up on them.” Trump’s nomination is a threat to America that must be addressed and never allowed to happen again. Giving up is not an option. We have to figure out some way to respond.

Nor is somehow denying Trump supporters material support they need an option (though this is a proposal I’ve only ever heard attacked by journalists sympathetic to Trump supporters; I’ve never heard it actually proposed). Hillary Clinton, to her great credit, has offered programs ranging from expanded child care to free college to a plan to fight the opioid epidemic to child tax credit expansions to improvements to Obamacare that will leave millions of white Trump supporters much better off. This isn’t worth doing to win back their votes; it’s worth doing because it’s the right thing to do.

Notably, Trump is not proposing anything like this and would in fact raise taxes on many middle-class families. Insisting, as many journalists have, that his supporters aren’t voting for the white nationalist candidate because they agree with him on race seems like a way to be charitable to those voters. But the idea that voters are motivated by economic struggles and so are voting for a candidate who would make their economic situation far worse is much more insulting than accepting they are uncomfortable with racial equality. The implicit idea is that Trump’s voters aren’t motivated by genuine political disagreement about race, but are just dupes voting for the wrong candidate because they’re too dumb to Google his tax plan.

Any solution has to begin with a correct diagnosis of the problem. If Trump’s supporters are not, in fact, motivated by economic marginalization, then even full Bernie Sanders–style social democracy is not going to prevent a Trump recurrence. Nor are GOP-style tax cuts, and liberal pundits aggressively signaling virtue to each other by writing ad nauseam about the need to empathize with the Trump Voter aren’t doing anyone any good.

What’s needed is an honest reckoning with what it means that a large segment of the US population, large enough to capture one of the two major political parties, is motivated primarily by white nationalism and an anxiety over the fast-changing demographics of the country. Maybe the GOP will find a way to control and contain this part of its base. Maybe the racist faction of the party will dissipate over time, especially as Obama’s presidency recedes into memory. Maybe it took Trump’s celebrity to mobilize them at all, and future attempts will fail.

But Donald Trump’s supporters’ concerns are heavily about race. Taking them seriously means, first and foremost, acknowledging that, and dealing with it honestly.

Watch: What the media gets wrong about Trump votersFrom 2012 to 2015, Evelyn Farkas served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia. Since leaving office, she’s been raising the alarm that there was more to the strange relationship between Trumpland and Russia than the public knew. Maybe even much more. This week, she was proven right.

We spoke Wednesday, and the relief was evident in her voice. Far from being concerned over the new revelations, she’s comforted that the ties are finally being made public and broad pressure is finally being applied for more investigations. “I didn’t think it would happen this fast,” she says.

The investigation we need, Farkas continues, is the equivalent of running “a security clearance on the president.” The core question is, “Are you susceptible to blackmail from a foreign entity or individual?”

Related The 3 Trump-Russia scandals, explained

Farkas, who served as the executive director of the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism, thinks Congress needs to create an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate Russia’s ties to the Trump administration and role in the election. In this interview, which is edited for length and clarity, she explains why.

Ezra Klein

What’s your level of alarm after the resignation of Michael Flynn?

Evelyn Farkas

It’s lower than it’s been since the summer, when I was first made aware of all this stuff. I’m like, finally, everybody else sees it! Seriously.

The reason I was so upset last summer was that I was getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here. I was agitated because I knew the Clinton campaign and the world didn’t know. But I didn’t think it would happen this fast. I didn’t think Flynn would survive a year, but I thought it would be most of the year.

The fact that Flynn is gone is constructive from the perspective of US foreign policy. He was getting it wrong on combating terrorism and Russia. So I feel relieved that he will not be whispering his policy prescriptions in the president’s ear.

On the bigger issue, the intelligence community, the bureaucracy, patriotic Americans, and some members of Congress are making it impossible for the White House to sweep whatever they are trying to hide under the rug. And the White House is clearly trying to hide something, or the president would have said, on day one, that he would support the investigations that began under his predecessor.

Ezra Klein

The piece of this I keep coming back to is Trump’s own actions. He’s a guy with very few consistent and clear policy positions, particularly on foreign policy. But he has always had very specific, very hard-line pro-Russian policies — questioning NATO, altering the GOP platform to be friendlier to Russia on Ukraine. And he has surrounded himself with staffers like Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who are unusually closely tied to Russia. That behavior is what, to me, creates a context that makes these contacts between his associates and Russian intelligence really unnerving.

Evelyn Farkas

It is unusual. His personnel choices line up with his words on Russia. This is the only place where we haven’t seen Trump contradict himself, but we still don’t know exactly what his policy will be. We know he’s inclined to be friendly to Putin, to cooperate with Putin, but he hasn’t articulated specifics.

Ezra Klein

Where does an investigation like this go? What do you think the investigators are looking for?

Evelyn Farkas

From the perspective of the intelligence community, the fundamental question is: Are you susceptible to blackmail from a foreign entity or individual? There’s the possibility of blackmail based on giving money or lending money or guaranteeing something. There could be some hanky-panky that opens the president up to blackmail.

It’s like you’re trying to do a security clearance on the president. The intelligence agencies want to make sure there’s no undue foreign influence on him.

Ezra Klein

The question that concerns me is whether these investigations can be sustained. What we’re seeing emerge right now is largely information that has already been gathered. But the heads of the CIA, FBI, and Department of Justice are now people Trump has either appointed or kept on. Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to really investigate. So how does this inquiry maintain momentum?

Evelyn Farkas

Congress is so politicized. For them to be in charge of an investigation is hard. So I think that what you’re going to see happen — unless the Republicans really have a come-to-Jesus moment where they decide they’ll lose in 2018 unless they pull themselves together and really investigate this in a bipartisan fashion — is Democrats and the American people will force it out of Congress and into a bipartisan, independent commission.

Ezra Klein

What would that look like?

Evelyn Farkas

It should be made up of former members of Congress, éminence grises. It could be a Brent Scowcroft, an Eric Cantor. I was the executive director of the Graham-Talent WMD commission. The thing with these commissions is you begin by establishing a baseline of facts, and only then do you proceed with the investigation.

Ezra Klein

But Congress would have to vote to form a commission like that, right? And I doubt Trump would sign that bill.

Evelyn Farkas

It would have to be veto-proof. It would have to be the result of huge outside political pressure. The upside of farming it out, for Republicans, is that the commission allocates the blame. The president can’t say, Paul Ryan, you set me up. Paul Ryan can just say, we were under huge pressure to create the commission, but I didn’t know it would lead to this!

On December 7, 2009, the Administrator signed two distinct findings regarding greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act:

Endangerment Finding: The Administrator finds that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) — in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.

The Administrator finds that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. Cause or Contribute Finding: The Administrator finds that the combined emissions of these well-mixed greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution which threatens public health and welfare.

These findings do not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities. However, this action was a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles. In collaboration with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, EPA finalized emission standards for light-duty vehicles (2012-2016 model years) in May of 2010 and heavy-duty vehicles (2014-2018 model years) in August of 2011.

These findings were signed by the Administrator on December 7, 2009. On December 15, 2009, the final findings were published in the Federal Register (www.regulations.gov) under Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0171. The final rule was effective January 14, 2010.

On April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court found that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act. The Court held that the Administrator must determine whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or whether the science is too uncertain to make a reasoned decision. In making these decisions, the Administrator is required to follow the language of section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court decision resulted from a petition for rulemaking under section 202(a) filed by more than a dozen environmental, renewable energy, and other organizations.

On April 17, 2009, the Administrator signed proposed endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. EPA held a 60-day public comment period, which ended June 23, 2009, and received over 380,000 public comments. These included both written comments as well as testimony at two public hearings in Arlington, Virginia and Seattle, Washington. EPA carefully reviewed, considered, and incorporated public comments and has now issued these final Findings.

Top of PageHere's a capsule summary of the big UN climate talks this year:

1) The good news: Every country is submitting a detailed pledge to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

2) The bad: Those pledges, added together, aren't nearly enough to keep us below 2°C of global warming. Short of drastic changes, we're in for some serious shit.

Point 2 can be tricky to conceptualize, since it involves so many moving parts. For more detail, I'd recommend this new paper in Environmental Research Letters by Glen Peters, Robbie Andrew, Susan Solomon, and Pierre Friedlingstein. It's the clearest presentation I've seen of how far off course the world is from its stated 2°C climate goal. And it illustrates why the United States, Europe, China, and even India would have to drastically rethink their climate policies to stay below that target.

The US, Europe, and China will use up the world's carbon budget by 2030

The science here is pretty straightforward: If we want decent odds of avoiding more than 2°C (or 3.6°F) of global warming — which has long been the stated goal — then there's only so much more carbon dioxide we can put into the atmosphere. The world's annual CO2 emissions will need to shrink to zero to stay within this "carbon budget."

In their paper, Peters and his co-authors sketch out a plausible carbon budget if we want a 66 percent chance of staying below 2°C. (Because there's some uncertainty around climate sensitivity, this is couched in terms of probabilities.) Roughly speaking, the world has just 765 gigatons of CO2 left to emit. We currently emit about 35 gigatons per year and don't (yet) have large-scale carbon removal technology.

The authors then compared this carbon budget (the dark line) with what the United States, the European Union, and China* are currently promising to do on emissions between now and 2030:

There's a big problem here: If the United States, EU, and China all followed through on their current emissions pledges, they'd consume practically the world's entire carbon budget by 2030 — leaving only scraps for the rest of the world (the part shaded in gray).

That's untenable. The "rest of the world" is where most of humanity lives — 5 billion people. It includes India, which is still very poor, has per capita emissions that are just one-fourth of Europe's and China's, and will inevitably need to burn more fossil fuels to grow. It also includes Africa, which still has 620 million people without electricity. No one thinks it'd be fair for these developing countries to cut even more deeply than the United States and Europe.

So that leaves a few options. Humanity could emit more CO2 than this budget allows — though at the risk of higher levels of global warming, with all the problems, risks, and potential horrors that entails. If, say, we emitted another 1,535 gigatons of CO2, double the budget above, then our odds of staying below 2°C drop to 50-50. A much bigger gamble.

Alternatively, the US, EU, and China could tighten their belts and cut their emissions even more deeply than they're currently promising, to make space for other, poorer countries. But how would they do that? And is that even realistic?

To stay below 2°C, the US, EU, China, and India would have to cut much, much more

In their paper, Peters and his colleagues explore what a "fair" climate agreement that still keeps global warming below 2°C might look like. Because fairness is an ethical term, not a scientific one, there are all sorts of ways to define it.

One possibility is that emission cuts would be divided equally among countries. The United States and Europe and China and India and Zimbabwe would all make proportionally similar sacrifices to stay below 2°C. When the dust settled, the average American would still emit more than the average Indian, but they'd each have made similar percentage cuts. The authors call this the "inertia" approach.

Another option would be to divvy up cuts so that every country has roughly the same level of per capita emissions. In this scenario, India's emissions are allowed to grow, while the US and Europe have to cut much more deeply. The authors call this the "equity" approach.

We could debate which one is truly fairer all day. But one key point here is that, under either scenario, the United States, Europe, and China would all have to cut a lot more deeply than they're currently promising.

Here's a look at current US climate pledges (the gold line) compared with the much deeper cuts required under either an "inertia" or "equity" approach to staying below 2°C:

Here's the EU's current pledges (in blue) compared with what'd be required to stay below 2°C:

And heres's China. Note that there's some uncertainty over how high, exactly, China's emissions are expected peak in 2030, but no matter what assumptions you use, they're expected to peak much higher (the orange lines) than what would be required under "inertia" or "equity" approaches to stay below 2°C:

We're not even close.

Cutting emissions enough to hit 2°C would take ... a miracle

What these charts show is that the US, Europe, and China are all currently promising ambitious emission reductions. Yet those promises are all laughably inadequate compared with what would be required to stay below 2°C.

In the United States, the necessary cuts for 2°C would require policies titanically more ambitious than anything the Obama administration has been doing through the Environmental Protection Agency. An "equity" approach would require getting to zero carbon by 2040 — just 25 years. We'd be talking about World War II–style mobilization. Congress would need to get involved, either by enacting carbon pricing or other policies to massively scale up zero-carbon energy. Few politicians are talking about anything like this.

Likewise, China would need emissions to peak sharply around 2020 — 10 years earlier than the government is currently envisioning — and then decline drastically thereafter. That's not easy given all the coal plants that the country has built over the last 10 years, facilities that can be expected to last for decades. Many of those plants would need to be either retired early or retrofitted with technology to scrub their emissions and bury the CO2 underground.

By the way, it's not just these countries. India would also have to make wrenching changes. On Twitter, Peters posted a graph comparing India's projected emissions under current policies (the purple line) with what'd be required under "inertia" or "equity" scenarios for staying below 2°C:

Given that India is currently planning to double coal production by 2020 as it lifts itself out of poverty, this looks incredibly unlikely.

So is 2°C still possible? Maybe with negative emissions.

Lately, a growing chorus of climate observers have been pointing out that without a massive — and increasingly improbable — rethink, the world simply won't meet its goal of staying below 2°C of global warming (I laid out the case here; my colleague David Roberts did so here).

Add this paper to the pile. It concludes that there's a "high risk of exceeding 2°C given current trends."

Now, there are a couple of potential caveats. Perhaps clean energy will advance far more rapidly than expected, making it easier for the United States, Europe, China, India, and everyone else to cut emissions more sharply than anyone's predicting. Or... perhaps the current emission pledges will prove to be mere starting points, and policymakers will significantly ramp up the level of ambition after meeting in Paris in December. That's certainly the overarching hope around the current UN talks — that action will build on action, iteratively.

Still, the charts above suggest there's not really much time remaining for a massive change of course. If the US, EU, China, and India don't make any major alterations to their emission plans between now and 2030, they'll have used up the world's entire 2°C carbon budget. At that point, we either have to hope climate sensitivity is on the very low end of the range that scientists have estimated, or we're busting through the 2°C limit. Better start preparing.

There is one other option, however. If we could devise carbon-removal technologies that can suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, we could conceivably extend our existing "carbon budget." The problem is that we'd have to remove a lot of CO2, some 2 to 10 gigatons per year by mid-century, more than all the world's forests and soils currently take up. Planting trees won't be enough. We'd need to look into things like air capture or biomass with carbon capture and sequestration — and scale them up rapidly. (See this interview with Noah Deich for more on that.)

Is that plausible? No one knows. But as climate scientist Kevin Anderson recently argued in Nature Geoscience, the only way we'll stay below 2°C is if we either a) develop negative-emissions technology, or b) opt for negative economic growth. The math just doesn't work otherwise.

One final coda: as I've noted before, even if the world does crash through the 2°C limit, that would hardly mean it's game over. Because the risks and damages from global warming go up significantly the higher that temperatures rise, even 2.5°C warming is still preferable to 3°C, which is better than 4°C, which is way better than 5°C. There's never going to be a point when it's time to just give up.

* Footnote: China has promised that its emissions would peak by around 2030, but it hasn't specified what level they'll peak. So Peters and his co-authors estimated, based on expected carbon-intensity improvements, that China would emit roughly 11.3 gigatons of CO2 in 2030. But the actual figure could well end up being lower (or higher).

Schumer (D-N.Y.) addresses the media on Capitol Hill Wednesday about the fallout from the resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)

The real world is full of hot wars and cold wars, but the Senate is now fully engaged in a turf war.

The battle lines are being drawn by the very powerful leaders of the committees that oversee national security matters, who are trying to assert jurisdiction over the unfolding saga surrounding U.S. assertions that Russia tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign.

Before this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), seeking to cordon off the probe inside the most secretive of panels, the Senate Intelligence Committee, had faced off against Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who for weeks had called for a more sweeping public investigation.

But the pressure for more immediate and visible action has intensified with Michael Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser after revelations that he spoke repeatedly with the Russian ambassador last year.

With new details coming almost daily, frustration has grown on Capitol Hill with the slow pace of the Intelligence Committee’s work, under its chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.). And that has sparked new interest in whether other committees should get a piece of the action — or whether a select committee should be created that would pull in the top members of all the relevant committees.

After a pair of bipartisan, closed-door huddles, Burr still had the lead role on the investigation. But doubt was creeping in.

[Senate Democrats unify around congressional probe of Trump ties to Russia]

“I guess the question is, is that the best way to have a fulsome look, 360, at everything that’s been going on? And I don’t know,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters before the GOP’s luncheon.

Corker said he is “mulling” the right path, whether it’s a select committee or just giving out more pieces of the investigation to other panels. “I’m telling you that I’m not sure we have the most efficient situation right now on this,” he said.

Burr said he’s doing just fine. “We’re into it and we will methodically continue,” he told reporters. But while other senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have called for Flynn to testify about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December about economic sanctions, Burr also acknowledged that his panel has not decided whether to do so. “We don’t even know what to ask Mr. Flynn,” Burr said.

[Pence remains above the fray, but is he outside the inner circle?]

Turf wars don’t split on ideological lines. They often hinge more on which committees get the clout and glamour that come with a high-profile investigation.

These are moments that can often define a senator’s career. Even before Flynn’s resignation landed at 11 p.m. Monday, commentators were demanding, “What did the president know and when did he know it?” — parrying the infamous line uttered in 1973 by Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) when he served on the special committee to investigate the Watergate scandal.

Burr has the backing of the top Democrat on his committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), who said he told Democrats that there was no need to expand the investigation beyond his panel.

“We’ve already started this process. We’re already starting to review the raw intelligence. We are well down this path,” Warner said. He also told his colleagues that creating a new select committee would be cumbersome, requiring new legislative authority, a staff and a retread of much of the ground that the Intelligence Committee is already covering.

Warner’s comments came after a previously unscheduled gathering of the Democratic caucus, which Schumer’s aides trumpeted as “an emergency” meeting because of Tuesday’s report in the New York Times that intelligence officials had traced contacts between Trump advisers and Russian intelligence officials throughout the 2016 campaign.

Yet Schumer emerged with nothing new to add to the investigative spectrum other than to say that Democrats would push other committees to weigh in at times. In December, as intelligence officials confirmed their belief that Russian cyberattacks and other efforts were designed to help Trump win, Schumer and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) led an unsuccessful call for the creation of a select committee.

Some Democrats and Republicans latched onto the idea again in light of the latest media reports, including The Washington Post’s report Monday that senior officials had warned the Trump administration that Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador left him open to potential blackmail by Moscow.

[It’s bigger than Flynn. New Russia revelations widen Trump’s credibility gap.]

One’s position on the issue can sometimes be determined by membership on the committee in question. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee who remains a senior member, rejected calls for a new committee or commission to wade into the matter.

“I think it’s fair to say there are differences of opinion in the caucus,” she said after the Democratic meeting. “The question is how soon can you get started, in my mind.”

Critics of that committee’s recent history have noted that its work is often done in secret and takes years to flesh out, such as the multiple reports issued on interrogation techniques used in the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“This has consequences that are immediate,” said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), noting that the 2018 elections need protection from Russian interference. Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, joined Schumer, McCain and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) in the initial push for a new select committee to handle the matter. Now, he has resigned himself to the reality that it will reside exclusively under Burr and Warner — so long as the work gets done.

“Now we have to make sure that that actually is purposeful and accomplishes a full and complete investigation,” Reed said.

Warner said he understands the concern, and he has promised Democrats that he will revisit the creation of a new investigative panel if he feels Burr and the Republicans are not acting in good faith.

“If at any point we are not able to get the full information and we’re not pursuing the information to where the intelligence leads, we’ll look at other options,” he said.

Last week, we went to Corbin, Kentucky, to try to answer that question. It’s a small city in southeastern Kentucky, an area of the country that has seen huge declines in its uninsured rate — but also voted overwhelmingly for Trump.

You can read more about what we learned there in this story, but we also wanted to give you the transcripts of the conversations we had so the people we talked to could speak for themselves.

Debbie Mills is a 53-year-old furniture store owner in Bell County, an area of the state right on the Tennessee border. Earlier this year, doctors discovered that her husband has non-alcoholic cirrhosis. He now needs a transplant if he’s going to survive. Mills and her husband keep a bag packed, waiting for the doctors to call with news that a liver is available.

This all means that Mills really, really needs her health insurance. And she’s very grateful for the Affordable Care Act, because she couldn’t afford insurance before it was passed.

And yet she voted for Donald Trump. Until we spoke, she said she hadn’t taken Trump’s repeal threats seriously. As we talked, she started to process what his election might mean for her family’s future.

Here’s that conversation, edited for clarity and length.

Sarah Kliff

Can you walk through what your experience has been with Healthcare.gov?

Debbie Mills

The insurance we had before, we ended up paying about $1,200 a month for a family of five. It just kept going up each year.

So we ended up dropping it.

We didn't have health insurance. And we went for maybe two years with no insurance until this came out. We really didn't go to the doctor because it cost too much.

So for the past two years, we had the Healthcare.gov. It's made it affordable.

My husband ended up getting sick this year. He has non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.

He's lost all this weight and all this muscle tone. Some people don't recognize him that he's known for years until he speaks and they recognize his voice.

But it's been great to have health insurance, because I couldn't imagine what it would be like to not have it with all the treatments and things that he's had to have done.

When we didn't have health insurance, we didn't go and get blood work and all that stuff done to be checked to see, you know, how his liver was doing.

He was taking medicines that could damage the liver for the cholesterol and all that stuff. But because it costs so much to get blood work done … [the doctor] wanted it done every three months, and he would do it maybe once a year.

Byrd Pinkerton

So just to be clear, he only got it once a year during the years that you didn't have—

Debbie Mills

Have insurance. Yes. Yeah.

So like I said, we didn't go get it done, and so now he is very sick.

Sarah Kliff

﻿So what do you think about Obamacare as a law? I know it's not especially popular.

Debbie Mills

I have liked the fact that it gave us health insurance, you know, and I know some have not. Some have not been wanting to be forced to have it. But other ones, I know it has helped. I know a lot of people that have gotten it that did not have health insurance before.

Sarah Kliff

﻿Did it change your opinion of President Obama at all? I know nothing about your politics at all, but if you did like him—

Debbie Mills

I’m not really a fan of his policies, but I like the fact that he gave me health insurance. And I have been worried about the fact that, you know, is it going to go away ﻿because, like I said, we're in a situation now where I can't afford to pay $1,200 a month. And I can't go without insurance because he has to have it in order, you know … a transplant could be a million dollars.

Sarah Kliff

Did you vote in the election this year?

Debbie Mills

Yes.

Sarah Kliff

And do you mind telling us who you supported?

Debbie Mills

We voted for Trump.

Sarah Kliff

So how did you decide to vote for him, since he's one of the people promising to repeal Obamacare?

Debbie Mills

Well … we liked him because he just seemed to be a businessman.

We're in a small, rural area where there's not a lot of businesses right now going on, and so we can't really have anything else shut down, because it affects everybody.

We were in an area where there's lots of coal. And so we don't work in the coal mines, but … one job affects this job and affects this job. If they're not working, they're not grocery shopping, they're not going and buying furniture, they're not buying clothes, they're not doing anything.

We're more or less sort of a general store. We sell a little bit of everything. But the coal miners are not able to purchase anything.

Christmas is a lot different than what it used to be because they were getting their Christmas bonuses. And they would come and they would buy the TVs and the recliners and they would redo the whole kitchen and do new dining room tables for the family Christmas or Thanksgiving or whatever. And now it's not like that.

Byrd Pinkerton

Leading up to November 8, were you weighing the pros and cons of each candidate? Did you talk about Trump's position on the Affordable Care Act at all?

Debbie Mills

We would watch the debates and stuff every night. But we didn't really talk about the health care that much, even though it now is a major player in our life.

Sarah Kliff

Are you surprised how much Republicans are talking about repeal?

Debbie Mills

No.

Sarah Kliff

Did you expect — do you think they'll do it, or do you think it'll be too hard?

Debbie Mills

I'm hoping that they don't, ’cause, I mean, what would they do then? Would this go away? I mean, I mean, will the insurance? It will go away?

Sarah Kliff

It will go, if they repeal it. I mean, it’ll … that's what they promised to do in so many elections.

Debbie Mills

Right, so, I don't know … I don't know what we'll do if it does go away.

Sarah Kliff

Do you think if it does go away, you'll regret your vote in any way? Thinking, “I voted for this person who took away my health insurance.” Or … it's like, that's one of so many things, like you said, jobs, the economy?

Debbie Mills

I don't know. I guess I thought that, you know, he would not do this. That they would not do this, would not take the insurance away. Knowing that it's affecting so many people’s lives. I mean, what are you to do then if you cannot … purchase, cannot pay for the insurance?

You know, what are we to do?

So I don't know. Maybe he's thinking about, you know, the little people that are not making the big money, like what they make in New York and Washington and all the places that, you know, this is not, you know, something — this is people’s lives that's being affected.

Byrd Pinkerton

Yeah. Going into it, did you hear him talking about his health care promises, or was it not something that came up in his ads or debates for you?

Debbie Mills

Um, no, I guess we really didn't think about that, that he was going to cancel that or change that or take it away. I guess I always just thought that it would be there. I was thinking that once it was made into a law that it could not be changed, but I guess it can? Yes?

Sarah Kliff

It can be changed.

Debbie Mills

Okay.

Sarah Kliff

Did you feel like you heard them talking about Obamacare repeal in the campaign?

Debbie Mills

Well, we did hear him talking about it some, that he was going to, but like I said, I always just thought that he was, if he changed it, it would be that it would be some other form of health insurance that he would have.

Sarah Kliff

No, I totally understand. During the debates, Trump was the one saying, “I'm going to cover everybody.”

Debbie Mills

I don't know. I guess the next four years is going to be different. I don't know what to look for. ﻿

You're scaring me now, on the insurance part.

’Cause I have been in a panic, so I'm afraid now that the insurance is going to go away and we're going to be up a creek.

Watch: Repealing Obamacare could change millions of livesRepublicans are considering capping the U.S.’s tax break on job-provided health insurance, a major change to the tax system that could be used to finance their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.

The proposal, still under development, would limit the amount U.S. employers can exclude from workers’ taxes for the health benefits they provide, meaning Americans’ taxes would go up. Excluding premiums from taxes was worth about $250 billion in forgone tax revenue in 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some health economists have argued that the exemption artificially drives up health spending.

House Republicans plan to put forward a full health-care proposal when lawmakers go to Washington at the end of this month, Speaker Paul Ryan said during a press conference after members of his party met in Washington Thursday to talk over their policy options on health care. Such a plan will also likely include broad changes to Medicaid, the state-federal program for the poor. Republicans have promised to repeal Obamacare and replace it with their own policies.

“We need to replace it with a true, patient-centered system, one that gives every American access to quality, affordable coverage,” Ryan said. He has backed similar tax changes in the past.

Economists have in the past described such proposals as equalizing the way health care is treated for those who get it through work, versus those who buy it on their own. Employer-provided health benefits, often worth thousands of dollars a year, aren’t taxed as wages are. People who have to buy coverage on their own don’t enjoy the same tax advantage.

Tax Changes

“If you really want to treat American families the same way that businesses do, then this is a way to do it,” Representative Bill Flores, a Republican from Texas, said after the meeting.

The result would be higher taxes on anyone with an employer health plan worth more than the cap Republicans set. Those benefits are now tax-free. A similar idea was proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, during debate over the Affordable Care Act, and went nowhere. Obamacare already includes a levy on high-cost health insurance plans, known as the Cadillac tax, that begins in 2020. Republicans didn’t say where they would set the cap.

“The Average Joe would not ever see this,” Representative David Schweikert, an Arizona Republican, said after a gathering of House Republicans in Washington on Thursday. “Even the super-Average Joe would not see it.”

Potential Opposition

The proposal could run into opposition from tax-increase-averse members of the caucus.

"I don’t believe we ought to tax health care. I’ve never been for it," said Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, a senior Republican. "I was opposed to the Obamacare tax, so I’d be opposed to any Cadillac tax. Would I be for a Republican Cadillac tax but against a Democrat Cadillac tax? I don’t think so."

Other GOP lawmakers, including representatives Dan Webster of Florida and Mark Walker, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a conservative group of lawmakers, also expressed worries.

“I would say that’s not a breaking point, but it’s a concern,” said Walker.

It’s also likely to gather little help from Democrats.

“This is going to be the ruination of employer-based health insurance,” said Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, a senior Democrat on the House’s tax-writing panel. Combined with tax credits Republicans are looking at, he predicted that employers would stop providing health insurance and push employees to get it on their own.

On the Menu

Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. The tax idea is on “a menu of pay-fors” Republicans are considering as they debate changes to the Affordable Care Act and how to fund them, Flores said. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price also spoke to Republicans during the meeting, and indicated that the White House won’t propose its own health reform bill, Flores said, despite President Donald Trump pledging to produce a plan shortly after Price became secretary. Price, when he was a congressman, proposed taxing higher-cost employer-sponsored health insurance plans.

“No decision’s been made, we’re really looking at a whole range of options,” House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, of Texas, said after the GOP meeting. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate health committee, said the House and Senate are working together to come up with a plan that can pass both chambers.

‘Good Behavior’

Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Congress’ earliest backers of President Donald Trump, said that taxing health benefits might discourage companies from providing insurance.

“We want to reward good behavior. And we want to incentivize good behavior,” he said. “Good behavior is an employer providing health insurance. We want to promote that, reward that.”

Conservative and moderate members of the party are at odds about how fast and how far repeal and replace should go. Conservatives want to repeal the law as soon as possible, and many have indicated they don’t want any additions to the bill.

Another major sticking point could be Medicaid. The program was expanded under the Affordable Care Act, bringing coverage to millions of lower-income people. At Thursday’s meeting, Republican leaders discussed giving some states a fixed pot of money, known as a block grant, or a per-person allotment. Such proposals would give states more power to run Medicaid on their own, and are generally opposed by Democrats. Ryan proposed block grants for the program as part of his “ Better Way” agenda.9 Cards

EDITED BY Todd VanDerWerff

2015-07-10 14:36:56 -0400

Card 1 of 9 Disney is making a new Star Wars movie — without George Lucas The road that leads to Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens is a curious one, marked both by Hollywood business as usual and an acquisition that seemingly no one who covers the film industry saw coming. The obvious answer for the impending existence of this film is also largely the correct one: money. Simply put, Star Wars is one of the few cultural phenomena that almost everybody in the movie-going world is at least somewhat familiar with. The six current films in the franchise have grossed more than $4.5 billion worldwide. And when you consider that three of those movies were released in 1977, 1980, and 1983, when international box office earnings were far less important to a studio's bottom line, the accomplishment becomes all the more impressive. But there's another answer here, too. For all intents and purposes, it seemed as if the Star Wars saga was over after the 2005 release of the final installment of the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Though George Lucas, the man behind the first six chapters of the Star Wars franchise, had always talked about making nine films in total, the completion of that plan, as of 2005, seemed unlikely. But in 2012, Lucas sold his company, Lucasfilm — along with the rights to all the Star Wars characters — to Disney, which was increasingly centering its business strategy on recognizable, marketable brands, like Pixar, Marvel, and its gigantic number of animated princesses. The purchase, though completely unexpected, made sense for both companies. Lucas had wanted for ages to escape the burden of Star Wars, and his decision to sell gave Disney a chance to own one of the most recognizable brands out there. Disney immediately put a new trilogy of films into production, and even if the new films (episodes VII through IX) won't be what Lucas once envisioned (as he wanted to make a trilogy of films centered on teenage characters), they will bring the saga to nine films in total. And beyond that, Disney is also making films based on tertiary Star Wars characters and other corners of the franchise's universe, trying to expand what had been an ongoing film series into something closer to its Marvel Cinematic Universe — a big collection of standalone films that are, nonetheless, part of the same general story and setting.

Card 2 of 9 The cast of Star Wars: The Force Awakens unites familiar faces with brand new ones Almost all of the buzz around the cast of The Force Awakens has centered on the return of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford to the roles of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia Organa, and Han Solo, the characters they played in the original trilogy of Star Wars films released in the '70s and '80s. This is the first time any of the three will have played one of these characters since 1983, and excitement is palpable. They will be joined by several of the original films' other players, like Peter Mayhew as the gigantic, furry Wookie Chewbacca and Anthony Daniels as the rigidly mannered robot C-3PO. But both of those characters (along with the tiny droid R2D2) appeared at least briefly in the prequel trilogy, so their involvement is of less immediate significance than the presence of Hamill, Fisher, and Ford. The new series of films will also feature a number of other actors, led by: Daisy Ridley: An almost unknown British actress, Ridley is the female lead in The Force Awakens and reflects director J. J. Abrams's preference for using little-known actresses as the leads of his projects. (See also: Evangeline Lilly on Lost.) Ridley plays a character named Rey. John Boyega: Though he's slightly more recognizable than Ridley, Boyega is also a relative newcomer. He's played important parts in the alien invasion flick Attack the Block and the 24 miniseries, but he's largely unknown. He'll be playing a stormtrooper named Finn. Oscar Isaac: One of the best actors working right now, Isaac completes The Force Awakens' central trio of new characters. He's most famous for his work in independent film, where he played the lead roles in Inside Llewyn Davis and A Most Violent Year, and his supporting turn in the indie sci-fi movie Ex Machina earned raves in the spring of 2015. He'll play a pilot named Poe Dameron. The Force Awakens will also feature a who's who of up-and-coming actors, including Adam Driver (Girls), Gwendoline Christie (Game of Thrones), Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave), and Domhnall Gleeson (About Time), as well as the old master Max von Sydow, who's perhaps best known to American audiences as the elderly priest Father Merrin in The Exorcist. (Von Sydow has been playing old men for seemingly his entire life.)

Card 3 of 9 We know surprisingly little about the new Star Wars movie's plot The craziest thing about the new Star Wars movie is that we barely know anything about its story. There are rumors aplenty, but nothing has been confirmed just yet. We know the story takes place decades after the first trilogy of films, and we know the movies will not borrow from the so-called "expanded universe," the novels and stories that sprang up around the franchise in the early '90s, beginning with the Timothy Zahn novel Heir to the Empire. These novels are no longer considered Star Wars canon. One other thing we know is that the premise will be rather compact, according to screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan (who scripted The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi before going on to make such films as The Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist). Kasdan told Vanity Fair: One of the things that we always refocus on from the get-go was that it not be one of these very long, bloated blockbusters. A lot of very entertaining movies lately are too long. In the last 20 minutes, you think, why isn’t this over? We didn’t want to make a movie like that. I mean, we were really aiming to have it be—when it’s over you’ll say, 'I wish there’s more.' Or, 'Wait, is it over?' Because how rarely you get that feeling nowadays, and I think we’re headed there. But it means that there will be constant critical looking at it from now to the end, saying, 'Do we need this? Do we need that? Is it better if this comes out, even though we love it?' Killing your darlings. It seems likely that if more information is doled out about the story, it will happen at 2015's San Diego Comic-Con, which happens in July. Kasdan will be attending; perhaps he'll spill some of the beans.

Card 4 of 9 Here are the basics of the Star Wars story so far If you're not familiar with the Star Wars story to date, don't worry: Not everyone can know everything about every bit of pop culture. In its most basic sense, the Star Wars story thus far is centered on a battle between good and evil. In the original trilogy (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi), Rebel forces battle against the evil Empire to free the galaxy from the dictatorial tyranny of Emperor Palpatine. The action begins when a farmboy named Luke Skywalker discovers a message from a princess who asks for someone to come help her. He falls in with an old Jedi knight named Obi-Wan Kenobi, a couple of robots, and a roguish pilot named Han Solo (along with Han's co-pilot, Chewbacca). The story's irresistible momentum carries this crew through the rescue of Princess Leia and on to a quest to blow up the Empire's new space station, the Death Star. The second and third films of the original trilogy deepen the conflicts of the first, especially once Luke learns he is the son of the villainous Darth Vader (the guy dressed all in black with the crazy helmet), known at one time as Anakin Skywalker. In the end, Darth Vader finds what little good is left in his heart to save his son from the Emperor, and he dies a hero's death, even as the Empire crumbles around him. By the end of Return of the Jedi, the galaxy is free once again, Han and Leia are in love, Luke is now a Jedi knight himself, and a chorus of Ewoks sing a ridiculously irritating song of joy. The much more divisive, much more complicated prequel trilogy primarily delves into the backstory of Anakin, following him through his childhood as he grows into a hotheaded young man. It also digs into how a democratic society descended into the dictatorship that's present in the original films (mostly through complicated manipulation and the easing of democratic freedoms in wartime). The prequel movies aren't as good as the originals, and it seems unlikely they'll have much bearing on the final trilogy, but they're still worth watching, if only to see why Lucas was so ready to be done with the Star Wars universe and to sample their more overtly political agenda.

Card 5 of 9 There's a very good reason for those who hate the Star Wars prequels to get excited about the new film Though there are more and more defenders of the three Star Wars prequels, for the most part those movies are regarded as a wrongheaded failure. (By far the most ambitious defense of the three films is Mike Klimo's lengthy "ring theory," which is worth reading in full.) There's a valid basis for this popular opinion — by and large, the movies fall prey to the most common issue with prequels. When the audience knows how a story is going to end, it's hard to get invested in said story without sharp character work, intricate plotting, or deep themes. The prequels feint at all three of these things, but largely fail to pull them off. Thus, the most exciting thing about new Star Wars films is that since they're set after the original trilogy, fans have no idea where the story is headed or what to expect. Instead of waiting three films to see Anakin Skywalker embrace his dark side, the sky is really the limit for where the story can go next. But a word of caution: For those who think the conventional wisdom is completely set on the prequels, it's important to remember that for a long time, the original trilogy was regarded as a deeply flawed series of works that destroyed the film industry. A new generation of film writers who'd grown up with the original films eventually elevated them to the hallowed status they enjoy today. If this new trilogy proves disappointing, or if a new generation of critics that loves the prequels rises, the prequels could become more beloved than they are now.

Card 6 of 9 The behind-the-scenes team on Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a mix of old and new The important thing to note is that The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to be made with minimal involvement from George Lucas. Though Lucas will still receive credit for creating the film's characters (and likely some sort of producer credit), he won't be instrumental to its writing, direction, or production. And depending on how you feel about the prequel trilogy (which was all Lucas's doing), that's either a good or bad thing. The film's director (and co-screenwriter) is J. J. Abrams, a director whose stamp is now all over both the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Though Abrams got his start as a screenwriter (penning everything from Regarding Henry to Armageddon), he became a household name for his television work; his small-screen credits include creating or co-creating Felicity, Alias, and Lost. His rise to prominence in the world of film began with 2006's Mission: Impossible III, and then continued with his direction of Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, as well as the smaller (if a movie that prominently features aliens can be called "smaller") Super 8. Abrams's chief style is to toss in as many throwbacks to the movies he grew up with as possible. Super 8 is a giant homage to the early '80s films of Steven Spielberg, and both of Abrams's Star Trek films might as well have been Star Wars films for how they eschewed the former's sense of exploration in favor of glossy pop action. (Abrams also loves lens flares.) With Star Wars, Abrams's homage to the original trilogy is manifesting in a decision to downplay computer special effects and employ more puppetry and other practical effects, as were used in the first three films. (Check out, for instance, this practically achieved droid.) It could be just the thing the franchise needs, as the prequel trilogy sometimes felt overwhelmed by computer trickery — or it could end up feeling gimmicky. Abrams is joined by two of Lucas's key collaborators on other Star Wars films, namely Lawrence Kasdan (a writer on The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) and John Williams, who has written the vibrant score for every Star Wars film so far. Abrams's other collaborators include many of the people he's worked with on the recent Star Trek films, including cinematographer Dan Mindel and editors Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey.

Card 7 of 9 We've seen a small smattering of footage from Star Wars: The Force Awakens so far We have seen two trailers so far. The first teaser trailer debuted in November 2014. Watch it below: The second teaser trailer debuted in April 2015. It features Han Solo and Chewbacca, and, as such, it became the internet's favorite thing ever. Watch it below:

Card 8 of 9 Star Wars remains endlessly popular because its story is so elemental There have been lots and lots and lots of things written about how closely George Lucas's original trilogy hews to the hero's journey or "monomyth," as outlined by Joseph Campbell. You know the one — a boy (almost always a boy) of humble origins realizes his great destiny and embarks upon a giant quest to realize it. Along the way, there are battles and daring escapes and confrontations that reveal the boy's darkest side. This is a story we humans have been telling ourselves literally since we were able to construct stories. It underpins so many of the fairy tales, myths, and legends that endure, and even today, a well-executed version (or subversion) of it can be incredibly popular. Consider, for instance, the Hunger Games franchise, which both celebrates the hero's journey via its heroine, Katniss, and subverts it when she realizes how little she wants to be a part of that story. There are other reasons for Star Wars' endless popularity — the original film was, in many ways, the first modern blockbuster, and it contains a gigantic world worth exploring, filled with immediately intriguing characters — but this is at the center of every aspect of the film's appeal. What Star Wars realized before almost any other movie series (before most movies even thought to be series) was that a richly detailed world was best if it was hinted at around the margins, and that using a very simple story to explore that world could create something people would watch over and over and over again.Walking through a major US city without serious fear of harm is one of those simple acts that many Americans now take for granted. On a Saturday night in Washington, DC, I can walk a few blocks from my old Columbia Heights apartment to an active shopping center filled with restaurants, pet stores, a Target, and more — with people drinking outside, others eating food from countries all across the world, and kids running around and playing in the plaza. I have done this walk multiple times, not once thinking about whether I would get shot or robbed.

Just a few decades ago, this would have been an unimaginable sight in this exact neighborhood. The area would have been largely abandoned. Many of the people going through the streets would have been darting through as quickly as possible. As was true in many US cities at the time, it was more likely — doubly so nationwide, based on violent crime figures — that around the corner could be a total stranger ready to take your watch, your wallet, and even your life.

One federal study put this in stark context, suggesting that if crime rates kept at the levels of the late 1970s and early ’80s, more than 80 percent of Americans aged 12 at the time would be victimized by a violent crime in their lifetime — rates impossible to fathom today.

The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America, a new book by Barry Latzer, a criminologist at John Jay College, tells the story of how America went from the peaceful era of the immediate post–World War II period to the massive, decades-long crime waves of the 1960s through 1990s, and, finally, the relatively peaceful period we’re in today.

Latzer also offers an explanation for why crime was so high in previous decades and is now so low. His thesis is controversial: He says cultural factors may have more influence than anything else on violence levels.

"The black migration to cities, especially the big cities of the North, brought a culture of violence to the urban landscape"

Most controversially, he says a "black culture of violence" explains much of the crime rise: "[T]he black migration to cities, especially the big cities of the North, brought a culture of violence to the urban landscape. The effects of migration by a group with historically high levels of violence were compounded by the increase in young males within the African American population."

The thesis isn’t totally new. Conservatives, in particular, have long argued that culture contributes to the massive crime and violence problem seen in inner-city black communities. But Latzer offers a fairly prominent, scholarly example of this argument.

The book has not received much attention, but it has garnered praise from a certain segment of conservatives — leading to articles from David Frum at the Atlantic, the Federalist, and Breitbart about Latzer’s work.

The rest of America hasn’t paid much attention to the book. As Alfred Regnery wrote at Breitbart, "You would think that such a study would be warmly welcomed, written about and reviewed widely. But you would be wrong. Professor Latzer’s book has all but been ignored."

Perhaps some of that neglect is because, at face value, the book may seem like it’s just rehashing the same old issues. Ta-Nehisi Coates, a prominent writer at the Atlantic, has written on the subject of "black culture" and crime time and time and time again. For journalists and scholars, having this debate so many times can get tiring.

Still, Latzer’s is a credible scholarly work that’s being taken very seriously by a significant faction of the American political spectrum. Just for that, it’s worth looking at what we can learn from the book and what it tells us about these ongoing debates, particularly as Black Lives Matter and other racial justice movements continue across the US.

Latzer’s book is at its best — and most revealing — when it’s focused simply on the history of crime in America and, particularly, how it rose and fell through the latter half of the 20th century. But the book struggles to provide much insight when it focuses on "black culture." The term "black culture" is so vague to be at once unnecessary and useless at explaining exactly what’s going on in black communities. It’s also offensive — a broad, biased characterization of 13 percent of Americans.

Latzer tries to answer the big question in criminology today

Encounter Books via Amazon

Before diving into Latzer’s theory about "black culture," let’s look at what makes his book undeniably important: Latzer is trying to address a major gap in the study of crime.

There’s one big problem in just about any conversation about crime in America: We may know some causes of crime, but we don’t know all the causes.

This remains true even with the huge crime drop America has seen: Although many Americans lived through this big decline, we have no single concrete explanation for why, for example, murder rates plummeted from a high of 10.2 per 100,000 people in 1980 to 4.5 in 2014, the year with the most recent data.

It’s not that criminologists lack ideas to explain the crime drop of the past couple of decades. They’ve put forward all sorts of theories: mass incarceration, more aggressive policing, changes in the economy, the legalization of abortion, the drop in exposure to lead, and much more. All of these have research and experts lined up behind them and against them.

But you need to talk to only a handful of experts in the field to realize that virtually no one agrees on what were the biggest contributors to the rise and fall of crime. As criminal justice expert John Roman of the Urban Institute often tells me, he alone can think up at least 20 explanations — and they might not all match with all the ideas other experts are considering.

Part of the problem here, as criminologist Richard Rosenfeld has told me, is that there is no good source of data for violent crime in America. The best data collector in the field is the FBI, but that data comes out with a nearly one-year lag, and everyone agrees it’s likely underreporting crime. If researchers have a hard time collecting the basic raw crime statistics, how can they provide definitive answers for the reasons and trends behind those statistics?

We may know some causes of crime, but we don’t know all the causes

This is where Latzer comes in. Latzer acknowledges that there’s a dearth of good data on all of these issues, but his book pulls together the scholarly work done despite the inadequate data to give a more systematic review of the research and fill in what we can learn and don’t yet know about fighting and preventing massive crime waves.

Latzer suggests that America’s recent crime drop was partly a result of a few significant changes: baby boomers aging out of their peak crime ages (teens, 20s, and 30s), and the escalation of the criminal justice system. Latzer writes that the boomers growing up "was the main reason for the end of the post-1960s crime tsunami."

When the boomers’ children came of age, there was, in Latzer’s words, "a shortterm crime wave." But this time, the criminal justice system kicked into high gear: "The pressures of police harassment, arrests, and high rates of imprisonment, combined with the consequences of the whole grim cocaine lifestyle, set off an anticrack craze — a positive contagion — and by the mid-1990s, the short-term spike was over. The great crime tidal wave was finally receding."

Latzer argues that the criminal justice system, rather than socioeconomic policies that tend to focus on solving poverty or improving education, keeps us safe from crime.

He also suggests that our current peaceful era won’t last forever. He quotes crime historian Eric Monkkonen: "When the murder rate ebbs, control efforts get relaxed, thus creating the multiple conditions causing the next upswing."

These are the beliefs that guide Latzer’s work throughout his book, as he explains the theories that he sees as most credible for why violent crime rose and fell in the post–World War II era. What Latzer says makes sense, although other criminologists will very likely poke holes in his review of the research and contest, in particular, claims that mass incarceration was a huge contributor to the crime drop. After all, the huge crime drop came decades after incarceration began to steeply rise, as criminal justice scholar William Stuntz argues in The Collapse of American Criminal Justice.

But the most troubling aspect of Latzer’s book isn’t about these common debates over the rise and fall of violent crime. Rather, Latzer’s most concerning assertion is that "black culture" and its spread to big cities is a big reason that crime exploded in the 1960s and forward.

Is the cause of high crime in minority communities "culture"?

The book acknowledges that people who study crime tend to fall into two categories: those who believe crime is the result of systemic social problems such as economic inequality and racism, and those who blame crime on the pathologies and cultural problems inherent to certain groups of people — in Latzer’s words, who link "the beliefs and values of social groups to their crime rates."

Latzer seems to fall in between: He argues that "black culture" is more violent as a result of systemic racism.

He says that black Americans inherited a violent culture from white Southerners, the same people who enslaved and oppressed black people in the days of slavery and Jim Crow. (This provocative theory was also championed by Thomas Sowell, who wrote, controversially, about the historical development of what he described as self-destructive "black culture.")

Latzer supports this argument by pointing out that historically, crime rates among white Southerners have been higher than among white people in other parts of the country. To explain why, Latzer quotes the work of psychologists Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen:

Unlike the North, which was settled by farmers from England, Holland, and Germany, the South was settled by herdsmen from the fringes of Britain. Herdsmen the world over tend to be capable of great aggressiveness and violence because of their vulnerability to losing their primary resources, their animals. Also, unlike the North, where population densities have been in general relatively high, the South was a low-population frontier region until well into the nineteenth century. In such regions the state often has little power to command compliance with the law, and citizens have to create their own system of order. The means for doing this is the rule of retaliation: If you cross me, I will punish you.

Latzer argues that this, along with systemic oppression that black Americans have faced for generations, is the root of a violent "black culture."

From there, he walks through the rise in crime in big cities following the Great Migration’s end in the 1960s. Near the peak in 1990, the violent crime rate in New York City was close to 2,400 per 100,000 people.

The book claims that the essential change of the post–Great Migration era is that cities became predominantly black. "Insofar as crime is concerned," Latzer wrote, "the effect was to transport high levels of black violent crime to the big cities of the United States, with profound consequences for urban black communities and, ultimately, for the entire nation."

But Latzer doesn’t quite say how his "black culture" argument fits into the recent crime drop. Crime has fallen quickly in big cities in recent decades as their black populations barely changed or actually grew.

For example, Philadelphia’s murder rate fell from 31.7 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 20.1 per 100,000 in 2010 as the percent of its population that's black grew from 39.9 percent to 43.4 percent. New York City’s murder rate, meanwhile, plummeted from 30.7 to 6.6 as its black population dropped slightly from 28.7 percent to 25.5 percent.

And this isn’t the only problem with the "black culture" argument.

Or does systemic racism explain higher crime in black communities?





Where Latzer gets into trouble is that he’s broadly calling something "culture" that really may be thousands of causes of crime, some of which we may not know about or can’t measure in hard numbers.

Consider one of these possible factors: Black communities may be more violent and crime-ridden in response to a criminal justice system that has both under- and overpoliced them. In the fantastic Ghettoside, journalist Jill Leovy draws on the stories of police officers and black residents in violence-torn parts of Los Angeles to weave a nuanced story of how the justice system deals with crime depending on the community involved.

Leovy writes that police often harass black people for petty crimes — such as drugs, jaywalking, traffic rules, and loitering. But when black people most need police to prevent and solve violent crimes, they are not present. Investigations have found, for instance, that homicides involving black victims are much less likely to be solved than those with white victims. It’s a two-sided coin of systemic racism.

"Like the schoolyard bully, our criminal justice system harasses people on small pretexts but is exposed as a coward before murder," Leovy writes. "It hauls masses of black men through its machinery but fails to protect them from bodily injury and death. It is at once oppressive and inadequate."

The result: Only 30 percent of black people reported "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in the police during a 2014-'15 period, versus 57 percent of white people, according to Gallup.

The criminal justice system has abandoned the most significant needs of black people, while fostering resentment and distrust with excessive policing of small crimes. In the face of this, black communities have turned to their own means — including violence — to solve conflicts that would normally be solved in courts.

(As Latzer notes, "Murder and its junior partner, assault, are in the main precipitated by anger, sexual jealousy, perceived insults and threats, long-standing personal quarrels, and similar issues, frequently facilitated by alcohol or some other disinhibiting substance.")

After all, preventing interpersonal conflicts is the main reason for the criminal justice system’s existence. Leovy writes:

In the dim early stirring of civilization, many scholars believe, law itself was developed as a response to legal "self-help": people's desire to settle their own scores. Rough justice slowly gave way to organized state monopolies on violence. The low homicide rate of some modern democracies are, perhaps, an aberration in human history.

Indeed, Latzer acknowledges this. In The Code of the Streets, Elijah Anderson analyzed the reality that many black people in violent neighborhoods live under and the grim rules ("the code") they’ve adopted that essentially allow violence to solve disputes the law can’t be trusted to take care of. Citing Anderson’s work, Latzer writes:

The code also was a product of the perception that law enforcement can’t or won’t control violent crime. "Feeling they cannot depend on the police and other civil authorities to protect them from danger," residents adhere to "a set of informal rules governing interpersonal public behavior, particularly violence. The rules prescribe both proper comportment and the proper way to respond if challenged."

But how do you prove anything like this empirically? How do you measure the actual, full impact of systemic racism or distrust in law enforcement? Mathematical models are very advanced nowadays, but they can’t explain everything. We still don’t even fully know why crime rose and fell during the period Latzer looks at — something Latzer acknowledges. So how can we be expected to measure something as abstract as the effects of distrust or a systemic force that has existed since America was founded?

And there are many more factors to crime in black communities: disproportionate rates of poverty, racial segregation that leads to concentrations of poverty in their neighborhoods, horrible social mobility, job discrimination, and so on.

With all these complicated issues that can be hard to untangle, a term like "culture" seems to provide an easy answer. It helps put a concept, however abstract, to the hard-to-explain. But the vagueness of the term presents a serious problem — suggesting that Latzer is putting a diverse group of people into a monolithic culture.

The problem with the "black culture" argument

All of this can sound pedantic, but it’s important. In studying this history and getting it right, we can learn from what worked and what didn’t. So in looking at the unfortunate reality of high crime in black communities, getting into the nitty-gritty of what’s going on — instead of just broadly applying a vague label like "culture" — is crucial to learning how to fix all of this.

For example, if the problem is really a mix of under- and overpolicing, there are policy reforms the country can take on to address this. We know how to make police officers more effective — by working with the community to focus resources on very specific troubled areas and individuals. And we know there are policy changes that could help build trust between the police and black neighborhoods — such as cops working more closely with the people who live there, and police taking their communities’ criticisms more seriously. These ideas can work together to reduce crime and improve trust.

But if the issue is "culture," as Latzer argues, that’s a much more abstract problem that can’t be definitively addressed with policy solutions — and in fact might dissuade reform. As Latzer writes, "Cultures of violence may persist for decades, even centuries, and travel with their bearers."

In light of this, the continued punitiveness of the criminal justice system may seem like the right answer — and that’s exactly what many conservatives would like. After all, in the face of an inherently violent culture that could last centuries, why should a system meant to protect us all relax in any way? Mass incarceration and aggressive policing are needed, from this view, to put away people fundamentally corrupted by their culture.

(It’s not just conservatives, either; this is the kind of logic that led Hillary Clinton to speak out against violent teenage "superpredators" in the 1990s, when her husband, as president, enacted "tough-on-crime" laws.)

There’s no reason to think the violent cultural traits that Latzer describes are even "black"

Applying a broad label also seems far more counterproductive, misleading, and even insulting than it is useful.

For one, the term "black culture" suggests it’s inherent among all black people. That’s just not true, considering a majority of violent crime is committed by a small fraction of the population. If this is something that was pushed on a small minority of black Americans by white people’s prejudice, can it really be described as "black culture"?

In fact, there’s no reason to think the violent cultural traits that Latzer describes are even "black," as the term "black culture" suggests. As Leovy wrote in Ghettoside: "Take a bunch of teenage boys from the whitest, safest suburb in America and plunk them down in a place where their friends are murdered and they are constantly attacked and threatened. Signal that no one cares, and fail to solve murders. Limit their options for escape. Then see what happens."

Yet many people do use this term to bash black Americans. Blaming "black culture" is a common form of coded language that politicians and pundits use to get away with explicitly racist messages — from crime to immigration and terrorism.

Ian Haney López, author of Dog Whistle Politics, explained: "Current racial code operates by appealing to deep-seated stereotypes of groups that are perceived as threatening. But they differ from naked racial terms in that they don't emphasize biology — so it's not references to brown skin or black skin." He added, "It allows people to say, ‘Hey, I'm just criticizing the behavior, not criticizing a racially defined group.’"

The "culture" label also doesn’t give any information to fully understand these issues. This is a problem in Latzer’s book more broadly — what he means by "culture" remains very vague, and he never provides any clear solutions to these supposed cultural problems.

Still, Latzer provides much-needed context for why the justice system turned into a punitive behemoth

Despite the troubling discussion of "black culture," Latzer’s history is valuable in detailing why policymakers in the 1960s through 1990s reacted harshly to crime with policy prescriptions such as mass incarceration, which are now under a lot of scrutiny today. Latzer makes it clear the punitive measures were, despite the racially disparate effects, a reaction to a genuine fear of crime.

Latzer cites a notable set of statistics to demonstrate this point:

The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics once calculated, based on crime victimization rates from 1975 to 1984, the lifetime chances of being raped, robbed, or assaulted. The numbers were astounding. If crime rates remained the same (which, of course, they didn’t), 83 percent of all Americans aged 12 at the time would, in their actuarial lifetimes, be victimized by an attempted or completed violent crime, and 40 percent would be injured as a result of a robbery or assault.

These are the kind of numbers that the public, media, and lawmakers worried about in the '60s through '90s. Rates of violent crime and drug use, particularly during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, really were unusually high, as federal statistics show. And the public knew it: Gallup’s polling shows Americans in the 1960s, '70s, '80s, and especially the early '90s were much more likely to say that crime was "the most important problem" facing the US.

But in their fears of these statistics, policymakers embraced a tremendous escalation of the criminal justice system. This escalation had dire effects: The US now incarcerates more people than any other country in the world, including authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. Black people are nearly six times as likely to be locked up as their white peers, with only about 61 to 80 percent of that overrepresentation explained by higher crime rates in black communities.

The racial disparity is one of the major explanations for black Americans’ distrust of the criminal justice system. It is, in other words, one reason that people in these communities may feel the need to take the law into their own hands — sometimes leading to more violent crime.

But were the racially disparate results that have led to this distrust deliberate — the "new Jim Crow," to use a term popularized by Michelle Alexander’s book of the same name? Latzer’s history suggests they weren’t, since policymakers — including black leaders — were reacting to a real crime wave. This is an important point of clarification for political discourse, demonstrating just how vast a well-meaning policy’s unintended consequences can be.

The history suggests that the next time someone develops a policy that leads to big racial disparities, the perpetrator won’t necessarily be an outright racist villain that Americans can readily see through. Instead, it will likely be someone who really has good intentions and is genuinely trying to solve the problems of the day — but is not thinking enough about the downsides and possible unintended consequences.

So to avoid more policies as disastrous as mass incarceration, Americans need to be well aware of that possibility of bad consequences despite good intentions. Otherwise, a new round of criminal justice policies, like the old, could cause the exact problems in black communities and high levels of crime that The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime worries so much about.WASHINGTON—The Trump administration has drafted preliminary economic growth forecasts in its federal budget planning that rely on assumptions that are far rosier than projections made by independent agencies and most private forecasters, according to several people familiar with the discussions.

The forecasts are being revised, these people said, following an internal debate. One concern is that pressing staff economists to produce...Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, already has a plan for how to abolish Obamacare.

The Washington Post reported late Monday that Trump intends to announce Price, who currently serves as House budget chair, to lead the federal agency overseeing Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.

Price will arrive at HHS with a clear blueprint for what comes next. He is the author of the Empowering Patients First Act, one of the most thorough and detailed proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare. He’s the HHS secretary you’d pick if you were dead serious about dismantling the law.

This pick would suggest that Trump is serious about dismantling Obamacare and replacing it with a market-based alternative https://t.co/tsP2YllwOF — Lanhee J. Chen (@lanheechen) November 29, 2016

It would replace the law with a plan that does more to benefit the young, healthy, and rich — and disadvantages the sick, old, and poor. Price’s plan provides significantly less help to those with preexisting conditions than other Republican proposals, particularly the replacement plan offered by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI).

The biggest cut to the poor in Price’s plan is the full repeal of the Medicaid expansion, a program that currently covers millions of low-income Americans, which Price replaces with, well, nothing.

Most Republican replacement plans are still white papers rather than actual legislative language. This means they leave out a lot of key details, like who, for example, would qualify for a high-risk pool or how big tax credits would be. But Price’s plan is detailed. It is 242 pages long and lays bare exactly how he would repeal Obamacare — a program Trump is now putting him in charge of.

Empowering Patients restricts — but doesn’t ban — discriminating against people with preexisting conditions

Price’s Empowering Patients plan, like Obamacare, requires insurance plans to offer coverage to all patients regardless of how sick they are. But the Empowering Patients plan, unlike Obamacare, would let insurers charge sick people more if they did not maintain “continuous coverage.”

This continuous coverage policy shows up in a lot of the Republican replacement plans, and is likely something we’ll hear lots of debate about in the coming months. It’s part of Ryan’s Obamacare replacement plan, as well as Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch’s proposal.

Here’s how it works: If a cancer patient goes straight from insurance at work to her own policy, her insurer has to charge her a standard rate — it can’t take the cost of her condition into account.

But if she had a lapse in coverage — perhaps she couldn’t afford a new plan between jobs — and went to the individual market under Empowering Patients, insurers could charge her up to 150 percent of the standard premium for her first two years of coverage (you can read this section on page 151 of the bill).

A patient can once again qualify for the standard rate if she maintains 18 months of continuous coverage — although that would likely be with premiums set at the higher rate.

Empowering Patients does have a safety net for people like this: It would invest $3 billion over three years in a high-risk pool to cover those with preexisting conditions who are unable to afford coverage on the marketplace. This is significantly less generous than other Republican proposals for high-risk pools. Ryan’s Better Way plan, for example, would put $25 billion toward the high-risk pools over a decade ($2.5 billion per year) and keep them running indefinitely. In that way, Price’s bill has a much weaker safety net than his House colleagues envision.

Empowering Patients makes insurance better for people who are young and healthy. It makes insurance worse for people who are old and sick.

One constant Obamacare gripe from Republicans is that the health care law mandates too big of a benefit package. This drives up premiums, they argue, and scares off some healthy and young enrollees who want to buy a skimpier plan.

There is some truth to this argument. Obamacare’s marketplaces have struggled to attract young adults at the level the White House had initially hoped. (The Obama administration originally said it wanted one-third of the marketplace to be people between 18 and 34, but right now it’s only about a quarter.)

Empowering Patients makes the individual market more advantageous for healthier people. It eliminates the essential health benefits package, which mandated that all insurers cover a set of 10 different types of care, including maternity services and pediatric care. Empowering Patients would allow insurers to cut whatever benefits they no longer want to cover — they could stop covering maternity benefits, for example, to make their plans less attractive to women who plan to become pregnant. This would likely benefit healthy people, who generally want less robust coverage at a cheaper price. But it’ll send the cost of more comprehensive plans — the plans sicker people need — skyrocketing. And it could leave someone who wants, say, health insurance to cover her maternity costs completely out of luck.

There are other ways Empowering Patients makes insurance better for young people too: by letting insurance plans charge them lower rates.

It does this by allowing insurers to charge their oldest enrollees as much as they want. Right now, insurers can only charge the oldest enrollees three times as much as the youngest — that constrains prices for patients in their 50s and 60s.

Eliminating this regulation “increases the overall number of people with coverage, but older people end up falling out of the market as premiums rise,” says Christine Eibner, an economist with RAND Corporation who has modeled similar changes to Obamacare’s age-rating provisions.

And while young people might have cheaper premiums and an easier ability to enroll, older Americans could struggle to purchase coverage in this market, where their costs would rise. These are people who tend to have more urgent health care needs and could be in a worse position without health care than a young adult might be.

This worries some Obamacare supporters, who say the goal of insurance reform isn’t just expanding coverage — it’s expanding coverage for people who really need health care.

“If you replace a 60-year-old with a 20-year-old, that doesn’t change the number of people covered, but it changes the value of the coverage and of the program,” says Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who helped the White House model the economic effects of Obamacare.

Price would provide tax credits, but they would help the older (and likely richer) more

Empowering Patients, like Obamacare, envisions that Americans will use tax credits to purchase individual health insurance, but the structure of the tax credits is very different.

Obamacare’s tax credits are based on income, with those who earn less getting more help. Empowering Patients’ tax credits would only be based on age, giving more help to those who are older (and who will presumably be charged higher premiums). The tax credits outlined in the bill are as follows:

$900 for children under 18

$1,200 for those between 18 and 35

$2,100 for those between 36 and 50

$3,000 for those 51 and older

This means that that Bill Gates would qualify for the largest tax credit simply because he is 61 years old. Under the Empowering Patients bill, Gates’s net worth of $83 billion — presumably enough to purchase health coverage — would do nothing to disqualify him. Under Obamacare, he gets no help.

Conversely, a 23-year-old with little income and health problems gets minimal help under Price’s plan — despite the fact that he needs support much more than Gates does.

And these credits wouldn’t go especially far toward purchasing comprehensive coverage. I looked at how much a plan for a 55-year-old would cost where I live, in Washington, DC. The cheapest option was $8,316, and that works out to $443 per month after the Price tax credit — a hefty fee for a poor, older enrollee.

The plans under Price’s proposal would near certainly be cheaper because they wouldn’t have to cover so many benefits. A 55-year-old under Empowering Patients might find lower premiums for plans that cover fewer benefits. But it’s also true that the plans that do offer comprehensive benefits would likely prove financially out of reach for many.

Empowering Patients repeals Medicaid expansion without any replacement

Some Republican replacement plans have begun to look at ways to preserve parts of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which now covers millions of low-income Americans.

Ryan’s Better Way plan, for example, allows states that have already expanded Medicaid to continue running the expansion program, although the federal government would provide significantly less funding for it.

It’s easy to see why: Medicaid is one of the big reasons that Obamacare has pushed the uninsured rate to an all-time low. More than 15 million Americans have enrolled in Medicaid since the expansion began in 2014. Ending Medicaid expansion would mean disrupting and possibly ending coverage for most of those people.

But Price’s proposal mentions nothing about replacing the Medicaid program. Those people would become eligible for the tax credits discussed earlier and would have the opportunity to purchase coverage on the private market. But given that these are people who are right around or just above the poverty line — those eligible for Medicaid expansion earn less than $16,394 — they could easily find that the premiums in the private market are prohibitively expensive.

This change will likely make Price’s proposal significantly cheaper than those that do continue the Medicaid expansion, but it will come at the cost of throwing millions of Americans off their health insurance.

Empowering Patients would change employer-sponsored insurance too

Most of the changes in Empowering Patients have to do with people who get insurance through Medicaid or on the marketplaces. But there is one important change the plan would make to employer-sponsored insurance: It would cap the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored coverage.

The health insurance tax break is the biggest in the federal budget; the government loses out on $260 billion annually by not taxing health benefits. And economists across the political spectrum agree that we should eliminate or at least reduce this tax break, which currently gives those with jobs a huge discount on their coverage — and an incentive to buy more coverage than they actually need.

Price’s bill proposes limiting the employer-tax exclusion for insurance to $8,000 for individual policies and $20,000 for families.

As popular as this provision will be with economists, you can bet that the public will hate it, as it would make some health plans significantly more expensive — and face similar pushback to Obamacare’s Cadillac tax.

So what happens next?

Even if Price is confirmed as HHS secretary, he won’t have the authority to replace Obamacare himself. But he’ll be a key player in negotiations with Congress over how to replace Obamacare, and he’ll have vast power over the replacement’s implementation.

There is distance between Price’s plan and those of his Republican colleagues on the Hill. (You can read in depth about the other Republican replacement plans here.) The decisions legislators make about which direction to go in will be hugely important for the people who rely on Obamacare for coverage.

There are likely to be specific flashpoints in the coming debate, such as:

Should Republicans save Medicaid expansion in some way? As mentioned earlier, some Republican replacement plans do see a future for Medicaid expansion. And there might be support for this from within the Trump administration: Vice President-elect Mike Pence is among the 10 Republican governors who have expanded Medicaid in their own states. So Price’s plan could face some pushback in this space, particularly from legislators and governors worried about their constituents losing coverage.

So Price’s plan could face some pushback in this space, particularly from legislators and governors worried about their constituents losing coverage. How generous should those high-risk pools be? Price envisions spending much less on the insurance plans for Americans with preexisting conditions than Speaker Ryan does.

Price envisions spending much less on the insurance plans for Americans with preexisting conditions than Speaker Ryan does. Will Republicans weather the political backlash to raising the costs of employer-sponsored insurance? The proposal to limit the tax exclusion for health insurance would amount to a significant price increase for those with the most generous health insurance plans. Employers will view it as a massive tax increase. Like Obamacare’s Cadillac tax, it would almost certainly face significant political backlash.

The question right now isn’t whether Republicans have plans to repeal Obamacare. It’s which parts of which plans they’ll pick — and how quickly they’ll coalesce around one option.

But in choosing Price, Trump is signaling that he is serious about dismantling Obamacare. He has found one of the law’s most ardent, knowledgeable, and prepared opponents, and put him in charge of the effort.It came to my attention yesterday that some have been pointing to my videos and saying that I am giving credibility to the anti-Semitic movement, and my fans are part of it as well for watching. I don’t want to cite the sources because I don’t want to give them any more attention.



This originated from a video I made a couple of weeks ago. I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online. I picked something that seemed absurd to me—That people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars.

I think it’s important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes.

I make videos for my audience. I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary. I know my audience understand that and that is why they come to my channel. Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.

As laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don’t support these people in any way.

Thanks for reading.Donald Trump is settling all three fraud lawsuits against Trump University for a total of $25 million, ending a long legal battle against former students who said his real estate seminar business cheated them out of thousands of dollars.

Trump brags that he doesn’t settle lawsuits. But the three lawsuits against Trump University — two class-action suits in California and an attorney general–generated lawsuit in New York — threatened to follow him to the White House. One of the class-action suits was set to go to trial November 28, and Trump’s lawyers had initially said he planned to attend it even though he’s preparing for his inauguration in January.

Trump didn’t admit liability, according to the Los Angeles Times, although the $25 million he will pay includes $1 million in penalties to the state of New York and $21 million to former students.

The settlement, though, means that Trump will avoid the bizarre spectacle of serving as president-elect or even president while also facing a lawsuit for alleged fraud and racketeering — as well as the political fallout from any potential loss in court.

The two class-action lawsuits said Trump University was a fraud

The basic charge at the heart of two class-action lawsuits against Trump — Cohen v. Trump and Low v. Trump — is that Trump’s "university," a series of get-rich-quick investment seminars, was a fraud.

The presiding judge for both suits was Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump famously insulted during the campaign by saying that his Mexican heritage should disqualify him from the cases because Trump wanted to build a wall on the Mexican border.

Documents disclosed in the suits revealed clearly that Trump University had two goals: to identify prospects with the money to spend on Trump's seminars, and to get them to spend as much of it as possible.

The first seminar was free. The second, which was three days long, cost $1,500. The crown jewel was the year-long partnership with an adviser hand-picked by Donald Trump, an experience that cost $35,000. Even after they paid tens of thousands of dollars, students would be pushed to buy even more products. Recruiters were trained in the art of the high-pressure scam and were told to toy with their prospects' emotions and urge them to run up their credit cards.

Then Trump University didn't deliver on its promises. "To my knowledge, not a single consumer who paid for a Trump University seminar program went on to successfully invest in real estate based upon the techniques that were taught," Ronald Schnackenberg, a former sales manager for Trump University, said in a deposition.

Cohen v. Trump makes essentially the same claims as Low v. Trump, but on behalf of anyone who purchased Trump University classes after January 1, 2007. Because it was brought under federal racketeering laws, it had the potential to be even more expensive by requiring Trump University to pay damages.

Cohen v. Trump also could have forced Trump to reveal one of his most closely guarded secrets: his net worth. In July 2015, Curiel ruled that Trump would have had to talk about how much he’s actually worth under penalty of perjury and respond to questions about how much money he'd put into, or made in profit from, Trump University.

The settlement means that information will stay secret. And the plaintiffs in the lawsuits will get $21 million in damages.

New York v. the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman also took on Trump

The other suit settled Friday was brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, known for his pursuit of high-profile cases. People of the State of New York v. the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, accused Trump University and Trump himself of fraud, deceptive practices, false advertising, violating state rules for educational institutions, operating an unlicensed school, and disregarding buyers' rights to cancel a transaction.

A trial court initially ruled that Schneiderman was filing his suit against Trump too late, throwing out most of the charges against him. But in March, a state appeals court decided the statute of limitation hadn't passed and that it could include evidence from up to six years ago about Trump University's deceptive practices.

Before the settlement, the lawsuit was being appealed to the state's highest court, with a hearing scheduled for December. Schneiderman had initially sought millions of dollars in penalties, but the settlement means Trump will pay only $1 million.

Settling is a rare move for Trump, who usually prefers to carry out a grinding legal battle. But he apparently thought $25 million was a fair price to make a problem that could cast a shadow over the beginning of his presidency go away.An ambitious young executive is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an idyllic but mysterious "wellness center" at a remote location in the Swiss Alps but soon suspects that the spa's miraculous treatments are not what they seem.When I was in sixth grade, the X-Men got me in trouble.

During recess, in the small, low-tech library of my private Catholic grade school, I was showing off my collection of X-Men trading cards — the entire 1992 Marvel Masterpiece set and the 1993 Series II Skybox collection— to some of my best friends. I had a whole binder of them, filled with pages of plastic grids.

I explained why Dazzler was really much cooler than Wolverine, because claws don't stand up to any kind of energy projection. And why Storm was a better leader than Cyclops, because she bested him in Uncanny X-Men No. 201, without any powers.

But during my pontificating, a puritanical snitch told the librarian I was showing off porn. In a hurricane of rage, she tried to snatch my binder full of cards out of my feeble little arms. The encounter is still burned into my brain.

I protested.

"It's not Playboy, Mrs. Deakers," I explained. Deakers had engaged me in a tug-of-war with the binder, an excellent strategy since she had a height and weight advantage. "I don't even like Playboy."

"Then what's this?" she said pointing at one of the cards. Her fingertip landed in the valley between the character's breasts.

The card in question. (Marvel)

"That's Psylocke. Her name is funny because 'Psyche' sounds like 'key,' get it?" I said.

Back then, puberty hadn't kicked in, and all I cared about was that Psylocke had a psychic blade and was one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel universe. It hadn't occurred to me that her breasts might be seen as aggressively gratuitous.

"Alex. You can't have these. You can pick them up after school," Deakers said as she confiscated the binder. "And you can't bring them to school again."

Deakers made good on her word and returned my cards after school, but the damage had already been done.

That year, I was probably the only child to get in trouble in the Sts. Simon and Jude library during recess, but it only furthered my love for the X-Men. Decades removed from that incident, I'm starting to see why that love has never waned.

The X-Men cartoon was my gateway drug

In the '90s, right around the time of my library conflict, the X-Men were the kings and queens of the comic book industry.

They were created in 1963, but their Gen-X dominance didn't just happen overnight.

Much of it should be credited to writer Chris Claremont, who took over writing the X-Men in 1975, and artists Dave Cockrum and John Byrne. Byrne, a writer and an artist, began drawing the mutants in 1977.

Byrne was arguably the top artist of the time — his layouts were palatial and spacious, his lines clean and crisp. And when he paired up with Claremont, they created magic that manifested itself in stories like the "Dark Phoenix Saga" and "Days of Future Past" and transformed X-Men into one of the most gorgeous books of the era.

X-Men. (Marvel)

I wasn't even a zygote when Claremont and Byrne were at the top of their game. But two days after my 10th birthday, in 1992, the X-Men animated series premiered on Fox. I found Claremont and Byrne's stories when they came to life in a Saturday morning cartoon.

It was my introduction to a group of people I'd feel close to for the rest of my life.

One would wail at nature and send thunder and lightning into battle. Another could change his appearance with about as much effort as it takes to exhale. Still another could create force fields to protect her friends.

I was hooked.

No two X-Men sounded the same, looked the same, or had the same set of powers. From Gambit's smarmy "Creole" accent to Rogue's Southern drawl, from Storm's stark white hair to Jean Grey's red locks, from Wolverine's adamantium claws to Cyclops's optic beam, the X-Men didn't look like the kind of people we were supposed to admire. They certainly didn't seem like the kind of people who save the day.

Yet in each episode they did just that.

The cartoon wasn't perfect, but it kept the spirit of Claremont and Byrne's vision: that these imperfect people were a family that chose to be together. Even though they had magnificent powers, they were all lost without each other.

The X-Men needed each other as much as the world needed them.

To the average outsider, I was nothing like any of the X-Men. Unlike Jubilee, I got good grades and wasn't really a rebellious tween. Unlike Wolverine, I had friends and didn't really get into fights. And my family, unlike Rogue's, loved me a lot.

But underneath all that, I was a kid struggling with stuff I couldn't fully comprehend at the time.

The X-Men offered a world where people were so different — weird, even — that you didn't have to compensate for being yourself

In 1990, my parents moved from Northridge, California, and its racially diverse community, to Huntington Beach, and I transferred from a school full of kids with brown skin and last names stacked with extra syllables to a school that was predominantly white. I was also the first kid (the joy of being the oldest) that my parents, immigrants from the Philippines, were putting through school.

The move was a learning experience for both my parents and me.

I didn't really know it at the time, because no one ever talks to kids about assimilation or representation (or at least they didn't back then), but I quickly learned how to shrink whenever a teacher would muddle through my last name, or correct me when I'd pronounce a word like my parents would pronounce it at home. Feeling different felt wrong. Due to a simple misunderstanding, I once had a terrible experience with glue sticks.

For my parents, it must've been hard to see a kid struggle and not know why. But I also remember not being able to fully process that I felt alone.

Growing up with the feeling of being left out can seem trivial. Kids can be equal-opportunity assholes. And no doubt, it would have been a lot easier to figure things out and fit in if the internet had been around.

But when you don't see people like you reflected in your life (save for your family) or pop culture, you begin to feel as if it's your mistake, and you develop a constant need to adjust for it.

At 10, I probably couldn't explain why I loved the X-Men so much. But after watching the cartoon, I began collecting the trading cards and asking my mom to drop me off at the comic shop in the strip mall by my house.

In hindsight, it's easy to see what they offered to a kid who didn't see himself anywhere: a safe world where people were so different —weird, even — that you didn't have to compensate for being yourself.

The X-Men story that changed my life

It's no surprise that superheroes have repeatedly become popular figures after wars or in dire times like the Great Depression. And today, on the big screen, many superhero films still reflect the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Superheroes are, at their core, designed to teach us about life, goodness, and faith in humanity.

Spider-Man preaches about how "with great power comes great responsibility." Green Lantern recites an oath promising to eliminate evil: "In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight." And heroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America, and the Avengers each, in their own way, teach us about the preciousness and fragility of life around us.

The X-Men are no exception.

I often tell people (well, everyone but my mother, because it would break her heart) that the X-Men taught me as much about morality and humanity as my years in Catholic grade school, the masses I attended every Sunday growing up, the process of Confirmation, and my four years at a Catholic university.

Some of that is probably due to my attention span as a kid.

I remember daydreaming about the Phoenix during my priest's sermons or imagining what would happen if I had the telekinesis to lift the church piano off the stage. I was a bad influence on my little brother — my parents had a tradition of making three wishes every time we heard mass at a new church, and he spent his childhood wishing for mutant abilities like invisibility or teleportation.

But nothing — no sermon, no superhero story — hit me as hard as Chris Claremont and Brent Anderson's God Loves, Man Kills, a 1982 X-Men graphic novel.

In God Loves, Man Kills, the X-Men take on a man named Rev. William Stryker. If that name sounds familiar, it's because Bryan Singer's 2003 film X2 — in my opinion, the best X-Men film ever made — borrowed a lot from God Loves, including its main villain. But for as good as that film was, the original story was so much more cinematically brutal and helplessly human than what we saw onscreen.

God Loves, Man Kills isn't a traditional superhero brawl. There is no big bad. The X-Men's superpowers are used sporadically. It's more of a domestic or political drama than a mutant melee.

The plot revolves around Stryker and his "Purifiers," who are launching a double-sided attack on Charles Xavier and mutants around the world. Stryker is charismatic and makes TV appearances to talk about the mutant scourge, while his Purifiers are — well, the book starts off with a hate crime:

God Loves, Man Kills. (Marvel)

The X-Men are often referred to as allegories or reflections of LGBTQ people or racial minorities. That's largely because of their atypical looks and their origin stories — mutant powers surface at puberty, not unlike sexual orientation. But what Claremont and Anderson do so well in God Loves is personalize and crystallize the hate, fear, and pain that humans are capable of inflicting on one another. They also show how hard it is to understand the harm those feelings can lead to, let alone fight it.

Early in the story, Kitty Pryde brawls with a man who believes in Stryker's crusade. A black woman named Stevie Hunter breaks up the fight, letting the man run off and leaving Kitty with a heart full of anger and steam. Kitty retaliates on Stevie, dropping the n-word in the process:

God Loves, Man Kills. (Marvel)

Kitty's reaction is brash. She's painted as a bit immature. But Claremont and Anderson get at this idea of how hard it is to convey, from one human to another, the anguish that comes with being hated for something you can't control. And Stevie doesn't ever get to tell Kitty that she understands what that hate feels like:

God Loves, Man Kills. (Marvel)

Stryker, who Claremont says was modeled after Jerry Falwell and his rise in popularity, is entrenched in his faith and believes that mutants don't deserve a place in this world. And because Stryker is so fully committed to his cause, people begin to rally behind him. His charisma and appeal has members of the X-Men shaken:

God Loves, Man Kills. (Marvel)

The X-Men, save for Nightcrawler, aren't really religious. That fits well with Claremont's plan to set a conflict between religion and morality, and the notion that the two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, nor does one beget the other.

"I became fascinated by the conflict and, just to make sure I knew what I was talking about, sat down and started reading the Bible, and made liner notes all the way through it front to back," Claremont told the site Christ, Coffee, and Comics. "I started watching more sermons than I care to think about now, to find how this would all work out."

The story begins with Professor X — who has the power to take over people's minds, a gift that could be really helpful in this certain scenario full of people who need their minds changed — taken prisoner and mutants under attack. There's some pew-pewing going on behind the scenes, but most of the "action" consists of long dialogues that take place in settings like debates and on television, for the public to see.

Claremont and Anderson make clear that Stryker's persuasiveness and conviction to his cause are his biggest weapons. And the book ends with a standoff between the X-Men, Stryker, and the public:

God Loves, Man Kills. (Marvel)

Reading God Loves again today can, at times, feel like looking at a piece of history rather than art. Claremont and Anderson's work feels like a cry of pain and frustration — a fearsome warning regarding the way they felt the US was headed. But with talk about a giant wall to keep out Mexicans, and bans on Muslims, God Loves still resonates.

The X-Men don't win in this story. There's no retribution for the kids killed in the opening hate crime. The world doesn't shift or change because the X-Men stand up to Stryker. And even though the X-Men show that they're the better people, they know full well that being good isn't enough to change people's hearts:

God Loves, Man Kills. (Marvel)

The brutality of God Loves was a shock to me, and to the idea that good conquers all.

It's easier to imagine everyone as good, but Claremont and Anderson show that it isn't wrong to acknowledge the bad in this world. That hate isn't ingrained into human nature, but human nature sometimes can't help but be drawn to it.

The lesson the X-Men were learning, in their blue skins and metal muscles, wasn't much different from the stuff I learned from the 12 men in robes and sandals in Catholic school. But Nightcrawler's indomitable faith in humanity and his goodness were much simpler, more touching to me than a letter to the Corinthians.

The X-Men showed me the kind of person I wanted to be and that I wanted to act like.

I distinctly remember feeling heartbroken over God Loves, Man Kills' grim message that you ultimately can't get rid of the kind of hate Stryker represents. However, the comic also conveyed a sense of empathy and hope — that even though the X-Men were stuck in this world, I wasn't. And it was up to all of us to make sure the real world never got to that point.

Why I'll always love the X-Men

When comic book fans share their comics with other people, it's a fragile, precious thing. Physically, it's an exchange with another person who has proven herself a trustworthy enough friend that she will bring it back unharmed and unscathed. But when you dig deeper, the ritual becomes more complex.

If I offer you a copy of The Wicked + The Divine, it's because I think we could talk about David Bowie and our dreams of being raven-commanding goths like Morrigan. When I bring you a copy of Jonesy, I think we could probably laugh at monkey videos together. And if I share Secret Wars or Multiversity with you, I probably think you're the smartest person I know and need help deciphering what the fuck I just read.

There's always a moment of worry that the comic books I lend out won't be loved the way I love them. That fear, I think, is rooted in the fact that comics are one way I show someone how I see them.

Every day, the X-Men show up to fight for a world that would rather they not exist

With the X-Men, it's the opposite — they're how I see myself. And it's probably the reason I don't lend out those comics with the same frequency.

The X-Men have always let me imagine myself in a way I wasn't always bold enough to. I learned about the cruelty of the Legacy Virus (Uncanny X-Men No. 303) long before I could talk about the millions of people, including the generations of gay men who came before me, killed by the AIDS epidemic. And I learned to talk about the emotional toil of Storm being called a goddess in Africa and a rotten mutant in America long before I learned about representation and assimilation.

Every day, the X-Men show up to fight for a world that would rather they not exist.

Their story is about survival, not only as an act of living from one day to the next but also as a form of love or even defiance — a faith that there's something better than the world they've been given, and that they can achieve it by existing.

In the eyes of a kid who got in massive trouble for loving them in sixth grade and who's now a grown man still reading them today, they were (and still are) everything I needed them to be, even at times when I didn't know it.At Tuesday afternoon’s press briefing, ABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer if, in the wake of Michael Flynn’s resignation, he could “still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even Gen. Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election.”

Spicer at first evaded with an answer about the transition, then when Karl pressed him, said no.

“I don’t have any — there’s nothing that would conclude me — that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.”

A blockbuster new report says Spicer was wrong

Then Tuesday night, Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti, and Matt Apuzzo report for the New York Times, citing four current and former American officials, that Spicer was wrong. They say that, in fact, “phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.”

It’s an explosive lead. Deeper in, the story reveals that American intelligence agencies have “sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election” but that “so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation.” That’s a good deal less explosive.

Still, the fact is that the contacts were there. And the investigation is apparently ongoing.

It appears Spicer either baldly lied to the press about the contacts or else was kept out of the loop entirely. Kellyanne Conway made similar statements in December to CBS. Either way, the story is certain to intensify both the Trump administration’s complaining about leaks and congressional Democrats’ demands for an investigation on Capitol Hill that could provide an alternative route for information to reach the public.

Lying in the middle of a scandal is bad

Based on the facts currently known, it’s certainly possible that the contacts in question were either innocent or else had nothing to do with the Trump campaign.

By the same token, it’s certainly possible that Flynn’s post-election phone conversations with the Russian ambassador were entirely proper. It’s not wrong per se for a transition official to have discussions with foreign governments. But what’s curious is why, if the conversation was so innocent, did Flynn mislead both the public and Mike Pence about what they were talking about?

Similarly on this story, if there’s no fire beneath the smoke of these contacts, why did Spicer say there was no contact at all? Maybe he was misinformed. He wouldn’t have been in Trump’s inner circle at the time of the campaign, and maybe wasn’t trusted with the real information. But that simply pushes the question one step back. If it’s all innocent, why not give Spicer the full information?
