I’m totally grateful for the support some friends are giving me. But does God care about such prayers?

For the couple of months since I went public about my brain cancer, I’ve had many people of many faiths send me messages that they were praying for me. Some said they were hoping to nudge the Almighty to heal me.

I appreciate every such message. After all, glioblastoma is a tough challenge. The median survival rate is only a few months more than a year. Maybe my friends could offer God some reasons to boost my survival odds?

But I’ve been a reporter for a long time. I’ll admit I chew on any such broad claim, thinking about whether there are valid rebuttals.

So for me this has been a wry reminder of what I’ve read in the biblical Book of Job. If you’ve never read it, you’ve missed out on a rollicking narrative that includes colorful settings, sarcastic arguments and an answer that turns away from a lot of Jewish and Christian traditions.

You likely know that Job is portrayed as a pious and wise man who did a lot of good, suffered a lot of bad and ended up with a response from God.

But does that response say what God’s plans are and how well people can understand them?

I just reread the book for the first time in years. I’m using a 1985 translation by the Jewish Publication Society in my Jewish Study Bible. Near the start of the introduction provided, it says: “Job is the most difficult book of the Bible to interpret … ”

So, yeah, translation problems mean some fine details will be impossible to focus closely. But a view from the analytical equivalent of 20,000 feet seems reasonable and interesting.

Job is a pious and wealthy guy with a big family who has done many good things for other people. One day, God points out what a great and good fellow Job is to one of his divine subordinates.

“Ha-satan” is not like the Satan in other faith traditions, by the way. He’s an adversary, yes, but something like a prosecuting attorney. There’s zero hint of him being evil or supervising an eternal hell.

This Satan tells God that Job may be doing the right things only because he’s so comfortable. God, who doesn’t respond that he’s omniscient and will always win a bet, gives ha-satan permission to test Job by whacking his wealth, killing a lot of his family and ruining his health.

Job never blasphemes in his response. Not even once.

Some of his friends show up to discuss what’s going on. They insist Job surely did something wrong to deserve God’s imposition of suffering.

Nope, says Job, who also points out that not only do some other good people suffer, but some nasty people live happily and well.

He wants God to explain why. But God’s response is almost no answer.

Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do good things happen to bad people? God lists all the things he’s done that people can’t possibly fathom.

Don’t bother arguing, God basically says, because you can’t possibly understand how God sees what’s happening.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

At the very end, by the way, God tells Job’s buddies that they said all kinds of false things to justify why Job had suffered.

And God gives back Job his wealth and comfort. He dies at age 140, “old and contented.”

One angle in Job is a worthy point, no matter one’s specific theological beliefs: Job says he does what’s right because it’s right, not because he expects a reward. I’ve tried to follow that and will keep trying on my way to the Egress.

I’m totally grateful for the support some friends are giving me. But does God care about such prayers?

I think the Book of Job says even those who believe in the Almighty 100 percent can’t necessarily figure out what he might be doing or why.

So in addition to the gratitude, I’ll hold onto a smidge of hope that I might also die “old and contented.”

Trafficking demands attention

Thank you for bringing the fascinating topic of brothels in Sheboygan's history to light so we can all learn from our community’s past. I want to remind your readers that prostitution is still alive and well in our community today, but a much more insidious evil is also currently thriving here — sex trafficking.

As the article mentions, Hattie Cook was a respected employer of (hopefully) willing prostitutes in her day, but that is not the case with sex traffickers. Modern-day slave owners, sex traffickers force their victims to perform sex acts and keep all the profits. Many victims are minors.

Sex trafficking causes immense trauma to victims, as they are repeatedly raped day after day by strangers in homes or hotels that look just as ordinary as the brothels of old. Just like back then, the buyers of sex trafficking victims are also not subjected to public scrutiny today by having their names and faces published in the local newspaper.

Freedom Cry Inc. wants to change that. These men and women inflict horrific abuse on their “purchases” and should be treated as criminals, both by the court system and the press. The public should be made aware of who they are and what their activities have been to help prevent further abuse of our community’s youth.

Thank you for your continued support in educating the community about prostitution and sex trafficking.

Work to protect Medicare

My name is Judy Gmach and I am very worried about the future of Medicare. Many rumors as to the viability of the current system have been published, and I would like to share the correct data per the AARP website.

More than 1 million Wisconsinites depend on Medicare for their healthcare. That is 17 percent of the state’s population. Approximately 85 percent are over the age of 65.

Thirty percent of Medicare recipients in Wisconsin have two or three chronic health conditions, 19 percent had four or five, and 12 percent had six or more.

Under premium support, people with limited financial resources would be forced to enroll in less expensive plans with limited coverage and high deductibles. In 2013 we had 178,000 people dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. Since the median income for Wisconsinites 65 and older in 2015 was $22,000, I can visualize the number of dual enrollees increasing tremendously. And when those people don't have coverage, they go to the emergency room for all needs, and you and I pay for them.

For more than half a century, Medicare has delivered on its promise, bringing health care to seniors who were once shut out of the system. Yes, health care costs must be contained — but in a fair and responsible way, not by harming hard-working Americans and retirees. President Trump understands this vital principle, and we urge him to remind those in Congress who do not.

Rising healthcare costs are a problem for Americans of all ages and political views. It needs to be tackled by both parties, but responsibly.

Help preserve public schools

February 13-17 is designated as, “I Love My Public School” week by the Wisconsin Public Education Network (a grassroots, non-partisan coalition supporting public schools).



Our Founding Fathers believed in public education. In 1785, John Adams wrote, “The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves.”



Early immigration resulted in a more diverse country. Public education was a means of unifying that population. That is relevant today! But I have concerns that a voucher system diminishes the effort to unify an increasingly diverse and divisive population!



I applaud public school boards, administrators, teachers, students, parents, and community members. All work to preserve a great asset. That is evident in our excellent Sheboygan County public schools!



Preserve this asset in Wisconsin by ensuring we have an effective leader in our state's Department of Public Instruction. Vote for incumbent DPI Superintendent Tony Evers Feb.1 (Spring Primary Election) and April 4 (Spring Election).



Tony Evers works hard to help Wisconsin children experience a world class education. He works to make our public school system fair and balanced for Wisconsin children no matter their zip code!



He grew up in Plymouth, Wis. He has been a teacher, school administrator, and now our DPI superintendent. He loves public education, especially the kids, and will continue to stand up for our children and their public schools. Vote for Tony on Feb. 21 and April 4!!!



“I Love My Public School(s).” Thank you board members, administrators, teachers, parents, and community members for your efforts on behalf of children!

Family planning was deemed one of the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century and remains the cornerstone for progress on the shared national health goal to reduce unintended pregnancy. And thanks in large part to Title X, the nation’s family planning program that ensures access to high-quality family planning care to 4 million people nationwide every year, we are improving sexual health outcomes.

The unintended pregnancy rate in the U.S. is at a historic low and teen birth rates have been at a record low each year since 2009. In 2014, Indiana Title X clinics helped women avert 7,400 unintended pregnancies, which would have resulted in 3,600 unplanned births and 2,700 abortions. Indiana’s Title X network saves taxpayers $51 million from poor public health outcomes.

For some Hoosiers, Title X-funded care is the only health care they seek since most clinics are located where there is no federally qualified health center. It is estimated that four in 10 women seen at a Title X health center say that a family planning center is their sole health care provider.

Unfortunately, the program has been chronically underfunded for years. In fact, this is the sixth year the Title X network has received no new service dollars to provide desperately needed family planning care.

Indiana Title X providers are working tirelessly to do more with less, but at a time when a demand for publicly funded family planning is burgeoning, we are also bracing for major threats to the very program that delivers these essential services. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a solid replacement plan and the threat of removing contraceptive coverage as an essential benefit will continue place a strain on Title X.

The Indiana Family Health Council has managed the Title X program for 40 years, thus we know how vital the funding is to the public health infrastructure in the state. It supports a diverse network of experienced providers who are trained and focused on providing high-quality family planning services, from contraception to STD/HIV testing, and cervical cancer screenings. When women have access to the family planning care and education they need to stay healthy and support their families, communities are stronger and safer.

Harmful policies that restrict access to publicly funded family planning care will lead to a dramatic decline in women seeking care, fewer cancer screenings, less treatment for STDs, and diminished access to a full range of contraception. The impact is deeply concerning given that the gap between patients who receive Title X-funded care and the thousands more who need care but are going without is widening in Indiana. In 2014, 446,230 of low-income Hoosier women were in need of publicly funded family planning services, yet the Title X network is only able to serve 30,000 of those women. We encourage Hoosiers to recognize this troubling reality and support Title X to keep the public’s health strong.

Kristin Adams is president/CEO of Indiana Family Health Council.

Thanks for help at gym

I would like to sincerely thank the Sheboygan Fire Department First Responders and the people at the Sheboygan South High School gym that assisted me when I passed out while working out in the gym.

A special thanks to Laura, Mike and Dan who gave me immediate attention. I consider myself very lucky to be living in a community where there are such caring and talented citizens and members of the Fire Department.

Again, thanks to all of you for making Sheboygan such a safe place to live.

Democrats stifle debate

As I watched the Congressional hearings for Donald Trump's appointees there were several things that stood out. Many Democrats took their allotted time not to ask questions but to make lengthy statements, many even acted like children who, when they don’t get their way, take their marbles and go home. The reason is that they were less interested in the answers and more about appearing to be tough in the eyes of their liberal constituents.

Another observation, which is even more troubling, is the monolithic views held by today's Democrat leaders. The party of diversity is anything but when it comes to diversity of thought. It appears that, in order to get the blessing of Democrats in Congress, one must hold certain beliefs among which are the dedication to a universal right to abortion and a belief in man-made global warming and the ability of man to control it.

The applicant must bow to the wishes of the teachers unions and accept that education is best run by the federal government. Sacred cows like Planned Parenthood must be respected. LGBTQ rights must trump all others and Christian values have no place in government. As we're witnessing the collapse of Obamacare, Democrats still insist on government-run healthcare and refuse to accept alternate plans that they cannot control.

These ideas and others once were debatable, and people's motives were not called into question. Today's Democrat however, sees these not as mere ideas but inseparable from who they are.

Anyone daring to disagree is automatically labeled as radical and must be destroyed. The irrational fear on the part of Democrats to be challenged is at the heart of where our government has been these past eight years. The hope is that a Trump administration will restore vigorous debate and force liberals to prove their ideas rather than merely assert them as fact.

Vandersteen a solid mayoral pick

I am writing in support of Mayor Mike Vandersteen, and I’m hoping that everyone will vote for him for Mayor of Sheboygan, beginning with the February primary election. Mike has been serving this community as our mayor with dedication and hard work.

His deep commitment to our community is evident in how well he works with all citizens of Sheboygan, and his demonstrated leadership has brought new vitality to our city.

Mike Vandersteen has a well thought-out vision for Sheboygan’s future, and has had strong, positive results as chairman of our Sheboygan County Board. His past years of service have showcased his ability to promote Sheboygan in a positive light while protecting our city’s image and heritage.

A vote for Mike Vandersteen as mayor will continue to ensure that Sheboygan will thrive and grow under his leadership.

For superintendent, vote Holtz

The only statewide contest in the primary being held on Feb. 21 is for Superintendent of Public Instruction now held by Tony Evers.

Education in Wisconsin, during the time Evers has been superintendent, has shown no improvement. Indeed, the grades may have improved but that would have more to do with dumbing down the grading system than improving the kids’ ability to read, write, and understand math.

Under Evers, the state education system has implemented Common Core curricula without any evidence that it works. Now, some states are seeing the problems and are backtracking. Many hours of educational opportunity in Wisconsin have been lost chasing that rainbow. Evers caters to the education establishment and the union, not the kids.

Dr. Lowell Holtz brings common sense to education. He understood the value of Gov. Walker’s Act 10 reforms and did not sign the recall as his opponents have. Holtz was also able to see the advantage of a Trump presidency over that of Hillary Clinton. He is the only Superintendent candidate who supported President Trump. In the classroom, he supports giving teachers the ability to again bring discipline to the classroom and making education more local by jettisoning Common Core and implementing curricula that work.

Many things have changed over the last six years but not the Department of Public Instruction. It remains an unchangeable bunch of education bureaucrats chasing bigger paychecks and obstructing the reasonable reforms that are needed if educational outcomes in Wisconsin are to become more competitive. Time for a change and Dr. Holtz is the best prospect.

Mayor has raised neighborhood’s profile

I am writing this letter to endorse Mayor Mike Vandersteen for re-election. I have worked with Mayor Vandersteen and other city officials on the Gateway Project since its conception in 2012. Gateway is the building project on Erie Avenue between 10th and 11th Streets. If you have driven by, you know how much more welcoming Erie Avenue is due to the three new homes on the block. In the next few years, we should be adding three more to complete the project.

It was through the hard work of the mayor and our committee that this vision came to fruition. The mayor was steadfast in his commitment to getting this project completed and worked to make sure it happened. His foresight was instrumental in getting the older homes on the block purchased and torn down. He foresaw the many advantages including: a better Gateway into the city, an increase in property values, thus increasing the property tax value by 50 to 80 percent, and he helped three families purchase decent and affordable homes that otherwise would not have afforded them.

This project has also decreased crime in the area, making the entry to downtown much safer. When I look at the win-win situations this project has secured, I cannot help but think of the many other ways Mayor Vandersteen’s steadfastness, vision and efforts are and have been vital for the growth of our city. This is why Mike Vandersteen has my vote on Feb. 21.
