For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!MTV News has taken it upon itself to offer “white guys” a handful of New Year’s resolutions in a short video since “you could do a little better in 2017.”

And while it’s primarily packaged in humor, you don’t think the ultra-liberal outfit’s gonna let viewers get away with mere chuckles, do you?

“First off, try to recognize that America was never ‘great’ for anyone who wasn’t a white guy,” one apparently non-white woman says, presumably referring to the campaign slogan of white President-elect Donald Trump.

Another non-Caucasian woman adds: “Can we all just agree that Black Lives Matter isn’t the opposite of All Lives Matter? Black lives just matter; there’s no need to over-complicate it.”

A white guy who joins in on the fun notes that “Blue Lives Matter isn’t a thing” —

— just before a black man declares that “cops weren’t born with blue skin, right? I mean, yeah! They weren’t born blue!”

“Mansplaining” — i.e., when a male speaks to a woman in a manner deemed condescending — is covered, too. MTV News’ suggestion? “Stop doing it.”

Oh, and if you’re a white guy with black friends, don’t say you have black friends because “nobody who has black friends says that they have black friends,” a white guy warns.

“And just because you have black friends doesn’t mean you’re not racist,” the black man in the video adds. “You could be racist with black friends.”

Anyway, here’s the clip. Let the healing begin:

Hey, white guys: we came up for some New Year's Resolutions for you. pic.twitter.com/C9EeIY6wig — MTV News (@MTVNews) December 19, 2016

UPDATE 1:41 p.m.: The “2017 Resolutions for White Guys” video is getting hammered on MTV News’ YouTube page.

As views quickly shoot toward 25,000 Tuesday afternoon, the clip has received at last count over 10,500 down votes and only 86 up votes. Yes, just 86. Not a very favorable ratio.

In addition, the present YouTube clip is a Tuesday reupload “with updated graphic elements” — apparently meaning the famed MTV logo now sits on the right-hand bottom of the screen.

Many commenters weren’t buying the explanation, however, claiming the reupload put a halt to the growing number of down votes the previous version of the video was receiving.

“Let’s see how many dislikes we can keep giving this piece of s**t video by MTV to see how many times they delete it and repost it to clear out the dislikes!” one commenter wrote. “Any bets?!”

(H/T: The Daily Wire)The video is hard to watch.

It shows a black male tackling a white male on a street and repeatedly punching and stomping on the victim.

Then the attacker takes off the victim’s belt, drags him, apparently pulls his pants down to his ankles and then slaps him with the belt.

The victim’s father, John Boldle, told WSMV-TV that “two assailants drove up in a car, one jumped out, jumped on his back, beat him unconscious. My son says he doesn’t remember anything.”

Boldle told WZTV-TV the four stomps seen on the clip landed on his son’s head while it was “sandwiched” between the concrete and the attacker’s foot, resulting in a concussion.

Mickal Ladd, 18, pleaded guilty to felony aggravated assault in adult court over the attack, which occurred just over a year ago in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

“I’m no lawyer,” Bodle told WSMV, “but when I look at the video, I see attempted murder.”

Ladd was a 17-year-old senior at Riverdale High School at the time of the attack, the victim’s father told WZTV, which occurred just after students exited a school bus. The victim, who was 16 at the time of the attack, said he believes he was assaulted because he was good friends with Ladd’s girlfriend, WZTV said, citing the original police report.

The victim’s mother, Teresa Bodle, told police Ladd threatened her son for over six months before the attack, WSMV said.

But Ladd’s stepmother told WZTV in a follow-up story that she’s upset about the video’s release and said her stepson “has a very big heart, he cares for others.”

“I don’t think that one bad mistake should be played again over and over,” Ladd’s stepmother, Chloe, told the station over the phone. “A 17-year-old boy shouldn’t be blasted all over the news to ruin any type of future that he has.”

She added that “my son is not a bad kid … honest to God, even though you don’t see it in that video, Mickal has a very big heart, he cares for others. But at the same time, he’s taught his self to protect himself and honestly it’s sad that the world that’s what they are perceiving of my son because that’s not who he is.”

Ladd is being held in Rutherford County Jail, WZTV said, adding that his sentencing is scheduled for February.

“A bad mistake has given everyone an opinion and now he’ll just be another little black boy with a felony on his record and nobody cares,” Chloe added to the station. “Nobody cares and that’s the sad part about it, no one will care. No one will care that he’s smart. No one will care that he’s a loving person. No one will care that he wants to do better he wants more for his life no one will care. They’ll just see that one bad mistake.”

Bodle told WSMV videos of the attack — reportedly shot by another assailant who’s cooperating with the district attorney’s office — were released to him last week by the DA. The victim’s parents then released a video to WZTV.

After the attack, the victim’s family home-schooled their son instead of sending him back to Riverdale, WZTV reported. They decided to release the video because they want justice for their son, WSMV said.

“I’ve seen no repentance on the part of Mickal Ladd,” Bodle told WSMV. “We want the community to be safe from him.”

“When we see no remorse in his face,” the victim’s father added to WZTV.

(H/T: Mad World News)MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin has denied a report that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally directed how hacked data from U.S. Democrats was used during the U.S. presidential election.

NBC News on Wednesday quoted U.S. intelligence officials as saying that Putin “became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign.”

Asked about the report, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday dismissed it as “laughable nonsense.”

Russia, blamed by the CIA for helping President-elect Donald Trump in last month’s U.S. presidential election, has vehemently denied accusations that it orchestrated hackers to work against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave UrbanskiNewly inaugurated President Trump surprised many when he reserved some time to remark upon the attendance of former President Bill Clinton and his former presidential campaign rival Hillary Clinton during his inaugural luncheon Friday.

“I was very honored, very very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today,” he began, “and I think that’s appropriate to say.”

He then encouraged a standing ovation for the two Democratic icons, “I’d like you to stand up. I’d like you to stand up.”

President Trump was lauded from both sides of the aisle for the gracious moment which departed from the unbridled rancor of the presidential race.

“And honestly there’s nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people,” he continued.

He followed the moment by extending a hand to the other Democrats in the room, and joking about his cabinet nominations.

We’re gonna have four great years. hopefully of peace and prosperity and we’ll be working very very hard. our cabinets lined up and ready. I know eventually Chuck is going to approve them, I’m sure. And we’re all dealing together, we all want the same thing, we’re all good people. Whether you’re Republican or Democrat, it doesn’t make any difference, we’re gonna get along.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has warned the Republicans that he would lead a combative opposition party against their nominees. Shortly after the luncheon, Trump’s pick for Secretary of Defense, General James “Mad Dog” Mattis, was approved by the Senate.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Barack Obama, in addition to allegedly financially empowering Iran and setting them up for future development of nuclear weapons, also apparently stood behind what the Weekly Standard calls “secret exemptions” contained in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, more commonly known as the Iran Deal.

The deal, agreed to in July 2015 between the P5+1 and Tehran, essentially mandates that Iran cut uranium enrichment activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Now however, it appears there were secret concessions made that allowed Iran the ability to “keep low-enriched uranium in various forms beyond what’s allowed under the nuclear deal.” The Weekly Standard reports:

The International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday posted documents revealing that Iran had been given exemptions in January that permit the country to stockpile uranium in excess of the 300 kilogram limit set by the nuclear deal, experts said. The agreements had been kept secret for almost a year, but recent reports indicated that the Trump administration intended to make them public.

The United Nations nuclear watchdog and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently made the documents public and revealed that Iran had been given exemptions as late as January that “permit the country to stockpile uranium in excess of the 300 kilogram limit set by the nuclear deal.”

The concession applies specifically to low-enriched uranium “deemed unrecoverable” for use in a nuclear weapon. While Iran has promised not to build a facility to try to recover the uranium, the language regarding the LEUs is not included in the original Iran deal, and the administration has little explanation as to why:

“If this whole thing rests on [Iran] promising not to build a facility that they’d probably only build in secret if they were going to actually break out, then this material probably should not be deemed non-recoverable,” he continued. “The State Department … deliberately distorted what was in these decisions to make this point that somehow ‘non-recoverable’ meant [the LEU] really would never be able to be recovered, regardless if they build a facility.”

The State Department has been unable to adequately defend why the language exists outside the original deal and has been accused by a congressional source familiar with the negotiations of “secretly rewriting to let Iran cheat.”During a Sunday appearance on C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) took a stand against the state and federal practice of civil asset forfeiture. Asset forfeiture is a way for law enforcement to confiscate property without trial purely off of suspicion that your property is being used for criminal activity.

During his discussion about the practice, Paul referenced the comments President Donald Trump made to a sheriff about destroying the career of a Texas lawmaker who was introducing bills to restrict asset forfeiture. Paul believes that a discussion with Trump is necessary to bring him around.

“There was a discussion the other day in the White House about civil asset forfeiture. I think civil asset forfeiture is a terrible idea until you’ve convicted someone, and I’d like to have that discussion with the president,” said Paul.

Trump’s recently appointed attorney general Jeff Sessions has a record of supporting asset forfeiture to the point of wishing it go unhampered. Paul says that he has discussed the subject with Sessions, and explained that asset forfeiture is a practice that primarily targets and hurts the poor, who primarily deal in cash. Doing so, says Paul, does not automatically make them criminals.

“I’ve had that discussion with Senator Sessions,” he said, referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was sworn in last week, “and I think some of the things we’ve done particularly to poor people—poor people in our country deal in cash more than wealthier people, and more than people who have their life better planned out who might deal with money in a different way. “They have cash, and they walk around—doesn’t make them automatically guilty of a crime because they deal in cash, and so I think in order to take someone’s money from them, the government ought to prove that it was ill gotten,” Paul said, adding that the other side of that argument is “if someone’s caught with 50 kilos of some kind of drug and then there’s $50,000 in cash sitting there that somehow the people that are caught are going to get it back. That never happens.

Paul has been something of an ally of Trump’s since he has taken office, agreeing with the president’s opinions and actions most of the time. However, Paul has stated in the past that he expected he and Trump will butt heads on some subjects. One of those subjects has been entitlements, where Paul took a bold stance in saying that then President-elect Trump’s disinterest in tackling entitlements does not make him a fiscal conservative. It appears asset forfeiture will also be on that list as well.

That is, unless Paul can convince the president otherwise. Doing so, however, may be difficult given Trump’s hard stances on fighting crime. Regardless, Paul believes that this method of crime fighting is a dangerous one that allows the government to reach too far.

“There’s a real danger, and there have been instances of up and down the country of little towns on the side of highways just pulling over everybody and just taking their money, almost like some sort of Robin Hood kind of scheme, so I do worry about that, and I will continue to stand up for what I feel is right no matter no matter whether it’s a Republican or Democrat in office,” Paul said.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!A protest at Portland International Airport against President Donald Trump’s immigration ban culminated with a pro-Trump counter-protester getting knocked out apparently by an anti-Trump demonstrator as the two groups clashed.

Among the several hundred anti-Trump protesters at the airport Sunday afternoon were four men who formed a group called Bible Believers and staged the counter-protest, the Oregonian reported.

Grant Chisholm, 39, of Portland told the paper an anti-Trump protester hit him in the head three times with a metallic object. Chisholm added to the Oregonian that he drifted in and out of unconsciousness, vomited and still got kicked in the head.

“They almost killed me tonight,” Chisholm told the paper.

One of several videos of the protest shows a large group chasing a smaller group through an airport doorway and a punch being thrown that flattens a dark-haired man wearing a red-and-black flannel jacket. Once he’s on the ground, a few people come to his aid — but a much larger group hovers around him, cheering the act and taunting.

“Your boy got knocked out!” one person yelled, soon adding, “That’s right, Nazi boy! Where’s your f***in’ Fuhrer now, bitch?”

The Oregonian did not indicate if the man in the red-and-black flannel jacket is Chisholm.

Here’s the clip. (Content warning: Rough language):

Police soon arrive while a chant begins: “Peaceful protest!”

Chisholm was taken to a hospital and released two hours later, the paper noted, adding that he said he suffered a concussion but is otherwise OK. There were no arrests, the Oregonian reported.

More from the Oregonian:

Chisholm said he’s been to many protests to preach and has been hurt before. He said one man in particular became aggressive, asking to fight. Chisholm said police in riot gear swarmed the area to pull the protesters apart. Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson confirmed that the agency assisted in crowd control, using an FN 303 riot gun after the assault.

Another video shows an apparent counter-protester in a yellow jacket shouting into a bullhorn as a man with glasses and a purple hood appears to take something from him and try to run away. The man with bullhorn quickly catches him, however, and brings him to the pavement by the hair with the help of two other men — one of them apparently the man in the red-and-black flannel jacket who got knocked out in the first video.

A third clip seemingly shows that same dark-haired man in the red-and-black flannel jacket screaming through a bullhorn: “They’re terrorists! That’s what they are! We don’t want ’em in this country!”

After a light scuffle, the man in the red-and-black flannel jacket is seen yelling at and getting in the faces of two other men: “You hate God! You hate God! You don’t love God! You’re a degenerate, that’s what you are!”

Here’s that third clip:

(H/T: The Daily Wire)Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) Executive Director Mark Lucas issued a statement regarding President Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He stated how “anyone who celebrates freedom should be pleased that President Trump has nominated someone who so deeply respects our Constitution.”

Doc explains that “what we can glean from Gorsuch is that he’s pretty solid.”

The CVA continues to fight for Judge Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Veterans who swore an oath to protect the Constitution in uniform are especially passionate about this fight.

CVA is currently working to mobilize 3.2 million activists to put pressure on lawmakers to support and confirm Judge Gorsuch using grassroots efforts which includes a combination of direct mail, phone calls, and door-to-door visits across the nation.

Ben Cardin (Md.) on “Fox News Sunday” on Sunday over why less than half of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet has been confirmed more than three weeks into his presidency.

Wallace pointed out that by this time in Barack Obama’s first term, he had 12 Cabinet nominees confirmed while George W. Bush had his entire Cabinet confirmed by the third week.

Those facts led Wallace to question Cardin point blank why Senate Democrats are acting as obstructionists.

“Senator, isn’t this blatant Democratic obstruction?” Wallace asked Cardin candidly.

“Not at all, we can’t stop these nominees, we know that,” Cardin replied. “What we’re trying to do—”

“But you’re doing everything you can to slow it down,” Wallace interjected.

Cardin went on to tell Wallace the reason they’re slowing down the confirmation process of each nominee is because the nominees lack significant public office experience, which Wallace noted many people view as positive.

But Cardin said it makes senators’ jobs more difficult, given that they have to closely scrutinize each nominee’s ability to properly do the job they’ve been nominated for.

Still, Wallace was able to corner Cardin with comments he made in 2013, when he accused Senate Republicans of dragging their feet to slow down the confirmation process of two Obama Cabinet nominees.

“Senator, aren’t you and Senate Democrats engaged in exactly the same practice that you criticized Republicans for four years ago?” Wallace pressed.

Cardin responded by saying that Democrats don’t control the Senate, so they can’t stop Trump’s nominees. But he admitted that they can take their time and that’s exactly what they’ve been doing.

“We don’t control the agenda; the Republicans control the agenda. All we can do is take our time. We can have time for debate, the 30-hours that are given to us. We can’t block when it’s brought to the floor. We can’t block when the votes take place, that the Republican leader decides,” Cardin said. “All we can do is use the time that is allotted to us to make our points, and that’s what we are doing.”

Watch the exchange below:

Former Congressman and radio talk show host Joe Walsh said that he believes President Obama is a secret Muslim, and that not only does this explain his hatred of Israel, but that other congress members believe the same.

He made the admission on Twitter, saying it makes his radio stations uneasy:

For the past week, everybody has been asking again why Obama hates Israel. The answer is simple really: I think Obama is Muslim. /1 — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016

I've been saying that for awhile now. It makes the GOP uneasy when I say he's a Muslim. It makes my radio stations uneasy when I say it. /2 — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016

I say it because I believe it. Look, I know there are many other radio talk show hosts, many other members of Congress… /3 — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016

…many other Fox News personalities who privately believe Obama is Muslim but are afraid to say it publicly in fear of losing ratings. /4 — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016

For better or worse, I'm not afraid to say it publicly. I think Obama is Muslim. I think in his head and in his heart he has always been. /5 — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016

And I think it explains Obama's hatred toward Israel and explains his weakening of America these past 8 years. It's not complicated. /x — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016

Obama has always maintained that he believes in Christianity. Walsh has been a fiery political figure who has seized the headlines often with his controversial tweets and statements. In October he made a veiled threat at an armed revolt if Trump were to lose the election. His Twitter account was suspended and Muslim Congressman Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) demanded he be investigated by the Secret Service.

This was not the first time Ellison called for Walsh to be investigated for a threat on Twitter. In July, Walsh tweeted “watch out punks” to Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement, prompting outrage then as well. He deleted that tweet too.

Walsh opined in March that President Obama was skipping Justice Antonin Scalia’s funeral because he was white.

It’s pretty clear that Walsh enjoys pushing the envelope on issues that many Americans cringe at the thought of discussing.Hillary Clinton has made her first appearance since the inauguration in a video stating “the future is female.” In her incredibly tone deaf and sexist remarks, she proved that she is still playing the grievance card.

For those unfamiliar with the show, South Park often takes current events and pop-culture, and exaggerates the topic until the ridiculousness of the real life situation they’re satirizing floats to the top.

Sometimes, their exaggerations become reality. In fact, earlier tonight TheBlaze reported on a “Tunnel of Oppression” being opened around colleges that allow the “privileged” to experience various kinds of hardship the “oppressed” experience. This is a concept South Park had already made jokes about years ago.

Last season, Parker and Stone attempted to make light of the Presidential election with Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton facing her opponent Mr. Garrison, who Parker and Stone gave President Donald Trump’s characteristics. While the season was short, it satirized the face-off quite effectively.

However, in a recent interview with ABC, Stone and Parker – professed libertarians – say that the upcoming season will not touch Trump due to the fact that their usual method of exaggerating characters and situations is already being done in real life by Trump himself.

“It’s really hard to make fun of and in the last season of South Park, which just ended a month-and-a-half ago, we were really trying to make fun of what was going on but we couldn’t keep up and what was actually happening was much funnier than anything we could come up with,” said Parker. “So we decided to kind of back off and let them do their comedy and we’ll do ours.”

During the election which projected Clinton to win, Parker and Stone had to rewrite the remainder of the season as it was ongoing so that it depicted Mr. Garrison as the winner against Clinton so that the season could continue. Stone and Parker are no strangers to writing episodes in under a week.The Senate voted this week to undo an Obama-era rule that conservatives have argued unduly limits the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

In December 2016, former President Barack Obama’s White House issued a rule requiring the Social Security Administration to report anyone needing third-party assistance to manage their Social Security benefits to be placed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would bar them from purchasing a firearm.

A rule, put in place by former President Barack Obama in December 2016, requires the Social Security Administration to report anyone needing assistance to manage their Social Security benefits because of “subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition or disease” be added to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which would bar them from purchasing a firearm.

A similar rule was first considered following the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, but the rule was not actually implemented until the final year of the Obama administration.

It was determined in 2014, according to The New York Times, that shooter Adam Lanza suffered from severe psychiatric ailments that went “completely untreated in the years before the shooting” because his mother, who was fatally shot during the attack, failed to heed calls from Yale University medical experts about his mental health.

While Democrats have argued the rule is necessary to prevent mentally unstable individuals from having access to guns, Republicans argue that the rule is a pretext to restrict Second Amendment rights.

“This regulation unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said this week, according to the Washington Examiner. “If the regulation is not repealed, it will allow the agency to very unfairly deprive Social Security recipients of their Second Amendment rights.”

“This is essentially a national gun ban list,” he added.

Grassley and other Republicans in Congress , have argued that the Obama-era rule is too vague and wrongly prevents certain people from owning or purchasing a gun. And the National Rifle Association supports cutting the controversial rule.

In a largely party-line vote on Wednesday, the Senate voted 57-43 to nix the rule following a similarly party-line vote — 235-180 — in the House of Representatives earlier this month, the Examiner reported.

In 2015, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), who voted to overturn the Obama mandate, said in a statement that he was against an SSA rule on gun ownership because it “is a blatant infringement on the Second Amendment rights of millions of Americans.” Three other Democratic senators — North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana’s Joe Donnelly and Montana’s Jon Tester — and Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, voted with the Republicans.

Democrats argued against the vote, noting that the SSA rule allows those who feel they’ve been incorrectly placed in NICS to appeal the decision. “Anyone who thinks that they have been unfairly affected can appeal, and the likelihood is substantial that they are going to win,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said.

However, given Republicans control both the House and the Senate, the Congressional Review Act made it possible for conservatives to walk back the last-minute Obama regulation. The Act allows Congress to shoot down recently imposed regulations if majorities in both chambers agree and if the president signs the resolution.

The resolution is now on its way to the White House. Should President Donald Trump sign it, the Obama-era rule will be immediately voided.With the Super Bowl behind us, March Madness is up next, and we are approaching a big season in the gambling industry.

According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, from the 1950’s through July 10th of 2016, 98.4 percent of mass shootings have occurred on gun-free zones, with just 1.6 percent occurring where citizens are allowed to have firearms with them.

The research was actually updated from a previous figure in response to an article written by the gun-control advocacy group Everytown.org, which attempted to dismiss the CPRC’s research, saying “the gun lobby’s claims that so-called “gun-free zones” endanger Americans are inconsistent with evidence.” The CPRC says that Everytown.org used both incomplete information, and used criteria that falls outside of what the FBI considers as qualifications for mass shootings.

The CPRC dismisses claims of “mass shootings” if they do not meet the FBI’s criteria, and gives an entire list of mass shootings that have occurred within the United States. It then debunks Everytown.org’s claims.

While the first part of the discussion here goes through each mass public shooting from 2009 to 2014 discussed in the Bloomberg report, further down in this post we have updated cases up through 2015 and the sources of older cases dating back to 1950. At the end of the post we have a response to Everytown’s response to our post. Using the data from 1950 through February 2016 has three mass public shootings in places where general citizens are allowed to have guns — that is just over 1 percent of the shootings over that period.

To see the list for yourself, follow the link here.

Very recently, state lawmakers have begun moving to eliminate gun-free zones in various places, including two bills introduced into the Florida Senate and House that allows for carry within airports and government buildings, as well as one in Kentucky to allow firearms to be carried in schools.When Gwen Rich walked into TheBlaze studios for her January 17 interview, it was against all odds. She should not have been walking at all, much less jetting to Dallas to chat with Dana Loesch on set. Diagnosed with incurable cancer four years ago, Gwen considers each day a gift that she’s determined to share with others. She could easily feel otherwise.

By the time doctors determined it was cancer in 2012, this misdiagnosis left her with few options. The business woman and mother of four heard the words that would change everything: Terminal Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer. There were countless appointments and followups. Once breast cancer cells invade the bones in other parts of the body, there are treatments to relieve symptoms and slow growth, but there is no cure.

One month after her diagnosis, Gwen fell down the stairs and was hospitalized with a broken neck. She turned to her lifelong flair for fashion as a distraction during recovery. “I love to sew and you know, like everybody else, you’re busy, and when life gets in the way, you usually can’t do your hobbies,” she shared. “After my diagnosis… I wanted to leave a legacy.” She crafted her first leather handbags for family and friends that Christmas. She’s been at it ever since.

Her “purses with a purpose” were the beginnings of the Gwen Marie Collection. Many of the bags in the collection are named for cancer survivors, and a portion of the proceeds are donated to the University of Chicago Medicine for research in the fight against breast cancer. Gwen tells Dana, “It’s about connecting and comforting the cancer community. It really is.”

After receiving several requests to create a concealed-carry handbag, Gwen created “The Natasha,” which resonated with Loesch. “I cannot stand to wear a thigh holster,” said Dana, picking up an elegant clutch from the table next to her. “[This is] very discreet but incredibly functional at the same time.” She tells her audience, “It’s designed for fashionable women who support the Second Amendment. This is a handbag that’s actually made in America, from a designer that donates a portion of each sale to the fight against breast cancer.”

Watch Gwen’s full interview with Dana below.

This post is brought to you by Gwen Marie Collection, where your purchase of the “Natasha Conceal and Carry” handbag results in a donation to the fight against breast cancer.IN JEOPARDY: GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE

Donald L. Scott

It is hard to believe that 154 years ago my grand-pappys were slaves in Missouri when Ole Abe Lincoln gave his address at Gettysburg. Back then he was wondering if Americans could live up to the proposition that all men are created equal and could live under a government of the people, by the people, and for the people that would not perish from the earth. With the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States that government is still here but wobbly.

During Abe’s time the proposition was contested by bloodshed and the people divided by all sorts of issues that never got completely resolved. But thanks to Ole Abe the proposition remained an elusive goal of the USA even though a minority of the people did not support the proposition or the Lincoln administration. The percentage of current Americans that support the proposition and will support the Trump administration to work towards a government of, by, and for the people is unclear.Then as now, that elusive goal depends on individuals identifying themselves as being first and foremost created equally in the sight of God. We all struggle with this.

Miraculously, the proposition has survived some challenging times mostly dealing with the question of individual rights under the US Constitution applying to non-white citizens.Thankfully, a few highly principled white men in the United States Government ensured that individual rights under the constitution applied to the freed slaves. Grandpa Henry Scott and Grandpa Charlie Dant along with millions of other enslaved Africans were freed from slavery under the thirteenth amendment, granted citizenship under the fourteenth, and granted the right to vote under the fifteenth amendments respectively.

The primacy of skin color continues to be the determining factor of identity as an American. Since before my grandpappy’s time, people of color have traditionally been and continue to be treated less than equal in the laws created by white America. Donald Trump’s racially insensitive comments and association with Steve Bannon, a supporter of white supremacy, strongly suggests that he will use the power of the presidency to insure a government of, by and for the ( white) people. This statement probably alarms most white Americans who in my experience and opinion are not white supremacist or racist. However, I believe most white Americans are apathetic to the unequal treatment of people of color because they would not be disadvantaged in a white supremacist government. The lack of racial diversity in Trump’s cabinet, white house staff, and in the republican party does not evoke concern to the majority of white America. A picture is worth a thousand words and the absence of people of color and women among governing officials speaks volumes to people of color about America’s commitment to a government of, by and for the people.

The Trump government and the republicans are a major threat to the continuance of a government of, by and for the people. We need independent thinkers and informed people to challenge Trump supporters on the need to preserve an inclusive government of, by, and for the American people.

Regardless of wether your ancestor was granted citizenship by the victorious Revolutionary War, Ellis Island or court house, or the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution, the continuation of a government of, by and for the people should be common ground for all Americans. Are you concerned enough to get involved? Forward this to your friends, elected representatives, and especially to those who believe Trump’s various conflicting messages are for all Americans. Please use your credibility to promote the common good of all Americans! Thanks.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Trump arguably had the wildest, wide-ranging, and most entertaining press conference ever given in the White House. And we’re not even a month into his presidency.

But something occurred to me while watching him answer question after question and trashing the media nonstop… he is now his best spokesman.

Just look at three of his most vocal surrogates: Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, and Stephen Miller. Over the past three-and-a-half weeks, they’ve all sparked their own controversy while speaking on behalf of the president.

Sean Spicer kicked off his term as Press Secretary by berating the media about how they covered President Trump’s crowd size at his inauguration. He quickly became the most combative press secretary in US history practically getting into bickering sessions with certain reporters. He comes off so much as a hothead, SNL brilliantly captured his essence with Melissa McCarthy.

Kellyanne Conway was once a strong surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail when she served as his campaign manager. But now as a counselor to the president, she’s been fumbling from right out of the gate. She raised eyebrows when pointing to “alternative facts”, she was slammed for her “Bowling Green Massacre” misstatement, and she found herself in legal trouble when she promoted Ivanka Trump’s products while doing an interview in the White House. She’s become so infamous for bending the truth and dodging questions, she has now been banned from MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Perhaps she needs a reboot, but defending a presidential candidate, which she was great at doing, is different than defending a president.

Stephen Miller hasn’t gotten as much airtime, but one round on the Sunday morning news shows was more than enough. While he dismissed the reports that he and Steve Bannon were the author of President Trump’s botched executive order, he didn’t do a great job defending it. And on the revived subject of voter fraud, he insisted that fraudulent votes in New Hampshire were coming in by the busload and that prevented Trump from winning that state… without any sort of evidence. Let’s just say you might not be seeing him on the Sunday morning circuit anytime soon.

Unlike Spicer, Conway, and Miller, President Trump can masterfully take on tough questions and ridicule the media at once. And despite having a complicated relationship with the truth, he remarkably can give these crazy, inaccurate answers that even he seems to believe.

To be honest, his surrogates should either be retrained or be benched and just let their boss do the talking.Conservative author and commentator Charles Krauthammer believes President-elect Donald Trump can and should refuse federal funding for sanctuary cities if they continue to harbor illegal immigrants.

“I think Trump would be within his rights to withhold funds, and he should,” Krauthammer said on Fox News’ “Special Report” Wednesday.

“And the Democrats are making a big bet — and a mistaken one — if they decide that they’re going to defy the federal government and what seems to be common sense: control your borders,” Krauthammer added.

Trump previously vowed in his contract with the American voter to “cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities.” But in the days following Trump’s election, a number of mayors from the nation’s largest cities, including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Denver, have vowed to keep their cities as illegal immigrant safe havens despite pressure from a Trump administration.

“We are not going to do the job of the federal government. What we are going to do is make sure we remain an inclusive city,” Denver Mayor Michael Hancock told the Denver Post.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he doubts that Trump will actually carry through with refusing federal funding to sanctuary cities, telling the Chicago Tribune, “I don’t believe they’ll do it, because that would mean every major city in the United States would be targeted, and that’s not what an administration will do.”

New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio went to Trump Tower on Wednesday to meet with the president-elect. Speaking to reporters after his one-on-one, DeBlasio said he told Trump that many New Yorkers have expressed fear of the Republican’s proposed policies.

“I tried to express to him how much fear there is in communities all over this city, a whole range of people in the city and in this country that are fearful,” DeBlasio said, according to the New York Post. “I expressed to him that I knew we had very real philosophical differences, but that I was ready to work on these issues and represent the needs of New York City.”Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!There’s a scene in “Star Wars IV: A New Hope” that I often think of on the frequent occasions when Hollywood takes on an easy target — like, say, Christians.

In the scene, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and the crew are cruising aboard the Millennium Falcon after a narrow escape from the Empire. Chewbacca and R2D2 are playing chess, and R2D2 makes a move that imperils Chewbacca’s chances of winning, whereupon Chewbacca groans menacingly at the droid.

The prissy, perenially afraid C-3pO, observing the match, lectures Chewbacca, “He made a fair move. Screaming about it can’t help you.”

At this point, Han pipes in, “You know, it’s not wise to upset a wookie.”

C-3PO objects, “But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.”

To which Han replies, “That’s because a droid don’t pull people’s arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookies are known to do that.”

C-3PO glances at Chewbacca, who is folding his arms contentedly behind his head, and says to R2D2, “I suggest a new strategy, R2: Let the wookie win.”

The essential truth of Hollywood is that they think they’re just like the fierce Chewbacca, or at least the wisecracking Han Solo, but in truth they’re all C-3P0: walking around on stilted legs constantly muttering in fear, “Oh, dear. Let’s let the wookie win.”

By now, you might have heard that Seth MacFarlane’s shock cartoon comedy “Family Guy” made some minor waves this week with a “Christmas” episode that can only be described as deliberately sacrilegious, featuring (among other things) a scene in which the “little drummer boy” kicks the baby Jesus out of the manger.

MacFarlane is openly anti-religious, which is of course entirely his prerogative. It’s also his prerogative to write his derivative — and by now thoroughly repetitive and tiresome — comedy about whatever subjects he wants.

But for a man who fashions himself as a champion of secular humanism, there’s something overtly cowardly about the way MacFarlane — and the rest of Hollywood — go about their business. If religion is a superstitious plague that must be wiped out, why not start with the religion responsible with the true repression of humanistic principles? Why feature a billion casual insults directed toward Christians and nary a peep about a religion that is, frankly, much more open to Western satire and parody?

The reason, of course, is the same reason that nobody worries about upsetting a droid: Christians don’t behead reporters or shoot up satire magazines when they lose. Cowardice, plain and simple, is the reason the world’s foremost satire artists have treated Islam like a genuinely holy thing, while treating Christianity as an object of casual scorn and mockery.

Never was that more evident than it was after fanatical Muslims raided the headquarters of French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo and gunned down its employees for insulting the prophet Mohammed. Hollywood celebrities for the most part tripped over themselves to rush to their award podiums and declare “je suis Charlie,” an expression of solidarity meant to convey “I am Charlie Hebdo.”

But the simple fact is that Hollywood is not Charlie Hebdo. Hebdo is a profane magazine that often lampoons Christianity, and Hollywood has that much in common with it. But Charlie Hebdo had the audacity to turn its satire on Mohammed, and that remains strictly taboo in Hollywood.

True courage in American entertainment culture is increasingly difficult to find. The business of satire is supposed to be irreverent, it is supposed to push boundaries, it is supposed to make people think. Instead, Hollywood most often finds itself invading the same tired, well-trod space of making fun of earnest Christians and demanding congratulations for daring to do something that is entirely consequence-free in today’s American culture.

A useful contrast can be drawn with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Parker and Stone have made a mint from criticizing some extremely easy and docile targets (like Mormons), but they have also dared to tackle genuine pillars of political correctness, including global warming, abortion as birth control, immigration — and, yes, society’s sensitivity about the depiction of Muhammad.

One of the earliest controversies Parker and Stone involved themselves in actually resulted in the end of one of the show’s prominent characters. Parker and Stone took on the Church of Scientology — another taboo subject in Hollywood — which angered the iconic Isaac Hayes, voice of the show’s beloved Chef. Hayes told Parker and Stone he would leave if they did not pull the episode, and rather than either pull the episode or replace Hayes with a different voice, Parker and Stone removed the character from the show altogether, and even satirized the controversy itself by implying that Hayes had been brainwashed by Scientologists.

Freshness is the currency of comedy. Nothing earns the scorn of comedians faster than worn-out material. Professional comedians always hone their craft and are always seeking a way to be new, edgy and different. The insistence on returning to the same well over and over when a huge field of satire is ripe for the picking can only be explained by the kind of shamefaced cowardice that ought to leave Hollywood comedians like MacFarlane embarrassed to wander into the field of sacrilege at all.

But it doesn’t, and that’s one reason Hollywood finds its power and influence shrinking faster than ever.You have to love President Trump, because if people we’re tools, he loves blaming his tools for all his failures in office. [He] has, at his disposal many young legal interms and lawyers who would love to be let lose to prepare a executive order on the border ban. I will lay you odds, it would be at least over fifty (50) pages; once you have all the contingencies buildt in. But, you as The President of the United States come up and approved and signed by you a one in a half (1.5) page executive order; that was doom too fail.

×××××/

In your election ploy, you stated you wanted to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. How, by threatening sanctions and the payment plan. Why would Mexico pay for a wall that all it would take is a ladder and/or a rope with a hook too get over. Better yet, go through or dig under; but it is your tools fault.

×××××/

You took office without replacing all key people. Was that for, you could blame them if something goes wrong. If you took over a new hotel, wouldn’t you replace all the key people and put your in. That why we have a Russia problem. All Obama’s key people should be gone: It is called cleaning house.

×÷÷÷÷/

In stead of blaming your tools, reorganize.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Hillary Clinton and her Democratic supporters spent a whopping $1.2 billion on her second failed run at the White House — a record amount.

According to the New York Post, that amount was half of what President-elect Donald Trump and Republican spent, which came in at only $600 million.

Trump famously made claims last June that no person needed to raise or spend more than $1 billion to become president, saying that he would never need to raise such a high amount of money to win the White House because of all the free press he receives.

More from the Post:

Clinton’s expensive machine tore through $131.8 million in just the final weeks, finishing with about $839,000 on hand as of Nov. 28. Team Trump spent $94.5 million in the home stretch — from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28 — and had $7.6 million left. The figures include all spending by the campaigns, PACs and party committees.

Still, Trump did not make good on his promise to donate $100 million of his personal money to his campaign. Early in his campaign, Trump said he would give $100 million to his campaign — part of his self-funding strategy. But in the end, Trump only gave $66 million, according to FEC documents.

In addition, Clinton spent more than President Barack Obama did in both 2008 and 2012, while Trump spent substantially less than Mitt Romney did in 2012.The six-second video showing the three-word chant is all one official at St. John’s University needed to hear:

“Build that wall! Build that wall!” passengers aboard a campus bus called “the Link” shouted in the clip.

The Rev. Doug Mullin — vice president for student development at the Catholic university in Collegeville, Minnesota — called the chant “regrettably insensitive.”

“Understandably, some people who were on the bus or who heard about the incident may even feel their safety was being threatened,” Mullin continued in an email to the campus, Inside Higher Ed reported. “The incident is currently under investigation. … It is a tradition and value of our Benedictine campuses that we strive to honor the dignity of all persons … most especially those with whom we may disagree or whom we do not understand. Chanting highly charged political opinions on a bus fails our community in honoring this value.”

Already-planned rallies on campus Tuesday were apparently extra charged following the video hitting social media.

“The situation we are in, the political climate that we are in right now — we have to be bigger than that,” rally organizer Gladys Gutierrez told KSTP-TV.

But others said such reactions threaten free speech.

“It’s free speech until it hurts someone’s feelings,” student Matthew Adler told the station. “Then it’s not free speech anymore. It’s hate speech, which I think is kind of backwards.”

However, another student said that passengers on the bus who may have disagreed with the “Build that wall!” chant were forced to listen to it since they likely couldn’t get off the bus at that time.

“They had no place to leave,” Zach Kennedy told KSTP.

The Facebook user who posted the clip on Sunday wrote that some commenters were showing “a classic demonstration of white privilege and a complete lack of empathy. Many members of the CSB/SJU community are directly affected and currently in extremely vulnerable positions and this issue demands our immediate attention if we desire to be a true community.”

The station added that among a list of demands students have created for administrators is a push to hold students accountable for hate speech.

(H/T: The College Fix)Sunday morning on Twitter, Fox News Correspondent Ed Henry quoted Newt Gingrich on his thoughts about Mitt Romney as a possible contender for secretary of state. More to the point, Gingrich was responding to the idea that has been floated around of late that Romney needed to apologize to President-elect Donald Trump if he wanted the job:

.@newtgingrich on potential @MittRomney apology — "there is nothing Romney can say that doesn't sound phony or frankly pathetic" @ffweekend — Ed Henry (@edhenry) November 27, 2016

Perhaps Romney was unwilling to offer his apologies to Trump because following Gingrich’s harsh words, Trump’s Senior Adviser Kellyanne Conway was quoted in a piece in Politico as having “personal concerns” about Romney’s ability to perform as the nation’s chief bureaucrat. In wondering if he had done anything deserving of the job, Conway was quoted as saying on Twitter that she had a “deluge” of messages from Trump loyalists concerned about the potential Romney pick.

From Politico:Dr. Jonathan Haidt, author of “The Righteous Mind,” calls into the show to chat with Glenn Beck about humanity’s tendency to lionize ourselves and our political and religious fellows while demonizing the other side. While there are times to be adamant and unyielding, Jonathan argues that civil discourse is more productive than invective and shouting matches.

The effort included planting stories meant to discredit Flynn, the national security advisor to President Trump.

The abrupt resignation Monday evening of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is the culmination of a secret, months-long campaign by former Obama administration confidantes to handicap President Donald Trump’s national security apparatus and preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, according to multiple sources in and out of the White House who described to the Washington Free Beacon a behind-the-scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media. The effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes—the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a pro-Iran echo chamber—included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn’s credibility, multiple sources revealed.

Flynn was one of the most vociferous critics of the Iran Deal and ridding him from Trump’s administration helps the cause to keep the agreement in place, despite repeated statements by Trump that he would dismantle what he called, “the worst deal ever negotiated.”

The official story of the resignation from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is that the relationship between Trump and Flynn began to erode after Vice President Mike Pence backed Flynn based on his word that later turned out to be untrue.

Central to the scandal was a call made between Flynn and a Russian ambassador before the election. He had told Pence that sanctions were not discussed, but now says he doesn’t remember if they were discussed or not, embarrassing Pence and causing a rift between himself and Trump. Flynn apologized to Pence for the misleading statement.

But this alternate explanation from the Free Beacon means Flynn was purposely targeted because of his opposition to the Iran Deal.

“It’s undeniable that the campaign to discredit Flynn was well underway before Inauguration Day, with a very troublesome and politicized series of leaks designed to undermine him,” said one veteran national security adviser with close ties to the White House team. “This pattern reminds me of the lead up to the Iran deal, and probably features the same cast of characters.”

The sources say that Flynn was also planning to expose details of the plan that were hidden by the Obama administration in order to get it passed.

A member of the Obama administration once said that they viewed the Iran Deal as the Obamacare of his second term, meaning it was just as important to his presidential legacy.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!According to Daily Mail, Turkey has banned social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook after the militant terrorist group ISIS spread a video of themselves degrading, and then burning alive two Turkish soldiers captured in Aleppo.

The 19 minute video starts with terrorists apparently fighting in Aleppo on the ground. Near the end, it cuts to three ISIS terrorists opening up a cage containing two men whose heads have been shaven. They are then made to crawl on all fours like dogs, while on a leash to a place with two fuses. The soldiers are then hooked up to the fuses, and one ISIS member activates a device that catches the fuses on fire.

The fire begins to work its way toward the soldiers. As it does, one solider attempts to look over his shoulder to see the flames. The unedited video shows the soldiers then writhing on the ground attempting to extinguish themselves. However, the clothing they wore was likely doused in fuel, they eventually perish in the flames.

While the edited video does not show the ground fighting, or the two Turkish soldiers dying, it still may contain images too difficult for some.President Donald Trump took to his favorite social media platform early Sunday to blast the “failing” New York Times as “fake news.”

“Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!” Trump wrote on his personal Twitter account.

Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017

Taking to social media to blast mainstream media outlets like the Times has been a favorite activity of Trump since the campaign last year.

He most recently blasted the Times, along with the Washington Post, in a series of tweets on Saturday, where he labeled the historic newspapers as “fake news” with “declining” readership and subscriptions. He also said the papers write “false and angry” stories about him.

Trump, in the opening days of his presidency, has made it clear that he will not make friends with in the media while in the White House. Just nine days prior to taking office, Trump singled out a reputable CNN reporter and blasted him for his network’s coverage.

Then, on just Trump’s second day in office, White House press secretary Sean Spicer blasted the “dishonest” media over their reporting on crowd sizes at Trump’s inauguration.

And in a recent interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network’s “The Brody File,” which will air in its entirety Sunday night, Trump labeled the media the “opposition party,” echoing the words of his chief confidant Steve Bannon.President-elect Donald Trump will officially be sworn in Friday morning as the 45th president of the United States.

After meeting with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for morning tea and coffee, Trump and his wife Melania headed to the Capitol along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his wife Karen.

The swearing-in ceremony will be held in front of the Capitol at 11:30 AM ET, with Chief Justice John Roberts administering the oath of office. Trump will then deliver his inaugural address to the nation.

Shortly afterward, a parade will take place down the streets of Capitol Hill, with newly inaugurated President Trump and Vice President Pence leading the parade and military members down Pennsylvania Avenue.

Trump won the election after a contentious campaign opposite Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who is also in attendance at the inauguration ceremony.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!TheBlaze posted a story earlier this week about filmmaker Michael Moore saying that President Trump should step down and let Hillary Clinton be president.

http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/16/michael-moore-wants-trump-to-step-down-and-clinton-named-president/

Here is what some readers had to say about Michael Moore:

Justin_Franks

No, Clinton did *not* win the popular vote. She had a plurality in the popular vote. There is a big difference.

Hapscan

Poor Michael. The thought of a verified, certified and cross-indexed crook NOT in the White House literally freaks this guy out! Why is it that he is so anxious to make a fool of himself all the time? I think it’s because he surrounds himself with like-minded fools who nod and shout their agreement with everything that comes out of his mouth, and by so doing, create the illusion that he’s making intelligent remarks. I believe that another motivator is that he has a goodly number of followers on Twitter, and whenever he makes some inane or insane remark, he carefully monitors the ’likes’ tally, and when it reaches a predetermined number (he has a chart), he concludes that his comment is brilliant, or at least excellent+, and is therefore deserving of a quasi-press conference for hard-up journalists in front of his favorite bakery.

nickginex@gmail.com

Mr. Moore has no common sense, integrity, and has lost any credibility he formerly had. How can any intelligent person support or vote for Hillary Clinton who has clearly shown she is a liar and a cheat concerning Benghazi and the deaths of four Americans, her deletion of 33,000 e-mails, destruction of computer servers that contained evidence of her play-for-pay contacts, and receiving questions as a candidate for the presidency instead of reporting the cheating attempt. It is clear that Hillary Clinton supporters are ignorant of the facts and are blind followers of the Liberal Media and Hollywood propaganda. But this reveals Democrats may have a low IQ, unable to realize that President Trump is trying to make America great again to better their lives. He did more in less than four weeks to create jobs than President Obama, our first Muslim-American President.

Dward Fardbark

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh … a lot of people want Michael Moore to shut up and go away. But that is not going to happen any more than Trump stepping down and Hillary becoming president.

So, lets get real … Michael Moore will continue saying the most crazy, vile, insane things … just because any publicity is good publicity … and puts money in Michael Moore’s pockets down the road when he does another insane drivel of a movie.

And, Trump will continue being President for the next eight years, fixing the real problems of Americans, that past presidents ( *cough* Obama *cough*) have been totally ignoring.

Freedomringsforall

Moore is such a nut job it is unbelievable.

Trump won over 3000 counties and county equivalents were out of 3141 in 2016.

These lefties keep up their insanity and he will win over 3100 in 2020.

Hey Moore, every time you say Trump was elected under fraud you insult the majority of the US citizens that voted. We spoke, you don’t listen. Remember these are some of the same people that have made you rich. I’m not one of them. But I am sure everyone is sick of hearing your mouth run yet nothing comes out. I doubt anyone will ever pay another penny to watch another one of your sorry movies. Move on, you’re over and we are over listening to you. We spoke through voting.

Last time I checked the Constitution, I didn’t see ”the candidate who lost the election” ANYWHERE in the line of succession to the Presidency if the ELECTED President dies or is unable to serve. Every time Michael Moore opens his BIG MOUTH, he just offers further proof of what a liberal IDIOT he truly is!

Fake News:

Michael Moore has presented an argument today, outlining in detail, and being thoughtfully executed and written, the various events, reasonings, and justifications as to why Donald Trump should resign from his recent, duly elected post as President of the United States.

Michael Moore goes full-on crazy with latest anti-Trump blatherings.

Didn’t hillary allow a significant amount of uranium from U.S. resources be sold to Russia? How much money did Russian interests give to the clinton foundation? Just asking….

I’m hate to tell you Mr. (or Mrs??) Moore~I voted and I am NOT Russian. You have no right to invalidate the votes of millions of Americans, no matter how mentally deranged you are. The left is constantly bitching. The president has been in office less than a month and they whine that he hasn’t fixed everything or they whine because he has tried to. He isn’t perfect for sure, but he hasn’t even been given much of a chance. Everything has been a complete battle so far. Please just go back to your safe spaces and shut the hell up!Community Rules

“I’m looking to make a statement by just being here, and I think the protesters are doing the same,” Kiara Robles told the reporter. “Props to the ones who are doing it non-violently, but I think that’s a very rare thing indeed.”

Seconds later, she was hit with the pepper spray.

Robles was wearing a red baseball cap with white lettering on the front — “Make Bitcoin Great Again” — but it likely looked enough like Trump’s campaign cap to the black-gloved culprit, who quickly took off after pepper-spraying her.

She told KGO soon after that she was alright.

Here’s a look at the incident from a different angle, captured by a friend of Robles:

The protesting that turned into rioting came after the cancellation of a campus speech by conservative pundit Milo Yiannopoulos, whose controversial and provocative lectures on college campuses over the last year targeted liberals and feminists and led to numerous protests.

Officials held a news conference amid the rioting and indicated it wasn’t a proud moment for Berkeley, KGO reported.

Robles posted a photo to Twitter after getting pepper-sprayed:

Groeschel, author of the new book, “Divine Direction: 7 Decisions That Will Change Your Life,” told “The Church Boys” podcast that “the consumer mindset of our generation — of all people today — is really, really scary when it comes to the church.”

Groeschel said some Christians say that they can’t find a church that meets their needs — but that isn’t really the point of going to church.

“As Jesus followers, we are not spiritual consumers, we are spiritual contributors,” he said, adding, “The church does not exist for us. We are the church, and we exist for the world.”

Groeschel’s Life.Church is one of the the largest online churches in the world. He acknowledged that he is concerned about the impact that technology may have on some peoples’ church experience.

“Now many people are equating church with receiving content, meaning ‘I don’t necessarily have to go to a building … and I think we’re missing so much power in the face-to-face interaction,” Groeschel said. “And so I’m asking myself the question, ‘What does continue to draw people together?’”

“People are coming to church far less frequently,” he added. “If I’ve only got a person under my influence for an hour, it’s going to be very difficult to help them be spiritually successful in this world today. That’s a real big concern for me.”

Groeschel said he decided to write his new book after many of his congregants asked him for guidance about life decisions, asking questions like, “How do I know what I’m supposed to do?

“There’s a lot of fear, a lot of difficulty in making decisions and hesitation,” he said. “So, what I wanted to do was really demystify that.”

“[The book is] trying to guide the reader into seven decisions that, if we can all make … these faithfully over time, we really get to a great place in life,” he said, adding that faith is a journey toward God’s plan and “we are the result of the decisions we have made in the past.”

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Another day dedicated solely to what President Trump tweeted, and the mainstream media covered it because that’s all they seem to do these days. Tomi’s “Final Thoughts” are on the bitterness the hard left holds for President Trump and how they can’t seem to move on. Tomi feels their time could be better utilized reporting on the 11.1 million people living in the United States illegally, or jobs, national security, energy, the deficit, or colleges’ assault on free speech.

In fact, the net worth of millennials is more than half below what their parents’ around the same stage of life.

With a median household income of $40,581, millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles.

The “better educated” part is a factor in what’s causing millennials to fall behind their folks when it comes to earning money. This generation is drowning in student loan debt, with the average owed being some $37,000 per graduate. To boot, the education isn’t helping improve their financial situation all that much.

Education does help boost incomes. But the median college-educated millennial with student debt is only earning slightly more than a baby boomer without a degree did in 1989.

But, as data shows, the chances of a newer generation earning more than their parents has declined significantly over the decades, despite younger generations being more educated than previous generations.

The analysis fits into a broader pattern of diminished opportunity. Research last year by economists led by Stanford University’s Raj Chetty found that people born in 1950 had a 79 percent chance of making more money than their parents. That figure steadily slipped over the past several decades, such that those born in 1980 had just a 50 percent chance of out-earning their parents. This decline has occurred even though younger Americans are increasingly college-educated. The proportion of 25 to 29 year-olds with a college degree has risen to 35.6 percent in 2015 from 23.2 percent in 1990, a report this month by the Brookings Institution noted.

The problem seems to be in the way college degrees narrow options for the millennial generation. Besides the debt, many degrees lead to many of the same jobs, forcing graduates to take lower paying work as they wait for a position in their field to open up.

As former host of Dirty Jobs Mike Rowe stated in a video he once did for Prager U, graduates are forced into narrow fields that everyone tries to compete to get jobs in, and only so many will get. Meanwhile, employers are struggling to fill 5.8 million good paying jobs that no one is trained to do, mainly because these careers don’t fall into the social standard of a “good career.”The official Twitter account of President Donald Trump since before the election at @realDonaldTrump made it clear what he thinks about the media Friday in a tweet that was quickly deleted, but captured by quick followers.

a tweet so nakedly malevolent and fascist on its face that even @realDonaldTrump realized he'd gone too far and deleted. pic.twitter.com/8ENWGmULqC — MAX IM A KOOPA (@meakoopa) February 17, 2017

While many were speculating that he deleted it after someone close to him told him it was too extreme, the tweet turned up 16 minutes later and edited to explain the disappearance.

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

It appears that Trump was merely searching for more media outlets to add to his enemies list.

Donald Trump tweets: The 'fake news media' is the enemy of the American people https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L https://t.co/9hJYc8MRPj — CNN (@CNN) February 17, 2017

Trump has been waging a rhetorical war against the media since the beginning of his campaign, and it appears that his goal is to exacerbate hostilities. He has called entire outlets “fake news” and assailed specific reporters while on the campaign trail.

One such altercation came when CNN reported that intelligence officials possessed evidence of Russians acquiring information damaging to Trump. The president and his allies went on an all-out assault on the news channel for weeks afterward. It doesn’t appear that he’s too eager to find common ground with the “enemy of the American people.”Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!As we’re well aware, America’s toxic sociopolitical climate has given rise to enemies of politicians crossing into a once-off limits realm and turning on politicians’ kids (read: Barron Trump) as a way to vent anger.

So, it’s reassuring to catch wind of a celebrity — of the liberal persuasion, no less — not only avoiding that distasteful practice but sticking up for and extending kindness to a child of a politician she abhors.

Whoopi Goldberg, cohost of “The View,” heard that Tiffany Trump — whose dad happens to be Republican President Donald Trump — was shunned at a New York Fashion Week show.

Nobody wants to sit next to Tiffany Trump at Philipp Plein, so they moved and the seats by her are empty. pic.twitter.com/XcxNYI6Kf8 — Christina Binkley (@BinkleyOnStyle) February 14, 2017

Empty seats next to Tiffany Trump. pic.twitter.com/axvYJAFupl — Christina Binkley (@BinkleyOnStyle) February 14, 2017

And then Goldberg went to bat for the first daughter.

“You know what, Tiffany, I’m supposed to go to a couple more shows. I don’t know what’s gonna happen, but I’m coming to sit with you,” Goldberg said on Wednesday’s broadcast. “Because nobody’s talking politics. You’re looking at fashion! She doesn’t want to talk about her dad! She’s looking at the fashion!”

Goldberg added that the boycott of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line — which she said is “all about buying stuff” — is different than giving the cold shoulder to Tiffany Trump.

“I just thought it was mean,” Goldberg added. “And you know what, I don’t wanna talk about your dad, but girl, I will sit next to you ’cause I’ve been there where people said, ‘Oh, we’re not gonna sit next to you.’ I’ll find your ass and sit next to you.”

The crowd offered a hearty applause, and Tiffany Trump must have also, given she hopped on Twitter to accept Goldberg’s offer the same day: “Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg,” she wrote, “I’d love to sit with you too!”

Thank you @WhoopiGoldberg I'd love to sit with you too! 😊 — Tiffany Ariana Trump (@TiffanyATrump) February 15, 2017

“It’s almost like we live in a time where people are saying, ‘Because it’s a Trump, it’s OK to bully her,'” co-host Sara Haines added. “Because like bragging about this online and saying, ‘Look! She has no one to sit by her!’ — that’s being a mean girl. Just for sport.”

But Goldberg’s co-host Joy Behar declared that “nobody attacked” the daughters of former President George W. Bush — and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh “once compared 12-year-old Chelsea Clinton to a dog, so let’s not just blame liberals on this one.”

But fellow co-host Jedediah Bila jumped in and corrected Behar, saying the Bush daughters were, in fact, attacked and that “no kid is immune.”

Here’s the clip:

Reports later emerged that seats next to Tiffany Trump at the fashion show in question were vacant for only a couple of minutes before they were filled again.

Regardless, Goldberg deserves credit for stepping up and encouraging the correct attitude.Taking the conversation back to Sunday night at the Grammy Awards, Tomi discusses Joy Villa and the “Make America Great Again” dress she wore to honor the 45th president. Tomi exclaims how this isn’t the same thing as the rest of the political tomfoolery that Beyonce or Sarah Silverman have been spreading.

She feels that this was just a dress and was in good taste because it wasn’t mean, nasty, vile, supporting a hate group, spitting in the face of law enforcement, or asking for a military takeover of the United States.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!As New Yorkers woke up Thursday morning and commuted to their jobs, several popular restaurants and bodegas remained shuttered throughout the day in solidarity with the city’s immigrants.

In Washington, D.C., professionals found a variety of their favorite restaurants closed at lunchtime, a simple sign in the window proclaiming that the business is “supporting our employees today.”

It was a “Day Without Immigrants” Thursday, a nationwide strike that gained traction through word-of-mouth and social media with no large national organization to guide it. Hundreds of restaurants and businesses across the country – particularly in largely urban areas such as Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C. — closed or only sold limited products.

Multiple schools and daycares, too, closed Thursday.

Becki Young, a D.C.-based immigration attorney who specializes with those in the restaurant industry, told TheBlaze that the premise behind the protest was to show that “our economy wouldn’t function without immigrants” and the restaurant industry especially would crumble without them.

“I don’t think that’s a debatable point,” Young said in an interview following the Day Without Immigrants.

Young said she works predominantly with immigrants who are in the country legally, including “highly skilled professionals” who are “sometimes among the highest echelons of society.” The companies that hire her, Young said, often do so to get her help in bringing workers to the country and keeping them in the U.S. legally.

But while there are many immigrants in the restaurant industry — both documented and not — Young said immigrants as a whole can have a negative connotation.

The individual people who she works with “get respect, but immigrants as a whole definitely do not get respect,” Young said. “It’s amazing to me that people really do forget how young our country is and that we are a nation of immigrants.”

Young added:

The work ethic of immigrants is something that you hear a lot about. I think certainly people who get up early, work hard all day, go to bed late and get up the next day deserve a lot of respect. I think that basic respect is certainly something that is lacking. And respect for basic human dignity, too.

But, as Young pointed out, Thursday’s protest was most likely more predominantly felt in urban areas with a higher immigrant population — although the strike did take some by surprise in smaller communities.

According to the Island Packet, parents were surprised Thursday to find that a daycare in Bluffton, South Carolina, was closed for the day — reportedly with little notice.

“Why didn’t they tell me?” one parent asked after showing up to the closed daycare. “Why didn’t they call the parents? I’ve got to go to work.”

Little Steps, the bilingual daycare, said in an announcement about its closing Wednesday night, according to the Island Packet:

As an educational institution, I do not mix politics nor any beliefs within the daycare’s decisions, but all our staff members are immigrants. I cannot take away their right of protesting for what they believe is not fair. Even though everyone working in Little Steps is legal in this country, we believe it’s imperative to join this movement and protest since there are family relatives and friends being affected by all the raids and it saddened us to see the way … things are being taken care of.

“I definitely think [the protests are] only a first step, and we have a long way to go,” Young said. “In the middle of the country, where a protest like this is needed, there may not be as many immigrant workers.”

“I think the next step in terms of protests and civil disobedience is to do work in the interior of our country where people maybe have slightly different opinions about these issues because they don’t see it every day and don’t necessarily appreciate it,” she continued.

As Young pointed out, in the Washington, D.C., area, about 48 percent of those working in the restaurant industry are foreign-born.

Nationwide, immigrants are 1.4 times more likely than U.S.-born workers to work in the leisure and hospitality sector, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.Amid reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration committee is having trouble booking entertainment for the January 20th event, with some rumors indicating entertainers may fear reprisal if they agree to perform, Tomi Lahren appeared on The O’Reilly Factor to discuss the intolerance of the left when it comes to the President-elect.

O’Reilly asked Lahren if she believed performers who agree to align themselves with Trump by agreeing to perform are actually in danger of losing “their livelihood” for that decision.

“Well Bill, there are still many Americans out there that fail to understand that Donald Trump will be our 45th president, that he will be inaugurated on January 20th. They haven’t even accepted that yet. If they can’t accept that, of course they’re not going to accept entertainers going to perform at the inauguration… …I think it’s kind of the side-eye, the same thing we saw in the election. Oh you’re a Trump supporter? You must be a racist, you must be a bigot…I’m still wondering when they’re going to accept the fact that he’s going to be our president. Then maybe we can move on and actually unite.”

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!A panel of 91 historians and executive branch experts at C-SPAN have decided that former President Barack Obama is the 12th-best president in American history.

In the list of 43 former commanders-in-chief, Obama is wedged right under former President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, and right above former President James Monroe, who was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party founded by former Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.

Former President Abraham Lincoln has earned the No. 1 spot since 2000, when C-SPAN conducted its first Historians Survey of Presidential Leadership.

According to a network press release, the experts who participated in the survey were asked to rank the former presidents on a scale of one-to-10 on 10 different “qualities of presidential leadership,” which included “moral authority,” “crisis leadership,” “economic management” and “relations with Congress,” among other things.

“Once again the Big Three are Lincoln, Washington and FDR — as it should be,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University in Houston said, adding, “That Obama came in at No. 12 his first time out is quite impressive.”

But not everyone on the panel felt that way about the most recent ex-president. Howard University historian Edna Greene Medford, who participated in the survey, thought Obama deserved a higher ranking on the list.

“Although 12th is a respectable overall ranking,” she said, “one would have thought that former President Obama’s favorable rating when he left office would have translated into a higher ranking in this presidential survey.”

“But, of course, historians prefer to view the past from a distance,” she admitted, “and only time will reveal his legacy.”

When he left the White House on Jan. 20, Obama’s approval rating was slightly above 57 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics polling averages.

While Obama greatly outranks former President George W. Bush (No. 33) and surpasses fellow Democratic President Bill Clinton (No. 15), he was unable to best former President Ronald Reagan (No. 9), a darling of the Republican Party.

It is worth noting, given President Donald Trump’s affinity for former President Andrew Jackson, whose portrait hangs next to the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, that the 19th century populist has plunged five places since 2009, from 13th to 18th.Legendary pop star Madonna claimed at a women’s rally in Washington D.C., on Saturday that she has thought an “awful” lot about blowing up the White House now that President Donald Trump lives there.

According to multiple reports, Madonna showed up at the anti-Trump rally Saturday afternoon around 2:50 p.m. EST where she was slated to perform. But before singing, she spoke for a few minutes.

During that time, Madonna cursed repeatedly on live television, telling “detractors” of the women’s march: “f**k you.” According to Heavy.com, Madonna also lamented over Hillary Clinton losing the election, saying that she believes Trump’s win should “wake us the f**k up.”

“To our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything: F–k you!” Madonna exclaimed.

Then Madonna claimed she has thought about blowing up the White House.

“Yes I’m angry, yes I’m outraged, yes I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House,” she told the crowd, “but I know that this won’t change anything.”

Apparently, news stations aired part of Madonna’s speech before cutting her off due to her excessive use of curse words and offensive language.

After her short speech, Madonna went on to perform for the women. It is unclear if the Secret Service will investigate, but they do typically look into claims such as these, no matter how tongue-in-cheek they appear.The head of the Chicago Police Department is now admitting that more gun laws don’t necessarily result in less gun violence because criminals don’t “play by society’s rules.”

Chicago, a city run by Mayor Rahm Emanual, former White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama, reported double the number of killings throughout Christmas weekend this year than last year. At least 27 people were shot, 12 of them fatally, according to ABC News.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said during a news conference on Monday that most of the shootings between Friday evening and Sunday evening were “targeted attacks” by gang members going after rival gang members who were gathered for Christmas and holiday parties. The Chicago Tribune reported 90 percent of those fatally shot were involved in gang activities, had criminal histories or were previously known to police.

The deaths bring to more than 750 the number of gun-related deaths in Chicago just this year. As ABC News also noted, it’s the first time in more than two decades that Chicago has seen more than 700 people die in a single year as a result of gun violence.

As TheBlaze has reported multiple times, Chicago has among the nation’s most restrictive gun laws. But as Johnson acknowledged at his Monday press conference, repeat gun violence offenders don’t often don’t obey those laws.

“These gun offenders have repeatedly shown us that they’re not going to play by society’s rules,” the police superintendent told WLS-TV.

As a result, Johnson is now calling for repeat offenders to face tougher penalties for crimes they commit.

(H/T: New York Times)Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Minnesota Sen. Al Franken shared an awkward moment Thursday that just might become fodder for “Saturday Night Live.”

During his testimony at his confirmation hearing, Perry, President-elect Donald Trump’s onetime Republican primary rival — who is now his choice to lead the Department of Energy — exchanged pleasantries with the Democratic senator.

“Did you enjoy meeting me?” Franken asked.

“I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch,” Perry replied.

“Well—” Franken began before hesitating as Perry’s words sunk in and the crowd erupted in laughter.

“May I rephrase that, sir?” Perry interjected.

“Please, please, please,” Franken said. “Oh my lord, oh my lord.”

Perry, who had doubled over in laughter, replied, “Well, I think we found our ‘Saturday Night Live’ soundbite.”

Franken, who was once an ‘SNL’ cast member, laughed in response.Glenn has a special Valentine’s gift for his wife, Tania, that he expects she’s going to hate.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!The student government of the University of Wisconsin-Madison decided on Wednesday that black students, including former inmates, should be given free tuition, housing, and access to the university.

The Associated Students of Madison adopted a resolution saying that all black students should receive free education because blacks were denied an education during slavery and because they say that the university is “out of reach” for black students, according to the Associated Press.

It also says that students hailing from suburban areas are overrepresented at the school because the school requires ACT and SAT scores for application consideration, and that the requirement of those test scores in the application process is an example of “white supremacy.” The students contend that taking ACT and SAT scores into consideration for acceptance to the university denies lower income students the opportunity to enroll at the university.

The resolution would end up saving each black student around $20,000 in tuition and housing. Black students make up around 2 percent of the student community at the Madison UW flagship campus, and has grown by about 15 percent in recent years.

The resolution also says the university should dedicate 10 percent of donations to help with financial aid and study the option of admissions based on geographic location along with putting less weight on ACT and SAT test scores. The demands are similar to that of the Black Liberation Collective, a group dedicated to bringing freedom and liberation for all black people, according to their website.

This proposed resolution comes after several racially-charged incidents occurred on campus within the last year. In 2016, one student spat on and shouted racial obscenities at a black student, swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler were posted on a Jewish student’s door, and a student was arrested after allegedly spray-painting messages about racism on campus buildings. Just last month, a student who had previously been arrested for burning down predominantly black churches in the area attempted to start a white supremacist group on campus, an idea he eventually backed down on after the student body railed against the idea.

In August, the university announced plans to build a black cultural center to help encourage discussions about racial and societal differences. It would also hold diversity training for students and staff.

The author of the resolution, Tyriel Mack, suggested in a statement that the school needed to back up their words with actions. “The university’s rhetoric suggests that it is committed to diversity and inclusion, so this legislation compels the university to move towards action – which is imperative,” he said. “If no one challenges the university’s empty promises, then the racial composition will remain stagnant.”

University spokesman John Lucas said that school officials are reviewing the resolution.Veteran Fox News anchor Chris Wallace set out what he believes it is the duty of reporters to do in the face of criticism from a president or any other powerful politician. He made the comments to Harris Faulkner Friday.

Faulkner asked Wallace to comment on a video of former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton talking about the press and how they don’t have a special status though they are specifically mentioned in the Constitution.

“The media is not entitled to worship,” Bolton said. “It’s not entitled to respect as an institution. It’s not entitled to deference by political leaders. It’s entitled under the First Amendment to say what it wants to say… The notion that the press is somehow specially protected by the First Amendment and the institutional press, the mainstream newspapers and TV networks, that they have a special status is ridiculous.”

“The opposition he faces is overwhelming,” Bolton continued, referring to Trump, “from the establishment press and I think he’s entitled to disagree with them, he’s not threatening them.”

“So the president isn’t threatening to take away anything from the press,” Faulkner began, agreeing with Bolton’s assessment, “but he might be motivating them. And I would ask you what is he motivating them to do exactly?” She added, clarifying, “I mean, will we see an actual change in their actions at all, do you anticipate?”

“No, my experience has been,” Wallace chuckled, “when a president or any official tells you what you should be doing, I mean look you’re a sensible person you want to listen to what they have to say. If they have a fair criticism you want to take that to heart. But just because the president or some other powerful person says that you shouldn’t fall into line.”

He then compared the criticism of the media defying President Trump to that Fox received when they defied President Obama.

Look we got plenty of criticism at Fox from President Obama during the last eight years, and y’know we didn’t fall into line because of that. And I think most of the viewers out there salute us for not falling into line. You have to consider if it’s something that you don’t like, how would you feel if it was the other way around? If you don’t like the idea that president Obama is telling the press what to do, then you can’t like it when it’s President Trump, somebody who a lot of viewers here may admire, telling reporters what to do.They need to be accurate, they need to be fair, but they can report as long as it’s accurate and fair, and it isn’t going to endanger national security.

“John Bolton is right, halfway, we are not entitled to any deference,” he concluded, “the president can say anything that they want, he can all on any reporter we wants whether it’s a conservative reporter or liberal reporter, but we are constitutionally protected to report what we want.

Criticism of the media has become a contentious issue in President Trump’s term as he continuously attacks the press for what he and his allies consider to be unfair treatment. Sheriff Clarke even said he would boycott CNN until Trump said they were “OK,” while former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin called him a “fearless leader” for going after the media. CNN’s Jake Tapper just recently responded to Trump’s attacks saying, “get to work and stop whining.”Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, is accusing the Obama administration of “covering up” the possibility of alleged Fort Lauderdale gunman Esteban Santiago being radicalized by ISIS and showing up on the FBI’s radar well before the Jan. 6 attack that killed at least five people.

Authorities say 26-year-old Santiago boarded a flight Jan. 6 from Anchorage, Alaska, to Minneapolis, where he changed planes and then flew to Fort Lauderdale. Police say that Santiago checked a firearm before getting on his plane and then retrieved it at baggage claim in Florida. According to eyewitness accounts, he then entered a bathroom and re-emerged opening fire, killing at least five and injuring eight more.

Days after the massacre, questions arose over whether Santiago had been influenced by radical Islamic terrorists. According to one law enforcement official who spoke with ABC News, Santiago may have also used the name Aashiq Hammad.

An FBI spokeswoman did not immediately respond when asked to confirm ABC’s reporting, but another law enforcement official said last week that while in Alaska, Santiago visited an FBI field office, where he reportedly told officers that he was being forced to watch ISIS videos.

According to the Miami Herald, Santiago’s gun was seized by local Alaska law enforcement officers while he underwent treatment at a psychiatric facility. About a month later, officers returned Santiago’s firearm. It was just 29 days after Santiago retrieved the weapon that he boarded the plane to Florida.

These reports seem to suggest Santiago was radicalized but that the FBI failed to recognize the warning signs, according to the Texas congressman.

“They knew who this guy was. They knew he had converted to Islam and should have understood he was on the way of being radicalized and that this was not necessarily a mental situation as it was a guy who had been radicalized,” Gohmert said Friday during an interview with TheBlaze.

Gohmert, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees issues related to terror and homeland security, further accused the Obama administration of misleading the American people about the shooting, even calling it “another coverup” like the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.

“It was like coming out and telling us Benghazi was all about a video,” Gohmert alleged. “They knew he had been radicalized, and yet another coverup so the American people might not recognize that radical Islam is alive and well in the U.S. and is going to continue to kill Americans.”

“[Santiago] should never have been allowed to ship a gun … when they knew he had converted to Islam,” Gohmert added.

The Texas Republican pointed to political correctness as one possible reason for the FBI reportedly failing to identify warning signs. He specifically called out the FBI for not allowing agents to ask the right questions when trying to recognize a potential threat.

“There are many factors that help discern if someone has been radicalized before they kill people, and this administration will not allow those things to be taught to our FBI, State Department, Defense Department and intelligence agencies,” Gohmert told TheBlaze in June, shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting that resulted in the deaths of 49 people.

Gohmert was referring to the fact that nowhere in the FBI’s lexicon are “jihad,” “Muslim,” “Islam,” “caliphate,” “Muslim Brotherhood,” “al Qaeda” and “Shariah.” Those words were “purged” from the document as a result of policies enacted by the Obama administration in 2011-12, an action Gohmert has called “absolutely insane.”

“Generally speaking, I think it is absolutely insane. It is absolutely insane that you would not allow FBI agents to be trained about verses in the Quran, which help radicalize the Muslims,” Gohmert said in June.A black supporter of Republican President Donald Trump — who said people call him “Big Joe” — stood amid a throng of Women’s March participants in Los Angeles on Saturday and gave them a tongue-lashing they likely won’t forget.

It began with an interviewer asking Joe why he was there, and as he stood in the street with his bicycle, he said he was was just passing through and had “nothing to do” with the event — but said the marchers were misguided for not uniting behind Trump and giving him a chance.

At that point a woman approached Joe and argued that Trump wasn’t elected: “You are on a bike, and you’re oblivious!” she said to Joe.

Then the pair went at it as the camera rolled.

“Political correctness is a disease!” Joe told the woman, before bringing up Planned Parenthood and saying it’s a “racist system.” Joe added that the organization’s founder, Margaret Sanger, “thought very little of black people. She thought they were ignorant and they shouldn’t exist and reproduce.”

As the crowd around him grew larger, the marchers grew much quieter in the face of what became Joe’s passionate speech:

Everybody’s afraid of you guys because if they stand up for Trump, they’re deemed a racist … and everybody’s terrified … because of political correctness and all this craziness! This is wrong! This is the United States of America! You say he’s not your president, then you shouldn’t be here! Leave! Many of the elitist Hollywood people that said they were going to leave, they didn’t leave! They’re protesting now! You don’t like him, you don’t want to be here, then leave!

Joe also warned that the marchers’ actions are dividing the country and would “bring anarchy” and then “martial law,” which he said would lead to their “biggest fear” — Trump as “dictator.”

“People, wake up!” he yelled. “Be smart!”

Joe then told the marchers the reason so many were shocked that Trump won the election is because his supporters were “afraid to openly support him. But you know when they supported him? In the voting booth.”

(Content warning: While Joe managed to keep his language clean, some march attendees just couldn’t help themselves)

(H/T: BizPac Review)Only one customer was inside Porfirio’s II Pizza and Pasta with a pair of employees Tuesday night when the slow-moving evening at the Levittown, Pennsylvania, eatery suddenly picked up speed.

Two men wearing face masks, gloves and dark clothing with hoods up entered the restaurant brandishing handguns, Middletown Twp. Police Lt. Stephen Forman told WPVI-TV.

“Everything happened so fast,” Porfirio’s co-owner Alex Lara told the station. “Everything got crazy.”

Police told WPVI the gunmen were yelling commands at the customer — and he indeed put his hands up and backed away. But apparently that wasn’t enough for the intruders, who police said began pistol-whipping the customer.

The victim, however, wasn’t about to play one anymore.

“When the armed suspect looked away for a moment, the customer pulled out a .45 caliber handgun from beneath his jacket,” Bucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub told WPVI. “He shot the man who had just pistol-whipped him once in the torso, killing him.”

Then the customer took aim at the other intruder — who was pointing a gun at a clerk — and fired twice. The second suspect fell through the pizza shop’s front door, officials told the station.

The killed intruder was identified as 24-year-old Shawn Rose, police said. His brother, 22-year-old Justin Rose, was listed in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital, according to the station.

The customer refused medical treatment for head cuts and bruises, WPVI said.

“He was pistol-whipped,” Forman told the station. “They were very aggressive. He was in imminent fear of his life and believed that was his only option to get out of there that night.”

Philly.com reported that the customer’s concealed carry permit was recently expired but no charges would be brought against the 35-year-old man.

“He is a lifelong, law-abiding citizen, and yes, you do get credit for that,” Weintraub told WPVI. “A business owner who had the gun solely for his own protection, and thank God he did.”

Security video captured the attempted robbery, pistol whipping and shooting, officials told the station. And as it turns out, police told WPVI the guns the brothers used are airsoft guns.

After the terrifying ordeal, the pizza shop’s other owner has nothing but praise for the armed customer who saved the day.

“To me his is part of the family, now,” Gilmer Porfirio told WPVI. “He’s a hero.”Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul boasted on Twitter late Friday that President-elect Donald Trump “fully” supports his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it in the same day.

“I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it,” Paul tweeted. “The time to act is now.”

I just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it. The time to act is now. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) January 7, 2017

Paul’s announcement is extremely welcoming for a number of Republican senators who were becoming increasingly worried that the Republican-controlled Congress would attempt to repeal Obamacare without replacing it with a suitable solution in an appropriate timeframe.

Paul alleged in an op-ed earlier this week that if Republicans repeal Obamacare without simultaneously replacing it, they too will assume responsibility for the law’s failure.

“If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare. For mark my words, Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come,” Paul wrote.

And according to Politico, Paul warned on MSNBC “Morning Joe” on Wednesday that if Congress repeals Obamacare without replacing it, then insurance companies could go bankrupt and require a bailout from Congress.

Fellow Sens. Tom Cottom (Ark.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) have also said they want Obamacare to be repealed and replaced simultaneously.

Repealing Obamacare is a top priority for Trump and congressional Republicans. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has said that he wants a legitimate repeal and replace plan from congressional Republicans on Trump’s desk by Feb. 20.Community Rules

Haley resigned as South Carolina’s Republican governor following the vote.

Despite lacking strong foreign policy experience, Haley flew through her confirmation hearing last week. And she received well over the 51 votes needed to be confirmed Tuesday.

Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Tuesday evening ahead of the full Senate vote that while he initially had concerns about Haley, now he is “extremely impressed.”

Those who voted no were: Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).

VIDEO: 51st vote cast in favor of @nikkihaley nomination for U.N. ambassador. pic.twitter.com/sBb0aX2LKg — Rob Godfrey (@RobGodfrey) January 24, 2017

“Governor Nikki Haley was the right governor for the right time in South Carolina’s history. She has led our state through many difficult days with grace and humility,” S.C. GOP chairman Matt Moore said in a statement Tuesday. “We will miss Governor Haley’s strong, principled leadership — but we’ll also miss her compassion, kindness and love for our state.”

South Carolina’s Democratic Party also tweeted out its congratulations to Haley Tuesday.

Congratulations, @USUN Ambassador @nikkihaley! We thank you for your service to our state and wish you success representing our country. — SCDP (@scdp) January 24, 2017

Haley’s been widely praised for her leadership of the Palmetto State during the debate and removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse as well as for leading the state through the aftermath of an avowed white supremacist gunning down nine black churchgoers during a Bible study.

Haley cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier Tuesday with a 19-2 voice vote. Two Democrats, Coons and Udall, objected. “She did not convince me that she understands and embraces the foreign policy principles that the United States has championed over the past 70 years to serve effectively as ambassador to the United Nations,” Coons said. Ahead of the panel vote, Cardin released a statement in which he expressed his intent to vote in support of Haley. He said: What Governor Haley lacks in foreign policy and international affairs experience, she makes up for in capability, intelligence and a track record of building coalitions in South Carolina. Her nomination was surprising to many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but I have been impressed by her forthrightness on core American values, her willingness to admit what she does not know, and her commitment to seeking the facts and speaking truth to power.

During her confirmation hearing last week, Haley promised to “educate” President Donald Trump on foreign policy issues and alleviated Democrats’ concerns as she seemingly broke with the president on certain foreign affairs issues. Though she has little foreign policy experience herself, she touted her experience as a governor during her hearing.

Henry McMaster, who was the state’s lieutenant governor, will take over as South Carolina’s top official.

In her new job, Haley will move to New York City where she will reportedly make $187,000 a year — more than $80,000 more than her salary as governor. She will reside in Manhattan’s elite Waldorf Astoria hotel.

With her confirmation vote Tuesday, Haley joins Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo in Trump’s Cabinet.More Americans say they think that the Senate should confirm President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, to the nation’s highest court than oppose his confirmation, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.

Forty-four percent of respondents said that they favor the Senate confirming Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, while 32 percent said they are opposed. About a quarter — 24 percent — said they don’t know.

Pew found a sharp partisan divide in Americans’ views on Gorsuch: 78 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents support Gorsuch’s confirmation while half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents oppose it.

Pew notes that the public opinion of potential Supreme Court justices is typically positive after their nominations are announced, although many are not well known to the American people.

According to Pew, support for former President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court last year was “similar” to support for Gorsuch. Garland’s nomination was supported by 46 percent of Americans, two percentage points higher than current support for Gorsuch. However, that nomination was not considered by the Senate. Republicans lawmakers argued that since Obama was nearing the end of his term, the next president should choose a justice.

However, when Pew asked Gorsuch’s opponents why they object to his confirmation, they found that more opponents objected to his ideology and his association with Trump rather than Senate Republican’s refusal to consider Garland.

As a candidate for president, Trump promised to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice who embraced an originalist view of the Constitution. After Trump nominated Gorsuch, many conservative groups praised Gorsuch’s record on issues such as religious liberty and said the president kept his promise.

Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a statement Thursday that Gorsuch’s confirmation hearings will begin March 20.According to CNN, Senator Lindsay Graham was not at all having Senator Elizabeth Warren’s political grandstanding during her filibuster for the nomination of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to Attorney General. It was during the filibuster that Warren broke a Senatorial rule that forbids one senator from “impugning” another.

The South Carolina senator appeared on the Mike Gallagher Show Wednesday, where he said Warren reading the letter from Coretta Scott King — in which she expressed opposition to Jeff Sessions’ nomination to the federal bench in 1986 — was defamatory to Sessions, now an Alabama senator. The Massachusetts Democrat was ruled to be in violation of Senate rules for impugning another senator.

Graham believes that Warren’s only reason for smearing Sessions was to fix herself as a leader on the left, and set herself up for higher office in the future. Due to this, Graham said it was past time for Warren to to be shut down.

“The bottom line is, it was long overdue with her,” said Graham. “I mean, she is clearly running for the nomination in 2020.”

“The Democratic Party is being pushed really hard by the most extreme voices in their community, and they just don’t know how to handle it,” he added. “If they empower her, then I think the Democratic Party is gonna lose way with the vast majority of the American people.”

Of course, shutting down Warren, despite her obvious violation of the rules, only had the effect of the left making her out to be the victim in this situation. The Twitter hashtag, #LetLizSpeak appeared and came with accusations of sexism to foul play. She was even compared to such respected revolutionary figures such as Rosa Parks.

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Tired of being preached at by self-important and condescending Hollywood actors on how to be responsible political actors, some conservative pundits are fighting back using the very same format Hollywood employs: the impossibly boring public service announcement video.

An example of a recent PSA from Hollywood demands that Congress stand up to President-elect Donald Trump to protect civil liberties and to “obstruct” anything that “violates” American core values. Here it is in all its melodramatic glory, a feat really only actors could pull off:

So conservative pundits associated with Townhall.com decided to make their own video to answer the melodrama. And they chose to use the language of the actors to, quite literally, tell them to “stop sucking.”

“It’s your job to be creative. And yet, how many of these lame ass videos have you made that look exactly like this?” one person says in the video.

Fox News’ “Red Eye” got in on the fun, too.

I don't know….for me, this is the winner.pic.twitter.com/XtU0Ut3U7y — C-Shellن (@Isla_78) January 7, 2017

Your move, Hollywood.Fox News host Neil Cavuto took CNN to task in an on-air commentary, mocking the cable network on the heels of a headline-grabbing press conference this week during which Republican President-elect Donald Trump called CNN “fake news.”

Cavuto’s segment Thursday began with video of the press conference featuring CNN senior White House reporter Jim Acosta insisting Trump give him a question — and Trump refusing: “Your organization is terrible. … I’m not going to give you a question. You are fake news.”

Then Cavuto pounced.

“Ouch! How’s all that going down, CNN?” he asked. “How does it feel to be dismissed, or worse, ignored? How does it feel when your feelings are hurt? When your reporters are singled out? And you’re treated unfairly and unkindly? Even rudely? What is it like not to be liked? It’s not really fun, is it?”

It is not fun when you think you’re doing your job, and the guy you’re covering thinks you’re the piece of work. It’s insulting, isn’t it? Being called on the carpet by the next leader of the free world after years of giving the present one all but a free pass? You can’t figure out suddenly not being in. It bugs you when someone questions whether you’re fair, doesn’t it? Or cuts you to your journalistic core, doesn’t it? It matters now when it’s about you, doesn’t it? Not so much when it’s about someone else. Presidential pile-ons matter when you’re the subject, not so much — actually scratch that, not at all — when let’s say Fox is the subject.

With that, Cavuto’s commentary cut to clips of President Barack Obama ridiculing Fox News during his years in office — then Cavuto returned.

“And everyone chuckled,” he continued. “Take it from me, taking truth to power can be powerfully unsettling if that power sets its sights on you and attacks you and dismisses you and ignores you. It didn’t matter so much when it wasn’t about you before, CNN. Very different now that it’s you being singled out, CNN. Doesn’t seem very fair now, does it?”

Cavuto told CNN that it’s now “experiencing what we have been living. Now you’re the ones royally, uh, foxed. And the irony is I feel your pain.” Then the host offered CNN a compliment of sorts, saying it’s “better than BuzzFeed,” presumably for not running with the contents of a salacious report about Trump when BuzzFeed did.

“But the buzz is you’re getting fed to the wolves,” Cavuto continued. “Isn’t it obnoxious and unfair how some celebrate your plight? Kind of feels like the way you celebrated ours, doesn’t it? They say payback’s a bitch. If only you would take a moment to rewind the tape and see the shoe is on the other foot. Or am I confusing it with the one now kicking you in the ass?”

Cavuto concluded by saying that when Fox News was the target of Obama’s rebukes, CNN’s “silence was deafening. Very different now, isn’t it? And I suspect — just suspect — not much fun. Is it?”Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Singer-songwriter Miley Cyrus was clearly very upset about President-elect Donald Trump’s Nov. 8 victory, sharing a teary-eyed video on Twitter following the Election Day results, but actor Tom Hanks is offering a more tempered tone, possibly to the dismay of many of his Tinseltown colleagues.

Hanks was honored Wednesday by New York’s Museum of Modern Art and, after several of his fellow Hollywood stars offered their accolades to the Academy Award-winning actor, he shared somewhat of a pep talk in the wake of Trump’s victory, according to The Hollywood Reporter:

We are going to be all right because we constantly get to tell the world who we are. We constantly get to define ourselves as American. We do have the greatest country in the world. We move at a slow pace. We have the greatest country in the world because we are always moving towards a more perfect union. That journey never ceases, it never stops. Sometimes, to quote a Springsteen song, it’s “one step forward, two steps back,” but we still aggregately move forward. We, who are a week into wondering what the hell just happened, will continue to move forward. We have to choose to do so, but we will move forward because if we do not move forward, what is to be said of us?

But then Hanks made a comment that is most assuredly at odds with the thoughts many of his celebrity neighbors have expressed in the nine days since Trump’s stunning defeat of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

“This is the United States of America. We’ll go on. There’s great like-minded people out there who are Americans first and Republicans or Democrats second,” Hanks told The Hollywood Reporter. “I hope the president-elect does such a great job that I vote for his re-election in four years.”

The “Inferno” star also weighed in on liberal filmmaker Michael Moore’s suggestion that he should run for president in 2020. Spoiler alert: Hanks doesn’t feel qualified for the position, despite the fact that a one-time reality TV star will take to the White House in January.

“Not to be completely, over and over coming back to the same thing that I would like to strangle Michael Moore on him offering my name in order to be something other than a CPA, which I’m not qualified to be either,” Hanks said. “We will take everything that has been handed to us as Americans, and we will turn our nation and we will turn the future and we turn all the work that we have before us into some brand of a thing of beauty.”Community Rules

During this event students are paired with others as they place toppings on a felt pizza. The goal of this workshop is to open communication and compromise when it comes to asking for consent. Doc points out, “this can be confusing and it might cause more problems.” As the segment continues, Doc asks the audience to give examples via #HowSexIsLikePizza via Twitter.

Tomi explains in the latest “Final Thoughts” the hard left’s hopes and attempts to tank the Trump Administration.

Tomi states how the Democrats are so desperate to delegitimize Donald Trump’s presidency they “froth at the mouth” over “literally everything.” Tomi describes how the Democrats are pushing so hard for an investigation they’re willing to quote a fake Twitter account called “Not Michael Flynn.”

In response to the sanctions announced Thursday, the official Twitter account of the Russian Embassy in London posted a meme-like response:

President Obama expels 35 🇷🇺 diplomats in Cold War deja vu. As everybody, incl 🇺🇸 people, will be glad to see the last of this hapless Adm. pic.twitter.com/mleqA16H8D — Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) December 29, 2016

The image appears to be mocking Obama’s “lame duck” status until he leaves office on Jan. 20.

The Obama administration announced Thursday that it would shut down some Russian intelligence sites in the U.S. while declaring their operatives “persona non grata” on American soil. Some U.S. senators had been clamoring for a response to the alleged cyber-hacking meant to influence the election. President-elect Donald Trump, meanwhile, dismissed the intrusion and downplayed any sanctions the U.S. might impose, arguing that Americans should “get on with our lives.”Chris Salcedo talks about President Donald Trump’s historic press conference. Some things covered in Trump’s address were glossed over by the media because Trump answered so many questions.

Chris argues that the press and Democrats being “butt hurt” was the most enduring impression he was left with: “It was a wide-ranging press conference. The tongue lashing on the media was strong, and it was quite blunt. And that got the lion share of coverage, but all manner of things were covered yesterday.”

Unfortunately, the bishop is pushing a social justice agenda with little to no reference to the Bible or any traditionally Catholic teachings. So, here is my point-by-point dissection of his statement:

”We welcome the decision of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.”

Unnecessary lead with opinion without stating basis of opinion first. The bishop – who is charged with the spiritual (and then material) well-being of those entrusted to his care should not be offering endorsements of court decisions without a basis in Scripture or Church teaching. To do so is to speak outside of his office as Shepherd.

”We respect the rule of law and the American judicial process.”

As we – Catholics and non-Catholics, citizens and immigrants – all should! But not all do, particularly those who are not familiar with American history and laws.

”We remain steadfast in our commitment to resettling refugees…”

Yes, as many as are practical to resettle, and as many as are admitted by the country in which we live… but we should not be urging completely open doors, as that is as imprudent as not locking your doors and windows and inviting every passerby to come into your house at every hour of the day or night.

”…and all those fleeing persecution.”

Then why haven’t we been focused on the Coptic Christians and other religious minorities that were being beheaded, having churches burned, and their women kidnapped? If we are one big human family, isn’t the Church of Christ even more so supposed to be one? If so, where was the support then? Why has this become an issue now, simply because of the misnomer of it being a ”Muslim ban”?

”At this time, we remain particularly dedicated to ensuring that affected refugee and immigrant families are not separated…”

This is an attempt to broaden the scope of the so-called ”Muslim ban” to head-off any objections to attempts to limit immigration (legal or otherwise) from Latin American countries. ”Separation of family members” has been the favored argument against deportation of illegal immigrants, under the false belief that adults who entered the country illegally would be deported, yet their children who were born here would be taken away from them.

This is a false argument on two counts: one, many of these children of illegal immigrants are themselves illegally here – this is the main crux of the DREAM Act (providing education for children who are illegal immigrants because they were under-aged when their parents sneaked-in) – and therefore should be deported as well; and two, children of illegal immigrants are always encouraged to stay with their parents. Nobody is saying ”you’re a citizen and you MUST stay here while we take your mother and father back to their home country.”

”… and that they continue to be welcomed to our country. We will continue to welcome the newcomer as it is a vital part of our Catholic faith and an enduring element of our American values and tradition.”

Nobody is saying to end all immigration. The main argument is how to enact proper administration and enforcement of immigration laws. We welcome legal immigrants as we welcome invited guests into our home, and we welcome their family members as we welcome unexpected guests to a party (i.e., a ”+1” that was a last-minute addition). However – in Jesus’s own words – ”Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber… A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy.” (John 10:1,10a). These thieves and robbers are not to be welcomed and excused and rewarded for bad behavior.

Yes, we welcome the newcomer who follows the rules, appreciates their new home, and wishes to add to the culture. But those who flout our laws, protest and denounce our country and cling to their old ways – particularly those ways and ideas that were responsible for destroying their prior home! – do not add, but rather ”steal” from this country and its citizens. Such a person is not acting like a member of a loving family, but is instead acting like a divider, an insurrectionist, and – in the numbers they have already appeared – as part of a conquering army. Regarding such people, a nation has a right to resist and its leaders (political and spiritual) have a duty to protect against.During a discussion on HBO’s “Real Time” Friday night, failed Democratic Senate candidate from Missouri, Jason Kander, challenged Tomi Lahren to name the four Americans who were killed by Islamic terrorists in Bengahzi on Sept. 11, 2012.

Kander’s challenge came during a segment of the show when host Bill Maher was discussing the recent botched Navy SEAL mission in Yemen with his panel, which included Lahren, Kander and GOP strategist Rick Wilson.

That mission, despite killing several high-level Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leaders, left one American Navy SEAL dead and severely damaged a military helicopter, which was later completely destroyed.

Maher made the point that if in the opening days of a Hillary Clinton presidency an American solider was killed in a botched mission, then the conservative media would be screaming about a second Benghazi. To that point, Lahren agreed.

Kander chimed in to say that conservatives and Republicans “used the people who died [at Benghazi] as political chess pieces for quite a few years” in order to grill Clinton, who at the time the attack happened, was thought to be the most likely person to become the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.

Then Kander challenged Lahren to name the four Americans who died at the Benghazi compound, telling Lahren: “You don’t know.”

But Lahren did know and she made sure Kander understood.

“Chris Stevens, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods and Sean Smith,” Lahren boldly proclaimed straight to Kander’s face.

Watch the exchange below:

Kander is the former secretary of state of Missouri. He challenged Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) last year for Blunt’s Senate seat as the Democratic nominee, but ultimately lost in the general election by less than three percent.President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team says Trump will require that officials in his administration are prevented from lobbying for at least 5 years after leaving the administration.

RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday night that Trump will make sure any new government official joining his team would terminate their role as either state or federal lobbyists before joining the administration. All of the appointees will be required to sign a document expressing that they do not currently have any lobbyist ties and they will not engage in state or federal lobbying within 5 years after leaving the Trump team.

Trump’s transition team has been marred with reports of internal conflict, most notably between former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Trump’s son-in-law and real estate businessman Jared Kushner. Vice President-elect Mike Pence recently took over leadership of the team, officially submitting paperwork late Tuesday certifying his position as head of the transition team.Once in charge of the team, reports surfaced that Pence rid the new team of any lobbyists.

Spicer said, “It goes back to Mr. Trump’s goal of making sure people aren’t using government to enrich themselves.” He added that anyone serving in the administration won’t be able to use the position to “enrich themselves.”

The first round of “landing teams” that will go to federal agencies to detail the handover of power with current agency officials will be announced on Thursday.Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul decided to weigh in on the feud between Georgia Rep. John Lewis, and President-elect Donald Trump.

It started when Lewis questioned Trump’s legitimacy as president due to the Russian hacking, causing Trump to return fire as he tends to on Twitter, saying he should “spend more time helping and fixing his district, and calling Lewis “all talk” and “no action.”

This caused many to speak out against Trump, taking issue with the way the President-elect addressed Lewis, especially on Martin Luther King day. Lewis has a history of civil rights advocacy during the civil rights era in the 1960’s, having been one of those beating on 1965’s “Bloody Sunday” protests. Some of those who rose to defend Lewis weren’t just leftist however, as the Washington Post listed tweets from well known Republicans.

Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) said he disagreed with calling the election illegitimate but said Lewis “deserves all of our respect. He’s earned it.” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) riffed on Trump’s tweets in defending Lewis: “John Lewis and his ‘talk’ have changed the world.” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) replied to one of Trump’s tweets about Lewis with: “Dude, just stop.”

While Paul stated that he has great respect for that, he won’t let Lewis’s history stop him from making legitimate criticisms as to his policies, and principles.

“John Lewis isn’t in a position where there can’t be a healthy debate. Because he’s a civil rights icon, shouldn’t make him immune,” Paul told Tapper.

“John Lewis is a partisan,” continued Paul later. “I have a great deal of respect for him, but he’s a partisan, and I disagree with him on issues. I should be able to honestly disagree with him, and not have it all come back to I have no appreciation for civil rights icon because of this. I think that’s the part that’s sometimes unfair in this.”We all have opinions about which people should be appointed to certain Cabinet positions, and President-elect Donald Trump is giving you the ability to weigh in.

Currently up at the Republican Party’s website is a survey complete with plenty of space for visitors to fill offer ideas on who should be named for positions Trump still needs to fill. (While some of these positions have already gone, slots are still open.)

As it stands, Trump is weighing options on the positions of secretaries of state, health and human services, education, defense, treasury and more. The Washington Post has a great page dedicated to keeping track of who is being considered for what position. You can choose from the pool or enter your own ideas.

Go here to see the page. The spaces are large enough that you can write in multiple names or even present small arguments.

If enough votes come in, we may see a Cabinet selected with the help of the people, instead of just solely by the politician.Irving Mayor Beth Van Duyne, who was accused of committing “Islamophobia,” won’t be seeking a third term but says she is seeking greater opportunities. Van Duyne was also an early supporter of President Trump, and has met with him at Trump Tower, fueling speculation she might be in line for a position with the administration.

Van Duyne became a target for the left when she published a Facebook post in 2015 speaking out against an “Islamic Tribunal” being established in her city.

“As Mayor of the City of Irving,” she wrote, “I took an oath to uphold the laws of the State of Texas and the Constitution of the United States. I respect the freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment and believe that protecting fundamental constitutional rights and ensuring that individual rights are not violated or denied is essential.”

She was immediately criticized and accused of “Islamophobia” by Muslims, and the accusation was lobbed again at her when she backed school and law enforcement authorities in the “clock boy” controversy, also in Irving, Texas. Ahmed Muhamed, the boy at the center of the controversy, has since sued the school and the city for $15 million for the actions that Van Duyne defended.

Dana Loesch interviewed Mayor Van Duyne for the Blaze in 2015 about the outcry against her proposal.

Mayor Van Duyne had been on the City Council since 2004, and the mayor since 2011, serving two terms.The tallest dam in the entire country is located approximately 70 miles north of California’s capital, Sacramento. The Oroville dam in Oroville, California has a massive leak that is on the verge of releasing a three-story wall of water rushing downstream. Steven Greenhut, western region director of the R Street Institute, lives in a “danger zone” and joins Dana Loesch with the latest on the situation.

Steven explains that they’re in uncharted territory as the emergency spill way has never been used since it was built in 1968. He mentions how the state has had opportunities to fix it during droughts but instead of fixing infrastructure has spent the capital on grandiose projects.

According to The Hill, Obama played golf at the Kaneohe Klipper course with personal aide Joe Paulsen, staffers Michael Brush and Luke Rosa and longtime friend Bobby Tit‎comb.

Obama arrived to Hawaii late Friday night to begin his final vacation as president. More from The Hill:

According to a press pool, there were also a handful of protestors around Obama’s holiday rental in Kailua who held signs ranging from asking for clemency for Chelsea Manning to ending the “Gaza Blockade.”

The first family is vacationing on the northwest side of Oahu, according to the Washington Examiner. Prior to leaving for the islands, Obama gave his final press conference of the year where he spoke on a wide-range of topics.

Typically, Obama’s annual vacation to Hawaii has been a costly expense for taxpayers. According to Judicial Watch, the Obamas’ 2013-2014 trip cost taxpayers more than $8 million, including more than $316,000 in expenses for the Secret Service.Khal Elsebai, the executive producer for The Morning Blaze, brings another app for the audience to use on his app of the week.

The Wall Street Journal notes:

Some 69% of adults agreed with the statement that his use of Twitter is bad because “in an instant, messages can have unintended major implications without careful review.” By contrast, 26% agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweeting was a good thing, because “it allows a president to directly communicate to people immediately.”

The desire to see Trump curb his Tweeting habit is bipartisan, with 47 percent of Republicans seeing his Twitter use as bad, and a healthy 89 percent of Democrats indicating the same.

The Journal acknowledges the power of Trump’s tweets, saying that his early morning missives of 140 characters or less have successfully driven the policy and news discussion on any given day. That said, a large majority of millennials — the tech savvy 18-34 year olds — said Trump’s reliance on Twitter is still a bad idea. According to the poll, Trump’s use of Twitter is the least favored way in which respondents predicted he would be a “different kind of leader.”

Trump’s Twitter use has come under fire more times than it is perhaps possible to count during the course of both his campaign and his transition effort, including more than one early morning tirade against the media, his opponent Hillary Clinton and former beauty queen. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Trump is either incapable of or disinterested in changing his Twitter habits as he gets closer to the inauguration.

However, he has also engaged in serious policy moves on the application, including attempts to influence Israeli-Palestinian policy and issuing a veiled threat to the United Nations for what he saw as an abandonment of a long-time ally.Dana Loesch discusses Lady Gaga’s impressive Super Bowl half-time performance and how instead of using the platform as a way to push an agenda, she brought the country together.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Barack Obama made headlines Monday when comments he recently made in a podcast with his former senior adviser David Axelrod went public.

In the podcast, Obama said that if he was able to run for president again, he probably would have won a third term and he definitely would have defeated President-elect Donald Trump in a general election.

And while many agree that Obama’s popularity with Democrats, progressives and a large portion of Americans could potentially have catapulted him to another victory, it’s clear that Obama has been a huge hindrance to Democrats.

In fact, according to the latest stats, under Obama’s watch, more than 1,000 Democrats — between state legislatures, governorships and congressional races — have lost their seats. All the while, Obama regularly touts the number of jobs created during his presidency, most of which have not been full-time.

But the number he routinely forgets is 1,030 — the number of Democrats who have lost their job in politics under Obama.

South Carolina state Senator Vincent Sheheen, who lost twice to South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the battle for the S.C. governorship, told the Associated Press that Obama’s presidency has been especially hard on grassroots Democrats.

“What’s happened on the ground is that voters have been punishing Democrats for eight solid years — it’s been exhausting,” he said. “If I was talking about a local or state issue, voters would always lapse back into a national topic: Barack Obama.”

When Obama won the presidency, his election was heralded as a moment of Democratic dominance – the crashing of a conservative wave that had swept the country since the dawn of the Reagan era.

Democrats believed that the coalition of young, minority and female voters who swept Obama into the White House would usher in something new: an ascendant Democratic majority that would ensure party gains for decades to come.

The coalition, it turns out, was Obama’s alone.

The Associated Press contributed to this story.Though Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., has pledged to share “clear evidence” the U.S. was behind last week’s anti-Israel United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which bars the Jewish state from establishing settlements in territory claimed by Palestinians, one of President Barack Obama’s senior aides is calling the suggestion flatly untrue.

Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper Wednesday, Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said the suggestion that the U.S. orchestrated the controversial vote, from which the White House abstained, is nothing more than “a distraction.”

“We never told anyone how we would vote on the text of a resolution because we didn’t know what the text of the resolution was gonna be until it was introduced by the Egyptians,” the Obama operative told Tapper. “[W]e had not communicated how we would vote, we did not draft it, we did not know what the text was going to be until it was put forward and the president of the United States did not even give instructions to [U.N. Ambassador] Samantha Power as to what her vote would be until the day of the resolution.”

“Let’s be clear here, Jake,” he continued, “This is a distraction. We own the fact that we abstained from this resolution because we believe that was the right thing, so we’re ready to defend our decision to abstain on that resolution. I think it’s the Israeli government that is trying to have this distraction from the real debate.”

Ben Rhodes: Israel accusing the US of being behind the UN resolution is a "distraction" https://t.co/xyotKBQXgq https://t.co/8AqabdxE0V — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) December 28, 2016

Rhodes went on to tell the CNN anchor that the “real debate” is about how Israel’s plans to build “deep in the West Bank” and “displacing Palestinians” could be in line with a two-state solution.

The White House adviser’s charge follows a report that Vice President Joe Biden “put pressure” on Ukraine to vote “yes” on the anti-Israel resolution in order to guarantee “the optics” of a 14-0 vote.

Secretary of State John Kerry, who tore into Israel during a lengthy speech Wednesday explaining the U.S.’s decision on the U.N. vote, has denied any accusations that the State Department orchestrated the resolution.Fox News reported Saturday that Ret. Marine Gen. James Mattis spent his first day as new Secretary of Defense by visiting the Pentagon after being confirmed on Friday following the inaguration.

NEWS ALERT: Defense Secretary Mattis starts first day on the job. pic.twitter.com/WckvVIkn3I — Fox News (@FoxNews) January 21, 2017

Immediately upon confirmation, Mattis penned a memo to the troops under his command telling them, “It’s good to be back” and hinting at a closer relationship between the intelligence community, the Defense Department and the department of State.

Mattis had to be confirmed using a special waiver due to federal law that mandates a Secretary of Defense — and all military officers — must be out of uniform for seven years before taking a position in the cabinet to ensure “civilian” control of the military.Personal attacks against an alt-right leader and his mother have escalated into an armed neo-Nazi protest in the small Montana town of Whitefish. The racist website “Daily Stormer” is organizing a protest against Jewish businesses and those who support them in Whitefish for the second week of January. In addition to a planned march through town, a neo-Nazi website has published a purported list of names and addresses of Jews who protesters should attack.

From ABC Fox Montana:

“We are planning an armed protest in Whitefish. “Montana has extremely liberal open carry laws, so my lawyer is telling me we can easily march through the center of the town carrying high-powered rifles. “I myself am planning on being there to lead the protest, which has been dubbed ‘March on Whitefish.’ “Currently, my guys say we are going to be able to put together about 200 people to participate in the march, which will be against Jews, Jewish businesses and everyone who supports either. “We will be busing in skinheads from the Bay Area. ABC Fox Montana called the Whitefish Police to see if the department had a comment, but no one has gotten back to us.

They say they are protesting businesses that targeted white nationalist “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer’s mother, who owns a business in Whitefish. According to her, local human rights advocate threatened to flood her business with hundreds of protesters if she did not sell the rental property.

Does Love Really Live Here? Heartbreaking testimony from my mother about the shakedown in Whitefish. https://t.co/W4mu6GXlQT — Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) December 16, 2016

As a precursor to the armed protest, the racist website published a list of Jews to attack in Whitefish, and they’ve been bombarded with death threats:

The police in Whitefish, Mont., said Tuesday that they have stepped up patrols and are working with the F.B.I. after a neo-Nazi and white supremacist website listed the names and contacts of local Jews, calling on readers to “take action” against them. Lt. Bridger Kelch of the Police Department in the town in northwestern Montana said that the force was taking the measures after the website, The Daily Stormer, on Friday published phone numbers, work locations, email addresses, and photographs of six Flathead County residents. Several of those targeted were from Whitefish where Sherry Spencer, the mother of the white nationalist leader Richard B. Spencer, lives and owns a building that has been the subject of protests.

The father and mother of Richard Spencer say they do not endorse his views on white nationalism. Spencer has said that he’s encouraged by Trump’s victory, saying that his aims are very much aligned with those of the “alt-right.” He’s also said that he’s considering using his infamy as a springboard to run for congress.A white woman is in jail on a felony hate crime charge after prosecutors in Washington state said she posted a Facebook live video of her verbally ranting about a Hispanic driver, calling her “Spanish privileged” and also threatening to ram her vehicle, sue her and have her deported, the Seattle Times said.

“This is America!” the accused woman yelled from inside her vehicle, the clip shows. “We don’t drive like that here! We don’t drive like you’re in Mexico, lady!”

As she followed the Hispanic woman’s vehicle, the accused woman added, “This is my freakin’ neighborhood! This is where I grew up! I grew up here, not them! This woman don’t deserve to belong here, she don’t belong here! She don’t [expletive] belong here!”

King County prosecutors said the woman who recorded and posted the video is Sandra Jametski, 48, who was charged in early December with malicious harassment — a hate crime — for allegedly posting the 10-minute tirade on Nov. 21, the Times said.

And believe it or not, prosecutors said Jametski targeted the Hispanic woman — the Times agreed to use only her first name, Dolores — that day over a car accident a year prior for which Dolores wasn’t at fault.

State law defines malicious harassment as intentionally injuring, damaging property or threatening someone because of his or her perception of the victim’s race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or mental, physical or sensory handicap, the paper noted.

Dolores, 44, and her husband are originally from Mexico, the paper said.

Jametski — who also goes by Sandra Huddleson — has been in jail in lieu of $500,000 bail since Dec. 3, the Times said, adding that she pleaded not guilty at her Dec. 15 arraignment.

The bail amount is partly based on Jametski’s criminal history, which includes convictions for second-degree assault and driving under the influence, Senior Deputy Prosecutor Mike Hogan told the paper. But bail also was set at that amount because Jamet­ski’s actions were “an attack on the entire Latino community,” Hogan added to the Times.

It all started one November day in 2015 when Dolores took her 16-year-old daughter — who had her learner’s permit — for a practice drive. After a car started tailgating them, Dolores told the Times the driver soon tried to pass on the left as her daughter singled left and began turning, too. The driver of the passing car lost control — and while the passing car didn’t come in contact with Dolores’ car, it did hit a curb and pole. The driver was Jametski, who was cited for passing in a no-passing zone. Neither Dolores nor her daughter were cited or named in the accident report, but they still stayed at the scene until police arrived, the Times said.

Which brings us to last Nov. 21 when Jametski allegedly got in her vehicle, flipped on her video camera and said instead of going to a therapy appointment she would follow Dolores, the paper reported.

“You get a super good look, everybody,” Jametski allegedly said in the video. “This is what it calls [sic] to be Spanish privileged in America. Yeah, this is what we call Spanish privileged, and she’s going right to where I used to live. Welcome to my neighborhood.”

Soon, the Times said, Jametski allegedly exited her vehicle, used a racial slur and confronted Dolores: “You have no freakin’ right to go to this school, you don’t even have a right to be in this country. You totaled my car, and I’m going to have great privilege in suing your [expletive].” On the video, Jametski also allegedly said Dolores lied to police.

A friend sent Dolores a link to a Facebook page apparently belonging to Jametski — and 911 was called.

“She knew our house, she knew our cars, she knew where my brother goes to school,” Dolores’ daughter, 21-year-old Adriana, told the Times. “She seemed to have a personal vendetta against everyone in our family. We just felt really threatened and scared and just didn’t feel safe.”

“That’s what made my husband afraid,” Dolores added to the paper. “She doesn’t want to do something herself; she wants to involve other people who don’t like Hispanics.”

(H/T: New York Daily News)House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Ca.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) were embarrassed after excoriating former national security advisor Michael Flynn for tweets that were made by a parody account pretending to be him. They made the comments in a press conference Tuesday about Flynn’s resignation from the Trump administration.

Cummings derided Flynn for the tweets, and said further investigation was needed into the matter.

“Something is wrong here,” Cummings intoned, addressing Pelosi directly.

Madame Leader, just this morning, Flynn tweeted, and this is a quote: “scapegoat,” end of quote. Scapegoat. He basically described himself as a scapegoat. And so I believe we need to hold a public hearing with Flynn to get to the bottom of this. Our committee held three or four hearings, emergency hearings on Hillary Clinton in the matter of a week or two. And if there is any emergency at this moment in the history of this country, this is the moment. And so we need to get his security clearance documents, I wanna see em. I wanna see what he put in those documents to find out if he was honest on those forms and we need to know how much he got paid to have dinner with Putin.

Nancy Pelosi explained at length the concept of a “scapegoat” to further toss calumny on Flynn’s head.

Top Bimbo Dem Clown Pelosi CAUGHT

Citing Fake Flynn Tweet. Dem FakeNews !

But I will say this I didn’t know until I heard from my colleague that the tweet of General Flynn today was “scapegoat.” Scapegoat. Do you know what a scapegoat is? That means in community where people want to absolve themselves of guilt they get a goat and they heap all of the ills onto the goat and then they run the goat out of town. So the inference that is to be drawn from his statement is that other people have blame that should be shared in all of this.

Reporters captured the moment Pelosi was told the tweets were fakes.

It appears that the top Democrats got the tweets from the New York Times and Newsmax, who both published the tweets as being from the real Flynn. The tweets have not been deleted by the fake account:

General Flynn resigned Monday after a long scandal involving contact he had made with the Russian government before the election. He denied that he had spoken about sanctions during the call and later said he wasn’t sure if he had, embarrassing Vice President who had backed him publicly on the denial. A report surfaced that it was Obama officials wanting to defend the Iran Deal who orchestrated the leaks that eventually took down Flynn.”Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add ’within the limits of the law’ because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.” ~ Thomas Jefferson

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for three generations. By carefully molding public thoughts and opinions with an iron fist they now have a cult following from the vast majority of their brain washed subjects. Any freedom loving hold-outs must jealously shield their thoughts or face a harsh punishment, even death. The only religion allowed, which all must follow, is love of the Republic staring the Kim family. Entire families, from grandchildren to grandparents, are eradicated if a Bible or other non approved book is found. Should a person not show the proper amount of zeal for the government they are sent to the reeducation mines. Not an euphemism. Escape form North Korea and your remaining family will be properly punished.

On February 16, 2017, the Washington supreme court ,with aid from the U.S. supreme court, removed the rights of its citizens the free participate of religion. Beyond just denying the practice of freedom of religion, the court is willing to pierce the corporate veil and impose individual liability even in the absence of traditional justification: no fraud committed, no commingling of funds, etc. Personal financial ruin looms if a person fails to practice religion in a court mandated way. Will it be jail time if a person refuses to comply?

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Being in law enforcement has always been a tough job, but, according to a newly released study from the Pew Research Center, it has become much more difficult — and less safe — since the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri.

According to the research, 86 percent of police officers see their work as harder today due to the high-profile police conflicts with the black community. Perhaps even more alarming, a staggering 93 percent said their colleagues expressed concerns about their own personal safety — a number that was recorded before the separate ambush attacks in Dallas on July 7 and in Baton Rouge on July 17 that left a total of eight officers dead.

All of this is a result of the so-called “Ferguson effect,” which purports that increased scrutiny on police officers has directly impacted law enforcement work.

In addition to fears about safety, police are now less likely to use force, even when it is appropriate. Three-quarters — or 76 percent — of officers “are reluctant to use force when it is appropriate,” Pew concluded.

The survey also found that interactions between police and blacks have become “more tense,” according to 75 percent of respondents, while 72 percent said they and their colleagues are now less likely to stop and question people who seem suspicious.

However, black and white police officers have differing views on the Black Lives Matter movement:

The racial divide looms equally large on other survey questions, particularly those that touch on race. When considered together, the frequency and sheer size of the differences between the views of black and white officers mark one of the singular findings of this survey. For example, only about a quarter of all white officers (27 percent) but seven-in-ten of their black colleagues (69 percent) say the protests that followed fatal encounters between police and black citizens have been motivated at least to some extent by a genuine desire to hold police accountable.

“White officers and black officers have very different views about where we are as a country in terms of achieving equal rights,” Kim Parker, director of social trends research for the Pew Research Center, told the Associated Press.

For the most part, police officers in general are skeptical about the motives of the demonstrators who have protested following deadly police-involved encounters. According to the study, 92 percent of respondents believe that “long-standing bias against the police is a great deal (68 percent) or some (24 percent) of the motivation behind these demonstrations.”

As a result of the widespread criticism law enforcement officers have been subjected to in recent years, many are disinclined to act over fear of being vilified by the press and public opinion.

“Officers are concerned about being the next viral video and so that influences what they do and how they do it and how they think about it,” Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, told the AP, adding that he doesn’t think most officers are turning a blind eye, “but I still have to believe it may be in a marginal-call situation where there’s a reasonable suspicion on the bubble … that those are the ones they pass up.”

Pew questioned at least 8,000 officers from departments around the country with at least 100 officers between May 19 and Aug. 14 of last year.Conservative actor Scott Baio says he’ll “never again” shop at Nordstrom after the department store announced it would drop Ivanka Trump’s clothing line.

“Dear @Nordstrom NEVER AGAIN!,” Baio tweeted Saturday, along with what was presumably a picture of the Nordstrom credit card statement belonging to him and his wife, Renee Baio, showing that they spent more than $30,000 at the department store just in one year.

Baio is best known for playing “Chachi Arcola” on the 1970s sitcom “Happy Days” and “Charles” on the 1980s sitcom “Charles in Charge.”

Baio frequently appears on Fox News Channel as a political commentator.

Nordstrom announced last week it was dropping the clothing and accessories line of Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump’s oldest daughter.

The department store said the decision was made because the line simply wasn’t selling: “Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.”

President Trump wasn’t convinced, taking to Twitter where he blasted the retail chain for being “unfair” to his daughter.

Baio made headlines back in March 2016 when he officially endorsed Donald Trump for president on Fox News’ “Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro.”

“It’s very simple,” Baio said while explaining to Pirro why he supported Trump.

“When he speaks I understand him. He speaks like I speak. He communicates with people very well,” Baio added, CNN reported.The negativity overtaking Facebook is proving to be too much for some people.

Obama has caused outrage in recent days after he told the American U.N. delegation to abstain from voting on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, which ultimately passed and condemned Israel. Given that the U.S. is a permanent member of the security council, a veto from the U.S. would have killed the resolution for good.

“I think this is a deep reflection of Obama’s ideology,” Bolton said on Fox. “He sees Israel in much the same way he sees the United States.”

“[Obama] dislikes American exceptionalism, he dislikes Israeli exceptionalism, and I think he sees this as his way to ‘set it straight,'” he added.

Bolton went on to predict that in Obama’s 23 remaining days in office, America will continue to see his disdain for Israel and American exceptionalism.In a fitting end, The Clinton Global Initiative will shutter operations at their main office in New York City for good on Tax Day, April 15, 2017.

A WARN filing with the Department of Labor indicates that the 22 remaining employees employed there will be terminated on that date and that the official reason given for the layoffs is a “discontinuation of the Clinton Global Initative.”

The CGI came under scrutiny during the 2016 election. The many foreign government donors and wealthy benefactors the organization claimed contributed to the belief that the organization was a “pay-to-play” operation designed to enrich the Clintons by trading on their political influence, and by using the speaking circuit as a way to elevate the “Clinton” brand while Hillary Clinton campaigned for president.

Clinton defenders countered those allegations by citing the many charitable organizations the CGI funded around the world.

However, as a report from the New York Observer notes, the criticisms began to reemerge in the wake of Clinton’s electoral loss to now President-elect Donald Trump due to the nearly immediate decision by those same wealthy and foreign donors to distance themselves from the foundation — or fundraising — arm of the initiative:

[A]s soon as Clinton lost the election, many of the criticisms directed toward the Clinton Foundation were reaffirmed. Foreign governments began pulling out of annual donations, signaling the organization’s clout was predicated on donor access to the Clintons, rather than its philanthropic work. In November, the Australian government confirmed it “has not renewed any of its partnerships with the scandal-plagued Clinton Foundation, effectively ending 10 years of taxpayer-funded contributions worth more than $88 million.” The government of Norway also drastically reduced their annual donations, which reached $20 million a year in 2015.

The CGI was founded in 2005 to supplement the Clinton Foundation and serve as a networking apparatus to help in fundraising efforts. However, as the Observer notes, the language used to define the goal of the initiative was unclear. “Rather than directly implementing projects, CGI facilitates action by helping members connect, collaborate, and make effective and measurable Commitments to Action—plans for addressing significant global challenges,” the CGI website states.

Clinton was dogged during the waning days of the 2016 election by allegations stemming from an email exchange detailing a memo made public by WikiLeaks in October that the Clinton Foundation was running a scheme to amass a fortune using the Clintons’ political influence:

From the Post:

The memo from [top Clinton aide and Clinton Foundation employee] Douglas Band, made public Wednesday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, lays out the aggressive strategy behind lining up the consulting contracts and paid speaking engagements for Bill Clinton that added tens of millions of dollars to the family’s fortune, including during the years that Hillary Clinton led the State Department. It describes how Band helped run what he called “Bill Clinton Inc.,” obtaining “in-kind services for the President and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.”

The alleged abuses of the Clinton Foundation and the CGI are also detailed in the book, “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich” by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute.Country music star Toby Keith is one of the few musicians that has agreed to perform at a concert during President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration festivities this week.

Last week, the Trump transition team announced that Keith, along with others like Broadway superstar Jennifer Holliday and 3 Doors Down would also perform at a concert at the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday, one day before the inauguration.

Ever since the transition team began inauguration week plans, Hollywood celebrities and A-list musicians have turned down the opportunity to perform at any Trump inauguration event, choosing to put their politics in front of the spirit of American democracy.

And for the musicians who agreed to perform, people have called for boycotts of their music and work. This has led many musicians to back out of performing, including Holliday and opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Both singers said they received harsh criticisms from fans, including death threats.

However, Keith is not backing down. He told Entertainment Weekly in a statement over the weekend that he’s proud to perform for Americans at Trump’s inauguration.

“I don’t apologize for performing for our country or military,” Keith said in his statement to EW. “I performed at events for previous presidents [George W.] Bush and [Barack] Obama and over 200 shows in Iraq and Afghanistan for the USO.”

Still, people continue to bash Keith for his decision to not back out like others:

As it turns out, most of the kids Watters talked to were not exactly well-informed about the temporary travel ban.

The order, which was suspended Thursday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, established a 90-day freeze on entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries — Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Libya — as well as a 120-day moratorium on the refugee resettlement program.

But most of the students, who ditched their classes to march against Trump in Manhattan’s Foley Square, seemed to have very little knowledge of what the executive order actually entailed, Fox News reported.

“Which nations are on the travel ban list?” Watters inquired of one student.

The student, clearly unsure of what to say, uttered: “Well, as of right now, I’m not completely sure about the actual countries.”

Other class-skipping students claimed the ban targeted Lebanon and Afghanistan — neither of those countries is outlined in the executive order.

When the Fox personality asked one female student why she wouldn’t want to see potential visa applicants or refugees “extremely vetted” before they enter the U.S., she wondered why the government would want them to be screened in the first place.

“Why should they be extremely vetted?” she asked Watters, who replied, “Because [the countries in the ban] are havens of terrorism.”

“America’s a haven of terrorism,” the student quickly shot back, offering no explanation for her inflammatory claim.

And another student made the unequivocal statement that none of the countries listed in the ban are “terrorist countries.” That claim was immediately fact-checked by Watters, who informed the protester that Iran is the No. 1 state sponsor of terror in the world, according to the State Department.

And this is what happened when the Fox questioner asked another student about border security:

Watters: “Do you believe in borders?” Student: “If you’re cool and all, you’re coming in to help me, I’m cool with that. But you’re not coming here to mess things up.” Watters: “So don’t you wanna check to see if someone’s ‘cool’ before you let them in?” Student: “Well, of course, you always wanna check. That’s why we have our airports.” Watters: “And that’s why we want extreme vetting.” Student: “Of course, of course.”

At the end of their back and forth, Watters said: “So you do agree with the Trump ban.” The student had nothing to say.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comVice President Mike Pence will address the annual March for Life on Friday, according to the New York Times.

Organizers of the March for Life extended invitations to both Pence and President Donald Trump, and a senior White House official told the Times that Pence will attend.

Pence has addressed the annual pro-life gathering before. He spoke in 2010 while he served in the House of Representatives:

TheBlaze previously reported that another member of the Trump administration, Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to the president, will also speak at the march.

Some pro-life activists expressed concerns over Trump’s commitment to their cause during his candidacy. Prior to his bid for the White House, Trump had called himself pro-choice. During his campaign, he made conflicting statements on the issue.

Since taking the oath of office, Trump has reinstated the “Mexico City policy,” which bans foreign aid from going to nongovernmental organizations that promote or pay for abortion procedures.

Trump criticized the media Wednesday for largely ignoring the March for Life, which takes place on or near Jan. 22 each year, the anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide.

This year’s event will take place Friday in Washington.An Irish magazine is defending the cover of its February issue, which shows President Donald Trump with a bullseye over the left side of his head.

As if the image wasn’t provocative enough, the magazine, Village, splashed the words “why not” in big, bold letters across the bottom, leading some observers to believe the publication was advocating for the assassination, or at least the attempted assassination, of the most powerful man in the world.

.@lukemcmanus @SiobhanDowling.. @VillageMagIRE are just as edgy. if that is the right word. which it isn't. pic.twitter.com/UCHO07Sjfc — Luke Clancy (@lukeclancy) February 7, 2017

But Village insisted Tuesday that its cover is not encouraging violence, pointing to the fact that it didn’t include a question mark after the “why not.”

“It reads ‘WHY NOT’. Then it links to the editorial which duly EXPLAINS WHY NOT,” Village said in a Tuesday tweet.

The publication went on to acknowledge on social media that including a question mark “would signal equivocation or worse.”

It reads 'WHY NOT'. Then it links to the editorial which duly EXPLAINS WHY NOT https://t.co/YC7rP1GXeL ? would signal equivocation or worse https://t.co/2UJjFU8VDx — Village Magazine (@VillageMagIRE) February 7, 2017

The Village article, published under the byline “Village,” literally harkened back to the Middle Ages, highlighting how tyrannicide — the act of killing a tyrant — “has had support from various philosophers and theologians through the centuries.”

St Thomas Aquinas gave the most substantial Christian argument for tyrannicide. He based his position on his arguments for just war and capital punishment and concluded: “He who kills a tyrant (i.e. an usurper) to free his country is praised and rewarded”.

The magazine went on to state that in Trump’s case, however, assassination would be “unnecessary and disproportionate”:

Trump is a fool, he will alienate friends and enrage enemies. He will breach the constitution, illegally enrich himself, fall out with his allies and make evidence-unsupported mistakes. Ladbrokes bookies have Trump at evens to leave office via impeachment or resignation before the end of his first term. Paddy Power has Trump to be impeached in his first term at 3/1, and 7/4 to not complete his first term in office.

Ladbrokes and Paddy Power are betting websites, both of which have posted questions asking users to predict when they think Trump will “resign” or be “impeached.”

The article then made the moral case for not assassinating Trump, saying that in the process of his potential impeachment or resignation, the public would become more aware of the “dangers of allowing power to an intolerant narcissist.” As a result of that awareness, the article suggested, “institutions will be reformed, progressive policies enshrined and popular opinion inured against ever repeating the Trump mistake.”

Given all of these reasons, Village concluded: “The calculus is clearly against violence, even in the case of Trump.”

“Stick to democracy, rigorously but applied, as necessary, stealthily and aggressively,” the magazine added.

(H/T: Washington Post)Calling the notion that Russian hacking helped President-elect Donald Trump win the presidency “absurd,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) nonetheless acknowledged that the hacking existed and was helped along by President Barack Obama’s fecklessness.

Cruz told “The Mike Gallagher” radio show Thursday that the prevalence of cybermeddling now is directly related to Obama and his administration “roll[ing] over for eight years” and allowing it to happen. The Hill reports:

“They have shown nothing but weakness and appeasement in the face of those attacks. This is something I hope and believe will change with the new administration,” he said.

While it’s clear Cruz believes there are Russian fingerprints on the digital attacks of late, he stopped short of saying the attacks directly influenced the election to benefit Trump over his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

“I think that there’s no evidence whatsoever that Russia’s efforts against us, which have been longstanding, did anything to affect the campaign,” Cruz said. “It’s frankly patently absurd. You can’t credibly argue that [WikiLeaks’] disclosures impacted the election, because most voters never heard it.”

However, according to YouGov, 40 percent of those polled said they’d heard “a lot” about Hillary Clinton’s campaign Chairman John Podesta’s email hack, which resulted in embarrassing campaign messages being posted and shared during the election. Another 41 percent said they had heard about the hack at least “a little.” Only 20 percent said they’d never heard of it.

A CIA report released in early December alleged that Russian hacking occurred with the intent of helping Trump gain an advantage in the 2016 election. The FBI, initially skeptical of the report, has since backed it. Trump has been vehement in his rejection of the idea, saying the very notion that Russia wanted to help him win is an attempt to delegitimatize his victory over Clinton.

At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the committee: “We stand actually more resolutely on the strength [that Moscow interfered to help Republican Donald Trump win] than we did on Oct. 7.”

“They’re partisan Democrats,” he said.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!You can add Al Sharpton’s name to the list of leading Democrats openly questioning the legitimacy of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration before it officially begins.

Sharpton, appearing on MSNBC Monday, declared that there’s “no question” that the electoral process that Trump won was not “legitimate.”

Sharpton’s reasoning? Russia, of course.

“I think that there’s no question that the process that elected him was not legitimate,” Sharpton claimed on “Meet the Press Daily.”

“When you look at the new evidence from the intelligence agencies that there was the influence from the Russians and involved in the public discourse at the time of the election, when you look at those that were expunged from being able to vote, clearly the process has serious questions about it,” he explained.

Talk of Trump not being “legitimate” climbed to a new level Sunday when Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he doesn’t think Trump is a “legitimate” president, citing Russian hacking allegations. During that same interview, Lewis also said that he wouldn’t be attending Trump’s inauguration Friday.

Lewis’ strong comments, and Trump’s response to them when he suggested that Lewis should worry about his district instead, were the talk of the weekend. And according to Sharpton, Lewis’ comments should not be taken lightly, given his work on civil rights.

“And to come from John Lewis, a man who was beaten on the bridge in Selma, Alabama, to get the Voting Rights Act that opened up the voting process to everyone, he has blood in this,” Sharpton said. “He has some injury in this that opened the voting process up. You should not take lightly his view at all.”

“Meet the Press Daily” guest host Peter Alexander tried to press Sharpton over his claims, saying that during the election last year, Democrats routinely lectured Trump and his supporters about accepting the results of the election — no matter what.

But Sharpton argued back that the things that have happened following the election, including the intelligence community’s conclusion about Russian state hackers attempting to undermine American democracy, are substantial enough to question the legitimacy of the election’s outcome.A 10-year-old boy recently diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition saw his Christmas wish come true, thanks to NFL star Cam Newton.

The Carolina Panthers quarterback paid a visit to Taylor Deckard at an Atlanta hospital Tuesday, WSOC-TV reported.

The boy, who is set to undergo surgery for advanced pulmonary hypertension, a life-threatening condition, excitedly greeted his football idol while sporting the athlete’s jersey from Newton’s alma mater, Auburn University.

“What’s going on, buddy? How are you doing?” Newton asked Deckard as he walked into his hospital room. The boy responded by hopping out of bed, wrapping his arms around the famous football player and refusing to let go.

Watch the boy’s tear-jerking reaction for yourself:According to President-elect Donald Trump and his aides, Trump is enjoying the transition process and relishing the opportunity to revamp the executive branch. However, Trump’s aides have indicated that Trump will soon be taking some time to engage in an activity he has genuinely come to love during the presidential campaign: A series of rallies with his supporters.

According to Yahoo News:

“We’re working on a victory tour now; it will happen in the next couple of weeks,” Gigicos told reporters at Trump Tower on Thursday, per the presidential transition pool report. Gigicos said Trump’s victory tour will start some time “after Thanksgiving.” He did not identify any of the places Trump plans to visit but said they would focus on “the swing states we flipped over” and other places where Trump scored wins on Election Day last week.

One potential complication in Trump’s victory tour is the Trump University fraud case, which is still scheduled for trial the week after Thanksgiving. Trump’s attorneys have asked the San Diego court that is holding the trial to postpone the trial until after Trump’s inauguration on January 20th, arguing that Trump does not have enough time during transition to hold the trial.

Trump’s attorneys have a hearing on this motion on Friday the leak of Trump’s planned victory tour will likely not amuse Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who himself has become the subject of unwelcome attention after being attacked by Trump on the campaign trail. If Judge Curiel denies the motion to postpone the trial, then the trial would almost definitely conflict with any planned victory tour by Trump.Ninety-two days after the election and the Democrats literally can’t function anymore.

Tomi explains how Democrats, Hollywood elite and snowflakes are still losing their minds over President Trump. She states how at first some vowed to leave the country but didn’t follow through. They’ve gone on for so long now, that the Democrats don’t even know who they’re targeting anymore.

Tomi gives an example of Nancy Pelosi’s recent speech erroneously exclaiming how there’s nothing she can work with “President Bush” on.

Tomi proceeds to compare the leftists to a malfunctioning Furby toy she had as a child, which short-circuited in its last few months of life and didn’t do anything productive.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Barack Obama, in one of his final interviews as president, claimed recently that he was the first modern president without a “major” scandal during his tenure in the White House.

Obama made the comments in an interview with Steve Kroft on CBS “60 Minutes” that is set to air Sunday.

When pressed by Kroft whether or not Obama’s administration changed Washington, Obama alleged that he was able to change the things that were in his control by being the first modern presidential administration to be free of any major scandals.

“I changed those things that were in my direct control,” Obama said.

“And I mean, look, I’m proud of the fact with two weeks to go, we are probably the first administration in modern history that hasn’t had a major scandal in the White House,” he added. “In that sense, we changed some things.”

However, many, many Americans would disagree with Obama’s assumption. In fact, a large portion of Americans would likely argue that Obama has overseen a large number of scandals during his time in the White House.

Some of those scandals include: Operation Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the Veterans Affairs scandal, the IRS targeting conservative groups, the Department of Justice unlawfully seizing information of journalists, the NSA conducting mass surveillance on Americans, being a part of Hillary Clinton’s private email scandal, paying Iran a ransom for the release of several Americans, the Secret Service scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia, the EPA dumping waste in the Colorado River, just to name a few.

Indeed, Obama’s claim that his administration has been scandal-free isn’t a new talking point. In the closing months of the administration, at least one top administration official has publicly made the same claim.

“The president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn’t had a scandal and he hasn’t done something to embarrass himself,” Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett said earlier this month on CNN.

During his interview with “60 Minutes,” Obama went on to explain that he would have liked to accomplish more during his eight years as president, but said that it was Republicans who constantly obstructed his agenda.

“There were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren’t able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us,” Obama claimed.

However, many object this claim, given the fact that during Obama’s time as president, Congress was controlled solely by Republicans for only two of those years, 2015 and 2016. In fact, for the first two years of his presidency, Democrats had sole control of Congress and Obama was able to freely administer his agenda how he wanted.

Watch Obama’s interview excerpt with “60 Minutes” below:

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Democrats have been running wild in the wake of the Michael Flynn scandal. From jumping to conclusions that the Trump team are essentially agents for Russia to comparing this to Watergate and even calling Russia’s intrusion as an act of war on the level of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. The rhetoric is insane!

That said, there is complete legitimacy to have concerns regarding Flynn’s short-term activity as Trump’s National Security Advisor. Frankly, his communications with Russian officials should be investigation and ultimately the transcripts should be made public. However, this scandal is twofold, but Democrats are only acknowledging one side.

The one side Democrats are panicking about is the truth behind Flynn’s (and to some extent President Trump and his team’s) relationship with Russia. The other side involves the fact that Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador was illegally leaked to the press.

Individuals in the intelligence community have take it upon themselves to “resist” the Trump presidency. They’re Obama loyalists who have beef with their new boss. In this case, whistleblowers likely within in the NSA broke the law by leaking classified information and disclosing Flynn’s identity in the wiretapped conversations with the Russian ambassador (such a disclosure requires the president’s approval).

In other words, General Flynn was the target of a political assassination. That doesn’t excuse his lying to Vice President Mike Pence, which as of now is his only wrongdoing known to the public and further investigations will conclude whether Flynn was up to no good. But individuals in the intelligence community has weaponized their tools to undermine President Trump and to advance their political agenda. They’re acting as if the intelligence community is its own branch of government. It’s not. They a part of the executive branch and whether they like it or not, President Trump is at the top.

Democrats ought to be outraged by this. It wasn’t too long ago when they were outraged at Russia for hacking the DNC and John Podesta’s emails. They virtually ignored the content of those damning emails, similarly to how some Republicans are dismissing the content of Flynn’s conversations. Instead, they just want to shoot the messenger. Democrats and Republicans may be far different from one another, but one thing they have in common is that they’re all a bunch of hypocrites.

So while Flynn and the Trump administration should be held accountable if their actions were unlawful, so should the ones who actually broke the law, aka the leakers.IN JEOPARDY: GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE

Donald L. Scott

It is hard to believe that 154 years ago my grand-pappys were slaves in Missouri when Ole Abe Lincoln gave his address at Gettysburg. Back then he was wondering if Americans could live up to the proposition that all men are created equal and could live under a government of the people, by the people, and for the people that would not perish from the earth. With the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States that government is still here but wobbly.

During Abe’s time the proposition was contested by bloodshed and the people divided by all sorts of issues that never got completely resolved. But thanks to Ole Abe the proposition remained an elusive goal of the USA even though a minority of the people did not support the proposition or the Lincoln administration. The percentage of current Americans that support the proposition and will support the Trump administration to work towards a government of, by, and for the people is unclear.Then as now, that elusive goal depends on individuals identifying themselves as being first and foremost created equally in the sight of God. We all struggle with this.

Miraculously, the proposition has survived some challenging times mostly dealing with the question of individual rights under the US Constitution applying to non-white citizens.Thankfully, a few highly principled white men in the United States Government ensured that individual rights under the constitution applied to the freed slaves. Grandpa Henry Scott and Grandpa Charlie Dant along with millions of other enslaved Africans were freed from slavery under the thirteenth amendment, granted citizenship under the fourteenth, and granted the right to vote under the fifteenth amendments respectively.

The primacy of skin color continues to be the determining factor of identity as an American. Since before my grandpappy’s time, people of color have traditionally been and continue to be treated less than equal in the laws created by white America. Donald Trump’s racially insensitive comments and association with Steve Bannon, a supporter of white supremacy, strongly suggests that he will use the power of the presidency to insure a government of, by and for the ( white) people. This statement probably alarms most white Americans who in my experience and opinion are not white supremacist or racist. However, I believe most white Americans are apathetic to the unequal treatment of people of color because they would not be disadvantaged in a white supremacist government. The lack of racial diversity in Trump’s cabinet, white house staff, and in the republican party does not evoke concern to the majority of white America. A picture is worth a thousand words and the absence of people of color and women among governing officials speaks volumes to people of color about America’s commitment to a government of, by and for the people.

The Trump government and the republicans are a major threat to the continuance of a government of, by and for the people. We need independent thinkers and informed people to challenge Trump supporters on the need to preserve an inclusive government of, by, and for the American people.

Regardless of wether your ancestor was granted citizenship by the victorious Revolutionary War, Ellis Island or court house, or the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution, the continuation of a government of, by and for the people should be common ground for all Americans. Are you concerned enough to get involved? Forward this to your friends, elected representatives, and especially to those who believe Trump’s various conflicting messages are for all Americans. Please use your credibility to promote the common good of all Americans! Thanks.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!We’ve now seen the end of the struggle to keep President-elect Donald Trump from attaining office, and it ended to the sound of laughter.

House Democrats Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), and Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) stood multiple times in an attempt to challenge the certification of the Electoral College vote, only to have Vice President Joe Biden put an end to it.

The moment will live in infamy however when Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) attempted to put forth debate about long lines outside voting locations in order to delegitimize 16 electoral college votes from Georgia.

“Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the state of Georgia on the ground that the electoral votes were not-” began Jayapal, who was suddenly cut short by Biden banging a gavel.

“No debate,” said Biden, who went on to explain that objections had to be signed by both a member of the House, and a senator.

Jayapal attempted to debate again, only to once again be stopped dead by Biden’s gavel. “There is no debate,” he said again. “If there’s not signed by a senator, then the objection cannot be entertained.” Only then did Jayapal admit that there was no senator’s signature on her objection.

“It is over,” said Biden.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, sitting just behind Biden erupted into laughter, followed by laughs and applause by the Republican side. With Biden’s gavel, and Ryan’s laugh, the government has officially acknowledged that Donald Trump will be President of the United States.Glenn Beck has been enjoying the unseasonably warm winter weather in Texas so much that he was struck by an urge to plant some wisteria on his property. In researching the plant, Glenn discovered that it can take over your yard if left untended, choking out other plants.

He realizes that the American system of government exhibits similar traits; without constant vigilance, excessive government power can run rampant, with disastrous consequences.

TheBlaze has previously reported that the videos in Live Action’s “Abortion Corporation” series depict Planned Parenthood staffers telling undercover investigators that they cannot offer prenatal care or ultrasounds to women who want to continue with their pregnancies. The videos also feature former employees of the nation’s largest abortion provider saying that Planned Parenthood imposes abortion quotas on its clinics and offers staff incentives such as pizza parties for meeting those quotas.

Live Action’s first “Abortion Corporation” video has been viewed on Facebook over 17 million times:

According to the Media Research Center, despite the shocking allegations detailed in the videos and the millions of views they have acquired on social media, none of the three major broadcast networks have mentioned them once.

The videos were released after House Republicans indicated that they will redirect federal funds granted to Planned Parenthood to community health centers, a long-held goal of pro-life activists. Planned Parenthood has been accused of making fraudulent Medicaid claims and violating health codes in addition to trafficking aborted fetal body parts, allegations it has denied.

Lila Rose, the founder and president of Live Action, has said that the videos are evidence it is time for lawmakers to finally act on reallocating the funds.

“When lawmakers watch these videos, they should be deeply concerned at the treatment of women at Planned Parenthood,” Rose said in a statement accompanying the release of her organization’s most recent video. “It’s time to redirect Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding to more worthy local health clinics that aren’t in the abortion business but that instead provide holistic health care to women.”

Mary Alice Carter, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, said in a recent interview with the New York Times that her organization has a history of being targeted by selectively edited videos.

“This is obviously part of a continued campaign to try to discredit us even though investigation after investigation found no wrongdoing in any of our health centers,” Carter said.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Both the Orlando nightclub massacre in June and the Nov. 8 presidential election have sparked a nationwide increase in interest for a LGBT gun rights group, the Pink Pistols confirmed Thursday.

Because the organization doesn’t collect membership dues or forms, it’s difficult to specifically nail down an exact tally of just how many people belong to the Pink Pistols, a spokeswoman for the group said Thursday. But since both the Pulse nightclub shooting that claimed the lives of 49 people and the election of Donald Trump, interest in the Pink Pistols has spiked on social media as well as in chapter growth.

Pink Pistols First Speaker Gwendolyn Patton told TheBlaze Thursday that some in the the LGBT community are concerned that a Trump administration will be unfriendly toward them.

“I personally don’t believe he’s given any indication that he’s unfriendly” to the community, Patton said. In fact, Trump has indicated that he “wants to defend us from people who wants to throw us off buildings or hang us from cranes,” she said, citing his response to the Orlando massacre.

Trump reiterated his call for a moratorium on Muslim immigrants in the wake of the shooting. The 29-year-old gunman declared his allegiance to the Islamic State while on the phone with the police during the attack.

Nevertheless, the Pink Pistols mission promotes an individual’s right “to defend themselves from harm,” and in the wake of the election, as the political tide turned from Democrat to Republican, interest in that right and the Pink Pistols on social media has increased.

But a better measurement of the group’s growing popularity is seen in its chapter growth since the nightclub shooting.

Aside from Facebook likes increasing from around 1,500 to well over 9,100, some 15 Pink Pistol chapters have started or been restarted nationwide — a nearly 50 percent increase, Patton told TheBlaze.

And in Atlanta, hundreds of people have expressed interest in joining the Pink Pistols at local gun ranges to train or practice, she said.

Following the shooting, the Pink Pistols urged Americans to focus on the motive of the killings, not what Omar Mateen used to murder and injure so many.

Patton said in June:According to one Washington Post writer, the election of President-elect Donald Trump was what many who failed to see him a viable candidate thought it might have been all along: a way for the GOP to pass an agenda they’ve been working on for years and just needed a president with an R by his name to make it happen.

Everything from rolling back financial sector regulations to cutting taxes, to repealing and replacing Obamacare has been on the wish list of congressional Republicans, writes Dave Wiegel. And now that Trump is set to be inaugurated in January, the GOP can finally implement their wide-ranging plan that has been “long in the making.”

When the 115th Congress begins this week, with Republicans firmly in charge of the House and Senate, much of that legislation will form the basis of the most ambitious conservative policy agenda since the 1920s. And rather than a Democratic president standing in the way, a soon-to-be-inaugurated Donald Trump seems ready to sign much of it into law.

Weigel quotes American for Tax Reform’s Grover Norquist in 2012 as he “described the ideal president as ‘a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen’ and ‘sign the legislation that has already been prepared.'” Trump certainly meets that criteria. And with a Republican in the White House and both chambers of Congress securely in the GOP’s hands, the Republicans are claiming a mandate to pass all of the legislation they have been quietly and diligently working on through most of President Barack Obama’s tenure.

The Republicans, say Weigel, plan on using several methods at their disposal since they control Congress and the White House, most notably the budget reconciliation process (requiring only a 51-vote majority rather than a filibuster-proof 60 votes) and the Congressional Review Act (allowing Congress to cast a simple majority vote of disapproval for any regulation).

The irony, as Democrats realized after the election, was that congressional Republicans were poised to have more influence over the national agenda in 2017 than congressional Democrats did after the 2008 election that put Obama in the White House with his party in control on Capitol Hill. While the Democratic majority in 2009 was larger than the GOP advantage this year, the Democrats were hamstrung in ways they came to regret.

The entire piece is worth a read. If the voters really were serious about electing Donald Trump as an agent of change, they are certainly about to get what they wanted.MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski called out Democrats Thursday, saying she hopes they will “get a leader some day.”

Brzezinski and Time Editor Nancy Gibbs were discussing the fact that most of the candidates running to become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee didn’t even attend the nationwide left-wing Women’s March the day after President Donald Trump was inaugurated.

“Just give me three names. Who are the leaders that emerged out of these marches?” Brzezinski asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

Gibbs noted that five out of the six people currently running for DNC chair weren’t even at the marches that were held Saturday in cities across the country.

“They were out of town at a fundraiser,” she said.

Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison and former Obama Labor Secretary Thomas Perez are all in the running to head the DNC, according to Prospect.org. Only Buttigieg attended any of the Women’s Marches, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

Brzezinski was stunned by the candidates’ absence.

“Wow, at a fundraiser,” the morning show co-host groaned. “I just hit this against my head three times,” Brzezinski said, holding up a newspaper.

Moments later, Brzezinski ended the segment by saying that she hopes the Democrats “get a leader someday.”

Since their stunning Nov. 8 upset, Democrats have been in disarray trying to figure out the direction their party should take. Some congressional and senate Democrats have advocated for new, younger leadership, but members of the establishment have refused to step down, even amid accusations that they have fallen out of touch with the average voter.

Ryan Jessen thought he was having a bad migraine episode, but doctors concluded he suffered a brain hemorrhage. Although his family was still processing the tragic news, they knew there was one member of Jessen’s family who deserved to have some kind of closure: his dog Molly.

His sister, Michelle Jessen, posted a video on Facebook before life support was turned off and included in the caption, “Rideout Memorial Hospital did the sweetest thing for us and allowed us to bring my brother’s dog in to ‘say goodbye’ so she’d know why her human never came home.”

She added, “If you knew my brother, he really loved his sweet dog.” Jessen also confirmed that their family will be keeping the dog.



Ryan Jessen’s heart was donated to a 17-year-old boy whose birthday is on Christmas day.President-elect Donald Trump’s statements on the alleged negotiability of the United States’ “One China” policy has led Chinese government leaders to threaten to “take off the gloves.”

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal posted Friday, Trump hinted that he wasn’t willing to commit to the “One China” policy — which treats Taiwan, a nation that claims independence from Beijing, as part of China — until he could assess whether or not China was a currency manipulator. During the 2016 campaign, Trump threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. if he determined they were actively attempting to manipulate the value of currency.

His statements to the Journal on the “One China” policy prompted concern from some Chinese leadership who issued a strongly-worded retort Sunday on the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs agency website, Bloomberg reported:

“The One-China principle, which is the political foundation of the China-U.S. relations, is non-negotiable,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement on the agency’s website. “In order to avoid disruption to the sound and steady development of the China-U.S. relations and bilateral cooperation in key areas, we urge relevant parties in the U.S. to fully recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan question, approach Taiwan-related issues with prudence, and honor the commitment made by all previous U.S. administrations of both parties on adhering to the one-China policy,” Kang said in the statement.

Trump has made past statements indicating that he questions the United States’ approach to China, particularly the policy of recognizing only Beijing and not the government in Taiwan. He has also been critical of a perceived failure by China to assert pressure on North Korea over their increasing nuclear presence.

In early December, Trump had a carefully orchestrated phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. It was reportedly a friendly diplomatic call that incensed Chinese leaders at the time but that former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said sent the message that “the president of the United States [will] talk to whomever he wants if he thinks it’s in the interest of the United States, and nobody in Beijing gets to dictate who we talk to.”

English-language newspaper The China Daily, associated closely with the Chinese government’s press office, published an editorial Monday suggesting Trump was “playing with fire” in some of his rhetoric:

If Trump is determined to use this gambit in taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves.

Also according to the Wall Street Journal, Beijing is reportedly also concerned about a potential trade war and about Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson’s suggestion Chinese access to artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea be blocked if they continue to aggressively claim that area of open water as their own.President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday that the U.S. needs to up its game when it comes to the country’s nuclear defense capabilities — a call that resulted in liberals across the country collectively losing their minds.

“The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,” Trump tweeted.

While you might think of making the U.S. better able to respond — if, God forbid, there ever was a nuclear threat— as a positive step forward for the safety of the American people, a number of left-leaning media outlets went into all-out panic mode over the president-elect’s proposal.

You guys are acting like this is the end of the world! It's not at all. The end of civilization? Maybe. https://t.co/C0qomWo65E — Don Ventura (@donventura) December 23, 2016

The Washington Post on Thursday evening only added to the hysteria by tying Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and suggesting that the president-elect is trying to “revive the nuclear arms race.”

“The language echoes old Cold War rhetoric: Our missiles must be able to serve as a deterrent to usage, by existing as a threat to enemies,” an article in the newspaper, under the headline “Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin agree: Let’s revive the nuclear arms race,” read.

But it’s important to point out that nowhere did Trump suggest in any way using nuclear weapons. The president-elect was simply voicing his support for developing nuclear defense capabilities, given the nuclear program that other countries, like Iran and North Korea, have recently shown more interest in developing.

The Obama administration’s Iran Deal was intended to address such concerns, but Trump iterated throughout the presidential campaign that he would “rip up” the deal. Perhaps Thursday’s tweet is the country’s first look at how Trump plans to govern from a position of strength — not weakness.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reiterated his intention to block President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick, indicating on “State of the Union” Sunday he’d rather leave the 9th seat — formerly occupied by the late Antonin Scalia — open if “the nominee is not bipartisan and mainstream.”

The seat has been open since Scalia’s death last February. Former President Barack Obama tried to fill the seat on his way out the door with appeals court judge Merrick Garland, but the Senate refused to consider Garland and declined to vote on his nomination.

Since that time, Senate Democrats have been seething over the slight and have vowed to block any Trump pick.

Meanwhile, liberal groups are gearing up for a fight and already calling Trump’s list of 20 potential nominees “very extreme.”

More from Reuters:

“We’re hearing from Senate Democrats and parallel concern among outside groups that this is going to be a major fight,” said Marge Baker, [Executive Vice President of People For the American Way]. “We’ll be arguing that Democrats use every means at their disposal to defeat the nominee. This is going to be ‘all hands on deck,’ using all means at our disposal.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said it is hard for him to imagine Trump picking a nominee who Democrats could support, and said he would “absolutely” fight to keep the seat vacant rather than let the Senate confirm a Trump nominee deemed to be outside the mainstream. “We are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice,” Schumer told MSNBC on Jan. 3, adding that if the Republicans “don’t appoint someone who’s really good, we’re going to oppose them tooth and nail.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been trading barbs since early December when Schumer first began asserting his desire to keep the seat open rather than confirm a Trump SCOTUS pick Democrats considered extreme.

“Apparently, there’s yet a new standard which is to not confirm a Supreme Court nominee at all,” McConnell told reporters Wednesday at the GOP leadership’s weekly news conference. “I think that’s something the American people simply will not tolerate.”

Senate Democrats could actually succeed in holding up Trump’s pick indefinitely. A 60 vote majority is required in the Senate to get past the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees. There are 52 Republican senators, who must all vote for Trump’s pick plus eight Democrat senators. McConnell could also use his position as Majority Leader to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster, like former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R-Nev.) did in the past.

Republicans have some history with the latter approach, complaining in 2013 that Senate Democrats, then in the majority, had violated their rights by voting to ban the filibuster for executive branch and judicial nominees beyond the Supreme Court.

Trump has indicated he thinks he knows who his pick is likely to be, leading some to speculate that he may choose either Judge William Pryor, an Alabama-based judge on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, or Diane Sykes, a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and former justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.United States Marine Sgt. Michael Eckert from Winter Park, Florida has a talent that many men would envy. For one, he’s competed in the American Ninja Warrior competition he currently holds the world record for most pull-ups in one minute, which he set at 50 while stationed in Iwakuni Japan.

But this talent on the pull-up bar goes beyond being able to do many of them quickly. Eckert’s strength is such that what he can do is seemingly defy gravity with the use of God knows how many muscles throughout his body. The Marine can make it seem as if he’s holding onto the bar and walk upward through the air. He can hold onto the bars and seemingly slide himself back in forth as if he was on wheels on the ground.

He can even fling himself into the rafters from the pull-up position like Ezio Auditore.

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Hollywood A-lister Mark Wahlberg sat down recently with Task and Purpose, a website geared toward American veterans. Having previously starred in the critically acclaimed “Lone Survivor” in 2013 and headlining the upcoming movie about the Boston Marathon bombing, “Patriots Day,” Mark Wahlberg has not shied away from drawing attention to political events.

When Wahlberg spoke with Task and Purpose during a luncheon last week, he was asked about all the actors and Hollywood celebrities who were quick to speak out against President-elect Donald Trump.

Wahlberg said, “A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn’t.”

“A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble. They’re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family,” Wahlberg continued.

He added, “Me, I’m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it’s afforded me, I also understand what it’s like not to have all that.”

Wahlberg also touched on the country’s attitude toward police, saying, “Look, when I was doing the wrong thing, I certainly didn’t like the police. But I like the relationship that I have with them now. I also know that I’m doing the right thing.”

“Patriots Day” centers around a fictional character, Sergeant Tommy Saunders, a Boston police officer who works the finish line of the Boston Marathon and has to deal with the aftermath of the 2013 terrorist bombing, which killed four people. It opens in theaters December 21 nationwide

When speaking about his upcoming film and the heroism of law enforcement officers, Wahlberg said, “The overall purpose of police and military is protect us. It’s an amazing thing, and every chance I get I want to thank them for their service.”Following last summer’s terrorist massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, members of the LGBTQ community recognized the importance of situational awareness and proper self-defense.

Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski own a Phoenix-based stationary company that crafts wedding invitations, among other things. But they recently refused to create invitations for a same-sex wedding, citing a contradiction with their religious beliefs.

Now they’re being accused of violating a Phoenix ordinance that protects gay people from discrimination. The ordinance also prohibits the business owners from informing customers and the public why they can only create art consistent with their Christian beliefs about marriage.

According to Charisma News, the business owners face a fine of up to $2,500, in addition to six months imprisonment for holding to their Christian beliefs.

They’re being represented by a religious-based law firm, the Alliance Defending Freedom. ADF attorney Jonathan Scruggs told the Charisma News:

We fully expect to have a hearing in the next few weeks on our motion for preliminary injunction and to have the Arizona superior court grant our motion and vindicate the free speech and religious liberty rights of our clients. No American, including artists, should have the government force them to create art against their artistic and religious beliefs.

In addition, another attorney representing the business owners, Kristen Waggoner, told Fox News last week that Americans don’t give up their constitutionally-protected rights in order to make a living and neither should artists.

“We don’t force artists to create artistic expression under threat of jail time,” she argued.

Many Americans, especially Christians, would argue that their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion is increasingly being encroached upon, as more continue to be persecuted for believing that same-sex marriage is wrong and outside of God’s design.

Most famously, cake bakers Aaron and Melissa Klein had their business effectively shut down by the state of Oregon and were issued a fine of more than $135,000 after they refused to bake a gay couple a wedding cake in 2013.A recent viral video has surfaced of a police officer standing over a teenager who had reportedly gotten caught smoking weed.

Instead of taking the teen to jail, this police officer decided that it would be better if the kid was punished right then and there, and instead gave the teen a choice. His options were to either do 200 pushups, or get in the patrol car and head down to the station.

Naturally, the teen chose the pushups. As luck would have it, a woman was standing nearby with her phone, and captured the event on video so she could show her son. As it turns out, she showed a lot more than that, and now the whole world can see it.

While some may disagree with the police officer’s choice of not taking the teen in, pushes have been made in states such as Texas to minimize penalties to those with non-violent drug offenses. Oftentimes, entire lives can be destroyed due to mandatory minimum prison sentences of five years for something like drug possession.

Hopefully, this teen will count his lucky stars, and not brush off his second chance at a better life given to him by the officer.During President Barack Obama’s “exit interview” podcast with his former advisor David Axelrod, Obama mentioned that he felt the Democrats lost the election in part because the media just wasn’t effectively communicating all the ways rural America has prospered under Obama’s presidency.

“We — we devoted more attention, more focus, put more resources into rural America than has — has been the case probably for the last two, three decades,” Obama said on “The Axe Files” podcast.

“And — and it paid great dividends, but you just wouldn’t know that, that’s not something that you would see on the nightly news,” he told Axelrod.

Obama also purported that the Democratic party had not done a good enough job using emotional appeal as opposed to relying on the facts to make their case.

“And so we’ve got to figure out how do we show people and communicate in a way that is visceral and — and makes an emotional connection as opposed to just the facts,” he continued, making a reference to the issue of fake news, “because the facts are all in dispute these days.”

Obama also claimed that although Trump won rural American three-to-one, that his own policies actually helped them, they just didn’t realize it.

“Look, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters,” Obama told Axelrod, referring to an article posted on Vox claiming that a large number of Kentuckians who voted for Trump were utilizing Obamacare.

Obama failed to mention the ever-rising insurance premiums and the increasing number of Americans forced to purchase insurance from government insurance exchanges since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act .

“There are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn’t vote for Hillary, didn’t vote for me, but are being helped by this,” Obama said.

He told Axelrod that another problem the Democrats had connecting with rural Americans was that they weren’t “on the ground communicating” that they are “bleeding for these communities.”

Obama again reinforced his idea that what his party lacked was an emotional connection to rural America, and focusing on that connection instead of depending on media to communicate their message effectively.

“And there’s an emotional connection, and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there and — and that means organizing, that means caring about state parties, it means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day,” he said in closing.Community Rules

The hot toddy, a mixture of hot water, lemon juice, honey and whiskey, has been a staple of homespun cold remedies in Southeastern U.S. since the Scots-Irish settled the Appalachian region and brought their recipes for hot whiskey with them. Southern grannies have been mixing the brew to ease a sore throat or loosen congestion ever since — although there are certainly versions in other parts of the U.S., and even up into Canada.

Now a writer for Mic.com has examined the evidence and deconstructed the health benefits of each ingredient in a hot toddy and come away with a veritable recommendation that a hot toddy is preferable over traditional cold medicine to treat symptoms associated with the common cold.

From the pain-reducing qualities of whiskey — “It’s why many over the counter medications contain small amounts of booze.” — and the mucus-reducing miracle of lemon juice and hot water, to the throat soothing tendencies of honey, the hot toddy has it all:

It’s not just an old wives’ tale that a jigger of alcohol can help people suffering from sniffles — science confirms that the ingredients in hot toddies really can help to alleviate sore throats and stuffy noses.

Of course it’s a good idea to remember that, as with anything involving alcohol, moderation is key. But the cost of the common cold, according to WedMD is about $40 billion a year, and the hot toddy home remedy does give the popular over-the-counter cold helpers a run for their money:

For decades people have used the hot toddy as a natural remedy for easing all those aches and pains that are associated with the common cold, and for the most part, it was just assumed that it was one of those natural remedies, like chicken soup, that works because your brain thinks it works, not because there is actual science behind it. But as it turns out, a hot toddy is actually pretty great, from a scientific perspective, at soothing your cold.

The evidence also suggests that perhaps the best cure for the common cold is plenty of rest. The alcohol in a hot toddy likely helps facilitate that, too.Frequent guest Riaz Patel explains why some of his friendships have soured since he began appearing on Glenn Beck’s show and provides advice on repairing rifts with our political opposites.

He laid out his response to the NFL in a tweet Saturday.

NFL decision makers also benched Tom Brady last season. It ended with NFL handing the Super Bowl trophy to Brady. https://t.co/Qg06jT9RDp — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) February 11, 2017

Abbot seems to compare the plight of Texas to that of Patriots’ quarterback Tom Brady, whom the league punished by banning for four games of the season. The team won the Superbowl despite the setback, and Abbott clearly means to challenge the punishment of the league on Texas and win anyway, just like Brady.

League spokesman Brian McCarthy made a statement issuing the threat to Texas in response to an email. “If a proposal that is discriminatory or inconsistent with our values were to become law there,” he wrote, “that would certainly be a factor considered when thinking about awarding future events.”

He was referring to a bill filed last month in Texas that would set guidelines for who can use what gender-designated bathroom.

Under the Texas bill, people would be required to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. It’s similar to a North Carolina law that prompted the NCAA to pull seven championship events from that state last year and is backed by Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a powerful figure in the state who had cited the Houston Super Bowl as proof that big events will stick around.

This isn’t the first time the NFL has used its clout to push pro-transgender policies. In 2015, the league implied that a similar bill in Georgia might cause them to skip over Atlanta for hosting Superbowls. Their Republican Governor later vetoed the bill.

Abbot appeared to throw down the gauntlet to the NFL in the tweet which defied the characterization of his position in the CBS article he posted.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has been quieter on the proposal and, noticeably, never mentioned bathrooms while laying out his legislative agenda last month.

Governor Abbott has been embroiled in another controversy since coming out against “sanctuary city” policies that harbor illegal aliens by not responding to federal requests to aid in detaining them. Officials of some Texas cities, including Sheriff Sally Hernandez of Travis County, have tried to fight back, precipitating a Texas bill to ban those policies in Texas cities that persist in abetting illegal immigration.

The Houston Texans made it to the second round of the playoffs and lost 16 to 34 to the Patriots and their quarterback, Tom Brady.Managing Editor of TheBlaze.com Leon Wolf and VP at the Center for Security Policy Jim Hanson join Dana Loesch to have a rational conversation from different points of views on the current state of the leaks coming from the intelligence community.

Leon states that if intelligence officials believe one of the president’s key advisers has been compromised by the Russians, it has been brought to the president’s attention and he does nothing about it, then the officials must act to expose this impropriety.

Now the social media giant is refusing to answer questions about how they could have left the video up for so long before recognizing it and removing it from the site.

British newspaper The Guardian attempted to get answers from someone at Mark Zuckerberg’s media giant recntly, but to no avail. They asked questions related to how the video could have been left up for so long, drawn so much attention and garnered a huge number of horrified comments without Facebook being alerted to the nature of the video.

“I find it really hard to believe that not enough people reported it,” Reem Suleiman of SumOfUs, a civil rights group that’s been campaigning for Facebook to be more transparent about its content takedown process, told The Guardian.

“I don’t want to speculate here, but we’ve had issues ourselves trying to get certain things taken down in the past,” she added.

Facebook did release a statement in which they condemned the video and pointed to its community standards for content removal and reporting.

“We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason. In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed,” the statement read.

The Guardian claims that the incident raises further claims about the responsibility of Facebook and other media giants to police their content, something Facebook in particular was caught up in during the recent U.S. election and the “fake news” that was alleged to have influenced it.

Facebook isn’t always so slow to remove or curate their content. They were the subject of criticism by conservative groups in May because they were accused of suppressing conservative stories from their “trending stories” section. They ultimately invited conservatives to visit their compound in Menlo Park, Calif., to smooth relations.

The company announced a plan after the 2016 election to use fact-checkers to stop the spread of erroneous content on their site.

Now, in light of the brutal torture video in which four people have been arrested and charged with hate crimes, it looks like they’ll have to make some changes to how they deal with news that is very, very real.Community Rules

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!After watching a Donald Trump campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in October, Vice President Joe Biden says that was the moment he realized Donald Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton in November’s election.

That’s what the vice president told the Los Angeles Times in a recent interview.

“Son of a gun. We may lose this election,” Biden told the Times, recounting his reaction after watching the rally from his White House office.

“They’re all the people I grew up with. They’re their kids. And they’re not racist. They’re not sexist. But we didn’t talk to them,” the vice president added.

Reflecting on Trump’s connection with Americans throughout his campaign, and during that Pennsylvania rally in October, Biden attempted to diagnose Democrats’ inability to connect with middle America.

“My dad used to have an expression. He said, ‘I don’t expect the government to solve my problems. But I expect them to understand it,” Biden said, adding that he doesn’t believe Democrats are positioning themselves to “understand” the struggles of “an awful lot of people.”

“I was trying to be as tactful as I could in making it clear that I thought we constantly made a mistake of not speaking to the fears, aspirations, concerns of middle class people,” Biden went on to comment, explaining his central message during his 83 campaign stops for Clinton.

It was that message — one that connected with middle-class voters — that Biden wanted to bring to his own presidential campaign, he told the Times. However, Biden decided late last year not to run for the White House.Outspoken former basketball star Charles Barkley went off on an NBA player’s slavery accusation, calling it “just asinine and stupid.”

Draymond Green, a forward for the Golden State Warriors, said New York Knicks owner James Dolan enjoyed it when former Knicks’ star Charles Oakley intimidated opponents back in the day — but can’t take it when Oakley criticizes his former team now.

“You’re doing it for me, it’s all good,” Green said Wednesday on his “Dray Day” podcast, the Washington Post reported. “But now you’re doing it against me, or you’re speaking out against my organization, it’s not good anymore? That’s a slave mentality — slave master mentality. That’s ridiculous. It was all fine and dandy when he was laying people out, taking fines and all this stuff for your organization. But now all of a sudden when he says something that he feels, it’s a problem.”

But Barkley — not one to be shy about taking the black community to task or expressing his often-conservative views — took issue with Green’s analogy.

“That is just stupid,” Barkley said Thursday on Atlanta sports talk station 680 AM, the Post reported. “I don’t think you ever use basketball analogies to compare to slavery when guys are making $20 million, $30 million a year. I just think that’s just stupid.”

Barkley added that “the Knicks have been very disrespectful to Carmelo [Anthony]” — another of Green’s points, the paper reported — but “to compare guys making $20 million, $30 million to slaves is just asinine and stupid.”God had a hand in electing Donald Trump to the White House, Franklin Graham, son of famed evangelist Billy Graham, said on “Fox and Friends” Sunday.

Graham explained that the common theme he experienced during the 2016 election season — as he held prayer meetings in all 50 state capitals — is that Americans feel that their country is heading in the wrong direction and want intervention from God to turn things around.

He said that Americans are tired of the “secularist” federal government that has a “humanistic, atheist” agenda.

“They were praying that God would change this and put somebody in the White House that believed in God, and would listen to God’s voice,” Graham said.

And according to Graham, those prayers were answered last November.

“I believe — no question — that God’s hand was in it,” he said.

Still, Graham went on to explain that America is still in “great trouble,” citing the divisiveness that continues to plague Americans.

Graham also said that he hopes America can come together “as Americans” for Trump’s inauguration like the country has for past presidents, including President Barack Obama.

“Now, we need to help this nation move forward,” he said.

Watch his complete interview below:

Rebecca Friedrichs is an unsung hero who should be sung about a whole lot more. She is an Orange County public school teacher with 28 years of being an educator under her belt. She also, just last year, found herself facing off against one of the most powerful teacher’s unions in the United States, the California Teachers Association (CTA).

More amazingly, she used to be one of the union leaders.

Friedrichs tried to affect change from within the CTA — who were buying off politicians that restricted competition, and charging teachers absurd membership fees — that caused schools to stagnate. But Friedrichs soon came to realize that only the voters and the courts can break the hold that the union had over the state of California.

“Sadly, parents and educators no longer run our public schools because labor unions control way too much on our campuses today,” Friedrichs told TheBlaze. “I understand why labor unions focus on getting more for their members; that’s their business model, and getting more money and power for themselves is their value. Great teachers and parents don’t share the unions’ values or business model. We believe children should be first in our schools, and we believe educational excellence and safety should reign supreme.”

“Simply put,” she added, “parents know what’s best for their children and their family circumstances. They should be able to choose the schools that fit their lifestyles and their children’s needs.”

And due to her battle, Friedrichs became something of an icon for school choice. This in turned grabbed the attention of the popular conservative site, Prager U.

Prager U is engaging in their own push to make school choice the norm in the United States, and with other organizations, created SchoolChoiceNow.com, which will release a video every quarter in 2017, discussing why school choice is the best way our children can get a worthwhile education.

Naturally, they chose Friedrichs to star in their first video discussing why good teachers support school choice, and how competition has been proven to work for schools, just like it works well for the free market.

“We support school choice because we believe that parents and students should be able to choose education options that best fit their needs. It’s not the government’s place to limit school options, and children should not be condemned to bad public schools because of the zip code they live in,” Prager U’s Director of Outreach Elisha Krauss told TheBlaze. “We are excited to partner with so many other pro-school choice organizations who speak for the majority of Americans, and we hope that our new video and our entire School Choice Now campaign in 2017 shows millions of more Americans why school choice can fix America’s education system.”

This is a message Friedrichs wants to get across very clearly. Having had years of experience with children, she’s gotten a pretty good idea about how they learn and grow. As she told us, the way public schools treat kids nowadays you would think they view the children as defective, and in need of drugging to make them “normal.”

“I believe our current public education system is designed for those who can sit still and listen all day,” Friedrichs told TheBlaze. “Many boys — and some girls — do not fit this category, so we often drug them and call them “deficit,” and “disorder.” I’ve had hundreds of these little boys in my classes throughout my career — and one of them grew in my womb — and none of them seemed “deficit,” or “disorder” to me.”

“They were just wiggly little boys who would learn a whole lot better if we could provide a more active learning environment and stop emasculating them,” she continued. “My heart breaks that we label so many boys in such negative terms; especially since so many of them are gifted. This is just one example of why school choice is the right choice. Children aren’t carbon copies of one another, so why should they all attend schools designed to serve only one brand of kid?”

With Friedrichs and Prager U teaming up, both are confident that school choice across the nation is an achievable goal.

“Prager U has a huge national following with a large percentage under 35 years old. As a public school educator and parent of children who attended public schools, I’m well acquainted with a lot of the indoctrination going on in our schools today – talk about fake news!” Friedrichs told us. “Knowing the Prager U messages are reaching the younger generations gives me hope many will learn the Judeo-Christian values our great country was founded upon, so we can restore truth and goodness in our culture.”

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!CNN host Don Lemon hosted a panel discussion Wednesday night about President Donald Trump’s remarks at a Black History Month event, and the conversation took a turn for the worse when one of the panelists accused Trump of not caring about black Americans.

During a breakfast to mark Black History Month in February, Trump made a comment about the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who died in 1895. “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice,” Trump said Wednesday. Some critics claimed that Trump was insinuating that Douglass was still alive.

Discussing the event and Trump’s remarks, the panelists went back and forth over whether Trump or his Press Secretary Sean Spicer even knew who Frederick Douglass was. CNN commentator and former Bernie Sanders campaign press secretary Symone Sanders insisted Trump didn’t know much about black history or Douglass, while fellow panelist CNN political commentator Paris Dennard argued that Trump’s remarks were being taken out of context.

“Play the whole tape for your audience to see and I think it’ll speak for itself. I think you’re taking what he said out of context, he was by no means talking as if Frederick Douglass was alive and well today,” Dennard said. “I was in the room and I understand what he was saying and there is a difference.”

When Sanders interjected to say she would not have gone to the White House even if she was invited because she doesn’t believe Trump has a genuine interest in building relationships with the African-American community. “He’s only given us rhetoric, he hasn’t given us any action,” Sanders said.

Unleashing a tirade about what she believes to be Trump’s negative actions toward the black community, Sanders brought up Trump’s nomination of Betsy DeVos, along with his nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and said Sessions didn’t believe in protecting civil rights for black people.

“Donald Trump is disingenuous and I’m going to take a page out of Kanye West’s book — Donald Trump doesn’t care about black people, and until he shows me otherwise, that’s where I am,” Sanders remarked.

“That’s unfortunate for you — and for the listeners to hear that type of remark about the President of the United States,” Dennard responded.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Although Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a convicted late-term abortionist, has been called America’s “most prolific serial killer,” he arguably remains almost as unknown as the infants he killed, the authors of a new book about the doctor contend.

In an interview with TheBlaze, Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer, the producers of the movie “Gosnell,” said that they wrote the book, “Gosnell: The Untold Story of America’s Most Prolific Serial Killer,” in order to share details of the case that couldn’t be included in the film. The book explores the life and crimes of the convicted killer, as well as the trial that put him behind bars.

In 2013, Gosnell was convicted of performing abortions beyond Pennsylvania’s 24-week limit, three counts of first-degree murder for killing babies born alive and the involuntary manslaughter of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, a refugee who fled war-torn Bhutan.

Gosnell would sever the spinal cords of infants who were born alive with scissors in a process he called “snipping.”

The book details the conditions of Gosnell’s West Philadelphia clinic, dubbed a “house of horrors” by prosecutors, where filthy conditions, unsanitized equipment and unqualified staff were the norm. McElhinney likened the clinic to “the darkest circle of hell.”

Both authors pointed to the death of one of Gosnell’s infant victims — known in court documents as “Baby Boy A” — as one of the most disturbing elements of the case.

“I think Baby Boy A, his short life,” McAleer said. “They all fought for life, and they all lived and they all breathed.”

McAleer added that the evidence surrounding the infant’s death was key to convicting Gosnell.

“I get hope from that, that their short lives are going to have such an effect on the world,” he said. “They may have lived short lives, but their influence will be felt for generations to come.”

The book also sheds light on what the authors characterize as government bureaucracy run amok in Pennsylvania. Despite multiple reports of unsafe and unsanitary conditions to the state’s health department over a period of several years, Gosnell’s clinic continued its operations. Gosnell’s methods were discovered only when narcotics detective James Wood suspected the doctor of running a pill mill out of his clinic.

“If ever there was a case for the conservative case of small government, this is it,” McElhinney said. “This shows you what large bureaucracies manage to achieve. Only a massive government could be as uncaring, I feel.”

Despite the grisly facts of the case, which included finding the remains of aborted babies haphazardly stored in the clinic, the matter earned almost no attention from the mainstream media. That is, until columnist Kirsten Powers wrote a viral op-ed in USA Today condemning the media for turning a blind eye to the case.

“This is what journalism looks like, this is a journalist’s story,” McElhinney said. “People buy newspapers for stories like this. There is an interest in this, and it needs to be documented.”

McElhinney said she had trouble coming to terms with the horrific actions detailed in the courtroom during Gosnell’s trial and the lack of attention they garnered, and they enjoyed “naming names” in a chapter addressing the lack of media coverage. They also praise a small number of journalists and Twitter users for bringing light to the case.

Although the book has also been largely ignored by the media, less than a day after the book’s release on Tuesday, it was the No. 4 book sold on Amazon in the United States. On Thursday, it topped the website’s “Hot New Releases” chart.

McAleer said that although the book has gotten “no coverage from the mainstream media” the book is climbing the best-seller charts “thanks to the same people who got Trump elected.”

“This is how he got elected and this is how the media didn’t see it,” McAleer said. “It used to be that they are the gatekeepers and they aren’t anymore.”

The book also contains details of the authors’ visit with Gosnell in prison, poems the convicted killer wrote while incarcerated, as well as Bible verses that he believes justify his actions.

McElhinney said that prior to the Gosnell case, she was “neutral” on abortion — but that she got “a very swift education” on the subject during the case.

“I didn’t realize the reality of it,” she said.

McElhinney wrote in the book that the story of the case “can change hearts and minds; It has mine.”

McElhinney and McAleer are releasing the “Gosnell” film independently following a record-breaking crowdfunding campaign. They anticipate that it will be released this year.Tomi explains on her “Final Thoughts” that if you were out busting your back at work today and not aware, it was a day without immigrants. Tomi reveals that there was yet another protest today against border security, President Trump and the law.

Stores and restaurants remained closed nationwide or sold only limited food products to show support for immigrants and showcase how migrants are essential to the economy. Tomi deciphers the one word that is missing from the entire narrative being spun, and that word is “illegal.”

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!In an explosive claim reported by CNN, intelligence officials are claiming that the Trump campaign was involved with exchanges with the Russian government during the presidential election.

The two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. Sources tell CNN that these same allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians, mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year, prompted then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to send a letter to FBI Director Comey in October, in which he wrote, “It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government — a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.”

Trump and his surrogates had denied any kind of exchanges with the Russian government. In October, Trump said he knew nothing of Russians, and went so far as to suggest there wasn’t any hacking of emails at all. After the election, a Russian official admitted of the contact, but the Trump campaign denied all interactions. Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks claimed there was “no contact with Russian officials” before the election.

A recently released intelligence report provided the reasoning for the assessment by the U.S. intelligence community that Putin himself had ordered the cyber-attack, but it has been attacked by many for providing flimsy evidence because of the need to protect intel sources.Parents are criticizing school administrators at Highland Hills Middle School in Georgetown, Indiana, after a school-issued worksheet intentionally put a positive spin on the militant — and oftentimes violent — idea of Sharia law.

School teachers handed the worksheet out to seventh-graders at the middle school, which depicts a 20-year-old woman named Ahlima who says she feels “very fortunate” to live under Sharia law, which historically oppresses women and members of the LGBT community and encourages violence against those who stray from the strict religious code.

TheBlaze obtained a copy of the worksheet in question from concerned parents in the district, and some of the worksheet’s contents openly defend polygamy, female subjugation, and Sharia law. In one passage, Ahlima says that she knows that Westerners who oppose polygamy are wrong:

The sheet explained that Ahlima will “soon become a man’s second wife,” as a result of a marriage arranged by her parents, an arrangement with which she professed to be happy:

The worksheet also defended Sharia law’s strict dress codes for women:

The worksheet also flatly denied that women are oppressed under Sharia law:

Ahlima concluded her reflections in the worksheet by claiming that she was “lucky” to live under Sharia law:

Many parents spoke out against the lesson during a county school board meeting, expressing outrage at the school’s decision. “The way that the worksheet is left would be like describing how effective Hitler was at nationalizing Germany and creating patriotism but leaving out that he slaughtered 6 million Jews,” said Dean Hohl, one of the parents in attendance, according to the Courier-Journal. “I’m just not okay with my daughter – or any child that age – leaving class with the understanding that anything about Sharia law is okay.”

“That document by itself, it’s almost propaganda,” Jon Baker, another concerned parent, said. “If you read that, you would think everything’s wonderful in that world.”

The creator of the worksheet and president of the InspirEd Educators curriculum Sharon Coletti said the worksheet is far from an indoctrination attempt, but is instead supposed to help students independently identify stereotypes and developed the worksheet 20 years ago based on an interview she saw of a Muslim woman who voiced a positive outlook on Sharia law. “If I can shape something so that kids have to decide for themselves, once I get them involved in the situation, they never forget it,” she said.

She also told the Courier-Journal she has received death threats in the past for the controversial worksheet when it caused parental concerns in 2011 at a middle school in Georgia. Despite her defense of the worksheet, Coletti also said she will remove the lesson from the InspirEd Educators curriculum in light of the negative attention it has received.

Hohl told TheBlaze the school district informed him Monday it would no longer use the lesson in its teachings. He also said the school’s worksheet forced him to have a conversation with his daughter about the truth of Sharia law. “She was ignorant about it and thought all was ‘ok’ living under Sharia law…..until I explained honor killings, beatings, & rape. Then she realized the assignment left A LOT of the truth about Sharia law out of the text,” he told TheBlaze.

Sharia law, which is the same law that the Islamic State terrorist group abides by, states that anyone who does not adhere to the strict religious code should be physically punished, and oftentimes the punishment is death. According to the Washington Times, Muslim cleric Sheikh Khalid Yasin stated in a YouTube video, “God is very straightforward about this — not we Muslims, not subjective, the Sharia is very clear about it, the punishment for homosexuality, bestiality or anything like that is death.”

Another Islamic scholar, Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar, told fellow Muslims at the Husseini Islamic Center in Orlando in 2013 that gay people should be killed out of compassion. “Death is the sentence. We know. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about this. Death is the sentence,” he said. “We have to have that compassion for people. With homosexuals, it’s the same. Out of compassion, let’s get rid of them now.”Last week, TheBlaze reported that the state of California had seen an uptick in gun sales. It would appear that this trend continued to see spikes in sales.

After San Bernardino, California lawmakers were quick to use the tragedy in order to push further restrictions on firearms within the state. Among the six bills signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, is a law that requires semi-automatic rifles with “evil features” to be registered upon purchase.

Naturally, even in the Smurf-blue state of California, Americans are looking to get their firearms purchased before the laws kick in, and California starts keeping track of how they practice their Second Amendment right. Chris Ostrom who manages Pacific Outfitters, a gun store in California, has been sold out of many an accessory, or gun part for weeks.

The Press Democrat has more:

The new gun controls reclassified semiautomatic rifles that have what are called “evil features” as assault weapons, which have been banned in California since 1989. The features added to the prohibited list include a protruding or forward pistol grip, a thumbhole stock, a folding stock or a flash suppressor. The law was meant to address what’s often called the “bullet button” loophole developed as a workaround to an earlier ban of detachable magazines. The bullet button enables a shooter to use a bullet or small tool to depress a button to eject spent magazines. There’s a way gun owners can keep their so-called “evil features,” but it’s an unpopular one, according to Ostrom and others. California residents can register the assault weapon with the state, which costs $15. Ostrom said the gun cannot be sold or gifted and must be destroyed if a person no longer wishes to have it or when the owner dies.

There are ways around it, but they aren’t at all helpful.

The first method uses what’s called an AR Mag Lock, a fixed magazine lock-and-release kit that makes the bullet button inoperable and forces the shooter to partly disassemble the gun — by opening the receiver — to reload a magazine. Another option is to replace the pistol grip with a fixed stock, which so far has been the more popular option, said Ostrom. He outfitted his AR-10 with a fixed stock and uses it as a display in the store to show customers what to do. The change does impact comfort and accuracy, he said. “What the state calls an ‘evil feature’ is nothing more than ergonomics,” Ostrom said.

However, as seen during the Obama administration, whenever a leftist politician so much as looks askance in the general direction of a firearm, American citizens rush to purchase them. California is no different. Reports indicate that in the month of December alone, nearly 1 million firearms have been sold in California. Compare this to 700,000 guns sold in all of 2015.

The sale of semi-automatic rifles as also jumped, with 364,643 sold by December 9th.

California’s hike in gun purchases follows a national trend. Gun sales have hit record highs for reasons ranging from President Barack Obama’s negative view on them, to fears that failed Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would win.An Air Force dad surprised his kids by returning during the Atlanta Ballet’s performance of “The Nutcracker” Thursday evening.

According to WAGA-TV, Capt. Howard Church has been stationed in Saudi Arabia for the past nine months. When he and his wife discovered that he would be coming home for a visit earlier than expected — just in time for Christmas — they decided to surprise their four children.

“They’re used to seeing me gone all the time,” Church told WAGA prior to the reunion. “Can’t wait to see how surprised they are, when I step out there,” he said.

Before the performance, the Church family was invited on the stage, and the children cried when they saw their father join them.

“I was really surprised,” Austin Church told WAGA. “I really didn’t think he was going to be there.”

WAGA reports that Church has served in the Air Force for almost 19 years. He will spend just over two weeks at home before returning overseas.James Altucher is a successful entrepreneur, angel investor, chess master and prolific writer.

The video, now having been accrued hundreds of thousands of views, the school’s choir stands on stage, and out in front is 10 year old girl singing her heart out with altered lyrics to Leonard Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah.’ As she sings the verses that talk about the birth and importance of Christ, the rest of the children’s choir joins in behind her singing “Hallelujah.”

It’s nothing short of magical.

The little girl’s name is Kaylee Rodgers, from Donaghadee in Northern Ireland. She has autism, and ADHD, and according to the Independent, began singing in order to build her confidence at school.

“I just loved doing it,” she said.

The altered lyrics were originally devised by a Christian rock band called Cloverton in 2014, who had their video taken down on YouTube due to a copyright infringement claim by Sony. However, the lyrics are now being used to cover the song by the choir, and a good thing too.

Watch this amazing video below:Mike Rowe said a now-former fan slammed his scheduled appearance Tuesday evening at the 2017 SHOT Show State of the Industry Dinner in front of “a bunch of gun nuts.”

He said the fan, identified as Marla W., wrote the following:

I just read that you’re speaking at the SHOT show in Las Vegas this week. VERY disappointing. There are already too many guns in this country, and too much faux patriotism surrounding the second amendment. I can’t believe you’d risk your good name associating with a bunch of gun nuts. You’ve lost a fan.

The host of “Somebody’s Gotta Do It” — known for his friendly and thought-provoking replies to such letters on his Facebook page — responded to Marla with a pretty awesome perspective presented in an unconventional fashion.

Rather than launch into defense of guns and the Second Amendment, Rowe told a story.

He noted that he’d be visiting his friends at the SEAL Family Foundation at the SHOT Show, an outfit that helps SEALs’ loved ones and has a booth at the event. Rowe then described a recent team-building event with SEALs for his mikeroweWORKS staff arranged by a man he met through the SEAL Family Foundation — which began with skydiving.

But intensity only increased, Rowe wrote, as four SEALs “introduced us to 20,000 rounds of live ammunition, and an arsenal of firearms not currently available for purchase in the state of California.”

Rowe provided the details:

For the next few hours, the SEALs took my employees through an accelerated small arms training session. There was an emphasis on safety, obviously. Some of my people had never held a gun before, much less fired one. So there was some…trepidation. But after an hour of intense instruction, everyone got comfortable with the Glock 9mm. Then the AR-15. Then a variety of sniper rifles. We all got to shoot an M-1 from WWII, a Steyr from Austria, the Scar Heavy…even a Barrett 50 caliber. Fifty yards, a hundred yards, then two hundred yards. Their progress was impressive. Their enthusiasm was infectious. At 400 yards, my office manager was hitting a target the size of a pie plate. Unbelievable.

“Afterwards, we ate ribs and drank beer in a local bar with our instructors,” Rowe continued. “We also listened to war stories from Ramadi and Fallujah and a few places I hadn’t heard of, from people who wrote the book on teamwork. Fascinating. Eye-opening. Humbling.”

With that Rowe told Marla “how remarkable it is to see people who have never even held a gun go from uncomfortable, to tentative, to comfortable, to very comfortable, to empowered. One day Marla, I hope you’ll have the opportunity to experience something similar, and listen to the stories of people who use guns to protect us.”

Rowe concluded:

Obviously, you and I have a difference of opinion regarding the role of the Second Amendment in modern society. But thanks to the first amendment, we can express our differences in whatever way we prefer. We can criticize those with whom we disagree, or we can try to persuade them. We can make a case as to why we believe what we believe, or we can simply announce our disappointment to the world, as though our feelings alone are enough to justify our beliefs. As for you Marla — you can either stomp off in a cloud of righteous indignation, or you can accompany me to the SHOT Show as my guest, and see what all the fuss is about. Either way, it’s nice to have choices, don’t you think?

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Certainly, the impression that President-elect Donald Trump gives in public is that he is upset with prominent online news site BuzzFeed for publishing an alleged dossier full of salacious details that Russian intelligence was allegedly planning to use to compromise him. Furiously upset, even — going so far as to call them a “failing pile of garbage” in a defiant press conference Wednesday morning. And who knows, Trump’s anger might well be genuine; but he really ought to be thanking BuzzFeed for changing the course of this story in a way that has been very positive for him.

Rewind the clock to Tuesday afternoon and recall what Trump was facing. CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who enjoys one of the broadest bipartisan reputations for honesty of any person in the media, was on television, flanked by reporters Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez and Carl Bernstein. Tapper reported that CNN had developed credible information that U.S. intelligence officials had presented evidence to both Trump and outgoing President Barack Obama that Russian intelligence agents claimed to have compromising information about Trump “of both a personal and financial nature.” Further, the agents claimed that surrogates for the Trump campaign had regularly been in contact with Russian officials throughout 2016, directly contradicting Trump’s fierce denials of any such contact.

Tapper made clear that CNN would not be discussing the contents of the allegations. He stated that they had not been able to independently verify them and thus would not repeat what they were. He stated that no one knew if the claims allegedly made by Russian intelligence were true or not. All they knew was that this dossier was out there, and it had been handed to Trump and to Obama, with the message that the Russians were allegedly trying to use its contents to compromise Trump. Responsible reporting if in fact CNN did its due diligence on the report.

Then came BuzzFeed. They, in fact, had no such qualms about publishing the contents of the dossier itself. They emphasized that the material was both “unverified” and likely “unverifiable,” but laid out the claims in all their glory.

As the dust has settled, a general consensus has developed that CNN’s reporting should be distinguished from BuzzFeed’s and that CNN acted responsibly where BuzzFeed was reckless. It should be noted, BuzzFeed has its notable defenders today, including the Columbia Journalism Review, but most members of the media agree: What BuzzFeed did was worse than what CNN did (if you grant that CNN did anything wrong at all).

However, from Trump’s perspective, BuzzFeed’s reporting did him a huge favor. The reason for that is simple: The contents of the dossier were so obviously suspect that they called the veracity of the entire account into question. What reasonable intelligence official would have taken this transparent pulp to the president of the United States without a shred of verification to back it up? None would have, it was virtually obvious from the document’s face.

Imagine if BuzzFeed’s story had never been printed. CNN’s allegation that Russians had unspecified compromising information of both a “personal” and “financial” nature would have been left hanging in the air. And it would have been believable by a large number of people. Polls have shown that, after a brief post-election honeymoon period, Trump is unpopular again and the American public is increasingly uneasy about his public posture toward Russia — a vulnerability that Senate Democrats have mercilessly exploited during the first few days of confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet appointments.

“Donald Trump is in Russia’s pocket” is a damaging narrative for Democrats to build, because it fits what swing voters already suspect might be true about Trump, fairly or not. And the CNN report, by itself, would have fed into that narrative.

However, even an extreme Trump skeptic like myself could not believe the allegations in that dossier were presented to Obama and Trump as some sort of legitimate piece of intelligence. By the time I got to the unfortunate part of the document that briefly led the hashtag #PEEOTUS to trend on Twitter — a high point in the history of the Republic, to be sure — I said to myself, “This is so ridiculous that not even Alex Jones would present it to his audience as credible evidence.” As an editor, it took me less than two seconds to make the decision not to run any portion of the dossier.

BuzzFeed made a different choice. The ethics of that choice will likely be hotly debated for some time to come. Ultimately, of course, their readers — both actual and potential — will likely have the final say in whether it was the “right” call or not.

What I will say is, letting America see the too obviously fake dossier changed this story from another potentially damaging intelligence leak about Trump into the narrative that suits Trump best, at least with his base — the narrative in which Trump is the victim of an overreaching press that is bent on his destruction. In the span of one evening, BuzzFeed turned this story from a losing one into a winning one for Trump.

Trump is an astute enough student of human nature and public relations to understand that everyone who repeats allegations this fanciful without ironclad proof is demeaned thereby, whereas the victim of the allegations is elevated by the obvious desperation of his opponents. Let’s hope someone on his campaign sends the “failing pile of garbage” a nice fruit basket or something for their trouble. .Community Rules

The Algerian town of Ain Sefra, deep in the dry, hot Sahara desert was hit by a freak snowfall on December 19… …The last time flakes are reported to have fallen here was when a brief blizzard hit town in February 1979.

Proponents of global warming — which became “climate change” several years back when the warming trend stopped — insist that the earth is warming due to man-made pollution that affects the earth’s atmosphere and traps “greenhouse” gases inside the earth’s oxygen layer. The Environmental Protection Agency holds fast to their assertion that global warming is a dire and very real situation and calls humans “largely responsible”:

The evidence is clear. Rising global temperatures have been accompanied by changes in weather and climate. Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet’s oceans and glaciers have also experienced some big changes — oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea levels are rising. As these and other changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges to our society and our environment.

Unfortunately, the cure to what is at best changing science is often worse than the disease — or what Space.com calls, “a complex problem with potentially dire consequences”:

For decades, scientists have theorized that pumping aerosols into the stratosphere could counteract the warming effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It sounds crazy, right? How could pumping more pollution into the air fix a pollution problem?

Fortunately, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated someone to head the EPA that has a healthy skepticism for the “accepted” science that the Earth is warming and it’s all man’s fault.

And thank goodness, too. Because it snowed in the Sahara Desert Monday.While the Senate was busy debating and finally confirming Betsy Devos as the next Secretary of Education, Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced a bill to abolish the entire Department of Education on December 31st, 2018. Rep. Massie joins Dana Loesch to discuss his bill, which has gone viral on the internet.

Rep. Massie explains how the Department of Education has roughly 4,500 bureaucrats making around $105,000 apiece a year, dictating to states what the students will learn and how they will learn it. He states by making this cut there will be more funding available to the states to be spent in the school system.

Or are members of the media the ones at fault? TheBlaze spoke with people from both sides of that argument and, as you might expect, each side provided a very different answer.

Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists agrees with the former.

“I think that we’re pretty concerned about what we’re seeing in these initial days in terms of hostility toward the press,” Radsch said, responding to a question about how the administration called out one reporter last weekend for falsely tweeting that the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office.

The reporter, Time’s Zeke Miller, later apologized for the error, saying he didn’t initially see the artwork because it had been blocked by a door or a Secret Service agent. White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted, “apology accepted,” but even then, Trump and Spicer separately took the opportunity to get in a shot at the media.

Spicer, during his first briefing as press secretary, called the action “irresponsible and reckless” before going on to blast the media’s coverage of the inauguration crowd size. Spicer then then walked out of the briefing room without taking any questions.

Trump, who was visiting CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, also took aim at Miller while speaking in front of a memorial wall to honor fallen intelligence officers.

“Now big story, the retraction was like, where? Was it a line or do they even bother putting it in?” Trump said.

This is just one of the latest examples of a rocky relationship between the Washington, D.C., press corps and the new Trump administration.

Radsch compared these recent run-ins with what goes on in countries like Egypt, Turkey and even Russia.

“We see that in environments where leaders, those with moral authority, vilify the press that this has negative repercussions on the press and can lead to attacks,” Radsch told TheBlaze, adding that such attempts to demonize reporters can have a “chilling effect.”

“Under international law, there’s a right to freely express yourself whether you’re a president, prime minister, public figure or a private individual. So the fact that they [Trump’s White House] want to engage with the media and if they want to present their own information or perspective, I think that’s fine,” Radsch said.

But, she added, it becomes “problematic” when those in power start making personal attacks against journalists or bash the media more generally.

“This level of vitriol and vilification is something we are not accustomed to seeing in the United States,” Radsch claimed.

But Dan Gainor, vice president of business and media at the conservative Media Research Center, said the press has had this coming for a while.

“This administration-versus-the-press is not new,” Gainor told TheBlaze Thursday during a phone interview, citing then-presidential candidate Barack Obama kicking at least three reporters off his campaign plane because the newspapers they worked for endorsed Obama’s 2008 Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain.

“But the difference here,” Gainor added, “is the vast majority of media outlets see themselves as liberal crusaders, and they don’t like any of the things Trump is doing.” He then referred to a CNN headline published Thursday, which read: “Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.”

“In any other administration that would be a good thing,” Gainor pointed out. “President Obama doing exactly what he promised is you reaffirming the voters. But in the media’s mindset, Trump doing exactly what he said he’d do is awful.”

At some point, Gainor continued, the coverage becomes “so ridiculous” that for an administration to respond to it normally “doesn’t do any good.”

“The media act like everything Trump said during the campaign, he’s just being mean, as if they’d never done anything before,” Gainor said.

Gainor pointed to NBC reporter Katy Tur getting called out by Trump Nov. 2 while covering him on the campaign trail.

Pointing to his “massive crowds,” Trump singled out Tur, saying, “Katy, you’re not reporting it, Katy. But there’s something happening, Katy.”

At least two of Tur’s journalist colleagues later came to her defense on Twitter, using the hashtag “ImWithTur,” a play on the popular line “I’m with her,” which was often repeated at rallies in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

In response to Trump’s comment about Tur’s reporting, NBC’s Andrea Mitchell took to Twitter, asking Trump to “stop beating up on the media.”

.@KatyTurNBC has been doing stellar reporting since day 1 in #Decision2016 let's stop beating up on the media #ImWithTur — Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) November 2, 2016

CNBC’s John Harwood also weighed in, praising Tur’s journalistic abilities.

for the record, @KatyTurNBC is a bad-ass reporter — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) November 2, 2016

This was just one example Gainor provided while making the case that journalists don’t necessarily deserve better treatment.

“What’s Trump supposed to do? Sit back and take it like [former President] George W. Bush did?” Gainor asked.

The answer to that question, according to Gainor, is absolutely not.

“Trump is a street fighter. If they’re going to fight dirty, he’s going to fight right back at them,” Gainor said.A CNN reporter posted on his social media account a combative email reportedly sent Friday by Milwaukee Sheriff Clarke in response to a request for an interview.

The email from the popular Fox News commentator read as follows:

Donald Trump has labeled CNN as fake news. When Pres. Trump says CNN is ok again, then I might. Did they ever apologize on the Buzzfeed lie?

Clarke referred to the story that CNN broke about the Russian government possibly having damaging information on President Trump. This was conflated with the dossier that Buzzfeed released to much disapproval and roundly criticized as a falsified and unsubstantiated document. Trump and his supporters have tainted the CNN report by identifying it with the much-maligned Buzzfeed release, a comparison that CNN vehemently rejected.

Jeremy Diamond is a White House reporter covering President Trump for CNN. This is just the latest in series of interactions in the seeming “cold war” between President Trump and the mainstream media, and in particular the CNN news network. CNN’s anchor Jake Tapper has used his position to correct and criticize Trump when he thought it necessary, while Trump has assailed the network constantly as “fake news” for what he sees as partisan bias.According to CNN Money, the CEO of Ford Mexico Gabriel Lopez announced that Ford will go forward with building two plants in Mexico. An engine plant in Chihuahua, and a transmission plant in Irapuato.

The plants will cost $2.5 billion in construction costs, and will results in 3,800 workers upon completion.

While this news may seem like a sudden turn away from an American jobs centered plan seemingly arranged by President Donald Trump, Ford has actually had these plans on the books since 2015, and had never intended to veer from them. The confusion, says CNN Money, is likely due to news of a canceled plan for another Mexico factory being released on the same day as the announcement of another plant being opened in Michigan.

Ford got a lot of attention last month when it dropped its plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. But the small car production originally planned for the discontinued San Luis Potosi plant is shifting to an existing Ford Mexican assembly plant, not returning to the U.S. Ford (F) never claimed to be bringing work back, but onlookers could be forgiven for getting confused. On that same day, Ford announced plans for a $700 million investment and 700 new jobs to build electric and self-driving cars at a Michigan plant.

The truth is, the plans for the Michigan plant – while being hailed as a “vote of confidence” in Trump’s new economy by Ford CEO Mark Fields – was never supposed to go to Mexico in the first place, and was always intended to be build in the states.

Trump and Ford have had a tumultuous relationship in the past. During the 2016 elections, Trump targeted Ford as one of the companies that planned to move all its jobs to Mexico, and threatened to hit Ford with a 35% tax on all their products that came to the U.S.. Fields denied any intention to move all of their factories to Mexico, and explained that certain lower selling models were going to be made in Mexico, to make room for more lucrative models to be made here in America.

However, since Trump won the election, his view of the car company has been more sunny. During his first two days in office, Trump invited CEO’s of various auto companies to the White House. Among them was Fields, who Trump singled out for praise saying “Mark was so nice with the plant coming back, I wanted to sit next to him.”You have to love President Trump, because if people we’re tools, he loves blaming his tools for all his failures in office. [He] has, at his disposal many young legal interms and lawyers who would love to be let lose to prepare a executive order on the border ban. I will lay you odds, it would be at least over fifty (50) pages; once you have all the contingencies buildt in. But, you as The President of the United States come up and approved and signed by you a one in a half (1.5) page executive order; that was doom too fail.

In your election ploy, you stated you wanted to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. How, by threatening sanctions and the payment plan. Why would Mexico pay for a wall that all it would take is a ladder and/or a rope with a hook too get over. Better yet, go through or dig under; but it is your tools fault.

You took office without replacing all key people. Was that for, you could blame them if something goes wrong. If you took over a new hotel, wouldn’t you replace all the key people and put your in.

Rowe’s inquiry was directed at a Massachusetts college that flew its American flag at half-staff — and then removed it completely — after President-elect Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton on Election Day.

But one disgruntled fan, identified as Suzanne McDaniel, wanted to know why Rowe was so “blindly patriotic,” while instructing him to take a civics course and recognize that the flag is a “mere symbol.” She wrote:

How did you become so blindly patriotic? First of all, the college you were referencing in your rant about the American flag is a private college and doesn’t receive federal funding. However…the very essence of freedom in this country is our right to speak out against the flag, which is a mere symbol. If you take away that right, then we have lost all freedom. You really need to take a civics course, Mike Rowe. I used to like you; but, you have really become very annoying to me in recent years. I thought you were more intelligent. But, I guess appearances aren’t everything.

In his response, Rowe writes that he’s never thought of himself as “blindly patriotic,” but instead “a fan of the United States, the founding fathers, and the men and women who have served on my behalf,” who is lucky to live in the United States.

He continued:

Having said that, I think you’re correct about the flag; it’s only a symbol. So too is the Crucifix. And the middle finger. And the Swastika. And the compressed chunks of carbon that millions wear on their ring fingers as expressions of timeless love and eternal devotion. It’s easy to make anything feel small and silly by reducing it to its chemical composition or its various component parts. But if you really believe our flag is nothing but a “mere symbol,” equally suitable for flying or burning, ask yourself if you’d be comfortable if the people you work with suddenly started coming to the office in pointy white hats fashioned from bedsheets? Would that be a problem for you? Or how about The Rainbow Flag, favored by the LGBTQ community? Would it be OK if people started burning that? If not, why not? I mean, it’s only a symbol, right?

“The thing about ‘mere symbols’ Susanne, is that they represent ‘mere ideas,’ and ‘mere ideas’ are the backbone of ‘mere humanity.’ In the case of the flag, we’re talking about ideas that are wrapped into the Constitution – a document that separates us from every other country on the planet,” Rowe added.

Those ideas, Rowe wrote, are the reason people “fight and die” and have many of the rights Americans get to enjoy, like free speech, carry guns and desecrate symbols that represent those freedoms.

“I didn’t suggest that you or anyone else be denied your right to fly or burn whatever flag you wish,” he concluded. “What I failed to do, is quietly accept behavior I don’t care for. Which, if I’m not mistaken, is the same compulsion that motivates others to publicly express themselves in whatever ways they choose.”

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!After the fatal shooting of Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov on Monday by a gunman shouting “Allahu Akbar,” the media once again proved they are incapable of reporting a story accurately, especially when it goes against the liberal agenda.

Although the shooter was clearly heard shouting “Allahu Akbar” in video footage from the assassination in Ankara, multiple CNN anchors and reporters refused to mention as much.

They reported only on what the man was saying in Turkish, which was “Don’t forget about Aleppo. Don’t forget about Syria.”

But’s it’s clear from the entire video that, indeed, the gunman also shouted “Allahu Akbar,” which means “God is great” in Arabic. It is a phrase often uttered by Islamic terrorists while they are carrying out attacks.

Not all on-air personalities, however, refused to report the key context. To her credit, CNN foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward did mention it.

Anchors Jon Berman and Cairo-based reporter Mohamed Fahmy, however, glossed over the words mouthed by the gunman.

TheBlaze reported earlier on the shooting that killed Karlov and left several others injured.

The attack comes at a pivotal time for Russia-Turkey relations. The two countries have been on opposite sides of the ongoing Syrian civil war. Russia has for months helped to prop up Syrian dictator Bashar Assad while the Turkish government has supported Syrian rebels. Thousands of Syrians have died in the years-long war, many of whom perished in the recent uptick in violence occurring as a result of the Assad regime moving in to retake the ravaged city of Aleppo from rebel fighters.Community Rules

“I said something that was kind of politically correct,” he told the audience in San Jose, California. “I told y’all I didn’t vote, right?”

“But if I would have voted, I would have voted Trump,” West announced to audience members, most of whom responded by loudly booing the rapper.

He blamed the internet in part for Hillary Clinton’s loss, saying, “Echoing is what made people think Hillary was going to win. You thought, because what the internet was telling you, that she was going to win.”

West maintained what he first announced at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards — confirming that he will still be running for president in 2020.

“I’m a human being too, I have feelings. I like the debates. I’m a guy and a rapper, I’m a non-political rebel, the debates were entertaining,” West said.

McMullin, who himself is a former U.S. spy, tweeted that Trump “is siding with America’s greatest adversary even as it attacks our democracy,” in response to the president-elect’s praise of Putin.

“Never grow desensitized to this,” he warned.

To be clear, @realDonaldTrump is siding with America's greatest adversary even as it attacks our democracy. Never grow desensitized to this. https://t.co/tNSlkNPBgt — Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) December 30, 2016

The tweet garnered a massive amount of attention — more than 21,000 retweets and more than 30,000 “likes.”

Trump took to his favorite social media platform on Friday to offer a bit of praise for Putin after the Russian president said he would not retaliate against the U.S. over sanctions recently announced by President Barack Obama.

More from The Hill:

The sanctions announced by the Obama administration were in response to the Moscow-backed hacking of Democratic groups whose stolen documents were published in the months leading up to Trump’s electoral win. Those measures include sanctions against Russia’s two leading intelligence services and four top officers; the ejection of 35 Russian intelligence operatives and their families from the U.S.; and the closing of two estates in New York and Maryland believed to be used by Russia for intelligence activities. On Friday, Russian officials threatened retaliatory measures, but Putin said he would instead wait until the start of the Trump administration.

Trump tweeted Friday afternoon of Putin’s decision to delay any possible sanctions:

“Great move on delay (by V. Putin) – I always knew he was very smart!”

Great move on delay (by V. Putin) – I always knew he was very smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016

To be expected, the tweet has again made many weary of what the relationship between the U.S. and Russia will look like under Trump, as all indications currently suggest that it will be very friendly — which would be a vast turnaround compared to the Obama administration.There are a few misconceptions floating around out there about what it takes to be a Snowflake.

The Facebook post in which Rowe spoke on the subject went viral, as everyone seemed to appreciate the wisdom Rowe had to impart, one writer at the Daily Dot did not.

Gillian Branstetter wrote a response article to Rowe’s post that essentially accused Rowe of using economic concerns as a cover up for the racism espoused by Trump. Branstetter also accused Rowe of exploiting his fanbase with “bootstrap mythology” for personal gain.

Rowe wasn’t going to take that lying down, and in returning to Facebook, the former host decided to give the Daily Dot writer a little education on reality.

I believe a solid work ethic and a measure of ambition are essential ingredients to success, and readily available to anyone. Obviously, the desire to succeed and the willingness to work hard are not enough to guarantee success, but success without either is impossible. I also believe that any able bodied person can metaphorically pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. You call this belief a “myth,” and that puts us at odds over the importance of individual self-reliance. That’s fine, but to suggest that I have used this “mythology” to “exploit my fan base for my own gain” is a “doozy” of an accusation. I’ve exploited no one, Gillian. I run a scholarship program that rewards individual work ethic. I do so, because I believe work ethic is no longer encouraged to the degree it should be. We’ve trained about 500 people for a long list of good jobs, and I’m pretty sure none of them feel exploited. Finally, “economic frustration and demographic resentment” are not mutually exclusive. I understand that racism, sexism, or all the other ism’s currently dominating the headlines are alive and well in this country, and I suspect they always will be. But I don’t believe our country is fundamentally racist. Millions of white people who voted for Barack Obama, just voted for Donald Trump. It makes little sense to accuse them of “demographic resentment.”

Branstetter went on to accuse Trump voters of only caring about blue-collar infrastructure work when it came down to Trump’s wall along the Mexican border. Rowe once again injected a little reality, and explained that people can support immigration laws, and be wary of cities that refuse to enforce them, and still not be racist or xenophobic.

Really Gillian? ALL supporters? Do you really believe all 62 million voters based their vote on a wall? Isn’t it possible that a reasonable person might have a legitimate concern about illegal immigration, support the building of a wall, look with suspicion upon “sanctuary cities,” and NOT be anti-immigrant? Isn’t it possible a reasonable person might want to see the existing immigration laws enforced and not be a xenophobe? If so, what would such a person do, when given the choice between a crude businessman who speaks offensively, and a career politician who promises to dramatically increase the flow of refugees from countries that foment terrorism? Isn’t it also possible that an immigration policy that’s actually enforced might have a positive effect on overall economic anxiety?

Rowe continues to take apart Branstetter’s arguments bit by bit, and finishes by responding to her idea that that people have a right to anxious because Trump “used racism as the cure” to the job problem, and that it “is a disservice to the kind of workers Rowe promotes.”

“Deserve to be anxious?” You really do have an interesting way of putting things, Gillian. Anxiety is not a thing anyone “deserves.” It’s just a feeling, and like all feelings, it’s ultimately a choice. Sometimes it’s justified, sometimes it isn’t. But it has less to do with the facts in evidence, and more to do with what scares us as individuals. You and I for instance, are both anxious about President Trump. I’m anxious because the man has never held office, he’s never worn a uniform, and he’s frightened millions of people with irresponsible rhetoric and bad behavior completely inconsistent with the leader of the free world. That makes me uneasy, no doubt about it. You on the other hand, are anxious because you have taken everything he’s said at face value. Moreover, you seem to believe that everyone who voted for him did so because they agree with everything he’s said and done. Surely, you have to know how absurd that is. Do 60 million votes for Hillary Clinton means 60 million Americans approve of lying under oath, mishandling classified emails, and blatant “pay for play” shenanigans with her foundation? Of course not. I know many Hillary supporters who were disgusted by her behavior, and voted for her anyway. I know many Trump supporters who followed suit. You should take comfort in that. I’m not ignoring Trump or the things he said. But you – and many others – would have us believe the character of the country is no better than the character of the candidates. And that’s enough to make anybody anxious.

Cannon says in the interview that he is not anti-abortion — and that his mother had actually gone to abort him before deciding to have him — but that he has problems with the organization’s original desire to promote “ethnic cleansing.”

“I feel like it’s a systemic issue,” Cannon says in the video. “When you look at what Margaret Sanger and all the people who follow eugenics and all that stuff. It was all about cleansing. Margaret Sanger said that she wanted to exterminate the Negro race, and that she was going to use her organization as she founded to do so.”

Cannon has been vocal in the past in his criticism of Planned Parenthood, just last month accusing the organization of “real genocide” against black communities.

“Think about all the stuff they did with Planned Parenthood and all of that type of stuff. That type of stuff is to take our community and — forget gentrification, it’s real genocide,” Cannon said last month, according to the Washington Times. “And it’s been like that for years.”

Sanger is widely known for her belief in birth control to control what she called the “biologically unfit” from breeding. The effort to downplay some of her more controversial statements about population control have been successful over the years.

However, even those attempts are becoming stale in light of some of the horrors the organization has been involved with over the last several years, including the alleged sale of fetal body parts that was exposed in a sting operation by the Center for Medical Progress and the discovery of preserved fetuses and unsanitary conditions at Dr. Kermit Gosnell’s Philadelphia abortion clinic that Planned Parenthood failed to report to authorities.

Even National Public Radio’s effort to clean-up the rhetoric fails when Sanger is simply taken at her word:

Eugenics was a discipline, championed by prominent scientists but now widely debunked, that promoted “good” breeding and aimed to prevent “poor” breeding. The idea was that the human race could be bettered through encouraging people with traits like intelligence, hard work, cleanliness (thought to be genetic) to reproduce. Eugenics was taken to its horrifying extreme during the Holocaust, through forced sterilizations and breeding experiments. In the United States, eugenics intersected with the birth control movement in the 1920s, and Sanger reportedly spoke at eugenics conferences. She also talked about birth control being used to facilitate “the process of weeding out the unfit [and] of preventing the birth of defectives.”

Cannon contends in his video interview that because so many abortion clinics are located in black communities, the “unfit” that Sanger is referring to can be inferred to mean black people.

Watch the full interview here:

In an wide-ranging interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the grinning television host traded barbs with President-elect Donald Trump’s special advisor Kellyanne Conway and attempted to pin her down on many questions about the unorthodox Trump transition.

Meyers was fortunate enough to have Conway scheduled right as a controversial report was published by CNN detailing intelligence the Russians had allegedly dug up about the president-elect. Conway attempted to undermine the report by pointing out that the sources are anonymous, and claiming this information had not been presented to President Obama or to Trump, which Meyers disputes.

Kellyanne countered, saying “he has said that he is not aware of that,” to which Meyers joked, “OK, that concerns me!”

Conway then steered away from Trump’s disinterest in alleged Russian hacking and election interference by saying that Hillary lost the election without any foreign assistance. Meyers responded by asking, “shouldn’t we care if the Russians tried to interfere, whether it affected the outcome of the election or not? Isn’t that something that – I sometimes fear that the president-elect has no curiosity as to the amount that they tried.”

Meyers peppered her with tough questions about the lack of background checks of Trump’s administration nominees, the lack of full press conferences from the president-elect, and the disruptive nature of Trump’s Twitter. They have a funny exchange about her comment that the media listens to the words from his mouth and not his heart, with Meyers mocking, “how can we know what’s in his heart? He expresses it how? Out of his moooouth!”

At one point the audience laughs at Conway quoting Trump’s post-election comments, and she testily complains about the lack of respect from the audience and Meyers for the office of the president.

You have such disrespect, I guess I’m just astonished. I’m almost fifty years old and and I’m so astonished to hear people outwardly ridicule the office of the president and its current occupant. I was raised differently, no matter who it is. I know the media and their pollsters who were crap didn’t prepare you for the election results, but all you had to do was listen to us. The cues and clues were there. Every day I was on TV saying ‘this is how we’re going to win.’

Here’s the interview courtesy of the “Late Night” YouTube channel:World War II veteran Peter DuPre played a beautiful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” earlier this week during the pre-game ceremonies of an annual college basketball tournament.

DuPre was one of more than 100 living World War II who were flown to Hawaii to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan in Dec. 1941. He was a medic in the European Theatre and participated in the Battle of the Bulge.

The annual basketball tournament — the Pearl Harbor invitational — is held each year to honor all of the more than 2,400 Americans who lost their lives during Japan’s surprise attack. It is even held at Bloch Arena, which is on a base that Japan attacked.

DuPre played his rendition of the national anthem prior to Wednesday’s matchup between Seton Hall University and the University of California-Berkley.

You can watch his performance below. It’s safe to say he brought the house down.

Ultra-liberal filmmaker Michael Moore is at it again.

On the heels of a New York Times story saying members of Republican President Donald Trump’s campaign had multiple interactions with senior Russian intelligence officials, Moore hopped on Facebook and wrote that it’s “what we all suspected. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what was going on: TRUMP COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS TO THROW THE ELECTION TO HIM.”

While the Times story didn’t go that far, Moore was only too happy to take the leap — and then some.

“So this is what I want done NOW,” he offered before launching into a list of demands — the most notable being that “so-called President Trump could save the country a lot of time, money and pain by stepping down tonight.”

But then what? Is Moore cool with Vice President Mike Pence heading to the Oval Office?

No way, he wrote: “Pence can’t be president as he, too, was elected under this same fraud.”

Instead, Moore suggested the Supreme Court “has to rule either that the President is the winner of the popular vote OR the election must be held over.”

The “winner of the popular vote” is, of course, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

He added that “Republicans — the beneficiaries of this treason — cannot be allowed to hold on to the power by default. If it turns out there’s a traitor in the White House, the judicial branch must find a fair, peaceful way to un-do and then re-do the election of 2016.”

Moore at least stood up to his own party, demanding that the “weak and spineless Democrats bring Congress to a halt until investigative hearings are held and impeachment charges are filed. We don’t want to hear you Dems huff and puff and grandstand and take symbolic actions. We demand that you halt all actions being taken by an illegitimately elected government until this matter is resolved.”

His Tuesday post, which has garnered more than 36,000 shares, was still getting comments Thursday morning. Most seemed to enthusiastically back Moore’s demands — but a smattering went against the tide.On Wednesday, TheBlaze told the story of how Deadspin Editor Tim Marchman, after challenging Ted Cruz supporters to a fight, had the challenged accepted by two soldiers. One was wounded warrior J.R. Salzman, and the other was Special Forces sniper, Ranger qualified, MMA fighter Tim Kennedy.

Kennedy’s answer to Marchman’s call became a popular topic of conversation Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Both TheBlaze’s Doc Thompson and Glenn Beck had Kennedy on the show to discuss the story, and in Beck’s case, much more.

On the Doc Thompson show, after talking about Marchman’s attempting cyberbullying, Kennedy was offered the chance to formally accept Marchman’s challenge, which he promptly did.

“Mr. Marchman, my name is Tim Kennedy,” he began. “I’m a Special Forces sniper, a Ranger qualified Green Beret, and a UFC fighter for the past — almost 20 years.”

“I would like to extend an invitation for you to back up your words,” continued Kennedy. “You were rude and hateful yesterday, and you challenged really anyone that supported conservative ideas to a cage fight. I would love — at your convenience — to step up to that challenge.”

Kennedy finished by stating “I would love to officially make that happen for you.”

Listen below:



Beck also had Kennedy on; however, Beck wanted to sweeten the pot.

“So we’re offering a guaranteed $50,000 with TheBlaze cameras will be there or the Glenn Beck Mercury cameras will be there if TheBlaze doesn’t want to do it, but I’m sure they will,” said Beck. “We’ll cover it. It will make it an event, we’ll make it pay per view. Every dime will go right to the charity, so who knows how much you could make? So I want everybody to tweet to Deadspin today and Tim Marchman.”

“Let him know that his charity could be very, very wealthy if he just wants to complete what he started with his mouth,” continued Beck, “if he’d just like to cash the check that his mouth just wrote.”

But Kennedy wanted to add to Beck’s generosity as well, saying he would actually match Beck’s donation to charity, as his gift would be going to a military law enforcement cause.

“I’ll match yours, Glenn,” Kennedy told Beck. “That’s coming from me, Tim Kennedy, as a person supporting this cause as well.”

“So wait, wait, wait,” interrupted Beck. “I’m offering 50,000. You’re offering 50,000 as well?” Beck noted that this fight has a potential to raise $250,000 to go to a charity of the winner’s choice. It’s likely that Marchman will be writing a check to Planned Parenthood should he win, something that neither Beck nor Kennedy seemed OK with.

Still, Kennedy seems confident that he’ll win this fight, should Marchman choose to accept.

“I’m not hard to find unless you’re ISIS, then it’s a rough night,” said Kennedy.Former Marine and police officer Chad Robichaux, from the Mighty Oaks Program, joins Glenn Beck to explain how an experience responding to a domestic violence call inspired him to tackle veteran suicides.

His group uses “peer-based discipleship” as well as retreats and speaking events to help veterans struggling with reintegration into the civilian world.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Just hours after being sworn in, President Donald Trump reinstalled the bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill back into the Oval Office.

Reporters first noticed the bust in the Oval Office Friday evening just as Trump was signing several executive orders, some of his first acts as president.

The bust was removed by former President Barack Obama shortly after he took office in 2009. Obama replaced it with busts of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. and former President Abraham Lincoln.

The move created a wave of controversy and outrage with conservatives, who alleged that Obama removed the bust to snub the British. Conservative documentary filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza alleged in his documentary “2016: Obama’s America” that Obama removing the bust was further evidence that he hated American and British imperialism.

Obama, however, denied those allegations.

It was reported last week that Trump personally asked the British if he could have the bust back to reinstall it in the Oval Office. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed that May was more than happy to re-gift the bust.

“The Prime Minister is happy to loan the Churchill bust to the White House and will be delighted to view it on display when she visits this Spring,” the spokesperson said.

The bust was originally gifted to former President George W. Bush in the initial days of his presidency in 2001.

Since being removed, the bust had been kept at the British Embassy in D.C. According to pictures from reporters Friday, it appears that Trump also kept the bust of MLK in his new office.For the first time in more than two years, Christians from the Iraqi town of Bartella were able to celebrate Christmas.

That’s because their town was recently liberated from the control of the Islamic State in late October. The town is just 12.5 miles east of Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, which is currently the epicenter of a major battle between coalition and Islamic State forces.

More from CNN:

As mass was celebrated Saturday, dozens of Iraqi and US security forces were on standby to protect worshipers at the historic, battle-scarred Mart Shmony Church. A security officer searching cars at a checkpoint said ISIS had been threatening to carry out attacks in Bartella. Even though volunteers have worked on the church for several days, evidence of the terror group’s brutal regime is everywhere. ISIS’ signature is written large — in scorched walls, charred books and broken glass. Bullet holes scar the church. The head of a statue and its hands have been smashed. Outside, a big plastic Christmas tree provides a backdrop for commemorative group pictures and selfies. Emotions are mixed.

Hania Noah, a 52-year-old Iraqi Christian, told CNN that she felt like she lost her home when she was driven from her town and church by Islamic extremists.

“I felt like I lost a family member when I saw the church this way. This is the church that I have been praying in for my entire life,” she said. “But I am happy to be back. I am glad I am here to celebrate the birth of Jesus. It’s like I’m reborn again.”

During Sunday’s gathering, the church’s priest made it clear that they were there to stay.

“We are here to challenge the sons of darkness and this is why we held this mass here. ISIS are sons of darkness,” priest Yaqub Saadi said, according to CNN. “This is a message to the entire world that we Christians … are the inherent component of this country and we are staying.”

The church service culminated as the Christians replaced the church’s cross — after Islamic militants destroyed the original one — with a much larger cross.Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner Mark Cuban is ready to refund the money of a season ticket holder who was not happy with the billionaire’s recent public criticism of President Donald Trump.

Cuban, who has been an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump since the 2016 presidential campaign, went to Twitter to voice his frustrations about Trump’s press conference Thursday afternoon during which the president lambasted the media for their reports on his campaign’s alleged communications with Russia.

Cuban indicated he did not believe Trump was telling the truth. “It’s a waste of time to try to turn Pinocchio into a real President,” Cuban said. “The focus needs to be on the Geppettos and legislators around him.”

It’s a waste of time to try to turn Pinocchio into a real President. The focus needs to be on the Geppettos and legislators around him — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 16, 2017



Responses to his tweet began pouring in, including one Twitter user who took issue with Cuban’s criticism of Trump, telling Cuban he would be giving up his season tickets and boycotting the rest of the season. “Time to delete you and turn in my season tickets and boycott games,” the Mavericks fan told Cuban.

Never one to hold his tongue, Cuban’s response indicated his willingness to help the man get rid of his season tickets. “DM me and I’ll help get it done,” he responded.

@RUDONIV_58 @FOX4 DM me and I’ll help get it done — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 16, 2017



The Twitter user has since deleted the tweet, but KDFW-TV tweeted out a graphic showing the Thursday afternoon exchange.

Cuban was the subject of Trump’s seemingly unprovoked criticism last week, when Trump tweeted out, “I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls. He’s not smart enough to run for president!”

I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls.He’s not smart enough to run for president! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017



Cuban told reporters at the time that someone close to Trump explained to him that Trump’s tweet was a public response to a New York Post article reporting that Cuban could be a serious contender for the 2020 presidential election.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!As Barack Obama would cause gun sales to skyrocket after every anti-gun speech for fear of our Second Amendment rights being stripped, now President-elect Donald Trump’s mere vicinity to the Oval Office is causing many in the black community to arm up out out of fear their lives are in danger.

According to NBC News, gun store owners are reporting that gun sales to black and minorities customers have quadrupled since November 8th, and that many black gun groups have reported that twice as many attendees have been showing up at their meetings.

“You feel that racists now feel like they can attack us just because the president is doing it,” a gun shop owner told NBC News.

Gun sales reportedly increased into record highs with up to 2.3 million background checks being performed, but gun manufacturers stock numbers slacked off when Trump won the election. Regardless, numbers are up, and gun store owners are surprised by how much of this is made up of minority buyers.

“They thought Trump won’t win,” said Earl Curtis, the 53-year-old owner of two Blue Ridge Arsenal gun stores and shooting ranges in western Virginia who has noticed an “uptick” in the number of black and minority customers. Largely, says Curtis, they’re “shell-shocked” first-time shooters looking to get a handgun to protect themselves from “race riots and being attacked by racists” — afraid that what Trump and his supporters have already done is just the beginning.

While some would consider these fears unfounded, certain developments within the oncoming Trump administration have some people worried. Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon’s appointment as Chief of Staff has done much to worry minorities, as he bragged about allowing the alt-right — a group often associated with racists and neo-Nazis — to have a platform at his former website, Breitbart.com.During a discussion on HBO’s “Real Time” Friday night, failed Democratic Senate candidate from Missouri, Jason Kander, challenged Tomi Lahren to name the four Americans who were killed by Islamic terrorists in Bengahzi on Sept. 11, 2012.

Kander’s challenge came during a segment of the show when host Bill Maher was discussing the recent botched Navy SEAL mission in Yemen with his panel, which included Lahren, Kander and GOP strategist Rick Wilson.

That mission, despite killing several high-level Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leaders, left one American Navy SEAL dead and severely damaged a military helicopter, which was later completely destroyed.

Maher made the point that if in the opening days of a Hillary Clinton presidency an American solider was killed in a botched mission, then the conservative media would be screaming about a second Benghazi. To that point, Lahren agreed.

Kander chimed in to say that conservatives and Republicans “used the people who died [at Benghazi] as political chess pieces for quite a few years” in order to grill Clinton, who at the time the attack happened, was thought to be the most likely person to become the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.

Then Kander challenged Lahren to name the four Americans who died at the Benghazi compound, telling Lahren: “You don’t know.”

But Lahren did know and she made sure Kander understood.

“Chris Stevens, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods and Sean Smith,” Lahren boldly proclaimed straight to Kander’s face.

Watch the exchange below:

Kander is the former secretary of state of Missouri. He challenged Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) last year for Blunt’s Senate seat as the Democratic nominee, but ultimately lost in the general election by less than three percent.Doc Thompson joins “Pat and Stu” to discuss the upcoming #SnowflakeAwards on Sunday, February 26, 2017 at 8PM ET on TheBlaze TV.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!The House Intelligence Committee had to cancel a briefing set on Capitol Hill for Thursday after their request for more information from the CIA and other intelligence agencies was denied.

Chairman of the committee U.S. Rep Devin Nunes released a statement Wednesday night expressing his disdain for the handling of the request by the intelligence agencies.

“It is unacceptable that the Intelligence Community directors would not fulfill the House Intelligence Committee’s request to be briefed tomorrow on the cyber-attacks that occurred during the presidential campaign,” Nunes said. “The legislative branch is constitutionally vested with oversight responsibility of executive branch agencies, which are obligated to comply with our requests.”

He also added, “The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.”

Nunes had initially asked for a private closed session on Thursday with CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, and National Intelligence Director James Clapper. He sent a letter to Clapper on Monday explaining the committee wanted further clarification on recent remarks made to members of the media by unnamed CIA officials purporting they had found that the Russian government influenced the election in favor of President-elect Donald Trump.

In his original request, Nunes brought up Clapper’s public testimony from November when he asserted that the Intelligence Community lacked the evidence to connect the Russian government to the hacked emails or to influencing the election.

He said he would give the intelligence agencies until Friday to address the inconsistencies in the records, and added, “in particular we want to clarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us.”

But the CIA declined the meeting, expressing they were centering the agency’s focus on a full review requested by President Obama. The other agencies did not respond to the committee’s request for a briefing, despite the committee being the most-senior committee with jurisdiction over the matter.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is responsible for overseeing all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, issued a statement contrasting the representative’s remarks, saying that members of Congress have received “extensive, detailed classified and unclassified briefings … since last summer and have continued to do so after Election Day.”

“Last week, the President ordered a full Intelligence Community review of foreign efforts to influence recent Presidential elections – from 2008 to present,” the statement said. “Once the review is complete in the coming weeks, the Intelligence Community stands ready to brief Congress—and will make those findings available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods. We will not offer any comment until the review is complete.”

Nunes is also a member of Trump’s presidential transition team, serving on the executive committee to help the new president-elect choose his incoming administration.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!During his last overseas trip as the leader of the free world, President Barack Obama on Thursday cautioned against fake news sources, saying that America will have problems if its citizens read only “propaganda” that aligns with their already established beliefs.

Obama’s statement comes as social media platforms deal with a backlash of criticism from observers who have suggested that “fake news” found on the websites contributed to the election of Donald Trump. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that idea “crazy” but later indicated the company is working on purge fake news stories from the website.

“If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems” Obama said during a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, the Hill reported.

Obama said Americans are living “in an age where there is so much active misinformation,” adding that “it’s packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or turn on your television.”

“If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect. We won’t know what to fight for,” Obama said.

While he acknowledged that it’s easier to communicate negative attacks and “simplistic slogans” than complex policy proposals, the president seemed to remain optimistic. “We’ll figure it out,” Obama assured the international press.President Donald Trump’s administration put Iran “on notice” Wednesday after the world’s largest state-sponsor of terrorism provocatively, but unsuccessfully, launched a medium-range ballistic missile earlier in the week. Now, the administration has made clear what “on notice” means.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced new sanctions Friday against 13 individuals and 12 companies. At least five of the individuals are Iranian citizens or have clear ties to Iran. At least five of the business entities are based in Iran or have offices there.

The 13 “Specially Designated Nationals” named in the announcement are: Al-Hajj, Yahya Al-Hajj, Abdollah Asgharzadeh, Tenny Darian, Hasan Dehghan Ebrahimi, Muhammad ‘Abd-al-Amir Farhat, Mohammad Magham, Kambiz Rostamian, Ali Sharifi, Qin Xianhua, Richard Yue, Mostafa Zahedi, Ghodrat Zargari and Carol Zhou.

Darian, Ebrahimi, Magham, Rostamian and Sharifi are listed as having direct connection to Iran, either by citizenship or possessing a passport.

The 12 business entities included in the new sanctions are Cosailing Business Trading Company, East Star Company, Ervin Danesh Aryan Company, Maher Trading and Construction Company, Mirage for Engineering and Trading, Mirage for Waste Management and Environmental Services, MKS International, Ningbo New Century Import and Export Company, Ofog Sabze Darya Company, Reem Pharmaceutical, Royal Pearl General and Zist Tajhiz Pooyesh Company.

East Star, Ervin Danesh Aryan, MKS International, Ofog Sabze Darya Company and Zist Tajhiz Pooyesh Company are listed as having addresses in the capital city of Tehran.

According to an emailed statement from the office of Retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security advisor, the listed individuals and businesses “provide support to Iran’s ballistic missile program and to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.”

The U.S. has previously accused the Quds force of providing assistance in attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to CNN.

The nature of these new sanctions was not immediately clear, but John Smith, acting director for the Office of Foreign Asset Control, indicated that they may be economic.

“We will continue to actively apply all available tools, including financial sanctions, to address this behavior,” Smith said, according to Politico.

The measures came just two days after Flynn issued a blunt warning to Iran after its latest ballistic missile test.

“As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,” Flynn said in front of reporters at Wednesday’s White House press briefing.

Iranian defense minister Hossein Dehghan denied the test violates Iran’s nuclear agreement with the U.S. and the United Nations.

The U.S. called an emergency meeting of the U.N. security council Tuesday in reaction to Iran’s ballistic missile test, where Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., called the action “absolutely unacceptable,” Bloomberg reported.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!In the wake of Donald Trump’s upset victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, pro-life lawmakers and leaders expressed optimism about what the president-elect’s administration will mean for their cause.

Trump, who has described himself as pro-life since launching his presidential bid, made a series of conflicting statements on abortion during his campaign and expressed support for abortion prior to his candidacy. He struggled to win over some pro-life activists who questioned the sincerity of his conversion on the issue.

As a candidate, Trump once defended Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, as an organization that does “good work” for women. He later pledged to nominate pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and to sign the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act into law.

But will President Trump follow through on his pro-life policy commitments? Two Republican lawmakers said they believe he will.

Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) told TheBlaze, “As a national co-chair of Donald Trump’s Pro-Life coalition, I know that we can count on his administration to work with Congress in order to advance protections for our most vulnerable members of society.”

“I’ve been encouraged to see that, even after Nov. 8, President-elect Trump hasn’t backed away from his pro-life promises,” Black said. “He reaffirmed his commitment to appointing pro-life Supreme Court justices last Sunday in his interview with “60 Minutes,” and his transition website states his commitment to protecting ‘innocent human life from conception to natural death.’ These overtures to the pro-life community at a time when his name won’t be on a ballot for another four years give me great optimism for how he will govern.”

Black added that she looks forward to working toward implementing pro-life policies.

“Specifically, I am eager to work with President-elect Trump on defunding Planned Parenthood, passing the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act — a bill to protect unborn babies from abortions after 20 weeks — and protecting the conscience rights of pro-life individuals who refuse to pay for, perform or refer abortions,” she said. “We in the pro-life community have secured a commitment from the president-elect on each of these issue areas, and we will follow through on that.”

Black pointed to Trump’s selection of a running mate as a reason for hope for pro-lifers.

“I served with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in Congress, and I know him to be a fearless pro-life leader with a heart for the unborn,” she said. “He previously carried a bill to defund Planned Parenthood that he later passed on to me upon being elected governor of Indiana. I am especially confident in the prospect of getting these live-saving bills signed into law knowing that he will be part of this administration.”

Black said that she expects the next administration to be a vast improvement on the current administration when it comes to protecting the unborn:

President Barack Obama has long held an unholy alliance with the big abortion industry; even going so far as to become the first sitting president to speak at Planned Parenthood’s annual fundraising gala. His administration was a callous betrayal to the unborn. President-elect Donald Trump will be a welcome change for all who believe in celebrating life at every stage.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) told TheBlaze in a statement:

President-elect Trump has repeatedly said he is committed to nominating pro-life judges. It’s imperative we have judges on all courts who respect the Constitution and Congressional intent to implement policies that respect the sanctity of life. I look forward to working with the new administration in our continued efforts to protect women and the unborn.

Pro-life groups also expressed optimism about advancing a pro-life agenda under President Trump.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, seemed optimistic when she told TheBlaze:

Ultimately, no one knows if Donald Trump will follow through on the significant promises he made during the campaign. But there are many indicators that give pro-lifers hope that indeed he will be a force for the good of pre-born babies and their mothers. His vice president, Mike Pence, attempted to defund Planned Parenthood before it was cool, and his new chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is staunchly pro-life. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, is a great friend to the pro-life movement as well. Donald Trump has surrounded himself with people that the pro-life community believes are all great influences on the president.

“Right now, pro-lifers need to unify and present this new administration with an enormous grassroots army of passionate pro-lifers who are ready to defund Planned Parenthood and ultimately make abortion unthinkable in this nation,” Hawkins continued. “It is imperative that President-elect Trump continue to keep trusted pro-lifers by his side and appoint those who hold strong pro-life views to powerful positions in our government.”

Mallory Quigley, communications director for the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said that “over the course of the general election, Donald Trump’s commitments to the pro-life movement only became stronger”:

He has made four specific commitments to the pro-life movement and, in the third debate, he went on offense to call out Hillary Clinton for her abortion extremism, emphasizing the clear contrast between the two of them. The power of the pro-life grassroots was a huge factor in making possible this pro-life White House and Congress and now the Trump transition team is off to a great start with longtime pro-life allies like Mike Pence leading the way.

“Moving forward we’ll be working with the Trump-Pence administration and our allies on the Hill to advance the commitments laid out during the campaign,” she added. “But this is not a time for complacency. Pro-life grassroots need to participate.”

Quigley argued that “the abortion lobby suffered a loss this election cycle” and warned that “they are going to pull out all the stops to try and intimidate lawmakers to stop pro-life progress.”

They will stop at nothing to thwart the defunding of Planned Parenthood, the enactment of common ground laws like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and the nomination and confirmation of pro-life judges. We will need pro-lifers from across the country to pick up their phones as often as possible to call Congress and demand action, to demand the enactment of the Trump-Pence pro-life agenda.

She suggested that pro-lifers need to join organizations such as her own “so they’re kept up to date on the most pressing action alerts and breaking news.”

Pro-choice groups have condemned Trump’s statements about abortion. After his election, Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement: “There are almost no words to capture the threat that this election result poses to our democracy, to our economic security, to access to reproductive health care and most especially to the safety and dignity of people of color”:Hundreds of violent protesters caused more than $100,000 worth of damage at UC Berkeley this week when demonstrators gathered to protest Milo Yiannopoulos, who was scheduled to give a speech at the school last Wednesday.

Yiannopoulos was never able to give his speech and police escorted him from the campus “amid the violence and destruction of property and out of concern for public safety,” according to CNN.

More from CNN:

Black-clad protesters wearing masks threw commercial-grade fireworks and rocks at police. Some even hurled Molotov cocktails that ignited fires. They also smashed windows of the student union center on the Berkeley campus where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held. The violent protesters tore down metal barriers, set fires near the campus bookstore and damaged the construction site of a new dorm. One woman wearing a red Trump hat was pepper sprayed in the face while being interviewed by CNN affiliate KGO. She was able to respond that she was OK after the attack.

Still, police did not arrest any of the rioters.

However, this wasn’t the first time UC Berkeley, which used to be seen as a symbol free speech, has dealt with riots on campus.

More than 40 years ago in 1969, protests erupted — and soon turned into riots — over city plans to turn a vacant lot near campus into a parking lot.

On the early morning of May 15, 1969, the university had a fencing company, with the security of 250 police officers, begin building a fence around the property to keep students off of it so that plans to renovate it could go forward.

Five hours later, more than 3,000 students began protesting on campus. From Berkeley’s “Resource”:

The rally, which drew 3,000 people, soon turned into a riot, as the crowd moved down Telegraph (Ave.) towards the park. That day, known as Bloody Thursday, three students suffered punctured lungs, another a shattered leg, 13 people were hospitalized with shotgun wounds, and one police officer was stabbed. James Rector, who was watching the riot from a rooftop, was shot by police gunfire; he died four days later.

Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California from 1967 to 1975, responded to the riots with force, according to the “Resource.” He declared a state of emergency and sent in 2,200 National Guard troops to “use whatever methods they choose” to restore order.

Over the next several days, police and troops arrested nearly 1,000 people, including 200 for felonies, while 500 were booked at the local jail.

Later at a press conference, when Reagan was questioned about his response to the riot and why he didn’t negotiate with the rioters instead, Reagan said, “What is there to negotiate?”

“All of it began the first time some of you who know better…let young people think that they had the right to choose the laws they would obey as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest,” he said.

Reagan’s response to unrest at UC Berkeley was dramatically different than the response on Wednesday, which left administration officials bowing to protesters by canceling Yiannopoulos’s event.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Donald Trump’s administration is denying a new Associated Press report suggesting his White House is considering mobilizing the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.

According to the AP’s Garance Burke, the Trump administration is “considering a proposal to mobilize as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants,” to include “millions” who live nowhere near the U.S.-Mexico border.

BREAKING: Trump administration considers mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants. — The Associated Press (@AP) February 17, 2017

From the report:

The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. Four states that border on Mexico are included in the proposal — California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas — but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four — Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Governors in the 11 states would have a choice whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, written by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general. While National Guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the U.S.-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly or as far north.

The Trump administration was quick to denounce the report moments after it was released, though the AP said it was unable to reach the White House or the Department of Homeland Security for comment before publishing Burke’s story.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein that the AP report is “100 percent false,” adding, “There is no effort to use the National Guard to round up.”

The AP said a draft of the proposal has been “circulated among DHS staff over the last two weeks,” but a spokeswoman for the federal agency told NBC News: “That AP story about the National Guard is incorrect. It’s not true.”

Spokespeople for the governors of Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Oregon told Burke they were unaware of any such proposal and declined to comment further.

The National Guard, according to the AP, would be given wide-ranging authority, should the alleged proposal be implemented:

[T]he draft memo says participating troops would be authorized “to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States.” It describes how the troops would be activated under a revived state-federal partnership program, and states that personnel would be authorized to conduct searches and identify and arrest any unauthorized immigrants.

Similar operations involving the National Guard have been carried out in the past, though it is important to note that they have been done in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol and were focused only along the United States’ southern border.

For example, in 2006, then-President George W. Bush launched Operation Jump Start, which deployed 6,000 National Guard officers “to assist with surveillance, installing fences and vehicle barriers, as well as provide training.”

From U.S. Customs and Border Protection:

National Guard units assist CBP by executing logistical and administrative support, operating detection systems, providing mobile communications, augmenting border-related intelligence analysis efforts, and building and installing border security infrastructure. Operation Jump Start relieves Border Patrol agents from non-law enforcement duties, allowing them to focus on border security.

News of this alleged proposal follows Trump’s signing of an executive order on Jan. 25, greatly expanding the federal government’s priorities regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants. In the order, the president calls for the removal of people in the U.S. illegally who “have been convicted of any criminal offense,” “have been charged with any criminal offense,” “have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense” or “are subject to a final order of removal.”

As TheBlaze previously reported, the Mexican government has warned its citizens living in the U.S. to “take precautions” as they face a “new reality” under the Trump administration.

“The entire Mexican community should take precautions and keep in touch with the nearest consulate, to obtain the necessary help to face this kind of situation,” the statement reads.In the wake of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro’s death, many leaders have spoken of the man with either reverence or contempt. President Barack Obama himself gave a rather diplomatic response that seemed a bit too friendly for some, and gave “condolences to Fidel Castro’s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people.”

His friendliness to the Cubans in regards to Castro’s death did not sit well for many, as they wished for a response that leant more toward condemning Castro’s past deeds of terror, death, and dictatorship. Something more along the lines of Senator Rand Paul (R-KY).

The lesson of history is that violence is inherent to socialism. To Castro's death, I say good riddance. https://t.co/S4dvK5srTG — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 27, 2016

Furthermore, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said Obama’s comments were pathetic.

President Obama issued a pathetic statement on death of dictator #FidelCastro with no mention of thousands he killed & imprisoned. #Cuba — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 26, 2016

This may have lent to the recent decision of both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden skipping Castro’s funeral next week according to the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest says reporters should “stay tuned” for announcements should any U.S. official decide to attend.

Obama is the only sitting president in 88 years that has paid a visit to Cuba. When he did so, he was lambasted for taking a picture in front of a giant mural of murderous Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. With his words and actions far too close to friendly to communist leaders, it’s likely best that Obama put some distance between himself, his administration, and Cuba.Glenn tells the remarkable tale of “Madam” C.J.

However, it was the subject of the media and what he calls “fake news” that got him the most fired up.

The Trump administration has labeled the media as “the opposition party” and rightfully so. During the election, they did everything they can to stop trump from being elected while at the same time colluded with the Clinton campaign as revealed by WikiLeaks. Since the election, the media’s coverage of President Trump has been apocalyptic. The coverage of the Flynn scandal alone has been compared to Watergate and Russia’s interference in American politics has been seen as an act of war on the level of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. The hysteria is truly unbelievable.

What frustrates media personalities like MSNBC’s Chuck Todd and the folks at CNN the most is the reality that despite Trump’s own complicated relationship with the truth, most Americans actually side with Trump. A recent Emerson poll shows that more people trust the Trump administration more than the media! There are so many reasons to question the White House especially as of late, but the fact that many see them as more honest than various news outlets.

Just look at all of the reports that were made in the past week alone. At least half of them rely on “unnamed sources” and don’t provide tangible proof to support their stories. That alone earns skepticism. And many of those stories automatically get debunked by the Trump administration. The mainstream media has become an industry of political tabloids. And sadly, some of the legitimate stories are due to unlawful leaks from the intelligence community. There’s an unhealthy bond between Obama loyalists still working in the government and a hostile media. They’re willing to make confidential information, like Trump’s conversations with world leaders or more recently Flynn’s chats with the Russian ambassador, public solely to embarrass the president. So the fake news element is one thing, but the blatant objective to politically assassinate President Trump every single day is obvious to most Americans.

The most hilarious part about all of this is that the media sees themselves as the victim. They claim President Trump is a threat to our First Amendment right of the freedom of the press and that he delegitimizes journalism. For the record, it’s the media that delegitimized itself. They gave President Obama an easy eight years, attempted to destroy Trump’s candidacy while trying to help Clinton get elected. Now the media freaks out if Trump sneezes.

While there’s lots to criticize President Trump on, he’s absolutely right about the media and the way they treat him. And until the media addresses their own credibility problem, President Trump will continue to win this war.During the annual football matchup between the Army and Navy on Saturday, academy students from both branches came together to sing a powerful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Independent Journal Review’s Benny Johnson was on the field to capture the stunning two minutes. After the national anthem was sung, the crowd erupted into cheers.

For the past 14 years, Navy had defeated Army in the highly-contested game, but on Saturday, Army proved to be victorious, 21-17.

But America was the real winner. Check out the must-see footage of the anthem:

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!As the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has just struck down Trump’s executive order on the travel ban, Republicans are simultaneously moving to pass a bill that will split the court up.

According to Fox News, Arizona Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain have introduced legislation that will take six states out of the court, and create a whole new 12th Circuit. According to Flake, the court is overburdened, bloated, and slow.

“It represents 20 percent of the population — and 40 percent of the land mass is in that jurisdiction. It’s just too big,” Flake told Fox News on Wednesday. “We have a bedrock principle of swift justice and if you live in Arizona or anywhere in the 9th Circuit, you just don’t have it.”

Conservatives have never been a fan of the court, which is alleged to have a notorious left wing bias due to 18 of the court’s 25 judges being appointed by Democrats. It has earned the nickname “the nutty 9th” by those on the right due to this, and the fact that many of its rulings have been overturned by the Supreme Court.

The 9th Circuit was created in 1891 when the area was very sparse with only four percent of the population. Today, it contains 20 percent. This is why Flake believes it’s time to split the court up, and lessen its power.

Under Flake’s bill, the new circuit would cover Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona and Alaska, leaving the 9th with three Pacific states as well as the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam.

The problem, as Flake mentions, is that the judges of the 9th Circuit will not want to give up their jurisdiction.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that doctors must be permitted to talk to their patients about guns, delivering a blow to gun-rights advocates who claim the doctor conversations threaten to infringe Second Amendment protections.

In a 10-1 decision, the appeals court ruled that the law — The Firearms Owners’ Privacy Act — violates the First Amendment rights of doctors.

In 2011, Florida lawmakers passed the National Rifle Association-backed bill, nicknamed the “physician gag law.” Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed the bill into law in June of that year, according to the University of Miami Law Review:

[T]he Act provides that a doctor “should refrain from” asking a patient about firearm ownership, unless she believes “in good faith” that the “information is relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety, or the safety of others.” Additionally, according to the Act, doctors “should refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination.”

The legislation was immediately subjected to lawsuits, namely from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, all of which saw the law as unconstitutional. And in 2013, U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke enjoined the state of Florida from implementing the legislation, arguing the law is in violation of the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague.

However, a three-judge panel reversed Cooke’s order in 2014, upholding the constitutionality of the law, sending the legal battle to a higher court.

This week’s ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals went against that panel’s decision and the judges noted that there is no evidence — in their view — that doctors asking about firearms limits patients’ Second Amendment rights.

“Florida does not have carte blanche to restrict the speech of doctors and medical professionals on a certain subject without satisfying the demands of heightened scrutiny,” the majority opinion reads.

The opinion continues, via NPR:

As part of their medical practices, some doctors routinely ask patients about various potential health and safety risks, including household chemicals, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, swimming pools, and firearms. A number of leading medical organizations, and some of their members, believe that unsecured firearms in the home increase risks of injury, especially for minors and those suffering from depression or dementia. In an effort to prevent and reduce firearm-related deaths and injuries, particularly to children, the American Medical Association encourages its members to inquire as to the presence of household firearms as a part of childproofing the home and to educate patients to the dangers of firearms to children. The Florida law was passed in 2011, and targeted pediatricians who asked parents about firearms in the home. Under its provisions, doctors can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, and can lose their medical licenses for discussing guns with patients.

The court upheld portions of the law that explicitly block doctors from discriminating against patients who own guns. For example, the act reads: “A health care provider or health care facility may not discriminate against a patient based solely upon the patient’s exercise of the constitutional right to own and possess firearms or ammunition.”

The NRA has weighed in on the legal battle, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In 2015, the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action sent lawmakers a letter on the matter.

“Physicians interrogating and lecturing parents and children about guns is not about gun safety,” the letter reads. “It is a political agenda to ban guns. Parents do not take their children to physicians for a political lecture against the ownership of firearms, they go there for medical care.”

One of the judges in the majority, William Pryor, whom President Donald Trump had mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee, addressed the Second Amendment argument in a separate statement of his own.

“I write separately to reiterate that our decision is about the First Amendment, not the Second. The Second Amendment ‘guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons,'” he wrote, according to NPR. “[B]ut the profound importance of the Second Amendment does not give the government license to violate the right to free speech under the First Amendment.”

He went on to connect his position against the FOPA to protecting religious liberty:

Think of everything the government might seek to ban between doctor and patient as supposedly “irrelevant” to the practice of medicine. Without the protection of free speech, the government might seek to ban discussion of religion between doctor and patient. The state could stop a surgeon from praying with his patient before surgery or punish a Christian doctor for asking patients if they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior or punish an atheist for telling his patient that religious belief is delusional.

The Florida governor, according to WLRN, is reviewing the court’s decision.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!After the 9th Circuit Court’s ruling on the so-called ”Muslim ban”, Most Reverend Joe Vasquez, Bishop of Austin, Texas, and Chair of the Committee on Migration issued a press release in support of the 3-0 decision.

Unfortunately, the bishop is pushing a social justice agenda with little to no reference to the Bible or any traditionally Catholic teachings. So, here is my point-by-point dissection of his statement:

”We welcome the decision of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.”

Unnecessary lead with opinion without stating basis of opinion first. The bishop – who is charged with the spiritual (and then material) well-being of those entrusted to his care should not be offering endorsements of court decisions without a basis in Scripture or Church teaching. To do so is to speak outside of his office as Shepherd.

”We respect the rule of law and the American judicial process.”

As we – Catholics and non-Catholics, citizens and immigrants – all should! But not all do, particularly those who are not familiar with American history and laws.

”We remain steadfast in our commitment to resettling refugees…”

Yes, as many as are practical to resettle, and as many as are admitted by the country in which we live… but we should not be urging completely open doors, as that is as imprudent as not locking your doors and windows and inviting every passerby to come into your house at every hour of the day or night.

”…and all those fleeing persecution.”

Then why haven’t we been focused on the Coptic Christians and other religious minorities that were being beheaded, having churches burned, and their women kidnapped? If we are one big human family, isn’t the Church of Christ even more so supposed to be one? If so, where was the support then? Why has this become an issue now, simply because of the misnomer of it being a ”Muslim ban”?

”At this time, we remain particularly dedicated to ensuring that affected refugee and immigrant families are not separated…”

This is an attempt to broaden the scope of the so-called ”Muslim ban” to head-off any objections to attempts to limit immigration (legal or otherwise) from Latin American countries. ”Separation of family members” has been the favored argument against deportation of illegal immigrants, under the false belief that adults who entered the country illegally would be deported, yet their children who were born here would be taken away from them.

This is a false argument on two counts: one, many of these children of illegal immigrants are themselves illegally here – this is the main crux of the DREAM Act (providing education for children who are illegal immigrants because they were under-aged when their parents sneaked-in) – and therefore should be deported as well; and two, children of illegal immigrants are always encouraged to stay with their parents. Nobody is saying ”you’re a citizen and you MUST stay here while we take your mother and father back to their home country.”

”… and that they continue to be welcomed to our country. We will continue to welcome the newcomer as it is a vital part of our Catholic faith and an enduring element of our American values and tradition.”

Nobody is saying to end all immigration. The main argument is how to enact proper administration and enforcement of immigration laws. We welcome legal immigrants as we welcome invited guests into our home, and we welcome their family members as we welcome unexpected guests to a party (i.e., a ”+1” that was a last-minute addition). However – in Jesus’s own words – ”Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber… A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy.” (John 10:1,10a). These thieves and robbers are not to be welcomed and excused and rewarded for bad behavior.

Yes, we welcome the newcomer who follows the rules, appreciates their new home, and wishes to add to the culture. But those who flout our laws, protest and denounce our country and cling to their old ways – particularly those ways and ideas that were responsible for destroying their prior home! – do not add, but rather ”steal” from this country and its citizens. Such a person is not acting like a member of a loving family, but is instead acting like a divider, an insurrectionist, and – in the numbers they have already appeared – as part of a conquering army. Regarding such people, a nation has a right to resist and its leaders (political and spiritual) have a duty to protect against.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway had harsh words for Democratic leaders and protesters alike for digging their heels in on every decision President Donald Trump makes.

Speaking on Fox News Thursday morning, Conway slammed the Democrats for promising to protest Trump’s Supreme Court nominee before they even knew who his pick would be. “The Democratic party, we’re seeing it unravel in front of our eyes, and we’re seeing it be revealed in front of our eyes,” Conway said. “A bunch of crybabies who say that they’re going to oppose a Supreme Court nominee before they even know the person’s name and his academic credentials and impeccable judicial record.”

Conway added the Democrats have held up Trump’s cabinet nominees, specifically the secretary of treasury, and said it was going to affect all working Americans. “They are holding up our nominees to the cabinet, I was told yesterday this is the longest the nation has gone without a secretary of the treasury at least in modern times,” she stated. “For those who actually go to work in the morning and need the dollar to flourish, we need a Secretary of Treasury to be running things.”

“This obstinance and obstruction is the modern Democratic Party. I think it’s going to cost them because they’re hysterical about everything now. There’s no gradation of hysteria, everything makes them cry and scream,” Conway said.



Before Trump announced his Supreme Court nominee, Democratic leaders had already promised a fight. They continued that threat after Trump announced his nominee on Tuesday, Judge Neil Gorsuch. On Wednesday, Democrats in the Senate Finance Committee refused to show up to their committee vote on Trump’s health and treasury nominees, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) and Steven Mnuchin. Senate Republicans in the committee had to suspend the committee rules in order to vote on the picks to push them through the committee.During President Trump’s pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox’s Bill O’Reilly, the President appeared to compare actions by the United States to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin. In response to O’Reilly’s criticism of the Russian leader, Trump says that there are a lot of killers in the world and asks if our country’s innocent enough to critique other nations. Alexander Vershbow, former NATO Deputy Secretary General and former U.S. Ambassador to both NATO and Russia, joins Dana Loesch to offer his opinion on the current state of Russia–U.S. relations.

Every reasonable person knows that every government and every president takes certain measures when it comes to the laws of the country they are ruling and USA is not any different. What is different today is that when ex president Obama deported more immigrants than any other president in American history – no one. Absolutely NO ONE stood up to say anything. Not one person protested about it. Instead, many chose to be quiet because ”he was doing his job.” And I understand, he was. But what irritates me today is that the new POTUS wants to follow up with the same laws that every and each president has done and suddenly everyone wants to protest and has something to say. Suddenly, everyone wants to march and shut down businesses because they want the American government to feel what would be like without immigrants. Are you effing kidding me? Why now? Why today when back in 2005, 2006 many undocumented immigrants including mothers, fathers, teenagers and even children needed your support and voice? Why are you standing today when many have been deporting even if they had a speeding ticket and was the reason why they were deported. What makes this president different from Obama, or Bush? Because he has said how he feels about immigrants, or muslims? How do we know if the others didn’t feel the same towards minorities?

I, as a minority within a minority individual, who immigrated this country when I was 12 and did live in fear, did fight my battles and succeed call all of you who want to fight against deportations today FAKE. LIARS. MEDIOCRES and ridiculously childish people who think will get anything out of this moronic behavior. I can’t believe that feeding your ego by posting a picture of you in your social network will make you feel like a hero. I can’t believe that you need to protest today, but not before because you want to follow what everyone else is doing and is easier to walk with many than to walk alone. I call you, each of you hypocrites for wanting to stand today and not yesterday hoping that tomorrow will remember your worthless efforts.”Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add ’within the limits of the law’ because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.” ~ Thomas Jefferson

The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for three generations. By carefully molding public thoughts and opinions with an iron fist they now have a cult following from the vast majority of their brain washed subjects. Any freedom loving hold-outs must jealously shield their thoughts or face a harsh punishment, even death. The only religion allowed, which all must follow, is love of the Republic staring the Kim family. Entire families, from grandchildren to grandparents, are eradicated if a Bible or other non approved book is found. Should a person not show the proper amount of zeal for the government they are sent to the reeducation mines. Not an euphemism. Escape form North Korea and your remaining family will be properly punished.

On February 16, 2017, the Washington supreme court ,with aid from the U.S. supreme court, removed the rights of its citizens the free participate of religion. Beyond just denying the practice of freedom of religion, the court is willing to pierce the corporate veil and impose individual liability even in the absence of traditional justification: no fraud committed, no commingling of funds, etc. Personal financial ruin looms if a person fails to practice religion in a court mandated way. Will it be jail time if a person refuses to comply?

The Peoples Republic of America is on the horizon, our rights are not inalienable.Just two weeks after a massive kerfuffle surrounding the cross that was placed atop a Knightstown Christmas tree broke out and residents of the Indiana town erected crosses of their own in protest, the Christian symbol is back on the tree.

Using a truck lift, a man placed the cross back on the Christmas tree Thursday, according to WISH-TV. Though the cross is not at the top of the tree, as it was prior to being taken down, it is near the top, and it will be lit at night.

A motion to request a preliminary injunction was lifted to permit the cross, as long as it wasn’t in its former position, Ken Falk, director of the Indiana branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the local news outlet.

This entire issue started because of one resident who filed a lawsuit against the town, claiming the display infringed his civil liberties. So for those still concerned about a benign cross ornament stepping on someone’s constitutional rights, there is no need to fear. Falk said the ACLU-Indiana still plans to move forward with its lawsuit, once it is determined whether or not a cross being on the tree but not the top of it is unconstitutional.

As TheBlaze previously reported, the initial removal of the cross on Dec. 12 was met with great frustration from the Knightstown residents, hundreds of whom put out their own displays featuring the Christian symbol.

Though residents said they respected the man’s complaint about the cross, they aren’t giving up the fight.

“Keep Christ in Christmas no matter where you’re at,” Lora Lewman, who attended a pro-cross rally in the town square, told WISH.

But Falk, of course, sees it differently.

“The cross is not a Christmas symbol,” he said. “The cross is the preeminent symbol of Christianity and it reminds Christians not of the secular trappings of Christmas, but of the crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus.”Community Rules

The inmates took four correctional officers hostage, and while three of the officers were eventually released, one was found deceased at the scene. During the takeover, the group of inmates made various telephone calls to parties outside the detention center, including the Delaware News Journal.

According to KYW-TV, who obtained a copy of the audio, one of the inmates can be heard blaming the hostage situation on Trump, explaining the men were fearful after his election.

“We’re trying to explain our reasons for doing what we’re doing. Donald Trump, everything that he did, all the things that he’s doing now…We know that the institution’s gonna change for the worse,” the inmate said. He did not name any specific actions from Trump that led the inmates to conclude that.

In the calls provided to KYW-TV, the inmates also reportedly referenced the need for more education and rehabilitation within the prison system.

Inmates in the C building of the James T. Vaughn Correction Center in Smyrna, Delaware took the officers hostage Wednesday morning, resulting in a hostage standoff situation that lasted nearly 20 hours.

The inmate who referenced President Trump can be heard below, courtesy of KYW-TV.Chris Benguhe, writer for the Catholic Sun and author of “The Best of a Better View,” joins Tomi Lahren to explain the motivation behind the vocal political involvement of today’s Hollywood stars.

A successful coach and five-time NBA champion as a former player, Kerr was asked about Trump’s executive order following the Warriors’ win over the Portland Trail Blazers Sunday night. And in his answer, he recalled losing his father, Malcom Kerr, in 1984.

At the time of his death, Malcom Kerr was president of American University in Beirut where he worked to bring together those of different religious faiths. He was assassinated by two gunmen outside of his office when he was just 52 and his son was a freshman basketball player for the University of Arizona.

“As someone who [had] a family member who was a victim of terrorism — I lost my father — if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, really going against the principles of what this country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way to go about it,” Kerr said Sunday night.

“If anything, we can’t be breeding anger and terror so I’m completely against what’s happening,” he added. “I think it’s a horrible idea, and I feel for all the people who are affected, families are being torn apart, and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world.”

Kerr, who was named NBA Coach of the Year for 2015-16, said that while he has talked with his team about “various issues” often, due to the team’s schedule and games, he has not discussed with them Trump’s latest executive order.

Massive protests broke out at airports nationwide as refugees and visa-holders who were already en route to the U.S. at the time of Trump’s decree were detained upon entering the country. Lawyers worked from the floors of terminals to help those barred from entering the country – or simply coming home.

Not all who were barred from entering the U.S. are refuges. Nazanin Zinouri, who graduated from Clemson University last year with a Ph.D. in industrial engineering, was in Tehran visiting her family when she heard the news of Trump’s executive order. Although she’s lived in the U.S. for seven years, she was barred from returning home once she arrived in Washington, D.C.

A New York federal judge did issue an emergency stay late Saturday night which allowed refugees with a valid U.S. visa to avoid immediate deportation.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!With Donald Trump as commander in chief, more than a quarter of of military personnel surveyed admitted that they worry about the future of their jobs.

According to the Military Times/Institute for Military and Veterans Families poll, more than 27 percent of active-duty service members said Trump could negatively affect their job or future missions. That concern was even higher among officers (39 percent) and women (55 percent).

Approximately 1 in 5 troops polled also said they are unlikely to re-enlist under Trump’s administration. And 54 percent of military personnel who voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also said they are unlikely to re-enlist.

However, 54 percent of service members are confident that Trump will be able to tackle the threat of the Islamic State in the Middle East.

The poll also found that of the 2,790 surveyed, 56 percent of troops are confident that Trump can improve pay and benefits. And more than 60 percent said Trump will work with Congress to find a solution to defense spending caps.

Of those polled, 80 percent voted in the presidential election. Approximately 12 percent of the service members said they did not vote due to “barriers to casting their ballot,” the poll found. Only 8 percent of those polled declined to vote.

And of those who voted, 51 percent said they picked Trump.

Trump was heavily criticized during the election for his attack on a Gold Star family that supported Clinton. But he also promised to “take care of our vets” and fix the VA.

His messaging seemed to pay off; as the Chicago Tribune reported, swing-state counties with a high concentration of veterans turned red for Trump.

Paronto explains that people who get on television and put down other veteran services are “the worst human beings on the face of the earth.” He compares the events of Yemen with the events of Benghazi, stating that in Yemen they received all the help they asked for. In Benghazi they received no help and were “left behind because of political purposes,” and no one was left behind in Yemen.

An engine plant in Chihuahua, and a transmission plant in Irapuato.

The plants will cost $2.5 billion in construction costs, and will results in 3,800 workers upon completion.

While this news may seem like a sudden turn away from an American jobs centered plan seemingly arranged by President Donald Trump, Ford has actually had these plans on the books since 2015, and had never intended to veer from them. The confusion, says CNN Money, is likely due to news of a canceled plan for another Mexico factory being released on the same day as the announcement of another plant being opened in Michigan.

Ford got a lot of attention last month when it dropped its plans to build a $1.6 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. But the small car production originally planned for the discontinued San Luis Potosi plant is shifting to an existing Ford Mexican assembly plant, not returning to the U.S. Ford (F) never claimed to be bringing work back, but onlookers could be forgiven for getting confused. On that same day, Ford announced plans for a $700 million investment and 700 new jobs to build electric and self-driving cars at a Michigan plant.

The truth is, the plans for the Michigan plant – while being hailed as a “vote of confidence” in Trump’s new economy by Ford CEO Mark Fields – was never supposed to go to Mexico in the first place, and was always intended to be build in the states.

Trump and Ford have had a tumultuous relationship in the past. During the 2016 elections, Trump targeted Ford as one of the companies that planned to move all its jobs to Mexico, and threatened to hit Ford with a 35% tax on all their products that came to the U.S.. Fields denied any intention to move all of their factories to Mexico, and explained that certain lower selling models were going to be made in Mexico, to make room for more lucrative models to be made here in America.

However, since Trump won the election, his view of the car company has been more sunny. During his first two days in office, Trump invited CEO’s of various auto companies to the White House. Among them was Fields, who Trump singled out for praise saying “Mark was so nice with the plant coming back, I wanted to sit next to him.”White House chief of staff Reince Priebus got into a contentious interview with NBC News host Chuck Todd during an interview on “Meet the Press” Sunday over a discussion on President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on immigration.

Todd came out of the gate and pressed Priebus over why the administration didn’t implement a 72-hour “grace period” with their executive order to ensure that airport detainments didn’t happen and that any refugee in transit to the U.S. with a valid U.S. visa would be able to safely arrive stateside.

Priebus replied by saying that terrorists would exploit the grace period, which is why it’s better to just “rip off the band-aid,” Priebus said.

Todd continued to press Priebus on the details of the executive order, which, signed by Trump on Friday, temporarily halts the U.S. refugee resettlement program for 120 days and temporarily bars people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.

Todd inquired why the executive order also applied to green card holders from those countries, which are legal U.S. residents. The policy was condemned in the media over the weekend, but Priebus explained that those seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Sudan and Somalia — were actually identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries that harbor terrorism.

“This is something that 75 to 80 percent of Americans out there agree with,” Priebus said. “We don’t want people traveling back and forth to one of these seven countries that harbor terrorists to be traveling freely back and forth between the United States and those countries.”

After some back-and-forth, Todd began grilling Priebus over the constitutionality of adding another “hurdle” for green card holders to jump over when traveling out of the U.S. But when Priebus attempted to answer, Todd kept interrupting him.

“If you had just slowed down for a second and listen, I could answer your question,” Priebus said.

“You’ve twice confused me so I’m just trying to understand the clarity,” Todd shot back.

“It’s because you don’t stop talking, Chuck,” Priebus snapped. “Let me answer the question.”

The duo continued to argue back-and-forth over green card holders and Trump’s executive order. Todd also grilled Priebus over why Saudi Arabia and Pakistan weren’t included in the list of countries whose people would be temporarily banned from entering the U.S.

“Perhaps other countries need to be added,” Priebus said. “But this is all done for the protection of Americans.”

Priebus explained that the seven countries in the executive order were targeted first because they have been identified multiple times by Congress and the Obama administration as being the countries that pose the great threat to American in terms of terrorism.

Watch the full interview below:

According to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have proved to be “relentless enemies” of Israel.

That’s what Cruz said earlier this week, following the Obama administration supporting an anti-Israel resolution at the United Nations last week and after Kerry gave a 70-minute speech on Wednesday rebuking Israel for being a sovereign state.

“Like bitter clingers, President Obama and Secretary Kerry are spending every last minute of this administration wreaking havoc domestically and abroad. With their last breath in office, they have struck at Israel, through the United Nations and through today’s disgraceful speech,” Cruz said in a statement. “These acts are shameful.”

“They are designed to secure a legacy, and indeed they have: history will record and the world will fully understand Obama and Kerry as relentless enemies of Israel,” he added.

According to Cruz, Obama and Kerry intentionally designed their foreign policy to “weaken and marginalize” Israel, while “emboldening” Israel’s enemies.

Cruz said he believes that Kerry’s Wednesday speech, where he called Israel’s government the “most right-wing extreme” in Israeli history, will “enflame rising anti-Semitism” in Europe and across the world.

The Texas senator continued:

It will encourage the mullahs who hate Israel and hate America. And it will facilitate ‘law-fare,’ growing legal assaults on Israel through transnational legal fora. “Kerry’s speech drew a stunning moral equivalence between our great ally Israel and the Palestinian Authority, currently formed in a ‘unity’ government with the vicious terrorists of Hamas. Secretary Kerry declared the Hamas regime in Gaza ‘radical,’ in the same way he declared the duly-elected government of Israel ‘extreme.’ He declared vicious terrorism sponsored by Hamas equal to Israeli settlements in West Bank. And he equated Israel’s celebration of its birth with the Palestinian description of this event as the ‘disaster.’ His speech attempted to lay out an historic and seismic shift towards the delegitimization of our ally, Israel, and the further empowerment of the Palestinian Authority. “Kerry’s central conclusion, that ‘Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both’ is an inanity that passes as profound only in Ivory Tower faculty lounges. There are roughly 50 majority-Muslim countries in the world. There is one — only one — Jewish state. And yet, for Kerry and Obama, that is too much. The Israeli Knesset has 17 elected Arab members. It has Muslim members and Christian members. In contrast, one searches in vain for Muslim countries that have elected Jewish representatives.

In fact, the Obama adminsitation’s recent policies toward Israel is a true reflection of the ideology of both Obama and Kerry, Cruz alleged.

“It is a sign of their radicalism and refusal to defend American interests, that Obama and Kerry choose to attack the only inclusive democracy in the Middle East — a strong, steadfast ally of America — while turning a blind eye to the Islamic terrorism that grows daily,” he wrote.

And it will likely hurt them in the end, the former Republican presidential candidate said, as the extreme foreign policy position will backfire and inspire “bipartisan repudiation of their radical anti-Israel agenda.”

According to Politico, congressional Republicans in both the Senate and House are working feverishly to introduce bipartisan legislation next week that declares America’s support for Israel, while possibly sanctioning the U.N.

However, Cruz wants more. Ever since the U.N. passed their anti-Israel resolution last week, Cruz has called on Congress to strip the U.N. of all U.S. funds. Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) has also called for a similar measure.In all of 2016, nearly 90,000 Christians were martyred around the world, according to a new study by an Italian research group.

According to the Center for Studies on New Religions, which plans to release its full report next month, a Christian was martyred about once every six minutes in 2016, making them the most persecuted religious group in the world.

Massimo Introvigne, director of CENSUR, told Vatican Radio last week that approximately 70 percent of the martyred Christians were from “tribal villages” in Africa because Christians often refuse to take up arms during conflicts.

The other 30 percent, according to the study, were Christians who fell victim to terrorism or governmental persecution.

Still, the number of Christians who were martyred in 2016 is likely more than 90,000 because the study was unable to include data from China or India, two east Asian countries that have large Christian populations, because of the “underground” nature of churches in those countries.

There is some positive news, however, according to RT.com. The number of Christians being martyred decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 from 105,000 to 90,000.

(H/T: Relevant Magazine)Violence erupted inside Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday after an opposition leader was accused of working for the Kremlin.

Ukraine’s relationship with Russia has fraught with complication and controversy since time immemorial. During the Stalin era, many Ukranians hated Russia so intensely that many Ukranians joined the advancing German army during Operation Barbossa.

In fairness to the Ukranians, the Russians under Stalin had forcibly starved tens of millions of Ukranians to death prior to that point. However, today there remains a large ethnic Russian population that wields considerable political influence in Ukraine and that seeks to bring Ukraine back wholly under Moscow’s sphere of influence. The resulting political conflicts can get considerably more violent than Americans are accustomed to seeing.

Watch the fight break out below:Don’t bring a knife to a gun fight.

That’s the lesson one robber has recently learned the hard way. Footage of an attempted robbery has surfaced at a store where a man checking out groceries at a store decided it would be wise to pull a large chef’s knife.

Discretely pushing the point against the back of the cashier, he — presumably — tells the woman to empty the cash drawer and she complies, beginning to hand over the bills. What the robber didn’t anticipate is that the man behind him was more than prepared for situations like this.

A stranger in a white shirt draws a pistol and points it straight at the knife wielding thief, and after some words, the robber removes the knife from the cashier’s back, holds it into the air, and drops the cash in his hand back into the register.

More and more stories are coming out of good people with guns stopping bad guys in their tracks. For instance, one gun store owner prevented a robbery in his store by drawing and firing on two foolish armed crooks, killing one of them. There was also another recent example of a good samaritan who saved a deputies life when he drew his sidearm as a man was attempting to beat the deputy to death.Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, found herself in controversy this week after she cited the “Bowling Green Massacre” as an example of refugees coming to America and inciting terrorism during an interview defending Trump’s recent executive order on immigration and refugees.

However, the “Bowling Green Massacre” never happened — and mainstream media outlets were quick to point that out. Conway, she later clarified, was referencing the Bowling Green terrorists, two Iraqi refugees who were sentenced in 2013 for admitting to attacking U.S. soldiers in Iraq in addition to attempting to send weapons to Al Qaeda.

Still, Conway’s clarification didn’t stop Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Bill and Hillary, from taking a jab at her.

Writing on Twitter Friday, addressing the recent attempted terror attack at Paris’ Louvre museum, Clinton instructed her followers to not “make up” attacks” — an obvious jab at Conway.

“Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack …or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don’t make up attacks,” Clinton wrote.

Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack …or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017

The tweet has been retweeted more than 35,000 times and “liked” nearly 100,000 times.

But while Clinton didn’t mention Conway or direct the tweet to her, Conway knew Clinton was taking a jab at her. Conway was quick to respond — and remind Clinton of one of her mother’s famous lies.

“Bosnia lie a Great reminder,” Conway wrote back, referencing the time Hillary Clinton lied about landing in a helicopter in Bosnia under sniper fire in 1996 when she was first lady.

Then Conway dropped a bomb on Clinton, reminding her that Hillary lost to Trump in last year’s presidential election.

“And 2 @ChelseaClinton & others, you can’t “invent” quality candidates either,” Conway wrote. “I misspoke; you lost the election.”During a meeting of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) surprisingly advocated for less government interference, and on behalf of our military veterans no less.

The conversation started when Warren asked Sgt. Major of the Army Daniel Dailey about veterans who learn to drive trucks in the most hazardous of environments.

“The Army trains thousands of soldiers every year to drive trucks in the most difficult conditions: In combat. With hazardous cargo. At night. In sandstorms. You name it. If it’s tough, you train people to do it,” began Warren. “So you would say those folks are pretty good truck drivers?”

“I would say in my opinion they’re the best in the world, ma’am,” replied Dailey.

“Best truck drivers in the world. That sounds like an expert opinion on that,” continued Warren. “So with those kinds of skills, when they transition from the Army, it is reasonable to assume they could sign on with any long-haul trucking company and hit the interstate the next day, right?”

Dailey responded that while they are more than qualified in terms of skills, veterans typically are not immediately qualified for civilian positions they would excel at due to governmental red tape.

“It’s a complicated matter,” answered Dailey. “First and foremost, one, we have to credential them, those young men and women. Two, we have to work the requirements of each and every one of the 54 states and territories that license those trucks.”

“So we have a state and national licensing problem here, and we can’t take the world’s best truck drivers and just automatically move them into civilian truck driving jobs,” said Warren.

Warren also questioned Master Chief Petty Officer Steven S. Giordano of the Navy, and Chief Master Sgt. of the Air Force James A. Cody along a similar vein, wondering if the same could said for those veterans who are highly trained air traffic controllers. Troops that direct aircraft worth millions of dollars, filled with military men and women in sometimes hazardous conditions. The same in the Navy, where soldiers are taught how to use high tech equipment in high stress positions. However, many still run into licensing problems.

This is a problem that Warren wants to fix, and she sums it up on her public Facebook page nicely.

If you can drive a military truck in combat, with hazardous cargo, at night, through a sandstorm, then you can drive a commercial truck on an interstate. If you can dock or anchor a 10,000 ton warship under extreme stress, you can do the same thing for a small commercial ship. We spend hundreds of millions to train our service members to do highly skilled jobs, and they are the best at what they do. But too many still struggle to transition into civilian jobs because they don’t have the right certifications and licenses – even when they’re being hired to do the exact same thing under much less taxing conditions. We’ve made progress on this issue over the last few years, and I don’t want to lower civilian standards – but I don’t believe for one second that these individuals aren’t ready to do the equivalent civilian jobs the day they leave the military. They shouldn’t end up buried in paperwork or dump their money into a shady for-profit college to do it. Let’s fix this problem.

During the broadcast, Doc Thompson and The Morning Blaze crew look at pictures of food for Khaled’s app of the week segment that they tried to enter in. Upon sharing of the images, Kris Cruz, call screener and producer of The Morning Blaze decided to share a picture of what he had for dinner last night.

The show didn’t get any better for Kris after that as The Morning Blaze crew decides to point out the different creepy factors of the pictures.

The capitalized typed word “DRIVETHRU” was followed by “FCK U.”

The deputy contacted the Schlotzsky’s in Seguin and complained, a Texas Sheriff’s Deputies Facebook post noted. “I’m disgusted and disappointed,” the poster wrote.

“Law enforcement or regular citizen, young or old, man or woman, this is disrespectful to ANYONE,” the poster added.

To Schlotzsky’s credit, action was decidedly swift. Within hours the employee was fired.

Kyle Thomas, the restaurant’s operating manager, extended an invitation on Facebook to cater a meal for the sheriff’s office where the deputy who got the receipt works. “Please reach out to me so we can make this right any way possible,” he wrote.

(H/T: Mad World News)I never thought I was going to write about this, but I am completely dissappointed and upset at all of those who call themselves ”friends of undocumented immigrants,” or pro immigration. Every reasonable person knows that every government and every president takes certain measures when it comes to the laws of the country they are ruling and USA is not any different. What is different today is that when ex president Obama deported more immigrants than any other president in American history – no one. Absolutely NO ONE stood up to say anything. Not one person protested about it. Instead, many chose to be quiet because ”he was doing his job.” And I understand, he was. But what irritates me today is that the new POTUS wants to follow up with the same laws that every and each president has done and suddenly everyone wants to protest and has something to say. Suddenly, everyone wants to march and shut down businesses because they want the American government to feel what would be like without immigrants. Are you effing kidding me? Why now? Why today when back in 2005, 2006 many undocumented immigrants including mothers, fathers, teenagers and even children needed your support and voice? Why are you standing today when many have been deporting even if they had a speeding ticket and was the reason why they were deported. What makes this president different from Obama, or Bush? Because he has said how he feels about immigrants, or muslims? How do we know if the others didn’t feel the same towards minorities?

I, as a minority within a minority individual, who immigrated this country when I was 12 and did live in fear, did fight my battles and succeed call all of you who want to fight against deportations today FAKE. LIARS. MEDIOCRES and ridiculously childish people who think will get anything out of this moronic behavior. I can’t believe that feeding your ego by posting a picture of you in your social network will make you feel like a hero. I can’t believe that you need to protest today, but not before because you want to follow what everyone else is doing and is easier to walk with many than to walk alone. I call you, each of you hypocrites for wanting to stand today and not yesterday hoping that tomorrow will remember your worthless efforts.Force Blue Co-Founder Rudy Reyes joins Tomi to share his latest passion project giving warriors a cause and giving the coral reefs some warriors.

Data recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the abortion rate for 2013 was 12.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, half the rate of 1980.

In 2013, 664,435 legal induced abortions took place — a 5 percent drop from 2012. A majority of abortions were performed prior to eight weeks’ gestation, while 1.3 percent occurred at 21 weeks or later.

According to ABC News, the last time the CDC recorded a lower abortion rate was in 1971, two years before the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide.The Left claims you can be anything you want to be — so long as you agree with them and keep quiet.

Baio himself has been poking fun at leftists like Lena Dunham, and encouraging them to keep their word about moving to Canada. He even lobbed some words at MSNBC, calling their “literal crying” the “best television.”

During a recent interview on Fox News with Judge Jeanine, Baio was joined by Baldwin to discuss the reaction seen by the Hollywood elite and their fans to Trump’s victory. Asked if Trump supporters would start coming out in Hollywood now that Trump has won, Baio could only comment on the reaction he was seeing in his neck of the woods.

“I think right now with all this anger, which is just so unbelievable to me,” said Baio. “I mean eight years ago I wasn’t crying, and looking for a dog to hold. I wasn’t looking for somebody with a pin on their shoulder that was a safety person. I sucked it up. We lost. Personally, if I don’t ever work again — and I told you this before judge — and Donald Trump is now President-elect Donald Trump…I’m good.”

“Yes and no,” answered Baldwin to the same question. “I think a lot of Hollywood folks who voted for Trump inevitably will start coming out of the closet so to speak, and Scott and I agree on one thing. We’re two actors — been in the business 30 years — and our biggest driver in support for Mr. Trump has been the economy.”

“Just like Reagan, when everyone was afraid of Reagan, it was the exact same rhetoric,” added Baio. “When the economy turns around, and when the country gets strong again, that’s when you’re going to see all these people come out of the woodwork in Hollywood for Trump.”New Jersey Governor Chris Christie told a New York sports talk radio show that during a recent dinner at the White House to discuss America’s opioid epidemic, President Donald Trump ordered on Christie’s behalf, insisting he get the meatloaf.

Glenn Beck and the guys discuss what, if anything, this anecdote reveals about Trump’s character and whether they would ever attempt a similar dining maneuver.

The actor had installed a camera at The Museum of the Moving Image in New York to demonstrate that President Trump won’t divide us. The museum released a statement that the project has become “a serious and ongoing public safety hazard,” and so they have closed the exhibit.

Doc believes that LaBeouf is using this to divide people even more. He explains that if we want to come together, we must laugh at each other and talk to each other. Doc closes the segment by inviting Michael Moore and Patton Oswald to talk about the real issues.

Six people initially survived, but one of them later died in a hospital.

The British Aerospace 146 short-haul plane, operated by a charter airline named LaMia, declared an emergency and lost radar contact just before 10 p.m. Monday (0300 GMT) because of an electrical failure, aviation authorities said.

The aircraft, which had departed from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was transporting the Chapecoense soccer team from southern Brazil for the first leg Wednesday of a two-game Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional of Medellin.

“What was supposed to be a celebration has turned into a tragedy,” Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez said from the search and rescue command center.

The club said in a brief statement on its Facebook page that “may God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests traveling with our delegation.”

South America’s soccer federation extended its condolences to the entire Chapecoense community and said its president, Alejandro Dominguez, was on his way to Medellin. All soccer activities were suspended until further notice, the organization said in a statement.

Dozens of rescuers working through the night were initially heartened after pulling three passengers alive from the wreckage. But as the hours passed, and heavy rainfall and low visibility grounded helicopters and complicated efforts to reach the mountainside crash site, the mood soured to the point that authorities had to freeze until dusk what was by then a body recovery operation.

Images broadcast on local television showed three passengers arriving to a local hospital in ambulances on stretchers and covered in blankets connected to an IV. Among the survivors was a Chapecoense defender named Alan Ruschel, who doctors said suffered spinal injuries. Two goalkeepers, Danilo and Jackson Follmann, as well as a member of the team’s delegation and a Bolivian flight attendant, were found alive in the wreckage.

But Danilo later died while receiving hospital treatment, team spokesman Andrei Copetti told The Associated Press.

The plane was carrying 72 passengers and nine crew members, aviation authorities said in a statement. Local radio said the same aircraft transported Argentina’s national squad for a match earlier this month in Brazil, and previously had transported Venezuela’s national team.

British Aerospace, which is now known as BAE Systems, says that the first 146-model plane took off in 1981 and that just under 400 — including the successor Avro RJ — were built in total in the U.K. through 2003. It says around 220 of are still in service in a variety of roles, including aerial firefighting and overnight freight services.

Alfredo Bocanegra, the head of Colombia’s aviation authority, said initial reports suggest the aircraft was suffering electrical problems although investigators were also looking into an account from one of the survivors that the plane had run out of fuel about 5 minutes from its expected landing at Jose Maria Cordova airport outside Medellin.

A video published on the team’s Facebook page showed the team readying for the flight earlier Monday in Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos international airport. It wasn’t immediately clear if the team switched planes in Bolivia or just made a stopover with the same plane.

The team, from the small city of Chapeco, was in the middle of a fairy tale season. It joined Brazil’s first division in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s and made it last week to the Copa Sudamericana finals — the equivalent of the UEFA Europa League tournament — after defeating two of Argentina’s fiercest squads, San Lorenzo and Independiente, as well as Colombia’s Junior.

“This morning I said goodbye to them and they told me they were going after the dream, turning that dream into reality,” Chapecoense board member told TV Globo. “The dream was over early this morning.”

The team is so modest that its 22,000-seat arena was ruled by tournament organizers too small to host the final match, which was instead moved to a stadium 300 miles (480 kilometers) to the north in the city of Curitiba.

“This is unbelievable, I am walking on the grass of the stadium and I feel like I am floating,” Copetti told the AP. “No one understands how a story that was so amazing could suffer such a devastating reversal. For many people here reality has still not struck.”

Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave UrbanskiHundreds of residents in a small Mississippi town took part in a demonstration on Saturday to fight back after the town’s mayor was forced to remove a Christian flag flying over a local park.

According to WREG-TV, Mayor Walter Williams of Rienzi, Miss., was forced to remove the Christian flag flying over the town’s Veterans Memorial Park after the Freedom from Religion Foundation threatened the town with a $500,000 lawsuit.

Since the town has just several hundred residents, Williams said his hands were tied.

“I never dreamed that something like this would have happened in a town this small, but it happened,” Williams told WREG.

The predominantly Christian town was not happy with the situation, so they decided to organize a demonstration where they would re-hoist the Christian flag.

“There just comes a point in time when you’ve got to be politically incorrect and take a stand,” event organizer Kevin Nelms told WREG.

“We’re not gonna let other people, or a foundation, or anybody else up in Wisconsin tell us that we can’t fly our flag!” he added “You’re gonna take one down, we’re gonna put a hundred back up.”

So that’s what the residents did on Saturday — they re-hoisted the Christian flag. And although it didn’t stay up there for long, Williams vowed that it would soon fly on the pole again, only this time permanently.

“We’re gonna fly that flag again,” Williams told WREG, “and I’m hoping it’s not going to be long.”

The Freedom from Religion Foundation is an infamous organization that specifically targets towns, cities and the military for instances where they deem the First Amendment has been violated.

But Williams said his town isn’t going down without a fight. He told WREG that he has hired an attorney and will discuss further details of the matter with his town at the next board meeting this Tuesday.Glenn Beck, Pat Gray, Stu Burguiere and Jeff Fisher shed light on a new scary proposal happening in Britain.

Glenn describes the Planned Espionage Act that can jail journalists and whistle blowers as spies has now been introduced as a proposal by the British government. This future proofed Espionage Act puts whistle blowing in the same category as spying for foreign powers.

Glenn explains that sentences would apply even if the leaker wasn’t British or in Britain. He believes that the Wall Street of England really wants this pushed through and believes we’re being setup for a reset in the future.

Along with the many things Trump has promised, he has added the old complaint that saying “Merry Christmas” is going to be the greeting you hear most during the holiday season.

“And Merry Christmas everybody! Merry Christmas. Right? Merry Christmas,” said Trump as the crowd cheered. “They reminded me. We’re going to start saying Merry Christmas again.”

The crowd let Trump know they approved of this very loudly.

“How about all those department stores?” Trump continued. “They have the bells, and they have the red walls, and they have the snow, but they don’t have “Merry Christmas.” I think they’re going to start putting up “Merry Christmas.”

Watch below:

The “war on Christmas” has been a fear amongst many in America for some time. For instance the ACLU has claimed that nativity scenes in public places is a violation of the Constitution, and thus has attempted in the past to force places like courthouses to remove these displays. Even Google, which recognizes the Islamic holiday of Ramadan, has been known to not recognize Christmas as the religious holiday it is, choosing instead to post pictures of toys.

Despite these glaring attacks or dismissals, some h0ld that the war on Christmas is a fabrication created by Fox News.

That Trump is assuming office, Christians and Christmas lovers everywhere, are likely pleased to hear that the holiday will be venerated as they see fit.The most recent leak out of The White House has brought many behind the scenes issues to light. Mainly the fact that what is said, even between the people with the most power in this nation, is not safe. The issue that there is someone in the Trump Administration who is purposely leaking information is extremely disturbing.

Buck Sexton feels that whoever it is really needs to grow up and resign from their position, instead of humiliating innocent leaders just to attempt to get their own political beliefs known. Buck states how in holding these beliefs we should be ethical, man up, resign and address the public — don’t commit subterfuge and subversion.

Taking a break from politics to discuss a topic closer to home and more relevant to our lives. This is not marriage “advice” — I’m not equipped to be doling advice out — but it is an observation.

These days it’s common to hear people say that our marriages should be “equal.” An “equal partnership,” they call it, which makes it sound like you’re starting a law firm together rather than entering into a sacred covenant. I think this notion of marriage is false, and from my own experience I can say that our marriage has never once been helped by trying to “make things equal.” That’s what squabbling siblings worry about, not loving and self-giving spouses.

Marriage cannot be equal, anyway, because the spouses are not equal. Two things are equal when they are the same, but a husband and wife can never be the same, nor should they try to be. That doesn’t mean one is better than the other, just that they are unique. An apple is not equal to an orange, but nobody would claim that one or the other is inherently superior.

If husband and wife are not equal, then they will not contribute in ways that are exactly equal. They do different things, bring different skills and perspectives to the table, and shoulder different burdens in different ways. These things can’t be exactly quantified and compared, and whenever we attempt to do that, we are being selfish and childish, and harming our marriages in the process.

If it ever crosses our mind that we are shouldering more of a particular burden or bringing more to the table in some area or another, we ought to delight in the fact. We ought to take joy in serving the other, and we ought to be eager to serve more and do more. I’m not saying I’m perfect in this regard — far from it — but I at least know, intellectually, that this is how it’s supposed to be.

I think many of our marriages fall apart in this culture because we’re so obsessed with equality and so averse to things like duty, responsibility, sacrifice, and service. But a marriage that has no concern for equality and, instead, is fueled by the sacrificial love of both spouses, is the kind of marriage that will survive while so many others collapse around them in a cloud of immaturity and selfishness.

The night of the election, we saw jaws drop and tears flow from news anchors and the media at large. Since November 9th, we have seen routine riots, beatings, and other demonstrations. Comparisons of Trump to Adolf Hitler are common. The Left has no idea what to do.

.

But even a month after Trump’s inauguration, the Left cannot help themselves from continuously looking more and more unhinged. This week, liberals are still comparing Trump to the worst possible atrocities in history. For example, last Friday, former Virginia congressman and current Democrat gubernatorial candidate Tom Perriello compared Trump’s election to 9/11, and after the Washington Free Beacon published footage, Perriello was forced to apologize Wednesday.

.

“The election of Donald Trump was a little bit like, you know, a political and constitutional Sept. 11 for us, if I can be honest.” Perriello said on a campaign stop in Afton, Virginia. His apology came through Twitter, and Perriello explained that he meant that Trump’s election was a historical blow to the Democratic establishment.

.

Keep in mind that Perriello’s comment occurred in Virginia, where 200 people died on 9/11 when a plane crashed into the Pentagon. More than 2,000 died in New York. Many others were killed when Flight 93 crashed into the ground in Pennsylvania. The comparison between the election of someone you don’t support in no way compares to one death, let alone thousands.

.

But Perriello is not alone in his insensitive, asinine remarks. Thomas Friedman, a Leftist columnist for the New York Times, claimed in his piece that Trump’s election belongs in the same category as 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Friedman was addressing the resignation of national security advisor Mike Flynn on Monday, which brought speculation that the administration has ties to the Russian government, a claim that has still brought no evidence. He likened the election, considering these accusations against Flynn, to a foreign attack.

.

Friedman’s piece reads, “Ladies and gentlemen, we were attacked on Dec. 7, 1941 [Pearl Harbor], we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, and we were attacked on Nov. 8, 2016. That most recent attack didn’t involve a horrible loss of lives, but it was devastating in its own way.”

.

This is from the same person who has repeatedly claimed that America should be more like China. He said nothing about Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, and its secret side deals, including sending a plane filled with cash in the dead of night, in order to be untraceable.

.

Now, suddenly, the Left cares about national security. But their feigning interest in America’s safety is about nothing more than trying to discredit Trump, because they have no clue how to deal with his election. They cannot deal with the idea that they are losing power. Little do they realize that their loss of power will continue if they continue to act this way.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President-elect Donald Trump plans to form a new trade-focused council with the goal of boosting American manufacturing.

The White House National Trade Council will be led by Peter Navarro, director of trade and industrial policy.

The council will exist “to make American manufacturing great again and to provide every American the opportunity to work in a decent job at a decent wage,” as well as shrinking the “trade deficit,” expanding growth and stopping jobs from leaving the U.S., Trump’s transition team said in a statement. The “Buy America, Hire America” program will focus on Trump’s “America first” trade strategy after he takes office Jan. 20.

The NTC will advise Trump on strategies for trade negotiations, as well as assist unemployed U.S. workers.

“I read one of Peter’s books on America’s trade problems years ago and was impressed by the clarity of his arguments and thoroughness of his research,” Trump said in statement. “He has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class. He will fulfill an essential role in my administration as a trade advisor.”

Navarro, a UC-Irvine professor and Harvard economist, said he welcomes the chance to affect U.S. trade policies.

“I am deeply honored for the opportunity to serve the President-elect and this nation and to advise on policies to rebalance our trade, rebuild our industrial base, and restore America’s comprehensive national power by making America great again,” he said.I have said it before and I will say it again. It is pathetic that Congressional Republicans, after SEVEN YEARS of promising Obamacare repeal, did not have a plan ready for how to actually handle the repeal. I know Trump says a plan is coming next month, and Paul Ryan says a plan is coming next week, but that’s starting to sound a bit like the old ”the check is in the mail” type of promise.

.

But maybe the GOP’s incompetence will actually work out. Because despite all the GOP’s foot-dragging and hand-wringing, two events this week signaled the beginning of the end of Obamacare:

.

1. Health insurer Humana announced that it will end its participation in Obamacare exchanges later this year. Why? Because participation in the exchanges simply isn’t profitable, no matter how much health insurers raise premiums. Some counties, and even a few states, have only one or two health insurers participating in the exchanges. So what happens if no other insurers fill the void left by Humana and/or other insurers also drop out of the exchanges (Aetna’s CEO said this week that Aetna would decide in April whether to participate in the exchanges)? First, consumers who do not buy policies on the exchanges are not eligible for subsidies, and will bear the full cost of those policies (which many people simply cannot afford). Second, citizens in number of counties, and maybe even some states, will be legally required to buy insurance it is either impossible for them to buy, or that they cannot use because no providers reasonably close to where they live are in the networks of the health insurers that the consumers can buy policies from.

.

2. The second big event this week is the IRS’s announcement that it will not require taxpayers to disclose on their tax returns whether they had ”qualifying health insurance”. What does this mean? It means that there is no one enforcing the individual mandate. While the IRS’s decision in this regard may be legally questionable, the result will be that people who in prior years either bought policies to avoid the shared responsibility payment, or just paid the shared responsibility payment, will now do neither.

.

So what is the net result of these two events? As many recognize, Obamacare only has even the appearance of working because young, healthy people pay for overpriced insurance they likely will not use, thereby subsidizing the insurance for older, sicker consumers. But when there is no penalty for not buying the insurance, these marks, err, I mean, consumers, won’t buy the policies or pay the shared responsibility payment. That makes the remaining risk pool even more costly, which in turn will make participation in the exchanges an even bigger loss for health insurance companies, and more will follow Humana’s lead and drop out. The companies that remain, if any, will have to increase premiums even more dramatically to make participation in the exchanges have any hope of making sense. Those increased premiums will drive more people who do not absolutely need health insurance to drop it (especially if there is no penalty for doing so). This is the death spiral so many have talked about, and it has now begun.

.

Whether anyone likes or not, much of Obamacare is going away. Nothing can stop it. The only question for Congressional Republicans is whether they continue sit on the sidelines and let it happen (and let people suffer as a result), or do they, after SEVEN YEARS, finally come up with a plan.

.

GOP, you have been promising repeal since Apple was running commercials about iPhone 4, but always said you didn’t have the power to act. Now you have the power to act. Use it, or you may find yourselves without any power at all.As outgoing President Barack Obama plans to head off on vacation when he vacates the White House next week, his staffers and appointees are struggling to find work in Washington, D.C.

Following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory and Republicans’ major electoral gains in November, outgoing Obama employees and loyalists to failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton have found their job prospects in the District foundering, according to Politico.

“It feels like there are just thousands of us trying to find a job, and there are no jobs,” longtime Clinton aide Mira Patel, who worked for Clinton in her Senate, State Department and 2016 campaign offices, told the outlet.

Following Trump’s surprise victory Nov. 8, Democratic operatives no longer have some 4,000 presidentially appointed jobs for which to apply when the billionaire businessman takes the oath of office Jan. 20.

The Democratic workers who were expecting to see a Clinton White House are reportedly finding the transition especially difficult:

Clinton aides appear to be having a harder time, both emotionally and practically. “There’s anger, there’s frustration, there’s anxiety, there’s burnout,” said Russ Finkelstein, a managing director at Clearly Next and longtime progressive career guru (including as a founding team member at the lefty jobs board Idealist.org) who has been counseling Clinton alumni. “People are in shock,” said Anastasia Kessler-Dellaccio, 35, who quit her job at Sister Cities International to run Foreign Policy Professionals for Hillary. Some Clinton campaign workers say they’ve lost their bearings because they’re so rattled by the differences in Trump’s values from those represented by Obama and Clinton. Kessler-Dellaccio added, “I think people, myself included, are trying to figure out, ‘How do I recalibrate my dreams?’”

But it’s not all bad news. Laslo Bock, Google’s outgoing chief of human resources, has, according to the Wall Street Journal, established a database of résumés to help Obama staffers and Clinton advocates find work after their unexpected yet impending unemployment.

Given the dire situation some outgoing Obama staffers are in: “A lot of us are looking for any fit,” Patel said — the soon-to-be-former president is doing what he can to help his supporters find work in Trump’s Washington.

“The president made it a priority to ensure that, throughout his administration, employees had access to professional development resources and tools to help them advance in their careers and transition to new opportunities,” White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine told Politico, describing Obama as “extremely grateful” to those staffers who have stayed with him over the years.The Consumer Electronics Show happening this week in Las Vegas is an annual event where companies unveil new technology that used to be just science fiction. This year’s belle of the ball? Self-driving cars.

There’s a reason for that. While safety is certainly a concern regarding the technology, new video from Twitter shows a self-driving Tesla sensing an accident through a vehicle ahead and applying the brakes to avoid it:

@elonmusk Finally the right one. pic.twitter.com/2fspGMUoWf — Hans Noordsij (@HansNoordsij) December 27, 2016

CEO of Tesla Elon Musk has long sung the praises of autonomous vehicle technology, saying radar detection in concert with visual sensors helps his cars “see” through cars in front of them to avoid accidents.

The Twitter user who posted the video noted that the car’s autopilot “initially applied the emergency brake before the driver was able to react and brake herself.”

In a piece from the CES Thursday, USA Today reported that the self-driving automobile field, which used to be dominated by Google, has become pretty crowded:

The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. … It’s clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective.

While scalability is an issue for automakers, consumers will likely be paying closer attention to safety. The technology has some advocacy in Washington that should help, including current Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who released an 11-page memo Thursday urging the incoming Trump administration to support development in the field:

In the 1960s we had to fight industry to require seatbelts in vehicles, and to take other safety measures. The result of these safety battles paid off: the motor vehicle fatality rate has dropped by 80 percent. Now, fifty years later we are working with the automobile and technology industries to shape policies to ensure safe deployment of autonomous and connected vehicles on our roads, which have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives annually.

If these safety successes like the Tesla one continue, aided by praises from regulatory agencies like the DOT, the market may be selling self-driving cars sooner than originally expected.During the CNN Debate Night, Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) asked Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) if Americans are entitled to healthcare.

Doc Thompson liked the way Sen. Cruz answered the question, but he added a little more. Sen. Sanders believes that healthcare is a right and Doc inquires, “Where does it end?” Every one has access to healthcare and nobody is stopping you from healthcare.

Doc believes the issue isn’t access to healthcare but the access to the money to pay for said healthcare. “If it’s a right (healthcare), who determines that right?” Doc asks.

However, it was the subject of the media and what he calls “fake news” that got him the most fired up.

The Trump administration has labeled the media as “the opposition party” and rightfully so. During the election, they did everything they can to stop trump from being elected while at the same time colluded with the Clinton campaign as revealed by WikiLeaks. Since the election, the media’s coverage of President Trump has been apocalyptic. The coverage of the Flynn scandal alone has been compared to Watergate and Russia’s interference in American politics has been seen as an act of war on the level of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. The hysteria is truly unbelievable.

What frustrates media personalities like MSNBC’s Chuck Todd and the folks at CNN the most is the reality that despite Trump’s own complicated relationship with the truth, most Americans actually side with Trump. A recent Emerson poll shows that more people trust the Trump administration more than the media! There are so many reasons to question the White House especially as of late, but the fact that many see them as more honest than various news outlets.

Just look at all of the reports that were made in the past week alone. At least half of them rely on “unnamed sources” and don’t provide tangible proof to support their stories. That alone earns skepticism. And many of those stories automatically get debunked by the Trump administration. The mainstream media has become an industry of political tabloids. And sadly, some of the legitimate stories are due to unlawful leaks from the intelligence community. There’s an unhealthy bond between Obama loyalists still working in the government and a hostile media. They’re willing to make confidential information, like Trump’s conversations with world leaders or more recently Flynn’s chats with the Russian ambassador, public solely to embarrass the president. So the fake news element is one thing, but the blatant objective to politically assassinate President Trump every single day is obvious to most Americans.

The most hilarious part about all of this is that the media sees themselves as the victim. They claim President Trump is a threat to our First Amendment right of the freedom of the press and that he delegitimizes journalism. For the record, it’s the media that delegitimized itself. They gave President Obama an easy eight years, attempted to destroy Trump’s candidacy while trying to help Clinton get elected. Now the media freaks out if Trump sneezes.

While there’s lots to criticize President Trump on, he’s absolutely right about the media and the way they treat him. And until the media addresses their own credibility problem, President Trump will continue to win this war.Community Rules

Today is a big day for me. I am returning to The Five. Please watch and tell friends it's so good to. Be back! — Robert G Beckel (@RobertGBeckel) January 16, 2017

Almost five got to admit I'm nervous. Please tune. In! — Robert G Beckel (@RobertGBeckel) January 16, 2017

Beckel showed he hadn’t lost his famously bellicose character in this pointed message he gave to the President-elect Donald Trump towards the end of the show.

Beckel seemed at ease with the other co-hosts of “The Five” as they reminisced over their fights and laughs from his previous tenure. As one of the few hosts on Fox News representing the left-wing side of the political aisle, Beckel’s fights and debates with his more conservative counterparts have become legendary.

At one point he even exasperated Dana Perino into cursing on air, causing her audio to be cut, while in another episode he actually flipped off a guest host who had enraged him.

Many fans of the show greeted the return on social media:

I may not agree with most of what Bob Beckel says, but I am so glad he is back on #TheFive! He has been missed. @RobertGBeckel 😊 — Amy Morgan (@AmyMorgan_95) January 16, 2017

Watching The Five because @RobertGBeckel is back! I missed the dynamic! #bobsback Glad to see him.back in his place on The Five set! — ConservativeWoman (@Conservative_Lo) January 16, 2017One woman’s story of tolerance and cultural sensitivity the left could learn from. Hilary Corna, a writer and speaker passionate about global leadership, personal development, and cultural diversity, joins Tomi to converse on her personal growth, and challenges of living abroad.

Hilary points out how working in an American society we’re very individualistic and vocal but in the east it’s a collective society. She explains a saying in Japanese which states, “Don’t be the nail that sticks out — because you’re going to get hammered down.” She explains how her book has been well received by those in mid-America whereas the east and west coast are more cultured and tend to judge more.

Duncan Hunter (Calif.) removed the painting last week.

The painting’s return was led by Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who said its removal went against freedom of speech and expression: “This is about protecting the Constitution,” he said, The Hill reported.

But the painting of a confrontation between black protesters and police didn’t stay put for long.

Another GOP lawmaker, Doug Lamborn of Colorado, removed it again Tuesday, his office confirmed with TheBlaze.

“Just yesterday, we honored Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. I could not, in good conscience, continue to walk by a painting that so flagrantly disrespected the brave police officers that protect us here in the Capitol and in our communities across the country,” Lamborn said in a statement. “I decided to continue the protest started by my colleague Congressman Hunter and I hope that permanent action is taken to remove this brazen attack on the brave men and women who make up the thin blue line.”

Clay soon placed the painting back on the wall for a second time Tuesday.

After Hunter unscrewed and took down the painting Friday and then delivered it Clay’s office, Clay said he wanted Capitol Police to charge Hunter with theft.

“He had no right to take that picture down,” Clay told the Washington Post. “It’s thievery.”

But Hunter, a California lawmaker, on Tuesday told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” “Capitol Police aren’t going to arrest me for taking down a picture that portrays them as pigs.” In fact, the Hill said Capitol Police also are upset by the painting, which is displayed near a police security checkpoint. A law enforcement group called it “reprehensible, repugnant and repulsive,” Fox News reported.

Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.) warned that rehanging the painting “could result in the [death] of another police officer,” the network added.

The painting is by David Pulphus, a recent high school graduate and Clay constituent who won the Democrat’s annual congressional art competition last year.

More from The Hill:

House Republicans discussed the painting during a morning conference meeting on Tuesday and concluded it violates the art competition’s rules, according to members in attendance. They concluded the painting violates the art competition’s guidelines that no submissions depict “sensationalistic” subjects of “contemporary political controversy.” Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told members he was going to look into removing the painting, spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. Rep. David Reichert (R-Wash.), a former sheriff, plans to ask the Architect of the Capitol to remove the painting. When told that Ryan is reviewing a process to take down the painting, Clay indicated he is open to deliberating such a step. The problem, he said, was Hunter’s decision to remove it unilaterally. Clay said there are statues of Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee in the Capitol complex that he finds “deeply offensive,” but he hasn’t tried to remove them himself.

“I don’t mind the Speaker’s office following a process. If there’s a process to remove this painting, well, let’s start the process. And let’s discuss it,” Clay told the Hill. “But you just don’t walk up here and remove a painting because you are offended by it.”Doc Thompson goes out to dinner and has an out-of-body experience when a interesting topic on the 2nd Amendment gets brought up. A woman in their party mentions how if she has to live in a society where she has to have a gun to protect herself, she’s not sure if she wants to live. Doc attempts to analyze this thought while his wife is kicking him beneath the table to thwart his attempts to converse on the topic. Doc believes he’s being reserved and reasonable decides to continue the discussion with the woman regardless of the kicking from his wife.

According to Saldana, who doesn’t support Trump the AFP reports, despite many of the controversial things that Trump did and said during his campaign, Hollywood celebrities became the “bullies” of the election when they berated Trump and his supporters at a near constant rate.

“We got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies,” she said. “We were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong… and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and that are believing in his promises.”

Saldana told reporters last year that she was supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton and she often times spoke out against Trump’s policy proposals. She even co-signed an open letter with her fellow “Star Trek” actors that spoke out against Trump.

More from Mediaite:

Last year during the campaign, a lot of actors and crew members involved in the Star Trek franchise, Saldana included, co-signed an open letter that read, in part, “We cannot turn our backs on what is happening in the upcoming election. Never has there been a presidential candidate who stands in such complete opposition to the ideals of the Star Trek universe as Donald Trump. His election would take this country backward, perhaps disastrously.”

But for Saldana, she believes that America just needs to move on.

“I’m learning from (Trump’s victory) with a lot of humility,” she told the AFP. “If we have people continue to be strong and educate ourselves and stand by equal rights and treat everyone with respect, we won’t go back to those times.”

Saldana wasn’t the only actress this week to speak out against Hollywood’s treatment of Trump. Nicole Kidman made headlines late this week after she said that it’s time for all Americans to come around Trump and support him.

She later clarified those comments to say that she wasn’t expressing her personal support of Trump, but rather support for the the spirit of America, our republic and the U.S. Constitution — which supports a peaceful transition of power.A recently released study by CIRCLE shows that young voters aged 18-34 came out more for President-elect Donald Trump than many originally had thought. While millennials still mostly came out in favor of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, her reliance on the millennial vote in this election did not serve her as well as she thought.

From CIRCLE:

Our pre-election poll of Millennials ages 18-34 had Clinton 49% vs. Trump 28%, a 21-point preference for the Democratic candidate. The National Exit Poll suggests that the actual split in the election was 55% for Clinton to 37% for Trump (an 18-point gap) among youth aged 18-29. Throughout the election season, our analysis has emphasized the demographic and ideological heterogeneity of Millennials, contradicting facile generalizations that characterize them as the “Obama generation.” In particular, there are regularly stark differences in ideology and issue positions among Millennials of different races, genders, and socioeconomic status.

Circle notes that “an estimated 23.7 million young voters participated in the 2016 presidential election, which is 50% of citizens aged 18-29 in the United States.”

While still showing support for third party candidates, millennials are just one more element that defied numerous election forecasts.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!A New York state elementary school teacher gave students a flier urging readers to “shield our students and schools from President-elect Donald Trump” — and one angry parent found the flier in her son’s backpack.

But the Schenectady City School District said it was an accident, the Daily Gazette reported.

A Paige Elementary School teacher gave the flier — which was placed in teacher mailboxes by a Schenectady Federation of Teachers rep — to five or six students last month, the paper said.

“She was handing the flier out thinking it was something that was supposed to go home with students,” district spokeswoman Karen Corona told the Daily Gazette, adding that she suggested the teacher didn’t know what the flier said.

Along with anti-Trump sentiment, the flier asks for opposition to Betsy DeVos, whom Trump nominated for education secretary, noting they “will attempt to destroy public schools” with policies “that will only serve to line the pockets of corporate profiteers at the expense of our students,” the paper said.

The flier was part of a Jan. 19 “day of action,” the Gazette reported earlier, which explains why Trump is referred to as president-elect — although it mistakenly refers to DeVos as the education secretary when her nomination hasn’t yet been confirmed. Teachers were supposed to distribute the fliers directly to parents as they picked up or dropped off their kids, the paper said, and perhaps talk to parents about it.

But Jolene Damian said she found the flier in her first-grade son’s backpack and wasn’t happy.

“I was shocked that there was material being handed to my kid that blatantly creates division between my son and his president – in his eyes,” Damian, a Trump supporter, told the Gazette. “My 6-year-old just saw a big headline at the top that he needs to be shielded from his president.”

Damian posted a photo of the flier on Facebook along with her handwritten note: “This is shameful – how dare they send material home promoting fear & hate against our president. Don’t ever hand my child political material like this ever again!”

Superintendent Larry Spring told the Gazette the flier shouldn’t have ended up where it did.

“That can’t get in backpacks,” he told the paper. “We have to be really careful with those kinds of things. What we put in kids hands is essentially curriculum … it can’t be partisan.”

Corona told the Gazette the district didn’t find other instances of the flier getting into students’ hands, adding that the principal told staff that material for students in mailboxes must be pre-approved.

Damian on Thursday updated her original Facebook post, calling her son’s teacher a “lovely woman” and noting that a union rep “was given these fliers several weeks ago and was instructed to give them to their teachers with clear instruction to hand them to parents at pick up and to open some discussion with those parents. When said Union rep failed to pass these fliers out in a timely manner she went to the school with them at the end of the day, at the very last second, and hurriedly passed these to these teachers with a quick instruction to pass them out to parents.”

She added that her son’s teacher “wasn’t told that said material had not been approved by the administration … and had no idea the rep failed to inform even the principal of this flier.” Then Damian said the teacher “passed the 8-10 copies directly into the students mail boxes, where the children pick up their homework and artwork to bring home at the end of the day.”

Tonight, the media circus that surrounded Senator Elizabeth Warren being shut down due to her impugning Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have been one of those moments.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio watched this proceedings with some dismay as well, but instead of becoming angry and responding with attacks, he took to the floor to speak sense, understanding, and peace.

“One of the great freedoms of our nation is the ability to come forward and have debates,” said Rubio. “But the Founders, framers, those who established this institution and guided it for over two centuries understood that that debate was impossible if in fact the matters became of a personal nature.”

“Turn on the news and watch these parliaments around the world where people throw chairs at each other, and punches, and ask yourself how does that make you feel about those countries,” continued Rubio. “Doesn’t give you a lot of confidence about those countries. Now I’m not arguing that we’re anywhere near that here tonight…but we’re flirting with it. We’re flirting with it in this body, and we’re flirting with it in this country.”

Rubio goes on to talk about how debate has reached a point where the moment an idea is offered from one side, it’s automatically given a malicious motive by the other.

“I’m telling you guys, we are reaching a point in this Republic when we can’t solve the simplest of issues because everyone is putting themselves in a corner where everyone hates everybody.” said Rubio.

Rubio urges his colleagues to conduct business and debates with a mutual respect for one another, despite their disagreements, or face a future where no debates can occur due to the unmitigated hatred his colleagues will have with one another, and be ineffective in their jobs as representatives of the people.Hollywood film company 20th Century Fox created a campaign of “fake news” to market a new film, and its efforts fooled enough people that the company finally had to issue an apology.

According to a report from the Washington Post, the production company’s new horror/mystery film “A Cure for Wellness” was being promoted via the help of an unnamed “fake news” creator who set up websites that gave the appearance of actual news sites. These sites presented spurious news reports flanked by banner advertisements promoting the film. The problem is that it was nearly impossible to tell that the sites weren’t legitimate.

The Post cited as an example the the Sacramento Dispatch, a fake news site created that promoted a story about President Donald Trump meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Switzerland prior to the U.S. election in November. The fabricated story featured a sensational headline to draw readers: “BOMBSHELL: Trump and Putin Spotted at Swiss Resort Prior to Election.”

The production company also created sister fake news sites for the Sacramento Dispatch — including the Houston Leader, the Salt Lake Guardian, the New York Morning Post and the Indianapolis Gazette — which did not indicate that they were part of a film marketing campaign. Most of the stories at these sites, according to the Washington Post, “made outlandish claims about President Trump.”

One of the “stories” from the Sacramento Dispatch blared in its headline, “Trump Refuses to Provide California Federal Support in Midst of Natural Disaster, Cites Sanctuary Cities.” The post went viral through social media, with some prominent users, including former Star Trek actor and social media celebrity George Takei, promoting it as a real story.

Here's a story on that: https://t.co/WypuyQywzx — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) February 13, 2017

Both Regency Enterprises, a production company involved with the film, and 20th Century Fox have made statements following the confusion on social media about the fake news sites. Regency said in a statement, “‘A Cure for Wellness’ is a movie about a ‘fake’ cure that makes people sicker. As part of this campaign, a ‘fake’ wellness site healthandwellness.co was created and we partnered with a fake news creator to publish fake news.”

20th Century Fox released a lengthy statement saying, “In raising awareness for our films, we do our best to push the boundaries of traditional marketing in order to creatively express our message to consumers. In this case, we got it wrong.”Community Rules

http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/16/michael-moore-wants-trump-to-step-down-and-clinton-named-president/

Here is what some readers had to say about Michael Moore:

Justin_Franks

No, Clinton did *not* win the popular vote. She had a plurality in the popular vote. There is a big difference.

Hapscan

Poor Michael. The thought of a verified, certified and cross-indexed crook NOT in the White House literally freaks this guy out! Why is it that he is so anxious to make a fool of himself all the time? I think it’s because he surrounds himself with like-minded fools who nod and shout their agreement with everything that comes out of his mouth, and by so doing, create the illusion that he’s making intelligent remarks. I believe that another motivator is that he has a goodly number of followers on Twitter, and whenever he makes some inane or insane remark, he carefully monitors the ’likes’ tally, and when it reaches a predetermined number (he has a chart), he concludes that his comment is brilliant, or at least excellent+, and is therefore deserving of a quasi-press conference for hard-up journalists in front of his favorite bakery.

nickginex@gmail.com

Mr. Moore has no common sense, integrity, and has lost any credibility he formerly had. How can any intelligent person support or vote for Hillary Clinton who has clearly shown she is a liar and a cheat concerning Benghazi and the deaths of four Americans, her deletion of 33,000 e-mails, destruction of computer servers that contained evidence of her play-for-pay contacts, and receiving questions as a candidate for the presidency instead of reporting the cheating attempt. It is clear that Hillary Clinton supporters are ignorant of the facts and are blind followers of the Liberal Media and Hollywood propaganda. But this reveals Democrats may have a low IQ, unable to realize that President Trump is trying to make America great again to better their lives. He did more in less than four weeks to create jobs than President Obama, our first Muslim-American President.

Dward Fardbark

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh … a lot of people want Michael Moore to shut up and go away. But that is not going to happen any more than Trump stepping down and Hillary becoming president.

So, lets get real … Michael Moore will continue saying the most crazy, vile, insane things … just because any publicity is good publicity … and puts money in Michael Moore’s pockets down the road when he does another insane drivel of a movie.

And, Trump will continue being President for the next eight years, fixing the real problems of Americans, that past presidents ( *cough* Obama *cough*) have been totally ignoring.

Freedomringsforall

Moore is such a nut job it is unbelievable.

Trump won over 3000 counties and county equivalents were out of 3141 in 2016.

These lefties keep up their insanity and he will win over 3100 in 2020.

Hey Moore, every time you say Trump was elected under fraud you insult the majority of the US citizens that voted. We spoke, you don’t listen. Remember these are some of the same people that have made you rich. I’m not one of them. But I am sure everyone is sick of hearing your mouth run yet nothing comes out. I doubt anyone will ever pay another penny to watch another one of your sorry movies. Move on, you’re over and we are over listening to you. We spoke through voting.

Jg724

Last time I checked the Constitution, I didn’t see ”the candidate who lost the election” ANYWHERE in the line of succession to the Presidency if the ELECTED President dies or is unable to serve. Every time Michael Moore opens his BIG MOUTH, he just offers further proof of what a liberal IDIOT he truly is!

I’m hate to tell you Mr. (or Mrs??) Moore~I voted and I am NOT Russian. You have no right to invalidate the votes of millions of Americans, no matter how mentally deranged you are. The left is constantly bitching. The president has been in office less than a month and they whine that he hasn’t fixed everything or they whine because he has tried to. He isn’t perfect for sure, but he hasn’t even been given much of a chance. Everything has been a complete battle so far. Please just go back to your safe spaces and shut the hell up!Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Liberals’ reaction to President Trump’s decision to fire acting Attorney General Sally Yates — whose tenure was likely measured in hours or at the most days in any case — has been both predictable and tiresome. They are already calling it the “Monday night massacre,” a clear attempt to compare Trump’s actions with former President Richard Nixon’s infamous “Saturday night massacre,” which signaled the beginning of the end for his ill-fated presidency.

I am not a fan of Trump and I am likewise not a fan of this particular executive order, but something about Trump causes liberals to lose all historical perspective when criticizing him. They simply cannot help themselves from overreaching and overreacting to everything he does, and further demolishing their own credibility in the process. Regardless of how you feel about the executive order, Trump was right to fire Yates, and the only thing I would criticize him for is taking several hours to do it.

Let’s review what actually happened in the Saturday night massacre. Nixon desired to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was causing him political problems during his investigation of potentially criminal activities related to the Watergate break-in — activities that directly implicated key members of Nixon’s staff and presented an existential crisis for Nixon’s entire administration. Nixon had at least a plausible argument that there could be no such thing as a truly independent prosecutor, and that as the president and chief executive he had the inherent power to direct all criminal prosecutions in the United States. Nixon’s Attorney General, Eliot Richardson, disagreed and refused, whereupon he was dismissed by Nixon on the spot. Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was likewise ordered to dismiss Cox, and he likewise refused and was terminated on the spot. Ultimately, Solicitor General Robert Bork, as acting Attorney General, carried out Nixon’s order.

The reason that the termination of Richardson and Ruckelshaus was a momentous political event is that both men were appointees and political allies of Nixon. Their refusal to follow the orders of the man to whom their political futures were attached, even under the threat of instant termination, was intended to serve as a wake-up call to Nixon himself to reverse his course and — failing that — to the media as to Nixon’s recklessness. It failed to serve the first purpose, but accomplished the second magnificently. Ultimately, the Supreme Court would side decisively with Richardson and Ruckelshaus over Nixon as to the propriety of independent prosecutors, over a strident lone dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia.

Now, if we imagined a hypothetical scenario six months from now in which Trump fired Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner for refusing to obey one of his orders, then parallels to the “Saturday night massacre” might well be appropriate. That is not, however, what happened. Sally Yates – an Obama appointee with an obvious political motivation to embarrass Trump made what was very obviously a political decision to embarrass the president, not a legal one that she couldn’t in good conscience defend the law. How obvious were Yates’ political motivations? Obvious enough that even Alan Dershowitz, one of the country’s foremost civil libertarian liberals, called it a political decision rather than a legal one.

I personally don’t think the EO is a good idea, for reasons that are not really relevant to this post. However, as a licensed attorney, I would have no qualms defending its legality, if my employer called upon me to do so, confident that I would not run afoul of the Rules of Professional Conduct that pertain to government attorneys in either my home state of Tennessee or any jurisdiction I am aware of. The argument that the EO is illegal or unconstitutional in some way is an extremely thin one. Even if parts of it are on somewhat shaky ground (e.g., the portions pertaining to lawful permanent residents), the order as a whole is clearly not patently illegal or unconstitutional such that refusal to defend it was some sort of ethical duty on Yates’ part.

How clear is this point? Well, for staters, Yates herself did not even claim that the order was unlawful or indefensible. In fact, she implicitly acknowledged that it was, in fact both lawful and defensible in her statement, claiming that “My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts.” She didn’t refuse to defend the executive order because she thought it was illegal, she refused because it offended her notions of social justice, as she explicitly stated: “In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.”

In this case, of course, “stand for what is right” was solely determined by the subjective opinion of an Obama appointee who knew good and well she was on the way out the door anyway, so observers possessed of even a shred of discernment could be forgiven for dismissing Yates’ moral posturing as obvious political theater.

In the face of an acting attorney general who refused to defend an order that she herself acknowledged was legally defensible, what was Trump supposed to do? As a lawyer, if your employer orders you to do something that is not prohibited by the Rules of Professional Conduct, you still always have a choice: you can quit. If you’re not going to quit, you have an ethical duty to represent your client/employer competently and with diligence. Refusal to do so should lead to your termination, and furthermore to possible disciplinary action by the bar. Staying on the job but refusing to advocate for your client is actually one of the more grievous ethical violations a lawyer can commit.

Sally Yates is no hero lawyer; in fact, I would argue that she is guilty of spitting on the ethical canons of the profession that some liberals (who obviously know nothing of the legal profession) are praising her for upholding. Yates’ motives were transparently political and Trump was right to brush her out of the way in short order. The fact that he was forced to do so is not evidence of Trump’s recklessness, it’s evidence of Yates’ desire for 15 minutes of fame.

That is not to say that the Trump administration has covered itself in glory throughout this entire episode. If the report is true that the Trump administration used House Judiciary Committee staffers to draft the executive order, forced them to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and instructed them not to tell Congressional brass what they were doing, that presents a much more serious legal, political and separation-of-powers issue that should be confronted head-on sooner, rather than later. But Trump’s dismissal of Yates’ was not a “massacre” of any kind; rather, it was merely the expeditious dismissal of an obvious political fame-seeker who left Trump with no choice.Daryl Lies, the President of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, joins Tomi to discuss the DAPL protesters and the problems they are creating.

Can you spot it?

A photo delivered yesterday that will be displayed in the upper/lower press hall. Thank you Abbas! pic.twitter.com/Uzp0ivvRp0 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2017

The panoramic photo by Washington-based photographer Abbas H. Shirmohammadi, shows the crowds gathered in front of the U.S. Capitol for Trump’s inauguration.

But the problem? It’s marked with the wrong the date.

Trump’s inauguration was Jan. 20, but the photo is dated Jan. 21.

Jan. 21 was also a big day in the nation’s capital, however. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out to the Women’s March Saturday in support of women’s rights, health care and reproductive rights.

Trump has not tweeted yet if he’s spotted the mistake in the photo, but others sure have.

Picture includes the wrong date of inauguration, but I guess that could be an #AlternativeFacts https://t.co/b3V2wYoagi … — Kaz (@KazBiggaveli) January 24, 2017

When I'm President, I won't get the date of my own inauguration wrong four days later. I promise you that. — Ben Kompromat (@bkabak) January 24, 2017

Trump's inauguration photo also has the wrong date on it. Says Jan 21. In fact it was Jan 20. https://t.co/ZBH2JYV47w — Harry Horton (@harry_horton) January 24, 2017I have said it before and I will say it again. It is pathetic that Congressional Republicans, after SEVEN YEARS of promising Obamacare repeal, did not have a plan ready for how to actually handle the repeal. I know Trump says a plan is coming next month, and Paul Ryan says a plan is coming next week, but that’s starting to sound a bit like the old ”the check is in the mail” type of promise.

.

But maybe the GOP’s incompetence will actually work out. Because despite all the GOP’s foot-dragging and hand-wringing, two events this week signaled the beginning of the end of Obamacare:

.

1. Health insurer Humana announced that it will end its participation in Obamacare exchanges later this year. Why? Because participation in the exchanges simply isn’t profitable, no matter how much health insurers raise premiums. Some counties, and even a few states, have only one or two health insurers participating in the exchanges. So what happens if no other insurers fill the void left by Humana and/or other insurers also drop out of the exchanges (Aetna’s CEO said this week that Aetna would decide in April whether to participate in the exchanges)? First, consumers who do not buy policies on the exchanges are not eligible for subsidies, and will bear the full cost of those policies (which many people simply cannot afford). Second, citizens in number of counties, and maybe even some states, will be legally required to buy insurance it is either impossible for them to buy, or that they cannot use because no providers reasonably close to where they live are in the networks of the health insurers that the consumers can buy policies from.

.

2. The second big event this week is the IRS’s announcement that it will not require taxpayers to disclose on their tax returns whether they had ”qualifying health insurance”. What does this mean? It means that there is no one enforcing the individual mandate. While the IRS’s decision in this regard may be legally questionable, the result will be that people who in prior years either bought policies to avoid the shared responsibility payment, or just paid the shared responsibility payment, will now do neither.

.

So what is the net result of these two events? As many recognize, Obamacare only has even the appearance of working because young, healthy people pay for overpriced insurance they likely will not use, thereby subsidizing the insurance for older, sicker consumers. But when there is no penalty for not buying the insurance, these marks, err, I mean, consumers, won’t buy the policies or pay the shared responsibility payment. That makes the remaining risk pool even more costly, which in turn will make participation in the exchanges an even bigger loss for health insurance companies, and more will follow Humana’s lead and drop out. The companies that remain, if any, will have to increase premiums even more dramatically to make participation in the exchanges have any hope of making sense. Those increased premiums will drive more people who do not absolutely need health insurance to drop it (especially if there is no penalty for doing so). This is the death spiral so many have talked about, and it has now begun.

.

Whether anyone likes or not, much of Obamacare is going away. Nothing can stop it. The only question for Congressional Republicans is whether they continue sit on the sidelines and let it happen (and let people suffer as a result), or do they, after SEVEN YEARS, finally come up with a plan.

.

GOP, you have been promising repeal since Apple was running commercials about iPhone 4, but always said you didn’t have the power to act. Now you have the power to act. Use it, or you may find yourselves without any power at all.Conservative radio host Glenn Beck was fired up Thursday as he spoke about the differences in the way the media handles coverage of Republicans versus Democrats.

“The media has made me into a conspiracy theorist,” Beck said The Glenn Beck Radio Program. “And they will say, ‘Made you into one? You made yourself into one.'”

He went on to explain the instances when the media falsely portrayed him as a conspiracy theorist, even when the facts were well-documented.

Beck compared that to the media coverage of Keith Ellison, a U.S. representative from Minnesota and the first Muslim elected to Congress who is now the favored pick for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship.

“A conspiracy theory, to me, is what Keith Ellison said in 2007. Listen to the man that may be the head of the DNC and what he said about 9/11.” Beck then played a recording of Ellison’s controversial statement that then-President George W. Bush used 9/11 to benefit from it politically by making Americans afraid.

ELLISON: Because remember 9/11, right? You never had all this discrimination against religious minorities but for 9/11. You know, you had it, but you didn’t have it to the degree that we have it now. 9/11 is this juggernaut event in American history. It allows — I mean, it’s almost like, you know, the Reichstag fire kind of reminds me of that. Does anybody know what I’m talking about? VOICE: Yeah. Who benefited from 9/11? ELLISON: Well, I mean, like you and I both know– VOICE: Yeah, Bush. ELLISON: But the thing is, after the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it. And it put the leader of that country in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted.

Beck continued, “He’s making the argument that 9/11 was blamed on somebody so they could go religious discrimination and they could scope everybody up and make them afraid. Well, that’s a conspiracy theory. Show me the evidence of that. Now, if the press wants to have any credibility — you have called people on the right hateful conspiracy theorists — will you call out the person who is now going to be the head of the Democratic National Committee? Will you call him a conspiracy theorist?”

Beck reasoned that the media will not use the same standard to report on Ellison and tied it into their coverage of Hillary Clinton’s presidential election loss. He concluded that it is a perfect example of why the majority of Americans don’t trust the press.

He then directed his statements toward the media, “Now, you guys haven’t even addressed why Hillary Clinton lost. I haven’t seen one autopsy on Hillary Clinton and why she was the worst candidate of all time. The Republicans have known this for a long time. She was the most beatable candidate you could have run.”

Beck criticized the press for instead focusing on the alleged difficulties on Trump’s transition team:

All they’re doing is they’re talking about Donald Trump and what a horrible disarray his Cabinet picks are. First of all, he’s ahead of every other president in his Cabinet picks. It, of course, is messy. Can you imagine how many picks you have to make in, what, 60 days? Yes, it’s a mess. I’m sure it is. He didn’t expect to be president — and I have this on good authority — until I think it was 4:30 in the afternoon. They thought they were going to lose. And at 4:30, somebody came to him and said, “You know what, things are actually in play.” He didn’t believe it, until North Carolina came in and Florida. And when North Carolina and Florida came in and they were waiting so long on Connecticut and Pennsylvania, he looked at one of his aides and said, “We might win.” They weren’t — they were putting the pathway down for Trump TV, not the presidency. And he’s still ahead of every other president, appointing their Cabinet members now. And what is the press doing? All they’re saying is what a disarray it’s in. What are you talking about? What are you talking about?

Beck concluded by noting his amazement that the press was focusing on Republican struggles less than a week after the Republicans won a stunning national election:Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!In the first direct attack on Israeli forces since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, four Islamic State gunmen opened fire on Israeli soldiers — and were promptly killed.

The Daily Mailreports the Israeli soldiers were protecting the Golan Heights and were members of the Golani Brigade. The soldiers took fire from both mortars and machine guns, but were unhurt. They then fired back while an airstrike targeted the gunmen’s vehicle, killing them. The gunmen were suspected of being rogue rather than operating under direct orders from Islamic State leadership, Israeli officials said:

Nitzan Nuriel, a retired Israeli general, said: “A direct attack like that on Israeli activities on Israeli side of border – this is the first time.”

He said he was baffled what lay behind the attack and said: “They know exactly what the Israeli response would be. An Israeli front is the last thing ISIS needs at this stage.” …

…General Nuriel, a former director of Israel’s Counter Terrorism Bureau, said he suspected the attack was the idea of local hotheads rather than a change of policy ordered by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to the Israeli soldiers who successfully countered the attack, saying that Israel would not let insurgents use the Syrian civil war as “cover” to establish themselves on Israel’s border.According to a CBS poll, a majority of Democrats have said that they believe that the religion of Islam is dangerous, but that other religions are just as bad.

66 percent of Democrats believe when it comes to other religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism, et al, they are responsible for just as much violence as Islam. Only 14 percent believe Islam is more violent, which totals out to one out of seven Democrats.

Meanwhile, Republicans have few qualms with calling Islam a more violent religion than the others with a majority 63 percent.

Islam is the religion that was the inspiration behind such attacks as 9/11, San Bernardino, Pulse Nightclub, the attacks that took place in France, and more. The religion is also responsible for the murder of gays, and women under the guidance of Sharia law, which requires strict punishments for those who do not adhere wholly to it.

On the other hand, religions such as Christianity are often far more charitable, and make up the foundation for western laws which protect those groups that Sharia law seeks to put under its boot.LOS ANGELES (TheBlaze/AP) — No, Los Angeles residents, it wasn’t your hangovers playing tricks on you. The Hollywood sign really did read “HOLLYWeeD” for a few hours on New Year’s Day.

Police were investigating Sunday after a prankster used giant tarps to turn two of the iconic sign’s white Os into Es sometime overnight.

The Hollywood sign was changed to say Hollyweed today pic.twitter.com/NSWmbgz9aP — Tommy Chong (@tommychong) January 1, 2017

The vandal, dressed in all black, was recorded by security cameras and could face a misdemeanor trespassing charge, said Sgt. Robert Payan.

The person scaled a protective fence surrounding the sign above Griffith Park and then clambered up each giant letter to drape the coverings, Payan said.

The prank may be a nod to California voters’ approval in November of Proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana, beginning in 2018.

Hikers and tourists in the hills spent the morning snapping photos of themselves in front of the altered sign before park rangers began removing the tarps.

“It’s kind of cool being here at the moment,” Bruce Quinn told KABC-TV. “I thought we came to see the Hollywood sign, not the’ Hollyweed’ sign. But hey it’s OK with me!”

While attention-grabbing, the prank was not exactly original. Forty-one years ago to the day – Jan. 1, 1976 – a college student similarly altered the sign, using curtains to make it read “HOLLYWEED.”

The sign has been restored to say “Hollywood” as of Sunday afternoon, according to KCBS-TV.The Associated Press on Monday released guidelines for news outlets on how to cover the so-called “alt-right” — saying that it should be referred to as a white nationalist movement.

AP, which sets style standards for the news industry, put out the guidelines in a relatively rare and lengthy blog post.

In recent days, it has become confusing whether “alt-right” should be a broad term for some conservatives or supporters of President-elect Donald Trump — but AP has now clarified that the term should refer only to white nationalists.

The wire service first defined the fringe movement as “the name currently embraced by some white supremacists and white nationalists to refer to themselves and their ideology,” which many describe as a “mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.”

Though many in the movement have said that they support the president-elect, last week Trump said he disavows and condemns the alt-right. Many prominent conservatives, including Ross Douthat, David French and Glenn Beck have also condemned the movement.

In its newly released guidelines, AP warned news outlets about using the term “alt-right” without explanation, because the catch-all term could help the movement to cover up racist ideology.

“Avoid using the term generically and without definition, however, because it is not well known and the term may exist primarily as a public-relations device to make its supporters’ actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience,” the AP blog post said. “In the past we have called such beliefs racist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist.”

Moving forward, AP warned outlets to use the term only with a definition and that the group should not be allowed to define itself:Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!For the first time in eight years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was warmly welcomed into the White House. President Trump, who has been friendly with Netanyahu for years, met with the Israeli leader for the first time as Commander in Chief. And so far, US-Israeli relations are off to a good start.

Their joint press conference perfectly summed up the alliance between the US and the Jewish State. President Trump firmly declared that Israel has America’s full support, especially when it comes to the fight against terrorism and the growing threat Iran has become in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal. Trump again floated the possibility of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which would send a major political message.

But the big headline that came from this meeting was that President Trump has broken the 30-year US policy of vocally supporting the two-state solution, which formed under the Clinton administration with the hopes that Israel and Palestinians can live peacefully with divided territory. While he didn’t flat-out reject the solution, Trump basically said that whatever Israel supports, we support whether it be a two-state solution or a one-state solution.

Not pushing the two-state solution is a major, positive change to US foreign policy. For starters, the US shouldn’t be pushing a solution if neither parties are onboard. Secondly, Bibi Netanyahu put some pressure on Palestinians with his demands: that they recognize Israel as a Jewish State and they allow Israel to have enough territory to fulfill their national security needs. For Palestinians, that’s easier said than done, especially since the terrorist group Hamas runs the show in the Gaza strip.

That’s not to say that Trump and Netanyahu’s relationship is all smooth sailings. Trump did urge his ally to slow down on the expansion of the Israeli settlements, which triggered an awkwardly humorous exchange between the two leaders. That said, this is a honeymoon couple in comparison to Netanyahu’s bitter relationship with President Obama, who blatantly towards the end of his presidency tried to undermine Israel.

While the media painted this picture that world leaders fear what a Trump presidency might bring on Election Night, we know at least one leader who was cheering (well, maybe two if you count Putin). It’s been reported that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is the one who’s supposed to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. If he succeeds, it may be regarded as the biggest US foreign policy accomplishment in the past 50 years.

In the meantime, President Trump will make US-Israeli relations great again. Maybe he can put that on a hat.In the wake of the announcement that the Senate Intelligence Committee plans to investigate potential contacts between President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign operation and the Russian government, Trump’s transition team is conceding that at least one member of Trump’s inner circle has been in contact with the Russian ambassador.

According to transition officials, Ret. Army Gen. Michael Flynn — who is serving as national security advisor for Trump and who has been a lightning rod for Russia-related controversy for several years — spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on a number of occasions, including on December 29th, the day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for their alleged involvement in the hacking of former Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s email.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer told CNN that Flynn and the Russian ambassador “aren’t in frequent contact but they have been in touch recently on a number of issues.” Spicer claims that Flynn called to express condolences on the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, and to arrange a post-inauguration phone call between Trump and Putin. He denies that Flynn had substantive conversations about United States policy, but the timing of at least one of those calls strains the credibility of that statement.

The call in question — a call on December 29th, the day that Obama announced sanctions against Russia — coincided with a remarkable change in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tone in response to Obama’s announced sanctions. Putin had warned prior to the announcement of sanctions that any hostile action taken by the United States would be met by “asymmetric action” that would punish the United States severely. The morning the sanctions were announced, Putin struck a similarly hostile tone, promising retribution against United States action.

As the day wore on, however, Putin’s response took on a mocking, almost jovial tone, complete with a tweet from the Russian embassy labeling Obama a “lame duck” (indicating Russia’s belief that the sanctions might not last) and announcing that he would not, in fact, expel United States diplomats in reprisal as he had previously threatened.

The timing of Flynn’s call, combined with the softening of Russia’s response, raises at least the possibility that Flynn acted as the conduit to reassure the Russian government that the incoming Trump administration would not honor the sanctions imposed by Obama. If so, that would constitute at least a potential violation of the Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from negotiating matters involving United States policy with foreign governments without authority.

Flynn’s ties with Russia have been a subject of controversy for the Trump campaign since Flynn became an informal advisor for Trump during the campaign. Flynn was pushed aside by President Obama amidst a cloud of allegations that he had accepted either money or favors from the Kremlin while on active duty with the Army. Flynn did himself no favors in terms of dispelling these rumors when he accepted a retirement sinecure as a television analyst for Russia Today, a Kremlin-financed Russian propaganda operation. The extent and nature of Flynn’s relationship with the Kremlin is part of what led Trump to place Flynn in a role where he would not face Senate confirmation, given the overwhelming likelihood that even the Republican-led Senate would refuse to confirm him to any cabinet post.

Flynn has continued to be a source of controversy during the transition effort, as his son, Michael Flynn Jr., was forced out of the transition effort due to a series of controversial tweets.WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday named retired Sen. Dan Coats as national intelligence director, saying the former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee was the right person to lead the new administration’s “ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.”

Trump’s announcement came one day after release of a declassified government report on Russian efforts to influence the presidential election. The report predicts Russia isn’t done intruding in U.S. politics and policymaking.

Trump wants to improve relations with Russia and repeatedly has denounced intelligence agencies’ assessment that the Kremlin interfered in the election, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. But the report released Friday explicitly ties Russian President Vladimir Putin to the meddling and says Russia had a “clear preference” for Trump over Clinton.

Coats, an Indiana Republican, will await Senate confirmation to head the office, which was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to improve coordination among U.S. spy and law enforcement agencies. Coats now finds himself in line to be at the center of an intelligence apparatus that the president-elect has publicly challenged.

Trump said in an early morning statement that Coats “has clearly demonstrated the deep subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community.” He said Coats “will provide unwavering leadership that the entire intelligence community can respect, and will spearhead my administration’s ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.”

Coats, in a statement released by Trump’s transition team, said: “There is no higher priority than keeping America safe, and I will utilize every tool at my disposal to make that happen.”

Trump’s team has been examining ways to restructure intelligence agencies as part of an effort to streamline operations and improve efficiency, but Coats’ nomination could ease fears that Trump would push for a significant overhaul.

Coats, 73, is a Capitol Hill veteran who served eight years in the House before moving to the Senate in 1989 to take Dan Quayle’s place when Quayle became President George H.W. Bush’s vice president. Coats stayed in the Senate until 1998, then left to become a lobbyist.

After serving as U.S. ambassador to Germany under President George W. Bush, Coats joined the international law firm of King & Spalding, helping lead the government affairs division and lobbying for pharmaceutical, defense and energy companies.

Coats, who earned $600,000 in his final 13 months at King & Spalding, downplayed his lobbying work when he returned to Indiana for a successful Senate comeback bid in 2010. He served one term and did not seek re-election last year.

Coats was a vocal critic of Russia and pushed the Obama administration to harshly punish Moscow for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. When the White House levied sanctions, the Kremlin responded by banning several lawmakers, including Coats, from traveling to Russia.

Trump received a briefing Friday from intelligence officials on the classified report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, and he later told The Associated Press that he “learned a lot” from the discussions. But the president-elect declined to say whether he accepted the officials’ assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf.

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Most people who received an Amazon Echo device for Christmas probably want to ask Alexa, the voice-automated assistant, questions about the weather, the news or their music playlists. But there’s one Echo in Arkansas that police want to ask for clues in a murder investigation.

According to The Information, a tech news website, police in Bentonville have issued a warrant for Amazon to give them any audio or other records stored in the Echo owned by James Andrew Bates, who is slated to go to trial next year for first-degree murder in the death of Victor Collins.

While Amazon has refused to hand over all the data on the device, the company did give police Bates’ account details and purchase history. Law enforcement officers were able to retrieve information from the speaker, but it is not yet clear what data they were able to access.

“Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us,” the company said in a statement to Engadget. “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.”

In addition to whatever might be trapped inside the Echo, there were other technological clues left behind, according to Engadget:

Police say Bates had several other smart home devices, including a water meter. That piece of tech shows that 140 gallons of water were used between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. the night Collins was found dead in Bates’ hot tub. Investigators allege the water was used to wash away evidence of what happened off of the patio.

While it might be convenient — and certainly helpful — for police to have access to the high-tech gear in this case, should the findings be admissible in criminal cases?

Bates’ lawyer, Kimberly Weber, doesn’t think so. “You have an expectation of privacy in your home, and I have a big problem that law enforcement can use the technology that advances our quality of life against us,” she said.

This scenario harkens back to when, in April, the FBI forked over more than $1 million to unlock the iPhone used by San Bernardino attacker Syed Farook. After Apple refused to assist the bureau by unlocking the device, citing concerns over privacy rights, the federal agency found “an outside party” willing to break into the shooter’s iPhone.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Donald Trump touted his reinstatement of the “Mexico City policy” and the upcoming March for Life during remarks Thursday at a retreat for congressional Republicans in Philadelphia.

When Trump addressed his decision to reinstate the policy, which blocks foreign aid from going to international organizations that promote or pay for abortion procedures, he was met with robust applause from the Republican lawmakers.

Trump then turned to the annual March for Life, which will take place Friday. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the pro-life crowd.

“And by the way, on Friday, a lot of people are going to be showing up to Washington, right Mike?” Trump said. “A lot of people.”

Trump reiterated his criticism of the mainstream media for largely ignoring the largest pro-life gathering in the world: “You know, the press never gives them the credit that they deserve. They’ll have three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred thousand people, you won’t even read about it.”

“When other people show up, you read big-time about it, right?” Trump asked the crowd, likely referring to the Women’s March on Washington, which took place the day after his inauguration.

“So it’s not fair,” Trump added. “But nothing fair about the media. Nothing.”President Trump arguably had the wildest, wide-ranging, and most entertaining press conference ever given in the White House. And we’re not even a month into his presidency.

But something occurred to me while watching him answer question after question and trashing the media nonstop… he is now his best spokesman.

Just look at three of his most vocal surrogates: Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, and Stephen Miller. Over the past three-and-a-half weeks, they’ve all sparked their own controversy while speaking on behalf of the president.

Sean Spicer kicked off his term as Press Secretary by berating the media about how they covered President Trump’s crowd size at his inauguration. He quickly became the most combative press secretary in US history practically getting into bickering sessions with certain reporters. He comes off so much as a hothead, SNL brilliantly captured his essence with Melissa McCarthy.

Kellyanne Conway was once a strong surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail when she served as his campaign manager. But now as a counselor to the president, she’s been fumbling from right out of the gate. She raised eyebrows when pointing to “alternative facts”, she was slammed for her “Bowling Green Massacre” misstatement, and she found herself in legal trouble when she promoted Ivanka Trump’s products while doing an interview in the White House. She’s become so infamous for bending the truth and dodging questions, she has now been banned from MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Perhaps she needs a reboot, but defending a presidential candidate, which she was great at doing, is different than defending a president.

Stephen Miller hasn’t gotten as much airtime, but one round on the Sunday morning news shows was more than enough. While he dismissed the reports that he and Steve Bannon were the author of President Trump’s botched executive order, he didn’t do a great job defending it. And on the revived subject of voter fraud, he insisted that fraudulent votes in New Hampshire were coming in by the busload and that prevented Trump from winning that state… without any sort of evidence. Let’s just say you might not be seeing him on the Sunday morning circuit anytime soon.

Unlike Spicer, Conway, and Miller, President Trump can masterfully take on tough questions and ridicule the media at once. And despite having a complicated relationship with the truth, he remarkably can give these crazy, inaccurate answers that even he seems to believe.

To be honest, his surrogates should either be retrained or be benched and just let their boss do the talking.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Democrats have been running wild in the wake of the Michael Flynn scandal. From jumping to conclusions that the Trump team are essentially agents for Russia to comparing this to Watergate and even calling Russia’s intrusion as an act of war on the level of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. The rhetoric is insane!

That said, there is complete legitimacy to have concerns regarding Flynn’s short-term activity as Trump’s National Security Advisor. Frankly, his communications with Russian officials should be investigation and ultimately the transcripts should be made public. However, this scandal is twofold, but Democrats are only acknowledging one side.

The one side Democrats are panicking about is the truth behind Flynn’s (and to some extent President Trump and his team’s) relationship with Russia. The other side involves the fact that Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador was illegally leaked to the press.

Individuals in the intelligence community have take it upon themselves to “resist” the Trump presidency. They’re Obama loyalists who have beef with their new boss. In this case, whistleblowers likely within in the NSA broke the law by leaking classified information and disclosing Flynn’s identity in the wiretapped conversations with the Russian ambassador (such a disclosure requires the president’s approval).

In other words, General Flynn was the target of a political assassination. That doesn’t excuse his lying to Vice President Mike Pence, which as of now is his only wrongdoing known to the public and further investigations will conclude whether Flynn was up to no good. But individuals in the intelligence community has weaponized their tools to undermine President Trump and to advance their political agenda. They’re acting as if the intelligence community is its own branch of government. It’s not. They a part of the executive branch and whether they like it or not, President Trump is at the top.

Democrats ought to be outraged by this. It wasn’t too long ago when they were outraged at Russia for hacking the DNC and John Podesta’s emails. They virtually ignored the content of those damning emails, similarly to how some Republicans are dismissing the content of Flynn’s conversations. Instead, they just want to shoot the messenger. Democrats and Republicans may be far different from one another, but one thing they have in common is that they’re all a bunch of hypocrites.

So while Flynn and the Trump administration should be held accountable if their actions were unlawful, so should the ones who actually broke the law, aka the leakers.Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke does not hide the fact that he’s a great supporter of President Trump, in fact he vehemently and exuberantly defends him and his policies whenever he can all over your television dial.

But he put other Trump supporters to shame Friday with what is quite possibly the Trumpiest selfie ever tweeted.

Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS. I've never been prouder since we got rid of him. pic.twitter.com/pzAxahe7eD — David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) February 17, 2017

The tweet reads, “Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS [president of the United States]. I’ve never been prouder since we got rid of him.”

Clarke is making reference to a controversial statement the former first lady made in March of 2008 during the primary election. “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback,” she said, making people wonder if this was an expression of hostility towards America.

He followed that one up with this post:

So many people shared Sheriff Clarke’s sentiment that the tweet has been retweeted 8,466 times and “favorited” 23,501 times, at the time of publication.On Tomi’s “Final Thoughts,” she dishes on controversial pop star Lady Gaga, pointing out that she set an example other entertainers should follow during her Super Bowl halftime show. Tomi appreciates that Lady Gaga chose to keep her political opinions to herself throughout the performance, something Meryl Streep and other celebrities can learn from. Tomi contrasts this approach with many of the Super Bowl commercials, which “capitalized on political ignorance with a side of hypocrisy.”

The clip showing the lead vehicle flying the Trump flag was shot Sunday and left many wondering who the vehicle occupants were and if they were with a military unit or were military surplus, ABC News said.

Now military officials are investigating if the flag-flying equates to misconduct, the network reported.

“Defense Department and Navy regulations prescribe flags and pennants that may be displayed as well as the manner of display,” Lt. Jacqui Maxwell, a spokesperson for Naval Special Warfare Group 2, told ABC News. “The flag shown in the video was unauthorized.”

Maxwell added to the network that the convoy consisted of “service members assigned to an East Coast-based Naval Special Warfare unit driving vehicles while transiting between two training locations.”

Naval Special Warfare Unit is the official Navy term for SEALs, ABC News said.

However, Navy Special Warfare Units consist of various support staff, which means those who were inside the vehicle flying the flag may not be SEALs, Maxwell added to the network.

Maxwell said the unit commander will “make a disposition decision as to the appropriate administrative or disciplinary action” if it’s determined that misconduct occurred.

Here’s one clip. An occupant in the vehicle from where the video was taken apparently says, “You’ve got to be kidding me,” as it approaches the military vehicle flying the Trump flag:The announcement from DHS Secretary John Kelly to finish President Trump’s border wall in two years is exciting to some and infuriating to others.

The night of the election, we saw jaws drop and tears flow from news anchors and the media at large. Since November 9th, we have seen routine riots, beatings, and other demonstrations. Comparisons of Trump to Adolf Hitler are common. The Left has no idea what to do.

.

But even a month after Trump’s inauguration, the Left cannot help themselves from continuously looking more and more unhinged. This week, liberals are still comparing Trump to the worst possible atrocities in history. For example, last Friday, former Virginia congressman and current Democrat gubernatorial candidate Tom Perriello compared Trump’s election to 9/11, and after the Washington Free Beacon published footage, Perriello was forced to apologize Wednesday.

.

“The election of Donald Trump was a little bit like, you know, a political and constitutional Sept. 11 for us, if I can be honest.” Perriello said on a campaign stop in Afton, Virginia. His apology came through Twitter, and Perriello explained that he meant that Trump’s election was a historical blow to the Democratic establishment.

.

Keep in mind that Perriello’s comment occurred in Virginia, where 200 people died on 9/11 when a plane crashed into the Pentagon. More than 2,000 died in New York. Many others were killed when Flight 93 crashed into the ground in Pennsylvania. The comparison between the election of someone you don’t support in no way compares to one death, let alone thousands.

.

But Perriello is not alone in his insensitive, asinine remarks. Thomas Friedman, a Leftist columnist for the New York Times, claimed in his piece that Trump’s election belongs in the same category as 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. Friedman was addressing the resignation of national security advisor Mike Flynn on Monday, which brought speculation that the administration has ties to the Russian government, a claim that has still brought no evidence. He likened the election, considering these accusations against Flynn, to a foreign attack.

.

Friedman’s piece reads, “Ladies and gentlemen, we were attacked on Dec. 7, 1941 [Pearl Harbor], we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, and we were attacked on Nov. 8, 2016. That most recent attack didn’t involve a horrible loss of lives, but it was devastating in its own way.”

.

This is from the same person who has repeatedly claimed that America should be more like China. He said nothing about Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, and its secret side deals, including sending a plane filled with cash in the dead of night, in order to be untraceable.

.

Now, suddenly, the Left cares about national security. But their feigning interest in America’s safety is about nothing more than trying to discredit Trump, because they have no clue how to deal with his election. They cannot deal with the idea that they are losing power. Little do they realize that their loss of power will continue if they continue to act this way.

“It’s the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that’s incredibly difficult to replicate,” David Wade, who served as State Department chief of staff under Secretary of State John Kerry, told the Washington Post, which first broke the story.

“Department expertise in security, management, administrative and consular positions in particular are very difficult to replicate and particularly difficult to find in the private sector,” he added.

As former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick to helm the State Department, was getting acquainted with Foggy Bottom this week, there was a smattering of firings and resignations occurring.

While Post reporter Josh Rogin’s report suggested that all the officials resigned, CNN has a different take. State Department officials told Elise Labott, CNN’s global affairs correspondent, that the Trump White House fired four top officials.

.@eliselabottcnn reports they were sent letters by the White House that their service was no longer required — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 26, 2017

The officials who are out, either through firings or resignation, are Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, Assistant Secretaries of State Joyce Anne Barr, Gregory Starr and Michele Bond, Director of Foreign Missions Gentry Smith and Director of the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations Lydia Muniz.

And according to Wade, there is just no easy way to fill those posts again:

Diplomatic security, consular affairs, there’s just not a corollary that exists outside the department, and you can least afford a learning curve in these areas where issues can quickly become matters of life and death. The muscle memory is critical. These retirements are a big loss. They leave a void. These are very difficult people to replace.

The Post report expressed uncertainty about whether or not Kennedy, who had previously been angling to keep his job under Tillerson, was among those fired, given the issue seems to be disputed among State Department staffers.

Kennedy aided a lot with the transition, according to the report, but he has a few skeletons in his closet leftover from when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was leading the agency.

According to Politico, Kennedy was instrumental in trying to coax the FBI into changing its mind about giving one of Clinton’s emails a secret classification during its investigation:

Deputy Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy intervened with the FBI to dispute the classification at least three times: in a May 14, 2015, call to International Operations Division chief Brian McCauley, at an in-person meeting at the State Department five days later and in a phone conversation with the head of FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, Michael Steinbach. The unnamed FBI author of the message to Jupina said Kennedy summoned various officials to State to discuss the review of 55,000 of Clinton emails requested under FOIA. At that meeting, Kennedy asked the FBI representative and a Justice Department FOIA official to “stay behind to discuss the FBI determination” on classification in the first batch of Clinton emails, the FBI email says. An email from Steinbach said he turned down Kennedy’s request that the information be withheld solely under a FOIA provision for protection of law enforcement sources, rather than by classifying it.

His efforts, however, proved unsuccessful.

Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “drain the swamp,” but it remains to be seen if this is exactly the kind of draining he had in mind.

In the election, Trump constantly railed against the former President Barack Obama’s approach to foreign policy and promised to upend many of the practices he had put in place, most notably when it comes to defeating ISIS. But with no governmental experience of his own, the vacancies could pose a big problem for Trump’s administration.

Upon confirmation, Tillerson’s most pressing job will be to find qualified and experienced personnel to fill the new void.

“You don’t run foreign policy by making statements, you run it with thousands of people working to implement programs every day,”Ambassador Richard Boucher, who served as State Department spokesman for Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, told the Post. “To undercut that is to undercut the institution.”One of the frequent symbols seen throughout last month’s Women’s March march was the knitted hats portraying certain elements of female anatomy. The day following the march, an individual walked into a yarn store called The Joy of Knitting in Franklin, Tennessee and asked for pink yarn so she could knit her own hat. The yarn store owner, Elizabeth Poe, took to Facebook asking those interested in yarn for these types of hats to kindly take their business elsewhere. Elizabeth Poe joins Dana Loesch to discuss the backlash she received and why the country needs to come together now more than ever.

Dana states how no one really cares what a business thinks on politics and that Americans just want to know if they can purchase what they want. Klavan feels that most of America has embraced and is encircled by the left wing bubble, and they think that it’s reality.

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) compared President-elect Donald Trump to third-world regime dictator Fidel Castro of Cuba, saying the two men had the same personality traits.

Cohen, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, made the comment on Tuesday to CNN’s Carol Costello, who later pushed back against against the comparison.

Citing Trump’s skepticism of U.S. intelligence sources saying Russia is responsible for attempting to sway the U.S. election by hacking the Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta’s email and the Democratic National Committee’s email system, Cohen told Costello:

The last two people in the Western hemisphere that I remember being so close to Russia were Armand Hammer, who loved oil and money, and Fidel Castro, who loved to talk for long periods of time, hated disloyalty and dissent and eliminated it and was very much an egocentric individual.

Castro died in November, but for decades he ruled over the Cuban people, denying them basic human rights, executing his political opponents and siding with Russia against the U.S. throughout the Cold War. Armand Hammer was an American businessman who ran Occidental Petroleum, developing close ties to the former Soviet Union as he went about his corporate dealings.

Costello pressed Cohen, asking if he was really comparing Trump to Castro. The Democratic congressman replied: “Personality traits, indeed.”

Cohen went on to cite a Netflix show while explaining how he arrived at that conclusion:

You watch the Netflix program on Cuba Libra. Castro needed to be the center of attention at all time. He executed certain of his comrades for trumped up charges because he wanted total control and put that fear into people. He was very close to his family and he had a multitude in his family. He didn’t trust others and it was all about him and public speaking and he liked to speak on… [inaudible].

Cohen asserted that, with the exception of the fact that Castro was dedicated to a communist philosophy and making allegiance with Russia, “there are a lot of personality traits that are similar” between Trump and Castro.

But Cohen didn’t stop there, claiming that Trump doesn’t even know it is his committee that can start impeachment proceedings.

“I don’t really think he knows it’s Congress, and really the Judiciary Committee, that can bring impeachment charges,” Cohen said.

Cohen then charged that people at the bottom are “going to die” under a Trump presidency because they can’t get healthcare, while people at “Lago Maro” will continue to enjoy a great life. Cohen was referring to Trump’s South Florida estate, which is called Mar-a-Lago.

Cohen eventually corrected the name of the world-renowned beachfront property.

(H/T: Weasel Zippers)For the first time in eight years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was warmly welcomed into the White House. President Trump, who has been friendly with Netanyahu for years, met with the Israeli leader for the first time as Commander in Chief. And so far, US-Israeli relations are off to a good start.

Their joint press conference perfectly summed up the alliance between the US and the Jewish State. President Trump firmly declared that Israel has America’s full support, especially when it comes to the fight against terrorism and the growing threat Iran has become in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal. Trump again floated the possibility of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which would send a major political message.

But the big headline that came from this meeting was that President Trump has broken the 30-year US policy of vocally supporting the two-state solution, which formed under the Clinton administration with the hopes that Israel and Palestinians can live peacefully with divided territory. While he didn’t flat-out reject the solution, Trump basically said that whatever Israel supports, we support whether it be a two-state solution or a one-state solution.

Not pushing the two-state solution is a major, positive change to US foreign policy. For starters, the US shouldn’t be pushing a solution if neither parties are onboard. Secondly, Bibi Netanyahu put some pressure on Palestinians with his demands: that they recognize Israel as a Jewish State and they allow Israel to have enough territory to fulfill their national security needs. For Palestinians, that’s easier said than done, especially since the terrorist group Hamas runs the show in the Gaza strip.

That’s not to say that Trump and Netanyahu’s relationship is all smooth sailings. Trump did urge his ally to slow down on the expansion of the Israeli settlements, which triggered an awkwardly humorous exchange between the two leaders. That said, this is a honeymoon couple in comparison to Netanyahu’s bitter relationship with President Obama, who blatantly towards the end of his presidency tried to undermine Israel.

While the media painted this picture that world leaders fear what a Trump presidency might bring on Election Night, we know at least one leader who was cheering (well, maybe two if you count Putin). It’s been reported that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is the one who’s supposed to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. If he succeeds, it may be regarded as the biggest US foreign policy accomplishment in the past 50 years.

In the meantime, President Trump will make US-Israeli relations great again. Maybe he can put that on a hat.Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Texas Governor Greg Abbott has given no quarter in his war against sanctuary cities within his state. He has already made himself “abundantly clear” in making sure any towns within the state of Texas obey immigration laws, and that he doesn’t “care what jurisdiction you’re at in the state of Texas. You are going to comply with the law.”

It would appear that Abbott may have to back up his word against Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, who has forbid anyone in her offices to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

In a letter sent to Hernandez, Abbott called her directive “dangerous” and “shortsighted,” and proceeded to make the threat that if she does not reverse this policy by February 1st, the consequences would be incredibly expensive, in the form of millions of dollars being cut from the funding budget for the Travis County Sheriff’s Department.

Abbott sets up by telling Hernandez that she had betrayed her oath by adopting this policy.

As Sheriff your primary duty is to ensure the safety of the residents of Travis County. However, your recent policy directive forbidding Travis County Sherriff’s Office (TCSO) employees from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (except in the most limited of circumstances) betrays your oath and the residents of Travis County. I strongly urge you to reverse that policy before its effective date of February 1, 2017.

Hernandez had at one point attempted to justify her directive, but Abbott, is having none of it, smashes her reasoning.

You offer two justifications for your actions, but both are frivolous. First, you claim you have no legal power to comply with ICE detainers. That proves too much, of course, because by your own admission, TCSO will honor some ICE detainers — for example, when the alien is charged with or convicted of capital murder. You have the exact same legal authority to honor ICE detainers for capital murder cases as you do for other crimes that you personally deem unworthy of enforcement. Second, you claim that TCSO should focus on “public safety,” while the federal government focuses on immigration enforcement. That ignores, of course, that the individuals subject to ICE detainers pose grave threats to public safety. The whole point of ICE’s detainer program is to ensure that the worst of the worst do not walk free and further jeopardize public safety.

An just to make it clear, he gives Hernandez some “staggering” numbers to bring home the reality of just how dangerous her policy is.

Indeed, the potential impact of this public safety program is staggering. Since 2011, over 200,000 undocumented aliens have been booked into Texas jails. These undocumented aliens were charged with more than 559,000 criminal offenses. According to Texas Department Public Safety, those included 1,132 homicide charges; 66,687 assault charges; 16,304 burglary charges; 66,289 drug charges; 682 kidnapping charges; 39,689 theft charges; 43,723 obstructing police charges; 3,677 robbery charges; 5,903 sexual assault charges; and 8,375 weapons charges. Of the total undocumented aliens arrested in that time frame, over 139,000, or 66 percent, were identified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as being in the United States illegally at the time of a previous arrest

He holds little of his disapproval of this directive back.

Your shortsighted policy ignores those astounding figures and would permit TCSO employees to comply with an ICE detainer request in only the most limited of circumstances. Under your reckless policy, for example, dangerous criminal aliens convicted of felonies like murder; aggravated assault; human trafficking, including child sex trafficking; aggravated kidnapping; inducing sexual performance by a child or indecency with a child; dangerous gang activities; and the manufacture or delivery of deadly substances such as heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, GHB, PCP, and ketamine will be turned loose into Travis County without permitting ICE the opportunity to collect them.

Abbott then lets Hernandez know that if she doesn’t comply, then he will drop the hammer.

In the coming days, my office will reach out to you. We will ask that you reverse your policy and recommit to enforce federal immigration laws. Failure to accomplish both of those tasks prior to February 1, 2017, will disqualify Travis County from receiving subsequent CJD grant money.

Since President Donald Trump has been on confirmed to take office, Abbott has been very proactive about immigration issues in the state of Texas. He has threatened before to cut funding from any campus or city that labels itself a “sanctuary” for illegals. His threats against Sheriff Hernandez will very likely be followed up on.Tomi Lahren discusses in “Final Thoughts” the supremely qualified Neil Gorsuch, who was picked by President Donald Trump to be the next Supreme Court Justice.

A winter storm moved through parts of the deep south and mid-Atlantic late this week and into Saturday, dropping sleet, freezing rain and lots of snow in many locations. Parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and up the eastern seaboard were areas hit the hardest by the storm.

But as per usual, South Charlotte didn’t see much snow. Rather, they saw a mixed bag of sleet and freezing rain and just a little snow.

That’s what made Stehpen Wilfong’s video so funny. Because as he is talking about the “white blanket of death” that ravaged his neighborhood, barely any snow accumulation can be seen in the background.

“People are waking up this morning and saying, ‘Oh my god. We had no idea it would be this bad in Charlotte,'” Wilfong said, pointing to brown grass and damp roads. “You can see back here on the streets — I don’t know you could even get a snowmobile through this nonetheless a car.”

“We’re getting reports right now that people got trapped in their cars in this white blanket of death,” he hilariously added. “My source at the weather station said they didn’t know it could even get this bad.”

But the comedy was taken a step further. One of the staples of living in the south and anticipating winter weather is running to the grocery store to buy bread and milk. Why? People don’t really know, but if you live in the south and winter weather is impending, then you know that the grocery stores will be nearly empty as the storm approaches.

Wilfong poked fun at this tradition, saying that when the city of Charlotte “ran out of salt” on Friday, what they did to rectify the situation was quite “brilliant,” while pointing behind him to a “survival station,” which had several loaves of bread and half gallons of milk on it.

“If you can make your way to one of these…you can get your daily ration of milk and bread to help keep you alive for as long as possible,” he joked.

“And like I said before, we talked to these people at the weather station, one of my closest friends who’s been doing this for 38 years, told me, ‘Hey Steve, it hasn’t been this bad since the last time it did nothing.'”

What made the video even funnier? Wilfong was speaking into a plastic, toy microphone.

And it’s clear people are finding the video extremely funny. In the five hours that it’s been on Facebook, it has already been viewed nearly 400,000 times and shared nearly 11,000 times.

In 2014 they were set to host their own show on HGTV called “Flip It Forward,” where they helped people buy houses normally out of their price range. The brothers had a successful career flipping houses for profit, and were all set to begin their show in October.

However, due to their Christian beliefs and stances on abortion, the media whipped detractors into a frenzy which soon put so much pressure on the HGTV network that they were forced to cancel the Benham’s show before it could get off the ground.

Fast forward to today, when Cosmopolitan and Buzzfeed launched an attack on popular HGTV “Fixer Upper” hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines. Their crime?

Holding Christian beliefs.

According to Cosmo and Buzzfeed, the Gaines are guilty of attending a church that holds to the belief that homosexuality is a sin, which in the world of the social justice left is a top thought crime.

The Benham brothers were only too happy to share some insight on what was happening to the Gaines family with the Blaze’s own Dana Loesch, seeing as how they were the victims of a similar smear campaign.

“David and I also know what the phone call that Chip and Joanna probably received from HGTV is the same as what we received,” says Jason Benham. “I remember when (HGTV) called us and said ‘guys, man we are getting pushed, and we’re getting hammered by these groups.’ And I know that’s exactly what’s happening right now.

“David and I, by God’s grace were able to say ‘look, we’re going to stand for whats true and what’s right,'” continued Jason. “And the Gaines will too. They just need support from the Christian community.”

“HGTV will not fire them. I’m confident of that,” added David. “The Gaines will not bend to this garbage pressure that’s coming from this thought mafia that’s forcing them to bow.”

The brothers predict that due to this controversy, fans will vote with their wallet and overwhelm the Gaines with orders for their products.

Certain belief systems from churches are attacked outright, as the Gaines and Benham families can attest, however there are some beliefs that come from churches that seem to be perfectly okay. You’ll recall the reverend Jeremiah Wright proclaimed “G** damn America,” that Israel shouldn’t exist, and that we’re “Amerikkka.” These kinds of beliefs seem to be positive in the eyes of those who seek to defame and destroy people like Chip and Joanna Gaines.Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly offered to extradite Edward Snowden to the U.S. as a goodwill gift to President Donald Trump.

Glenn Beck and the guys debate whether or not the offer is serious and what Russia stands to gain from the extradition. Glenn asserts that Snowden is no longer useful to Russia, and even the offer of extradition is bound to stir up strife and discord in the U.S.

Now, go have fun and speak your mind!President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned last night following reports that he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia. Flynn wrote in his resignation letter that he held numerous calls with the Russian Ambassador to the United States and that he “withheld information” about those calls to Pence. Retired CIA officer and VP for Research and Analysis at the Center for Security Policy Clare Lopez joins Dana to discuss. Clare questions whether we can trust our own intelligence community to not leak like a sieve to the media.

Focusing on Chicago, America’s petri dish of liberal policies, MacDonald reveals that arrests and overall policing is in decline in the city:

Arrests are down 28 percent this year in the Windy City, the lowest since at least 2001, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, and less than half what they were in 2010. Drug arrests are down by half. Pedestrian stops were down 82 percent by early fall.

But rather than launching it into a new golden age of peace and prosperity, Chicago is experiencing a renaissance of crime:

So far this year, 4,334 people have been shot in Chicago: one person every two hours. Almost all the victims have been black. The police have shot 25 people, virtually all armed or otherwise dangerous — less than .6 percent of the total.

This is a drastic increase from last year, when 2,989 people were shot, and there were 492 homicides. Shootings have increased 45 percent over last year, and homicides have increased 56.5 percent, according to the Chicago Tribune. Less than 1 percent of the shootings have been by the police, and yet Black Lives Matter focuses on this minuscule number instead of the real threat to the black community represented by the rest of the 99.4 percent of shootings.

MacDonald says the real culprit is what academics and social justice groups have actually advocated as the solution to high crime rates: de-policing and the undoing of “broken window” policies that help deter greater crimes by targeting lesser criminals before they get a chance to expand their criminal activities.

She hopes that this will highlight the devastating consequences of de-policing to prevent other cities from implementing the policies that have caused so much misery in the beleaguered city of Chicago.Community Rules

Some 231 criminals are being granted a pardon, though they were guilty of breaking firearm laws in connection with drug trafficking crimes, and after Dana gave some quick facts about how our current gun laws are not being properly enforced, along with some facts, Konst made the mistake of trying to paint Dana’s facts as something else. This naturally prompted Dana to turn up the heat, without getting remotely heated herself.

“I see what Dana’s doing here,” said Konst. “She’s taking an anecdote-“

“No, it’s data,” Dana cut in immediately. “It’s real data.”

“It’s an anecdote from the data-” Konst tried to say.

“No, it’s actually Cook County statistics,” interrupted Dana again. “I’m not going to let you brush this off with your lack of education on this topic. This is real data you’re not going to brush off with some gun control anecdote.”

From there on, the debate became a sparring match with Konst trying to refer to notes, and Dana firing facts from off the top of her head at the same time. The host had to interject to try to bring order, but it quickly became another overlap of the two women talking over one another. Eventually, Konst devolved into accusing Dana of racism.

“Nomiki, I will railroad you all day long if you keep trying to brush my facts off. These are the facts of the matter,” finished Dana.

Mattis met with defense officials from the 27 other NATO member nations in Brussels and made his first address to the alliance as U.S. defense secretary. In the speech, he called the NATO alliance the “fundamental bedrock for the U.S. and all the transatlantic community,” according to CNN.

However, because only five of the member nations currently meet the spending target — 2 percent of their gross domestic product must be spent on defense — required for membership, Mattis issued a strong directive to alliance members regarding the need for a renewed focus on meeting the financial requirement for membership. The five nations that currently meet the NATO spending requirement are the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, Greece and the United States.

“No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of western values,” Mattis said, CNN reported. “Americans cannot care more for your children’s security than you do. Disregard for military readiness demonstrates a lack of respect for ourselves, for the alliance, and for the freedoms we inherited, which are now clearly threatened.”

Mattis was NATO’s supreme allied commander of transformation from November 2007 to September 2009. He told defense ministers that he recalled how, at the time, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates had warned NATO nations that the U.S. Congress and the American people “would lose their patience for carrying a disproportionate burden” of the defense of allies.

That impatience has now been realized, he said, calling it a “governmental reality.”

France, Turkey, Germany, Italy and Canada are among the major western nations that take part in the alliance but have not met the 2 percent spending mandate, according to NATO figures, the Washington Post reported. The other member nations have pledged to increase their defense spending to meet the target beginning in 2024.

The meeting of the defense ministers comes as the member nations begin discussion about Russia and the appropriate response to the nation’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, according to the Post.

“Fellow ministers, when the Cold War ended we all had hopes,” Mattis told his colleagues in Brussels. “The year 2014 awakened us to a new reality: Russia used force to alter the borders of one of its sovereign neighbors, and on Turkey’s border [the Islamic State] emerged and introduced a ruthless breed of terror, intent on seizing territory and establishing a caliphate. While these events have unfolded before our eyes, some in this alliance have looked away in denial of what was happening.”

Mattis further stressed that there is hope for a better relationship with Russia if member nations employ a policy of strength in negotiations.

“We remain open to opportunities to restore a cooperative relationship with Moscow, while being realistic in our expectations and ensuring our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength,” he said.

President Donald Trump has been critical of NATO in the past, saying during a joint interview with the Times of London and the German publication Bild in January that the alliance “had problems.”

“Number one, it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago [and] number two, the countries weren’t paying what they’re supposed to be paying,” Trump said.

He was more complimentary of the alliance in February while addressing U.S. Central Command in Florida.

“We strongly support NATO,” he said. “We only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions to the NATO alliance, which many of them have not been doing. Many of them have not been even close. And they have to do that.”

According to CNN, Mattis asked NATO defense ministers to draft a plan ensuring NATO is not in the same situation this time next year and urged member states to increase defense spending to meet the 2 percent target.Rebbie Roberson resides in Bowie County, Texas — where guns are a familiar sight and used without apology.

And this 74-year-old grandmother is no exception.

Roberson told KSLA-TV that she was about to sit down Sunday night to watch the TV news when an armed masked man wearing gloves broke into her home.

“And when I started to get up, he was in here on me with a gun facing me right to my face,” she told KSLA, adding that she had to “walk right out in front of him. I didn’t know if he was going to kill me or what.”

But Roberson wasn’t about to let the gunman get the upper hand — and grabbed her very own .38 from a table: “And when I swerved around, I pointed it at him, and he ran.”

Believe it or not, she took off after the intruder and fired her pistol. The bullet holes in her walls are evidence of that.

“I’m not sure I didn’t hit him,” Roberson told KSLA. “I don’t know yet. I sure tried. I sure was hoping. That was the scare of my life.”

Sitting in her chair and pointing her gun upward as she spoke to a reporter, Roberson was resolute.

“I tried to kill ’em,” she acknowledged to the station. “Anybody break in on me, I’m gonna kill ’em. He’s going to kill me, or I’m going to kill him.”

Roberson said she always keeps her gun close while she’s at home, and Bowie County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Jeff Neal told KSLA he has no issue with that.

“Every citizen, according to the Texas penal code, has the right to defend themselves and their family,” Neal told the station.

Officials told KSLA they don’t believe the suspect was injured.

A number of Texas legislators are looking to pass “constitutional carry” in the state during 2017, which would grant all Texans the right to openly carry firearms without a permit if they choose.Lee Kaplan is an undercover investigative journalist who has been published and on radio and television internationally. Kaplan joins Doc Thompson to talk about his latest investigative report on The Shia Association of Bay Area. He explains that after a comment on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the Catholic Bishop Patrick Joseph McGrath visited and declared “solidarity” with The Shia Association of the Bay Area (a.k.a. SABA Islamic Center), a staunchly pro-Iranian regime, anti-Semitic organization based in San Jose, California.

Maybe it was because the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday had just ended — and Republican Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration was just days away.

Whatever the reason, an apparently displeased Kentucky woman took to Twitter at 1:45 a.m. Tuesday and posted the following: “If someone was cruel enough to assassinate MLK, maybe someone will be kind enough to assassinate Trump. #bekind #trump #lovetrumpshate.”

Soon after, the sender of the tweet — Heather Lowrey of Louisville — was in trouble, WAVE-TV reported.

A screenshot was taken of her tweet, and then other social media users alerted Lowrey’s employers, the station said. Her social media accounts were soon taken down, but it was too late.

First off, the Secret Service interviewed Lowrey and opened an investigation on her, WAVE said.

“Any time threatening communications like that are made, we always conduct an investigation,” an agent told the Courier-Journal.

What’s more, Lowrey’s employers — four of them — gave her the ax.

Among them were the Va Va Vixens — Louisville’s “largest and most popular burlesque and variety troupe,” according to the group’s website — who who said Lowrey quickly got the big hook offstage.

“Please, know that we, at Va Va Vixens, do not condone the behavior of Heather Lowrey,” the group’s statement read, according to WAVE. “She was dismissed the moment we were informed of this incident. We have a zero tolerance policy for such. It’s no secret that we are in the midst of a divided nation. With so much hate and anger in the world, our hope is to be a sanctuary that welcomes all walks of life with open arms. We do not condone hate by any party and will not partake in it. We in no way support negative behavior or malicious intent from anyone.”

American Income Life — Travis Moody Office, Kentucky-Indiana didn’t take too kindly to Lowrey’s tweet, either, and posted this statement on Facebook:

Heather Lowrey is no longer contracted with the Travis Moody Agency. The Travis Moody Agency, its agents and its staff do not share the same views, nor opinions as Heather Lowrey. We have a zero tolerance policy and would never condone this behavior.

Same with the Elizabeth Monarch group, which is with Keller Williams Realty: “Heather Lowery is no longer employed at the Elizabeth Monarch Group. She has not worked at this company for over 10 months,” the statement read, WAVE reported. “The Elizabeth Monarch Group, its agents, and its staff do not share the same views.”

And the Heyman Talent Agency noted on Twitter that Lowrey is no longer contracted with the organization. The Courier-Journal said it added that “our company does not share the same views, nor opinions as Heather Lowrey. We would never condone this behavior and have zero tolerance for hatred and negativity.”Community Rules

For more information, please see our Terms of Use. Now, go have fun and speak your mind!Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, is urging President Donald Trump to pick former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton as his national security adviser, following retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn’s resignation from the post earlier this week.

“One person I think would be very, very strong is John Bolton,” Cruz told CNN’s Manu Raju Friday. “He’s someone who understands the world; he understands the threats of radical Islamic terrorism.”

While choosing Bolton, who served as former President George W. Bush’s UN ambassador during the Iraq War, would win a lot conservative support, some Republicans — especially those within the libertarian wing of the GOP — would likely be quite upset with the pick.

For example, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was vehemently opposed to Bolton when he was being floated in November as a potential pick to helm the State Department. Paul, in a scathing op-ed at Rare, lambasted Bolton as “a longtime member of the failed Washington elite” who is “hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years.”

“At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy,” Paul wrote. “The man is a menace.”

Paul, who would like to see the U.S. scale back its presence internationally, has long taken issue with the former ambassador for his support of the Iraq War and regime change in the Middle East. At the time, he called Bolton “totally unfit” for secretary of state.

Cruz told CNN he understands Paul’s concerns and believes Bolton “agrees” that the U.S. should not be too quick to engage in military intervention.

“When it comes to foreign policy, Rand and I do not see eye-to-eye,” Cruz said. “I share Rand’s concern that we should not be overeager to engage in military conflict. That’s exactly right and I actually think … John Bolton agrees with that proposition as well.”

Cruz is pushing for Bolton to replace Flynn https://t.co/Szl9gYBEoM — Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) February 17, 2017

In addition, the Texas lawmaker argued Bolton could help the Trump administration toughen its perspective on Russia.

“He understands the threats of an overaggressive [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Cruz said of Bolton. “And at the same time, an understanding that we should be reluctant to use military force, that we should do so only when absolutely necessary.”

There have been renewed concerns voiced about Trump’s worldview regarding Russia this week, following reports — which the White House denies — that members of his team had “repeated contacts” with Russian intelligence officials prior to Inauguration Day.

As TheBlaze previously reported, Trump’s first choice to replace Flynn — retired Navy Vice Adm. Robert Harward — turned down the offer from the White House. A friend of Harward told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the admiral rejected the job because the administration appears too “chaotic” and he sees the offer as a “s**t sandwich.”After the Supreme Court of Washington State ruled 9-0 that a Christian florist violated anti-discrimination law when she refused to provide flower arrangements for a gay wedding, the embattled owner of Arlene’s Flowers declared that she wasn’t giving up.

Barronelle Stutzman told KIRO-TV that she’ll take her case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“It was terrifying when you think that the government is coming in and telling you what to think and what to do and what to say,” she told the station by phone after Thursday’s ruling, which included a $1,000 fine.

As TheBlaze previously reported, Stutzman was first sued in 2013 after she cited her Christian faith in declining to make floral arrangements for longtime client Robert Ingersoll‘s same-sex wedding.

Stutzman, a great-grandmother, argued that she was exercising her First Amendment rights. But the state’s high court held that her floral arrangements do not constitute protected free speech, and that providing flowers to a same-sex wedding would not serve as an endorsement of same-sex marriage.

“As Stutzman acknowledged at deposition, providing flowers for a wedding between Muslims would not necessarily constitute an endorsement of Islam, nor would providing flowers for an atheist couple endorse atheism,” the opinion said.

Stutzman’s attorney, Kristen Waggoner, had a different take on the issue.

“It’s wrong for the state to force any citizen to support a particular view about marriage or anything else against their will,” she wrote in a statement following the ruling. “Freedom of speech and religion aren’t subject to the whim of a majority; they are constitutional guarantees.”

At a press conference following the ruling, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said that under state law, a business is not required to provide a particular service, but if it does so for couples of the opposite sex, it must provide that service equally to same-sex couples. Ferguson noted that Stutzman is not currently selling wedding flowers, but if she were to resume that side of her business, she would not be allowed to sell only to heterosexual couples.

Here’s more of Stutzman’s story:

The Associated Press contributed to this story.

(H/T: Hot Air)Wrestling star John Cena took to the “Saturday Night Live” stage over the weekend to play President-elect Donald Trump in a skit that portrayed what a typical day “through the eyes of Donald” looks like.

During the entire skit, the camera angle is depicted as if it’s from Trump’s point-of-view.

Cena, playing Trump, began his day by watching some “Fox and Friends” in the morning — of course — which is a show that Trump regularly calls into. He then sipped his coffee and read the newspaper, which was titled “The Failing New York Times,” playing into Trump’s regular criticism of the publication.

After admiring himself and his “large” hands in the mirror, Trump goes into his office where he is met with advisers eager to give him his intelligence briefing. The rest of the skit shows a carousel of what his life is like in the office, meeting with wife Melania, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an eager fan, and of course, his right-hand-woman, Kellyanne Conway.

“Kellyanne will fix it. Mommy lives for you,” Conway, who is portrayed by Kate McKinnon, says in the skit as Trump drifts off into a nap. “Sleep and dream your favorite dream.”

The skit ends as Trump dreams of dancing with his favorite person: himself.

Watch the full skit below:

Cena was in for the actor who regularly plays Trump on “Saturday Night Live” — Alec Baldwin. And ironically, Trump didn’t take to Twitter Sunday to complain about “SNL,” something he has done many times over Baldwin’s performances.A Baltimore teacher was fired after video surfaced showing her calling students racist names.

“Get out of my class,” the teacher is heard yelling repeatedly at one student, who eventually leaves the room. The rest of the class then becomes riled up from the drama, and as the teacher walks back into the room, she refers to the remaining students as “punk ass n*****s” who are “gonna get shot.

The incident happened at Harlem Park Elementary and Middle School in Baltimore.

“I see it and I’m floored!” Erica Gales Deminds, 32, the mother of one of the students in the classroom at the time, told the New York Daily News. “So I uploaded it and shared it with my family, didn’t think it would go as far as it went.”

But the video quickly went viral, leading to the termination of the teacher in question.

The Baltimore City Public School District said in a statement: “We are committed to creating positive and equitable learning environments in school communities where all members are welcome, supported, and valued. No form of discriminatory behavior of any kind is or will be tolerated.”

While the teacher has not been publicly identified, Deminds said she was ordinarily a “very nice teacher.”

“I can’t say what happened that day. I think she was at a breaking point,” Deminds told the Daily News.
