The president pledged to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants, but to do so, he’ll need to enlist the help of local authorities.

Bed space was so hard to come by inside immigrant detention facilities across the country last fall that federal officials scrambled to rent out extra room in county prisons and jails. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration-enforcement arm, had thousands more immigrants in custody than it had the capacity to detain. As a result, hundreds of Haitian immigrants wound up wherever there was open jail space, often in remote regions like the Yakima County jail in eastern-Washington state and far from where they were first apprehended at the southern border. The federal immigrant detention network was bursting at the seams even before President Donald Trump entered office. Those problems will likely exacerbate after the president vastly expanded the pool of immigrants up for deportation. The Obama administration put in place a solution that is already proving beneficial to Trump: a blueprint on how to outsource immigration enforcement to local cops, leveraging their resources and infrastructure to execute Trump’s proposal to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants who have “criminal records.” Latest from Politics Republicans' New Plan to Gut Public Insurance In January, Trump signed an executive order on immigration enforcement that included measures to ramp up a program known as 287(g), which deputizes local law enforcement officers to double as federal immigration agents. Once trained, local officers are authorized to interview, arrest, and detain any person who may be in violation of immigration laws. Thirty-eight law enforcement agencies are currently collaborating with ICE, according to the government’s latest figures. But a report released by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in December found that the overwhelming majority of the 2,556 counties surveyed didn’t need formal programs: They were already offering assistance to ICE. An early example is the Milwaukee Sheriff’s Department, led by Trump surrogate David Clarke, which teamed up with ICE for a 2-day raid in Wisconsin that ended on the same day that the president signed his executive order enlisting help from local law enforcement. The sheriff’s department has not formally entered agreements to join the 287(g) program. Still, local law enforcement played an active role in arresting 16 undocumented immigrants, all of whom authorities said had previous criminal convictions ranging from assault to drug possession.

Trump celebrated this mutual alliance with local law enforcement earlier this month by inviting sheriffs from across the country to the White House. The local leaders emerged from the meetings emboldened by the enthusiastic backing they received from the president. Some floated ways to target elected officials in so-called “sanctuary cities” that refused to cooperate with the feds. (A crack down on these jurisdictions was also included in Trump’s executive order.) “As far as I’m concerned, if you want to straighten out these people who are refusing to allow the federal government to enforce the law, then if they’re harboring illegal immigrants, you give them an arrest warrant,” said Sheriff Thomas Hodgson of Bristol County, Massachusetts. Trump claimed credit for keeping his campaign promise to crackdown on illegal immigration after federal officials confirmed that more than 600 undocumented immigrants had been arrested across the country. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly described the operations as “routine” in a statement Monday. But immigrant rights groups fear this is just the beginning. And while President Obama earned a reputation as the “deporter in chief” for removing more undocumented immigrants than his predecessors, advocates say Trump has set the tone for what they expect to be an era of unprecedented enforcement. “The level of anxiety and fear has increased tremendously,” Cristina Jiménez, the executive director of the advocacy group United We Dream, told reporters Monday. “What is clear under Trump’s executive order is that everyone is a criminal.”

Trump made countless more undocumented immigrants vulnerable to deportation by casting virtually any run-in with local police as grounds for removal. Enforcement of the order, however, will likely lead to haphazard results, says Lena Graber, co-author of the ILRC report, because of how much the directives leave up to interpretation. “It’s good for intimidating people—bad for creating consistency or any predictability about what the government will do,” Graber said. Advocates say Trump has set the tone for what they expect to be an era of unprecedented enforcement. Uncertainty around how the new enforcement measures will be carried out on the local level is already rattling immigrant communities. ICE agents sparked panic in San Francisco last month after they mistakenly stormed a building with a preschool on site while on the hunt for an undocumented immigrant whom they say is a convicted sex offender. Former Mission District Supervisor David Campos called the incident “unusual.” The aggressive enforcement measures stand to test resources that are already maxed out to the limit, with immigrant detainee totals estimated to top 47,000 by mid-2017, The Wall Street Journal reports—far above levels funded through Congress. ICE has already secured new detention space at three new facilities within the last several months by contracting out private, for-profit prison companies to begin housing new immigrants. A facility in Georgia is set to hold 780 immigrant detainees, while another private prison based in Ohio will have the capacity to hold 2,000 early this year. A final location is planned in Cibola, New Mexico, where a private-run detention center will hold up to 1,116 immigrants, said ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seeking an undocumented immigrant visited a home in San Francisco’s Mission District on Thursday, but not before first stopping at a building housing a preschool next door by mistake, an agency spokesperson confirmed.

ICE’s Bay Area-based Fugitive Operations Teams conducting “routine enforcement activities” went to the Good Samaritan Family Resource Center at 1290 Potrero Ave. in the Mission District at about 9 a.m. Thursday, trying to locate a convicted sex offender sought for deportation. ICE did not specify the nature of the sex offense.

The family resource center where the ICE agents first visited contains a preschool on site, where 30 toddlers and children played feet away from where ICE agents entered the center.

“They had batons, they had walkie talkies, they had police belts and vests on top of their black uniforms. I didn’t notice if they had guns,” said Jaime Aragon, services coordination manager at Good Samaritan.

ICE spokesperson Virginia Kice said the agents first went to the person’s last known address and identified themselves as ICE officers, but were told the correct address was actually next door at the Good Samaritan-owned apartment building.

When the agents went next door, they did not find their target and left without making any arrests. Kice said such operations occur every day throughout the U.S.

“ICE’s enforcement actions are targeted and lead driven, focusing on individuals who pose a threat to national security, border security, and public safety,” Kice said in a statement.

Still, the incident sparked fear and outrage among immigration advocates in San Francisco

The incident, which former Supervisor David Campos called “unusual,” came only a day after President Donald Trump signed two executive orders that — among other actions — called for 10,000 new ICE agents to perform deportations across the country.

Campos, who termed out in November, said he can’t remember any ICE raids during his time as supervisor in the Mission District, a historically Latino neighborhood, and only a “couple of cases” where ICE was seeking someone for deportation.

“Trump just declared war on immigrants,” Campos said. “This is very unusual.”

Visiting a preschool and other sites containing children is prohibited for ICE under a 2011 Department of Homeland Security “sensitive locations” memorandum, save for exceptional circumstances.

A 2011 memorandum from then-Department of Homeland Security Director John Morton wrote that ICE agents “do not occur at nor are focused on sensitive locations such as schools and churches,” including preschools.

However, the order is not intended to “categorically prohibit” operations at sensitive locations like schools, according to the memo, and exceptions include enforcement over a national security or terrorism matter; an imminent risk of death, violence or physical harm; the immediate arrest or pursuit of a dangerous felon or terrorist suspect; or imminent risk of destruction of evidence in an ongoing criminal case.

Mayor Ed Lee’s spokesperson Deirdre Hussey said the incident Thursday is an example of how The City must continue to protect undocumented immigrants, even under the threat of losing federal funding by upholding its sanctuary city status.

“We encourage people to continue to visit their community based organization and get the services they need,” Hussey said. “San Francisco is and will remain a sanctuary city.”

Supervisor Hillary Ronen, whose district includes the Mission, echoed that sentiment.

“We don’t want people to be unnecessarily afraid,” Ronen said, adding that while this was an ICE appearance, “there has not been a raid.”

“Take this time to review your rights,” she said. A number of workshops for nonprofits and community members to review their immigration rights are scheduled for the next few weeks.

Click here or scroll down to commentI remember the moment, four years ago, when I realized just how well Big Data knew me. I was sitting in the newsroom one afternoon and clicked over to Facebook, where an advertisement caught my eye. There on my screen was an image of the exact pair of hot pink Tory Burch sandals I was wearing at that very moment. On my feet and on my screen: the same color, the same style, identical twins in patent leather. I had bought them in-person, something of an impulse because they were on sale, and had never looked at them anywhere online or even visited the designer's website. But somehow, Big Data determined, these were the sandals for me. And they were right. It was a silly thing. So Facebook knows what kinds of shoes I like. So what? But it creeped me out. How did they know? And more importantly: What else did they know? In the United States, there's not much we can do to find out which aspects of our personal lives are being bought and sold by data brokers. That's not the case in much of the rest of the world, where there are vast data protections, entire agencies devoted to data privacy, and serious enforcement efforts.

"Generally, if information is publicly available in the United States, its use is not restricted," said Jim Halpert, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C.-based firm DLA Piper who specializes in global data regulations. "The way that a defender of the U.S. system would respond is to say people don't really care if they get more specific advertising that they might be interested in... But it goes to discrimination in a certain way rather than to the information collection itself being a harm. At some point you can collect so much information about an individual that it becomes intrusive." The irony is that to find out which data about you is being bought and sold, you often have to give marketers even more information. Browse through DLA Piper's extensive guide to data regulations and enforcement around the world and it's clear that the United States stands out compared with more robust protections in places like Canada and Europe. (Elsewhere, protections are lesser or nonexistent.) Many European countries have central agencies dedicated to data protection. In France, individuals must give their consent before a data broker can distribute his or her data. In the United Kingdom, websites have to notify visitors of data-tracking software. Many European countries require data brokers to give individuals the opportunity to review their data profiles, and to show them how to access, change, remove, or otherwise object to the data that has been collected.

There's some dissonance to the fact that data protections in the U.S. are so slim compared with other regulations in other nations. Culturally, Americans prize the right to privacy. And there are U.S. sectors, like health care, where protecting personal data is paramount. But Americans don't even know which pieces of their personal data is swirling around out there. Your name, age, past addresses, political party enrollment, whether you own a home—sure, you might expect that kind of stuff is to be shared by marketers and others who deal in data. But data brokers specialize in inference, too, so they can figure out all kinds of super-specific details about who you are and how you live. "For example, a data broker might infer that an individual with a boating license has an interest in boating, that a consumer has a technology interest based on the purchase of a Wired magazine subscription, or that a consumer who has bought two Ford cars has loyalty to that brand," wrote the Federal Trade Commission in a report on Big Data this week. The FTC has been pushing for Congress to do something about free wheeling data brokers for the better part of the last decade. All this data collection is happening without consumer consent, and some the profiling that seems innocuous is actually harmful, the commission argues. One person profiled as low-income might be inundated with sub-prime mortgage offers. Another person profiled as a motorcyclist might be flagged by insurance companies for higher rates. The categories into which consumers are sorted are incredibly detailed, and they're based on a mix of government data (like the political donations you made), publicly available data (like the relationship status on your Facebook profile), and commercial data (like how Aquafresh Extreme Clean is your favorite brand of toothpaste, a nugget of data that's linked to you because you swiped your CVS rewards card before paying).

Big data knows your net worth. It knows that you have a dog. It knows when you're most likely to use a coupon. It knows your favorite brand of detergent. It knows your dress size. It knows about your last speeding ticket, and when you got the oil changed. It knows you have a hunting license. It knows whether you're pregnant—and often before you have a chance to share the news. The New York Times in 2012 told the alarming story of a teenager whose father angrily complained to Target for sending his young daughter promotional mailings for cribs and baby clothes. It later turned out the girl was pregnant, just as her data profile predicted. She simply hadn't told her parents yet. The head of one social analytics firm recently told me that his company's software can make eight inferences about you from a single tweet. Data trackers even incorporate information about you from your offline behaviors to create more detailed profiles for companies that want to target you online. The nine data brokers that the FTC examined for its report highlight the dizzying data-collection industry in the U.S. According to the report: data aggregator Rapleaf has at least one data point associated with more than 80 percent of all U.S. email addresses; analytics firm Corelogic has 795 million historical property transactions, 93 million mortgage applications, and property-specific data covering more than 99 percent of U.S. residential properties; and the firm Datalogix, in partnership with Facebook, has marketing information about almost every U.S. household and more than $1 trillion in consumer transactions. From the FTC report: Data brokers acquire a vast array of detailed and specific information about consumers; analyze it to make inferences about consumers, some of which may be considered sensitive; and share the information with clients in a range of industries. All of this activity takes place behind the scenes, without consumers’ knowledge. In the United States, the irony is that to find out which data about you is being bought and sold, you often have to give marketers even more information. For instance, data broker Acxiom runs the website About The Data, which bills itself as a portal to show you what marketers know about you. What isn't immediately clear is that Acxiom is on the marketers' side. The site's terms of use say that Acxiom can share with marketers the info your provide during registration—things like your name, address, and the last four digits of your Social Security number. Oh, and by the way: Acxiom, according to the FTC report, has some 3,000 data segments for nearly every U.S. consumer.For Immediate Release

Following the tragic January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) temporarily ceased removing Haitian nationals to Haiti. On April 1, 2011, ICE announced the resumption of removals on a limited basis of Haitians with final orders of removal and convicted of a serious crime, or who posed a national security threat. Since that time, the situation in Haiti has improved sufficiently to permit the U.S. government to remove Haitian nationals on a more regular basis, consistent with the practice for nationals from other nations.

Yesterday I directed that, effective immediately, enforcement decisions with respect to Haitian nationals should be, consistent standard practice, guided by my memorandum dated November 20, 2014, “Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants.” These policies prioritize the removal of convicted felons, individuals convicted of significant or multiple misdemeanors, and individuals apprehended at or between ports of entry while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States.

Consistent with law, individuals who express a fear of return to Haiti will be screened by a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officer to determine whether they possess a credible fear of persecution or torture. Those determined to have a credible fear will be referred to immigration court for removal proceedings where they may apply for asylum or other forms of relief.

Haitian nationals currently covered by Temporary Protected Status are unaffected by this change in policy. Specifically, those Haitian nationals who have been continuously residing in the United States since January 12, 2011 and currently hold TPS may remain in the United States and are not subject to removal. These TPS beneficiaries also remain eligible for employment authorization. TPS for Haitian nationals has been extended through July 22, 2017.

DHS will continue to promote safe, orderly avenues for Haitian nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States, including through Haitian Family Reunification Parole, which allows certain beneficiaries of approved family-based petitions to be paroled into the United States up to two years before their visa priority date becomes current.

DHS and the Department of State are working with the Government of Haiti and other key partners to resume removals in as humane and minimally disruptive a manner as possible.

# # #President-elect Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration stance was a central part of his campaign message in 2016 -- and he said in an interview Sunday that he plans to immediately deport approximately 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants.

“What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,” Trump said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally.”

He continued by saying that after the border is “secure,” immigration officials will begin to make a “determination” about the remaining undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

“After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,” he said. “But before we make that determination...it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.”

Asked whether he really plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border -- a proposal that served as a centerpiece of his campaign message -- Trump replied, “Yes.”

Since Trump’s election on Tuesday night, the realities of actually building that wall have begun to set in. The Mexican government has publicly reminded him that Mexico will not pay for the wall. And asked about the wall, Trump transition co-chair Newt Gingrich said the wall was “a great campaign device.”

Trump also told “60 Minutes” that the border wall, which was one of the centerpieces of his campaign platform, could be part wall and “some fencing,” in accordance with what congressional Republicans have proposed.

“For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,” he said. “I’m very good at this, it’s called construction.”Google knows the questions that people wouldn’t dare ask aloud, and it silently offers reams of answers. But it is a mistake to think of a search engine as an oracle for anonymous queries. It isn’t. Not even close. In some cases, the most intimate questions a person is asking—about health worries, relationship woes, financial hardship—are the ones that set off a chain reaction that can have troubling consequences both online and offline. All this is because being online increasingly means being put into categories based on a socioeconomic portrait of you that’s built over time by advertisers and search engines collecting your data—a portrait that data brokers buy and sell, but that you cannot control or even see. (Not if you’re in the United States, anyway.) Consider, for example, a person who googles “need rent money fast” or “can’t pay rent.” Among the search results that Google returns, there may be ads that promise to help provide payday loans—ads designed to circumvent Google’s policies against predatory financial advertising. They’re placed by companies called lead generators, and they work by collecting and distributing personal information about consumers online. So while Google says it bans ads that guarantee foreclosure prevention or promise short-term loans without conveying accurate loan terms, lead generators may direct consumers to a landing page where they’re asked to input sensitive identifiable information. Then, payday lenders buy that information from the lead generators and, in some cases, target those consumers—online, via phone, and by mail—for the very sorts of short-term loans that Google prohibits. “It’s a sucker list. And people will buy that information for all different kinds of reasons.” “Google has a decent policy—including ‘obey the law’—but it’s a very hard policy for Google to effectively enforce,” said Aaron Rieke, a projects director at Upturn, a technology policy consulting group in Washington, D.C. “As a result, payday advertisers are often violating it and skirting around it. The result is that online payday marketers are reaching out to people nationwide, even to people who live in states where payday lending—and the solicitation of payday loans—is effectively illegal.” Google declined multiple requests to describe how it developed its policies on ads for financial services. Lead generators are increasingly under scrutiny by federal agencies and consumer advocates. Upturn recently released a damning report about lead generators, and the practice was at the center of a workshop held by the Federal Trade Commission last week.

“I find the entire online ecosystem that is designed to track consumers and then to place them in boxes ... too opaque and too under-regulated,” said Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer-program director at the consumer-advocacy group U.S. PIRG, during the FTC workshop on Friday. “So I think the entire online marketing, and advertising, and lead-generation system is a consumer protection problem of both deception, and unfairness, and maybe abuse as well.” Online lead generation is complicated in part because it involves a long chain of different companies, including but not limited to search engines, lead aggregators, and the businesses that end up buying the leads. The practice also entails several layers of privacy and consumer-protection concerns. Not only are lenders taking advantage of people in vulnerable financial situations, not only are lead generators sometimes skirting Google’s ad policies and even violating state laws, but companies are sharing individual data in a way that puts consumers directly at risk. All this comes down to the widespread availability and longevity of personal data online. Imagine again the person who turns to Google with a search term like “need money fast.” Let’s say that person ends up at a lead generator’s landing page, providing various information in hopes of getting a quick loan. “A very small percentage of those folks are actually qualified for a loan,” said Michael Waller, an attorney in the Bureau of Consumer Protection’s enforcement division at the FTC. “And so the vast majority—95 percent of those applications, which means 95 percent of the folks whose social-security numbers and bank-account numbers fall to the cutting room floor—are referred to in the industry as ‘remnants.’” Related Story Why Can't Americans Find Out What Big Data Knows About Them? Those so-called remnants aren’t discarded, though. They are sold and resold and resold again. “What’s created over a period of time is the consumers just become suckers,” Waller said in the FTC workshop. “It’s a sucker list.

This enforcement surge, which concluded Wednesday, is the latest effort by ICE to prioritize the arrest and removal of convicted criminals living illegally in the United States. ERO received significant assistance during this operation from the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO).

All 16 arrested during this operation had been convicted of crimes in the United States and fall within ICE’s enforcement priorities. Their convictions include the following crimes: force/assault with a deadly weapon not firearm — gross bodily injury likely, receiving stolen property, battery, grand theft (auto), drug possession with intent to distribute, and drunk driving. Two were previously deported and two have outstanding deportation orders.

Following are two of those arrested during the operation:

A 50-year-old twice-deported Mexican national with prior felony convictions for force/assault with a deadly weapon not firearm: gross bodily injury likely, battery/police officer, grand theft (auto), and intentionally causing bodily injury to a child-habitual criminal. He has additional convictions for battery and resisting an officer-habitual criminal. He was previously removed to Mexico in 1997 and 2003, and illegally re-entered the United States, which is a felony. He was arrested Jan. 25 in Waukesha and remains in ICE custody pending removal to Mexico.

A 41-year-old Mexican national with prior felony convictions for receiving stolen property and attempted unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle, and possession of a controlled substance. He was arrested Jan. 25 in Milwaukee and remains in ICE custody pending a hearing before a federal immigration judge.

"ICE officers are focused on arresting and removing convicted criminals from our communities," said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago. "When we locate, arrest and remove the most egregious offenders, we immediately improve public safety in the Milwaukee area."

All 16 arrested are Mexican males. Arrests were made in the following Wisconsin communities: Milwaukee (8), Waukesha (4), and one arrest each in Greenfield, New Berlin, Oconomowoc and Pewaukee. All remain in ICE custody, except one individual who was turned over to MCSO on outstanding arrest warrants.

In fiscal year 2016, ICE conducted 240,255 removals nationwide. Ninety-two percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense.

ICE remains focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes threats to national security, public safety and border security.A new 780-bed immigration detention center that is set to open in South Georgia in the coming months will cost taxpayers $116.7 million over the next five years through a no-bid contract with a private corrections company, according to records obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The Trump administration confirmed this week it is seeking more such detention space as it cracks down on illegal immigration. In South Georgia, where the economy has struggled, officials welcomed the jobs the new center will create. But some advocates countered that the private company running the center would be the one reaping the profits.

Signed in December by Charlton County and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the fixed-price contract will cost $1.9 million a month, regardless of whether all of the beds in the center are filled. Florida-based GEO Group, a private firm, is planning to open and operate the new Folkston ICE Processing Center in an existing facility — now unused — next to the D. Ray James federal prison, near the Georgia-Florida border. The contract does not mention any construction costs.

A spokeswoman for ICE said her agency has similar flat fee arrangements with other private detention centers because they provide “a monthly (price) guarantee to the vendor, which generally lowers the cost for ICE.”

Such no-bid contracts are allowed under federal law, according to ICE, which provided the AJC a list of many other similar arrangements. ICE chose the Folkston site, ICE Acting Press Secretary Jennifer Elzea said, partly because it is accredited by the American Correctional Association, it is not far from the Jacksonville International Airport and because other detention centers in the region are already full.

The Obama administration signed the contract even as it was considering phasing out the use of privately run immigration detention centers in Georgia and across the nation. The U.S. Justice Department had already announced it was going that route for its prisoners. But that could change under the Trump administration. In office less than two weeks, the Republican has already signed several executive orders aimed at toughening controls on illegal immigration and more decrees are expected.

“We have got to secure our borders,” Thomas Homan, the newly appointed acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told reporters during a news conference Tuesday. “For those arrested entering the United States, we need to detain those people, so we are in the process of identifying additional detention capacity.”

Taxpayers will pay $73.79 daily per bed in the new detention center in Folkston, not including transportation costs. That is higher than the daily bed costs at any of the existing immigration detention centers in Georgia, including some privately run facilities in Irwin and Stewart counties, according to Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement, or CIVIC, which wants to end immigration detention in the U.S. But it is lower than the national average cost for private detention centers as calculated by CIVIC: $90.43.

The payments from the federal government will pass through Charlton County to GEO. In return for its role, GEO will pay Charlton a monthly $2,500 administrative fee, according to an Oct. 13 resolution unanimously approved by Charlton commissioners. The contract is also projected to create 231 new jobs — primarily detention center officers — and generate property tax revenue for Charlton. Asked how GEO was chosen, Charlton County Administrator Shawn Boatright said, “This is something that was beyond our hands. We were just a third party on this. There is nothing that the county is bidding for.”

A surge of Haitians illegally entering the U.S. last year prompted the need for the new detention center, according to ICE, though the facility may also house unauthorized immigrants from Central America. ICE said the Folkston location was also chosen because GEO has “an exceptional past performance record” under its contract with the federal government to operate the D. Ray James federal prison.

Last month, CIVIC complained to ICE that GEO has been denying attorneys and families access to detainees at the Adelanto Detention Facility in Adelanto, Calif. A spokesman for GEO said ICE controls visitation. An ICE official referred questions about the CIVIC complaint to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which said it “will review the complaint and determine if further action is warranted.”

“Opening another taxpayer-funded immigration detention facility is unnecessary and wasteful,” said Christina Fialho, one of CIVIC’s cofounders. “Holding immigrants in privately run detention centers doesn’t benefit anyone but the companies that manage them — in this case GEO Group.”

GEO spokesman Pablo Paez said his company is “proud of our track record of delivering high-quality, cost-effective service to meet ICE’s needs.”Homeland Security officials are quietly scrambling to find 5,000 more prison and jail beds to handle a record number of undocumented immigrants being detained in the U.S., according to officials familiar with the discussions.
