A new Fox News poll finds that slightly more U.S. voters trust President Trump's administration to tell the truth than the media.



The survey released on Friday found that 45 percent of voters trust the White House to "tell the public the truth" while 42 percent of voters could say the same about the news media.



Ten percent of responders remained undecided.



The poll also revealed that 68 percent of voters believe that the media has been tougher on Trump than his predecessor President Obama. Only 18 percent of responders believe that the media has been giving President Trump an easier time, while 12 percent believe that both are treated the same.



A 55 percent majority also believes that the media should “cover the president aggressively,” while 28 percent think its better to give the commander-in-chief the “benefit of the doubt,” according to the survey.



In 2006, a similar Fox News poll found that news reporters were more trustworthy than government officials, 40 percent to 25 percent.



The Fox News poll surveyed a pool of 1,013 people between Feb 11-13. The margin of error is 3 percent.The Hill’s Rafael Bernal and Molly Hooper discuss how the Latino economy could benefit from new infrastructure and spending bills in the latest installment of The Hill’s video series presented by the Libre Institute.

The survey found 53 percent of voters believe Obama will triumph on Nov. 6, a huge swing from the 43 percent who held that view immediately before the Democratic convention early last month.

During the same period, the proportion of voters who think GOP challenger Mitt Romney will win shrank from 46 percent to 41 percent, The Hill’s poll found.

The doom-laden numbers for Romney reflect the fact that 50 percent of voters say the president and the Democrats have run a better campaign, while only 41 percent give the nod to Romney and Republicans.

The poll, conducted Sept. 27 for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, highlights the pressure Romney will be under to deliver a strong performance at his first debate with Obama on Wednesday in Denver.

Eighty-five percent of voters said they are likely to watch the opening debate, compared to 12 percent who said they were not likely to tune in.

The Republican candidate has endured a difficult four-week stretch on the campaign trail, while Obama’s Gallup approval rating over the same period has risen to its highest level in more than a year.

Democrats were seen as having a stronger convention than Republicans, who saw actor Clint Eastwood upstage Romney.

The GOP nominee then faced criticism for his initial response to the assaults against U.S. diplomatic missions in Egypt and Libya.

That has hampered his ability to make a bigger issue of the Obama administration’s changing account of the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens.

More problematic, Romney spent several crucial days dealing with the fallout over a secretly recorded video that showed him telling campaign donors that his “job is not to worry about” 47 percent of voters because they are dependent on government and cannot be persuaded to “take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”

The Hill Poll’s results come on the heels of a string of national and swing-state polls showing Obama maintaining a slim-to-comfortable lead over his challenger.

Gallup’s national seven-day tracking poll on Sunday showed Obama with a 49-44 percent lead. Obama also holds advantages over Romney in Ohio, Florida and Virginia: three of the most important Electoral College battlegrounds.

Perhaps not surprisingly, The Hill’s latest poll found Democrats are growing more confident and Republicans more pessimistic just five weeks before the election.

Seventy-two percent of Republicans believe Romney will win the election, down from 76 percent in The Hill’s poll on Sept. 2.

By comparison, 87 percent of Democrats now say Obama will win, up from 78 percent early in September.

More disturbing for Romney’s campaign — and more encouraging for Obama’s — is that far more centrist and non-aligned voters now feel the election is tilting in the president’s direction.

Among centrists, 65 percent think Obama will win, compared to 31 percent who say Romney.

A month ago, only 40 percent of centrist voters thought Obama would win; 44 percent picked Romney.

A similar trend is evident among ‘other’ voters — those who identify as neither Republicans nor Democrats. The Hill’s poll found 52 percent of those people think Obama will win, up from 36 percent in early September.

Obama is favored to win across all age groups, as well. Sixty percent of voters aged 18-39 think the president will get a second term compared to 36 percent who said Romney will win. The margin is narrower among voters aged 40-64 (48 percent said Obama, 45 said Romney) and those over 65 (48 percent said Obama, 46 said Romney).

The Republican has faced a barrage of criticism recently over his campaign’s overall direction, much of it from conservative pundits who say the candidate has lacked focus and been too cautious in his attacks on Obama.

That Republican unease is reflected in the poll.

While 84 percent of Democrats think Obama has run the better campaign, 73 percent of Republicans think their candidate has been more effective.

By a 2-to-1 margin (62 percent to 31), voters who identify themselves as “centrists” say Obama and the Democrats have run a better campaign than Romney.

The view that Obama has outperformed Romney is particularly important because many polls have shown the president began the election with built-in challenges.

He received low marks for his handling of the economy and overall job performance throughout much of the year.

The Hill’s poll on Sept. 2 found that 54 percent of voters said Obama, based on job performance, did not deserve to be reelected.

Despite the struggles Romney has had connecting with voters, the latest Hill Poll found voters believe the former Massachusetts governor matches up well against Obama on a major character issue.

When asked which candidate “most shares your values,” 48 percent said Romney and 46 percent said Obama. That’s similar to Hill Poll results from late July, when Romney led 48 percent to 44 on the same question.

The poll did not ask people which candidate they planned to vote for on Nov. 6.

With three presidential debates looming, however, the Hill Poll found a significant number of voters (9 percent) said they remained either somewhat or very likely to change their mind before election day.

Eighty-nine percent said they were not likely to change their minds.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters and is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.

Thirty-six percent of those polled identified as Republicans, 34 percent said they were Democrats and 30 percent had other or no political affiliation.

The bill quashes the Office of Surface Mining's Stream Protection Rule, a regulation to protect waterways from coal mining waste that officials finalized in December.

The legislation is the second Trump has signed into law ending an Obama-era environmental regulation. On Tuesday, he signed a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution undoing a financial disclosure requirement for energy companies.

Both the mining and financial disclosure bills are the tip of a GOP push to undo a slate of regulations instituted in the closing days of the Obama administration. The House has passed several CRA resolutions, and the Senate has so far sent three of them to President Trump for his signature.

Regulators finalized the stream protection rule in December, but they spent most of Obama’s tenure writing it.

The rule is among the most controversial environment regulations the former administration put together. The coal mining industry said it would be costly to implement and lead to job losses across the sector, which is already suffering from a market-driven downturn in demand for its product.

At the signing, Trump called the regulation "another terrible job killing rule" and said ending it would save "many thousands American jobs, especially in the mines, which, I have been promising you — the mines are a big deal."

"This is a major threat to your jobs and we’re going to get rid of this threat," he added. "We’re going to fight for you."

Republicans on Congress, especially from Appalachia, supported that argument and sought to block the rule several times before finally passing the CRA resolution this month.

Environmentalists supported the administration rule, saying it would protect waterways from pollution and preserve public health. They have criticized the GOP for repealing environmental rules in the name of supporting coal mining jobs, but doing little else to help displaced workers in mining areas.

“If you want to help miners, then come address their health and safety and their pension program,” Sen. Maria Cantwell Maria CantwellTrump signs bill undoing Obama coal mining rule Nine Dem senators say hiring freeze hurting trade enforcement Overnight Energy: Congress does away with Obama coal mining rule MORE (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said during floor debate on the measure.

“You can protect the coal industry here with special interests and the amount of lobbying they do, or you can step up in a process and have a regulation that works for the United States of America so the outdoor industry and sportsman and fishermen can continue to thrive.”

The Senate this week sent Trump a CRA resolution blocking a gun sales regulation. Members could soon take up a measure undoing a methane rule for natural gas drilling operations on public land.

This story was updated at 4:10 p.m.There should be unanimous agreement among Americans that no foreign dictator should ever be allowed to influence or determine the selection of our president and commander in chief.

From Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive attacks against American democracy in 2016 designed to elect President Trump to his cyber-invasion of France in 2017 designed to elect far right extremist Marine Le Pen as president of France, which I discussed in my previous column titled “The Battle of Europe,” we must resist and thwart this dangerous assault against democracy.

In his Feb. 5 interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, when O’Reilly referred to Putin as a “killer,” Trump replied by morally equating America with Russia. These sickening comments slandering America were unprecedented for an American president and sent chills up the spines of many Republicans as well as Democrats.

In the latest revelations of what I call the Putingate scandal, we learned that Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, was forced out after only three weeks because of conversations with the Russian ambassador, whose ultimate boss is unanimously believed by our intelligence services to have engaged in covert cyber war designed to elect Trump as president.

Flynn lied about these conversations to our people, the press and Vice President Pence. The vice president was so far outside the inner loop of the Trump White House that he was not told for two weeks by the president or his staff that Justice Department and intelligence service leaders were so alarmed they warned the White House that Trump’s then-chief of the National Security Council could be blackmailed by the Russian dictator.

The Putingate scandal is eerily similar to the Watergate scandal. Both cases involve breaking and entering into internal Democratic Party operations for the purpose of electing a Republican president. Both cases involve criminal acts with political motives followed by false denials. Both cases involve attacks against the free press for publishing information that the public has a right and need to know.

Both Putingate and Watergate involve a White House that is contemptuous of the federal judiciary that is a bulwark against authoritarian leaders who are tempted to believe they are above the law. Both involve presidents who at times treated our intelligence services like political enemies rather than guardians of democracy against adversaries who threaten our freedom.

Both Putingate and Watergate involve presidents with well-earned reputations for repeatedly saying things that were not true, surrounded by staff who often mirrored their habit of repeatedly bearing false witness, pitching denials that were repeatedly proven false.

In a stunning similarity between Watergate and Putingate, both the Nixon and Trump administrations included internal voices who exposed untruths and warned Americans against grave dangers that escalate every day. The extraordinary infighting and leaking from within the Trump administration is eerily reminiscent of Deep Throat during the Nixon years exposing wrongdoing through The Washington Post.

With new reports of countless and continuous communications between high-level Trump aides and Russian officials before and after election day, which according to some reports may include Russian intelligence operatives or officials, is there a John Dean-like figure in Trump circles who might reveal what the president knew, and when he knew it?

Congress should pass a law requiring full disclosure and divestment of any foreign assets or foreign loans held by any president to prevent any hostile foreign actor, including foreign dictators or business interests acting on their behalf, from exerting financial power over America’s president and commander in chief.

In a Fox News report Friday that explored the president’s approach to the military, Gates said Obama had promised him that there wouldn’t be any “significant changes” in the defense budget for a while.

When asked by Fox whether Obama kept to his word, Gates replied, “Well I think that began to fray. ‘Fray’ may be too gentle a word.”

According to the report, Gates was told to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the defense budget after already having slashed it.

“I guess I’d have to say I felt double-crossed,” Gates said. “After all those years in Washington, I was naïve.”

The former defense secretary added that he advised Obama to slow the cuts to the military because it would endanger U.S. troops.

“I think he acknowledged that what I was pitching at a minimum was, ‘The world doesn’t seem to be getting better. Before you head down a path of deep cuts in defense, why don’t you take it kind of slow,’ ” he said. “You know it was one of those things where I lost the argument.”

Fox also spoke with former Gen. Michael Flynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama.

“Frankly, the United States of America is in a less strong position today because of the readiness and the size of our armed forces,” Flynn said.

“I think he sees the military actually as something that is more dangerous to the world,” Flynn added. “I think that he looks at the United States military and sees it as a threatening application around the world, than actually as a useful tool.”A Democratic lawmaker is advising his colleagues on how to not get suckered by fake Twitter accounts, which happened to some top Democrats on Tuesday.

Rep. Eric Swalwell’s (D-Calif.) tip: Look for the telltale blue check mark that denotes a verified account.

"Look for the check mark, make sure they're verified, step one," Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, advised fellow lawmakers.

Earlier Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) cited a fake Twitter account purporting to belong to former national security advisor Michael Flynn as they called for investigations into Flynn.

Flynn resigned late Monday after reports he misled top White House officials about the nature of his conversations with Russia’s U.S. ambassador in December.

Even though the Twitter account Pelosi and Cummings referenced ended up being phony, Swalwell joins the top Democrats in saying an investigation into Flynn is still warranted.

So, I took the time to study his positions on the issues and talked to him on the phone for some time over Christmas break 2016. I liked what I saw and heard.

First, I was impressed by his message, which should have appeal to working class and rural voters. He seems to understand their anxieties and fears regarding jobs losses due to trade and other factors, and articulates these issues well – which we Democrats need to do better in the months and years ahead. He certainly understood that, while he was part of the progressive Democratic Party base (as I am), we have to do better as a party by moving to the center and appealing to a broader electorate than our base. He also agreed with the approach of former DNC Chair Howard Dean – we need to strengthen our state and local parties at the grassroots, with an aim of a 50-state party strategy, not just focusing on Blue states.

Second, when I talked to Ellison on the phone, I understood his broad appeal beyond our base. He speaks with humility about economic justice, respect for values and faith, and tolerance for views different than his. He is a good listener and comes across as humble and open-minded. He presents himself well on TV — a vital strength for DNC chair.

Finally, I need to contradict some calls I received from Jewish Americans who believe Ellison is anti-Israel. This is false. Israel has enough real adversaries without mischaracterizing someone who is a true friend as an opponent. Recently, I read a strong endorsement of Ellison for DNC chair from 300 Jewish American leaders from across the country, including more than 100 rabbis.

Ellison has publicly and strongly opposed the obscenely hypocritical “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions” (BDS) movement, supported among fringe elements of the left and on college campuses. We all see the hypocrisy of these BDS supporters. They ignore Israel’s pro-civil rights, human rights, women’s rights and gay rights laws, and rule of law and democracy, and their silence on anti-human rights policies — especially the mistreatment of women — among surrounding Arab nations is deafening.

Ellison has also publicly repudiated past positions, such as his brief association with the notorious anti-Semite Minister Louis Farrakhan during the days leading up to his Million Man March in 1995, 22 years ago. What he has done most recently is far more important: He voted in favor of the record $38 billion, 10-year military aid package for Israel.

Like myself, Ellison supports a two-state solution, as stated in the National Democratic Convention platform — but only if that solution is “negotiated directly by the parties” and “guarantees Israel’s future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders.” I have highlighted the word “Jewish” because that means the congressman understands the importance of Israel as the historic post-Holocaust homeland for Jews all over the world — a place where the Jewish people resided as a nation and a religion more than 3,000 years ago.

I know and have great respect for other contenders for DNC chair. But I believe, as a former DNC member, that Ellison’s proven ability to win congressional elections with large numbers of rural and working class voters is a critical difference between him and the other candidates. We need a national chair with a 50-state strategy — red states, blue states and purple states. Ellison has shown he has the broader appeal that our party needs now more than ever.

Amidst Trump’s headline grabbing flirtations with chaos, little attention was paid when he zeroed out funding for the National Endowments for the Arts (NEA) and Humanities (NEH). At a time when the American people face new threats from this administration on a daily basis, nothing could be more chilling than to see an explicit and intentional effort to suppress self-expression.

ADVERTISEMENT

Arts and humanities are reflections of the health of our democracy. They transmit our heritage and national identity from one generation to the next, and from our people to nations around the world. Most importantly, they project back the actions of our society through the eyes of people who experience them. In this sense, art gives voice and agency to all of us, along with the power to oppose anything — from a policy to a politician — that we disagree with. It is for this reason that we must protect these fields and ensure they remain accessible to everyone.

Artistic expression also has educational and economic benefits, expanding the minds of students while driving tourism and urban renewal. In 2013, a bipartisan, congressionally initiated study conducted by an ideologically diverse, nonpartisan group of business leaders, former elected officials and scholars argued that exposure to humanities is critical for educating our youth. Ironically, it recommended Congress increase funding.

And increase funding is exactly what Congress should do. Funding the arts is something all great nations do. Providing federal resources in turn encourages local support, extends the reach of vital programs, promotes quality and diversity, and encourages entrepreneurship. But compared to our contemporaries, the United States has not been particularly committed to this goal over time. From 2006 to 2010, a total of 3 percent of funding for performing arts came from state or federal sources. All other funding — 97 percent — came from private donations and generated income. It cuts a stark comparison to many of our European allies — Slovenia, for example, provides 99 percent of their arts funding through the government.

This simple fact tells us two things. First, we are already woefully undercutting the arts sectors in this country while knowing full well how beneficial they could be to our society, and we have been for a long time. Second, and perhaps most important, when Donald Trump tells us he is cutting funds for the NEA and NEH to save money, we know he is lying.

We know he is lying because the total amount we allocate to these fields is less than .016 percent of our annual budget. As The Washington Post pointed out, this is the equivalent of a $10 investment for someone earning $50,000 a year. So as a means of saving our nation trillions of dollars, these cuts are meaningless. But as a means of silencing the masses, they are surgically designed for maximum impact.

If Trump’s cuts become a reality, it will not be the end of art or the study of humanities. It will be the end of access to these fields for anyone without the means to afford them. Considering Trump’s policies will fall hard on the poor and on minority communities, these cuts will effectively muzzle the very people most in need of art’s platform. Given this fact, Trump’s proposal to cut off the NEA and NEH are every bit as corrosive to our national character as his border wall or Muslim ban.

Just like so many of Trump’s other toxic policies, the ulterior motives behind these cuts are easy to see. And just like so many of Trump’s other policies, these cuts are thinly veiled attacks on the vulnerable, intended to cut off a reliable channel for their dissent. With each step that this administration takes toward authoritarianism, their attempts to gag opposition become more alarming. If we allow them to turn the power of art and humanities into a privilege for the rich, we will be accomplices to the effective silencing of every non-affluent person in the country. I, for one, refuse to stand by.

A clear plurality of voters believe the nation’s gun laws are too lax and they expect President Obama and Congress to tighten them, according to a new poll for The Hill.

At the same time, however, voters tend to believe that stricter gun laws will not significantly reduce deaths from gun violence in the United States.

Those opinions reflect the complexity of an issue that has been center-stage politically since the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., last month in which 20 children and eight adults, including the killer, died.

Vice President Biden is leading a White House working group examining how to lower rates of gun violence. Biden is expected to deliver his recommendations to Obama this week.

As a senator, Biden was a driving force behind the 1994 bill that banned many assault weapons, but it appears unlikely that he or Obama will push for such a broad-ranging measure this year. Instead, the administration may focus on expanding obligatory background checks for gun-buyers and perhaps banning high-capacity magazines.

In The Hill Poll, 49 percent of voters asserted that current gun laws are too lax, against 35 percent who said they were about right. The gun laws were judged to be too strict by 11 percent of voters.

A striking consensus was evident around the belief that Obama and Congress would come together to make the current laws pertaining to firearms more rigorous.

Asked to set aside their personal opinions about the desirability of such a change, a full 64 percent of voters asserted that action was very likely or somewhat likely. Only 26 percent said that it was not very likely or not likely at all.

The number of voters who thought that such a move was likely was broadly similar among Republicans and Democrats: 63 percent and 68 percent, respectively.

There were much sharper partisan divides on other questions. Three-quarters of Democratic voters asserted that the current gun laws were too lax, yet that opinion was shared by only 24 percent of Republicans. Conversely, 53 percent of Republicans argued that the current state of the gun laws was “about right”, a position that was endorsed by only 17 percent of Democrats.

Democrats were also far more likely to believe that tightening gun laws was likely to deliver a direct dividend, in terms of reducing the number of deaths from gun violence. Two-thirds of Democrats, 66 percent, asserted that this would be the case, whereas only 15 percent of Republicans agreed.

Gun-rights advocates have long insisted that making regulations stricter is likely to restrict law-abiding citizens’ access to firearms, while those with criminal intent might acquire weapons by illicit means.

Asked directly about the mass shooting in Connecticut, 47 percent of voters said that it had made them more supportive of tighter gun controls while 32 percent said that it had not altered their views.

Almost one-in-five voters — 19 percent — said that the events in Connecticut had made them less supportive of stricter gun laws. In the wake of the tragedy, representatives of the National Rifle Association (NRA) suggested that giving teachers permission to carry firearms might help prevent future atrocities.

Last week, the NRA was among several groups that met with Biden at the White House. Afterward, the group released a statement accusing the Obama administration of having “an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.”

Gun-rights groups had been put on edge earlier last week by Biden’s assertion that “executive orders, executive action, can be taken” on the gun issue.

The Hill Poll found more voters opposed to such an action than supportive of it, by 49 percent to 42 percent.

Here, again, the partisan split was deep. Seventy-one percent of Democrats would support executive action to make the laws tighter, but 82 percent of Republicans would oppose it.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters on January 10 by Pulse Opinion Research. The margin of error is three percentage points.

A growing number of Democrats are openly questioning President Trump’s mental health.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer Earl BlumenauerDemocrats raise questions about Trump’s mental health Dem launches panel to review presidential removal procedures 40 House Dems to urge Trump to suspend Flynn MORE (D-Ore.) in a floor speech this week called for a review of the Constitution's procedures for removing a president. He warned the 25th Amendment of the Constitution falls short when it comes to mental or emotional fitness for office.

Sen. Al Franken Al FrankenAT&T, Time Warner defend deal The Hill's 12:30 Report FCC chair responds to Franken's net neutrality concerns MORE (D-Minn.) during a weekend interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” said that “a few” Republican colleagues have expressed concern to him about Trump's mental health.

And Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) plans to introduce legislation that would require the presence of a psychiatrist or psychologist in the White House.

The Democrats justify their questions by pointing to Trump’s habit of making demonstrably false claims. At a press conference Thursday, he said he’d had the biggest Electoral College win since President Ronald Reagan, for example, when his margin was lower than either of President Obama’s wins.

Blumenauer told The Hill he started taking another look at the 25th Amendment because Trump had casually repeated easily disproven claims, such as stating that it wasn’t raining during his speech on Inauguration Day when it was.

“It’s not normal behavior. I don’t know anybody in a position of responsibility that doesn’t know if they’re being rained on. And nobody I work with serially offers up verifiably false statements on an ongoing basis,” he said in an interview steps from the House chamber.

But suggesting the president has a mental health problem invites criticism that Democrats are going too far.

“It’s divisive. The bottom line is, if Trump doesn’t succeed, we all fail. It’s time to give the guy a chance,” said Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.).

Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) both burst out laughing when told some Democratic colleagues were questioning Trump’s mental health.

“Are you serious?” Hunter asked. “Yeah, I don’t care what they say.”

“I think that’s a stretch,” Simpson said.

The White House didn’t return a request for comment.

But mental health professionals say the politicization comes at a cost. Political actors suggesting an opponent has psychological problems risks stigmatizing people with actual mental illnesses, they say.

“I think the politicization is troubling,” said Joshua Miller, a psychologist at the University of Georgia whose research focuses on pathological personality traits and personality disorders. “We certainly wouldn’t want individuals to use mental illness as a weapon to harm others.”

The American Psychiatric Association has long held it’s unethical for psychiatrists to give professional opinions about public figures they haven’t personally examined.

Yet in a sign of the polarized times, thousands of mental health professionals have signed a Change.org petition declaring Trump “is mentally ill and must be removed.”

Thirty-five psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers also signed a letter to The New York Times saying that “the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.”

Lieu argued it's justifiable to scrutinize the mental health of anyone in control of the nation's nuclear codes.

“I think it is a legitimate issue to raise. I am not a mental health professional, so I don’t know in terms of any sort of medical expertise on this. But I do see and hear the same things that other people see and hear, and a lot of people have concluded that what’s going on is not normal. So what do I do with that as a member of Congress?” he told The Hill.

“Anyone who can launch 4,000 nuclear weapons in minutes absolutely should be questioned on any matter related to their physical and mental health.”

Blumenauer is starting a working group, which he says at least a half-dozen colleagues have expressed interest in joining, to review the presidential removal procedures.

He also plans to introduce legislation that would empower former presidents and vice presidents to determine, in coordination with the sitting vice president, if the president is unfit for office.

The 25th Amendment currently says a majority of Cabinet members must make that decision with the vice president, which Blumenauer says isn’t enough if a mentally unsound president simply fires them all.

Asked if it’s appropriate for members of Congress to question the president’s mental health, Blumenauer replied: “All I’ve said is that this is strange behavior. It’s not normal in the circles I run in. And it raises questions. People can make their own diagnosis. I’m not.”

Simpson, the Republican congressman who initially laughed off the Democrats’ remarks, said it’s fair to question Trump’s judgment.

“Now, to question his judgment, that’s a different story,” Simpson said. “The behavior is somewhat disturbing."

He also said Trump’s false statements could end up hurting him at some point.

“The concern I have — how do I say this and still be respectful? Every presidency, no matter who it is, there’s going to come a point in the presidency where you’re going to have to go to the American people and get their support for something,” he said.

“If this continues much longer, he’s going to lose the ability to rally those people.”Lawmakers in the House debated Tuesday whether cameras should be allowed in federal courtrooms, just days after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals live streamed audio of its hearing on President Trump’s executive order temporarily barring immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) called the idea of allowing cameras dangerous.

“There’s enough grandstanding in Congress before the cameras in hearings and on the floor. Can you imagine what would take place in a courtroom?” he asked during the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.

Mickey Osterreicher, general counsel of the National Press Photographers Association, who testified before the committee, said he saw what took place in the courtroom during the O.J. Simpson trial.

“And that was a circus in and of itself,” Marino said, interrupting.

“Even the judge, in my opinion, spent too much time looking at the cameras, as did the defense and prosecution. This is a dangerous, dangerous area to get into. … The last thing we need is speculation that nothing will happen. What if something happens?”

Osterreicher argued that people have a right to monitor the official functions of their government and that transparent court proceedings improve the quality of testimony, persuade unknown witnesses to come forward, make trial participants more conscientious and provide an opportunity to better observe the workings of our judicial system.

“I think we all agree that courtrooms are open to the public, and blaming the camera for the circus-like atmosphere that sometimes goes on in and outside the courtroom I think is shooting the messenger,” he said.

Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) asked about claims that having cameras in the courtrooms heighten the level of potential threats against judges.

Osterreicher said images of judges can already be found on the internet just by searching their name.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte Bob GoodlatteHouse Dem: 'Are we witnessing the first Manchurian presidency?' Several Hispanic Dems denied entry to meeting with ICE Gingrich calls for investigations into intel leaks MORE (R-Va.) asked how sensitive information could be protected if cameras were allowed.

“The camera doesn’t add or detract from that problem,” he said.

Rep. Ted Poe Ted PoeLawmakers debate allowing cameras in courtrooms Hey Congress: Where’s the ban on ISIS? House passes bill requiring warrants for email searches MORE (R-Texas) said he was one of the first trial judges in his state to allow cameras in the courtroom.

“We had a system that was very discrete. The jury never saw the cameras," he said. "The cameras did not film the jury, child witnesses, sexual assault witnesses or any other witness that the lawyers did not agree should be filmed.”

Poe called it shameful that the public is left with a 90-second soundbite on the news of what the reporter thinks took place that day in a trial court, the Supreme Court, an appellate court or federal district court because they are not permitted to see it for themselves.

“We have the greatest judicial system in the world for determining guilt or innocence,” he said.

“No, it’s not perfect, but it is the absolute best that anybody has ever come up with, and why would we not want the world to see it?”

"He has had a tremendous career," Trump said of Acosta in a press conference at the White House, listing off highlights of his nominee's resume. Acosta was not present at the press conference.

"I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of Labor," the president added, noting that Acosta has gotten through the Senate confirmation process before.

Acosta is a former member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and is currently the dean of Florida International University’s law school.

A Republican, Acosta served on the NLRB from December 2002 to August 2003 and authored more than 125 opinions, according to his bio on FIU’s website.

ADVERTISEMENT A Harvard law graduate, he was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2003 to be the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.

Acosta was the first Hispanic U.S. assistant attorney general and longest-serving U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.

If confirmed, he would be Trump’s first Hispanic Cabinet member.

Trump was scheduled to meet with members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Thursday afternoon as a courtesy to discuss possible candidates for the Labor secretary position, a source familiar with discussions said. Picking Acosta ahead of that meeting, the source said, is a surprise and another example that the White House and the RNC are not on the same page.

One day before a scheduled Senate hearing, Andrew Puzder released a statement Wednesday afternoon withdrawing his nomination after it became apparent that he did not have the votes to get confirmed.

Senate leaders had warned the White House that anywhere from four to 12 Republicans planned to oppose Puzder, sinking his chances, according to a CNN report.

Puzder had been under attack by Democrats and labor unions for his record of labor violations as the CEO of the fast food conglomerate CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns the burger chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.

And he was sure to face tough questions during his hearing on why he hired an illegal immigrant to clean his home and why his ex-wife Lisa Fierstein had accused him of physically abusing her — accusations she has since retracted.

“If President Trump is remotely serious about standing up for workers, he will nominate someone for Labor Secretary that champions workers’ rights rather than suppresses them.”

Business groups were quick to praise Trump for selecting a new nominee so quickly. “We look forward to learning more about Alexander Acosta and his position on the issues important to the restaurant industry,” Cicely Simpson, executive vice President of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement. The National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons called Acosta a “proven leader, who understands the complexities of the modern workplace.” “We are hopeful that he will listen to manufacturers’ concerns as we work to strengthen employer–employee relationships and provide workers with the right skills to succeed,” Timmons said in a statement. “In recent years, regulations coming out of the Department of Labor have too often been overreaching and counterproductive, harming manufacturers’ abilities to create jobs and do what’s best for the millions of hardworking men and women employed in manufacturing careers.” But Allied Progress accused Trump of failing to vet another nominee. The liberal group pointed to a 2008 report on an investigation into the allegations of politicized hiring and other improper personnel actions in the civil rights division in which the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General said Acosta did not take sufficient action in response to information he was provided about potential problems with the conduct and judgment of his Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bradley Schlozman. Acosta had received reports that Schlozman had hired unqualified applicants and forwarded a racially insensitive email to other department officials, according to the report. “Although these incidents did not directly relate to the consideration of political or ideological affiliations in hiring, these matters should have put Acosta on notice of potential problems with Schlozman’s conduct and judgment,” the report said. The report went on to find that Schlozman, first as a deputy assistant attorney general and then as principal deputy assistant attorney general and acting assistant attorney general, considered political and ideological affiliations in hiring career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division. "In doing so, he violated federal law – the Civil Service Reform Act – and Department policy that prohibit discrimination in federal employment based on political and ideological affiliations, and committed misconduct," the OIG said in its report. In a statement, Allied Progress Executive Director Karl Frisch called Acosta “wholly unqualified for the job.” “We understand that the President is still reeling from his last failed Labor nomination, but that doesn’t mean he should nominate someone who is wholly unqualified for the job,” he said. “Americans deserve a Secretary of Labor who will fight for workplace safety, fair wages, and the rights of working families. It’s clear Mr. Acosta is not that person.”

Puzder’s withdrawal followed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's resignations Monday night. Flynn had reportedly misled senior White House officials about his conversations with Russia.

- Updated at 2:39 p.m.The top senators on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel are urging the Department of Justice to scrutinize the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger for the possibility that it leads to anticompetitive practices.

"The proposed transaction raises complex questions that will require a fact-intensive investigation that has yet to be completed, as well as a deep understanding of the economics of the digital content creation and distribution markets," reads the letter.

The senators point to the fact that Time Warner owns popular networks like CNN, HBO, TBS and TNT, and would be in a position to charge more for content from those channels and suppress content from their competitors.

"As a result, AT&T would be both a distributor of and competitor to many content providers (HBO, for example, competes with premium channels such as STARZ and Showtime; CNN competes with MSNBC; and small independent content providers compete with Time Warner’s content)," the letter adds. "AT&T could conclude that it’s beneficial to limit competing content providers’ access to AT&T’s distribution services."

In another letter first reported by The Hill on Friday, AT&T and Time Warner sought to reassure a group of Democratic senators about the merits of the proposed $85 billion deal.

“The merger will allow us to offer customers more attractive bundles of broadband and video services, prodding cable companies and other competitors to respond by improving their own services,” it reads. “And the merger will further incentivize AT&T and other wireless carriers to deploy lightning-fast 5G wireless technology faster and deeper in their networks.”

President Trump took a hard line against the proposal when it was first revealed during the presidential race, but since then he has indicated a willingness to reconsider his stance.Republican lawmakers critical of President Trump may present the best opening for Democrats to work across the aisle, a Democratic lawmaker says.

"There are openings there to talk with Republicans who are not totally on board with Donald Trump," freshman Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said in an interview with The Hill's Molly K. Hooper.

"I think moderate Republicans [are] open to discussion on social issues."

Espaillat is one of several Democrats to introduce measures aimed at blocking construction of Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

His bill would "prohibit the construction of new border barriers, including walls or fences, on certain Federal land."

Though his measure only has Democratic co-sponsors, the former undocumented immigrant said he is reaching out to border-state Republicans for support.

Several moderate GOP lawmakers, including Reps. Charlie Dent (Pa.) and Tom Reed (N.Y.), said they were meeting with Democrats as recently as Wednesday to find common ground on matters such as tax reform and infrastructure.

"There’s a lot of dialogue going on in the Tuesday Group and New Dems and Blue Dogs ... particularly in context of again, tax reform, infrastructure," Dent, co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group Caucus, told The Hill.

Watch the video above to hear the lawmakers in their own words.The Senate voted Friday to confirm Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ushering in what are likely to be dramatic changes to the agency.

Pruitt’s confirmation came despite repeated pleas from Democrats to delay the vote due to ongoing litigation regarding emails that a liberal group had requested from the office of Pruitt, who is Oklahoma’s attorney general — a position he will leave when he is sworn in as EPA administrator.

Republicans said Pruitt will bring much-needed change to an agency that exemplifies eight years of executive overreach by the administration of former President Obama.

ADVERTISEMENT “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the real-world consequences of EPA actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the long-term.”

Democrats said Pruitt’s record of animosity toward Obama’s EPA — including filing more than a dozen lawsuits to block regulations — shows that he opposes the EPA’s most important functions, and that he is too friendly to the fossil fuel industry.

Pruitt will be responsible for implementing an aggressive deregulatory campaign that Trump outlined on the campaign trail and that the GOP has long sought.

Trump promised to roll back Obama’s entire climate change agenda, including the Clean Power Plan, which sets carbon dioxide limits for power plants. He also pledged to repeal the EPA’s Clean Water Rule, which asserts federal power over small waterways like ponds and streams.

Trump said any new regulations will be judged on whether they benefit workers, and he would refocus the EPA’s mission on clean air and water.

At his confirmation hearing, Pruitt promised to take seriously the EPA’s mission, but also to improve cooperation with states and regulated parties.

“Regulators are supposed to make things regular, to fairly and equitably enforce the rules and not pick winners and losers,” Pruitt told senators.

“A regulator should not be for or against any sector of our economy. Instead, a regulator ought to follow law in setting up the rules so that those who are regulated can plan, allocate resources to meet the standards, versus operating in a state of uncertainty and duress.”

The senators also voted to shoot down a last-minute plea by Democrats to delay the vote until Pruitt’s emails could be released and reviewed.

A state judge ruled late Thursday that Pruitt’s office has to release what could be thousands of emails between him or his staff and various fossil fuel and conservative interests, records that the Center for Media and Democracy requested more than two years ago.

Democrats unsuccessfully sought to delay the Pruitt vote until at least after Tuesday, when the emails are due to be released, so that senators could see them.

The delay would have pushed Pruitt’s vote to Feb. 27 at the earliest, due to a coming Senate recess.

McConnell slammed the pleas as politically-motivated delay tactics, like when the Democrats boycotted Pruitt’s committee vote.

“Over the past several weeks we’ve seen a historic level of obstruction from our democratic colleagues on the president’s cabinet,” he said. “Truly historic, unprecedented, and harmful obstruction. Pointless obstruction … a collection of futile gestures.”

Pruitt is set to be sworn in at 5 p.m.

The president also signed legislation Thursday to end a coal mining rule aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste.

As The Hill's Devin Henry reports, this was the second piece of legislation Trump has signed into law to undo an Obama-era environmental rule. Earlier this week he signed a resolution to do away with a financial disclosure requirement for energy companies.

GOP lawmakers have been using the Congressional Review Act as a new found tool to assail rules finalized in the waning days of the Obama administration.

The rule is reportedly among the former administration's most controversial with industry complaining it was too costly to implement.

QUOTE OF THE DAY

"I don't mind bad stories, I can handle a bad story better than anybody, as long as it's true," Trump said while blasting the media during his press conference Thursday. Read more on Trump's presser here.A popular Russian tabloid hit President Trump Friday for "contradictory" statements on NATO, signaling somewhat of a change in tone on the president who has mostly received positive coverage in Russia, the BBC reported.

"(During the election campaign) Trump had called the Alliance obsolete and useless. Less than two months have passed since he moved into the Oval Office and he's already expressed full support for NATO," the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda wrote.

"As the saying goes, you need to be drunk to understand the true position of America's president."

The article comes a day after reports that Moscow is instructing Russian state media to reduce their favorable coverage of President Trump.

Three people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg the order is a sign of growing concerns from top Russian officials that the Trump administration is not going to be as pro-Russian as they initially thought.

According to those reports, the Kremlin became concerned when mentions of Trump in January eclipsed mentions of Vladimir Putin for the first time since he was reelected president in 2012.

Russia originally welcomed Trump's election and calls for improving relations between the two countries, but recent international developments have cast doubt on the relationship.

Numerous White House officials, including Trump, have recently knocked Russia for its annexation of Crimea and the subsequent violence in Ukraine.A strong majority of voters oppose the deportation of people living in the United States illegally, but an equally large share of the electorate thinks that the nation’s borders are not as secure as they should be, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill.



The findings underline the complexity of an issue that has taken center-stage since President Obama and a bipartisan group of senators put forward separate proposals for comprehensive immigration reform last week.

ADVERTISEMENT

A decisive 64 percent of respondents in The Hill Poll said illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country, with 47 percent supporting the additional step of creating a pathway to citizenship for the same people.

By contrast, only 27 percent of voters called for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to be deported.

But exactly the same share of voters — 64 percent — asserted that the borders of the United States are either “not very secure” or “not secure at all.”

The latter finding could be a sign that the Senate’s plan might be the more popular, because it would make the citizenship benefits “contingent upon securing the border.”

Obama, by contrast, is supportive of tougher border measures but doesn’t want to make the citizenship benefits dependent upon the security steps being taken first.

Party affiliation is a big factor underlying voters’ views on immigration, the survey found, with 62 percent of Democrats supporting a pathway to citizenship versus 32 percent of Republicans; and 39 percent of Republicans backing mandatory deportations, versus 16 percent of Democrats.

Overall, respondents graded Democrats and Republicans almost equally when it comes to “immigration and border security,” with 41 percent favoring Obama’s position and 39 percent preferring the GOP’s.

Another question amid the immigration debate is whether same-sex couples should receive the same consideration as heterosexual couples under an overhaul of the system.

Behind Obama, Democrats are pushing for such equal treatment, which in practical terms would mean that non-citizen partners of Americans in same-sex unions would be entitled to a green card, just as is the case with heterosexual marriages.

But Republicans aren’t on board with that proposal, and the Senate’s reform blueprint excludes that language as a result.

The Hill’s poll indicates that voters are split almost evenly on the issue, with 46 percent of respondents supportive of Obama’s position and 45 percent opposed to it.

On that issue, both party and gender appear to play a significant role, with 59 percent of Democrats — and 52 percent of women — supporting the extension of benefits to same-sex couples, while 64 percent of Republicans — and 54 percent of men — oppose the same provision.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Jan. 31 by Pulse Opinion Research, an independent polling firm that borrows the automated procedures of Rasmussen Reports.

The push for immigration reform has risen near the top of the congressional to-do list this year, largely as a result of November’s elections, which found Obama winning the support of Hispanic voters by a thumping margin of 71 percent to 27 percent over GOP contender Mitt Romney. Since then, GOP leaders have been seeking ways to attract more Hispanic voters to their side. A bipartisan reform bill, they hope, will do just that.

A GOP lawmaker escorted by police from a town hall meeting in his Northern California district over the weekend says he will continue to hold open town hall meetings at home.

"I'm not going to stop meeting with my constituents because a disruptive element has emerged in the body politic," Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said in an interview with The Hill's Molly K. Hooper.

McClintock was one of several Republican lawmakers to face taunts at recent constituent events held in their respective districts.

Democrats seized on the headlines of such incidents, comparing them to the Tea Party movement starting in 2009, a comparison McClintock and fellow Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) dispute.

"This seems like political operatives have been hired, websites set up, on-the-ground dispatches and so forth — it seems highly coordinated compared to the organic nature of a Tea Party," Roskam, who also faced rowdy crowds, said.

Veteran Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) explained that the Tea Party heated up during the summer of 2009 as then-President Barack Obama pressed for overhaul of the healthcare system and environmental regulations.

"This began literally the day after the election and [the Tea Party supporters] were coming out to actually oppose policies ... It wasn't nearly as organized as this is," Cole said, noting that "people are allowed to exercise their constitutional right but, I don't think it helps you when it degenerates into violence or shouting."

For his part, McClintock says he's going to be doing "a lot more security planning ... and get much bigger venues" as precautions for his future town hall meetings.

Instead, she took time to give what she called a “free commercial” for the president’s daughter’s clothing line.

If you think that doesn’t sound like something she’d be allowed to do in her official capacity as a senior advisor to the president, you are right. So we filed a complaint with the Office of Government Ethics and the White House counsel to address her apparent violation of federal law, ethics regulations, and traditional standards of conduct.

Conway’s pitch for Ivanka Trump’s business, which included telling Americans to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff…it’s a wonderful line…go buy it today, everybody, you can find it online,” comes on the heels of the president attacking Nordstrom on Twitter for its decision to no longer sell his daughter’s clothing line.

This was an unprecedented action by an American president—not just to attack an American company, but to do so for not engaging in business with his family. And it leads to a larger question about the priorities of this administration.

The administration is less than three weeks old, but we are already deep into the selling of the presidency. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club doubled its membership fee to $200,000 five days after his inauguration. On Friday, he will host Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there—at the club where he spends most weekends and which he has dubbed the “Winter White House”—instead of at a more traditional location like Camp David. All the news coverage of the meeting will serve as free advertising for his private club.

After a great outcry, the administration was forced to remove First Lady Melania Trump’s QVC line from her official White House biography. In a legal filing, her lawyers noted her great earning potential as First Lady. For any other administration, it would be unimaginable that the First Family would try to monetize its position.

But that is the essential conflict of the Trump administration, and it all comes back to the president’s unwillingness to part with his businesses. If he had sold his businesses as so many experts urged, he would have avoided many problems and set an entirely different tone.

As a result, we are forced to question even issues that should never need to be debated in the first place, like where the Department of Defense and Secret Service set up shop. With both agencies considering renting space in Trump Tower, it is hard to avoid raising questions.

Sadly, the threat of conflicts now permeates many key areas of national policy. If this White House appears to be so concerned with lining the pockets of the Trump family, what will happen when the president’s vast foreign business interests run up against American foreign policy?

That is already a significant concern as many countries accused of supporting or harboring terrorists were left off of president’s travel ban list, seemingly because he had business interests in those countries. Could he wield threat of an expanded travel ban to ensure his hotels and condos get preferential treatment overseas? If he needs to make the hardest decision a president can make, to put American troops in harm’s way, will he be thinking of their families or his own?

Every prior U.S. president came from a background of public service. President Trump did not, and we understand that this is new ground for him. It means it may be hard for him to get himself into a position where he places America’s interests before his own—something we’ve seen as he became the first president in decades not to release his tax returns or place his assets in a blind trust or widely held funds. But no one forced him to run for the presidency. He must recognize that public service takes sacrifice.

President Trump announced that his slogan is “America First.” It’s time he started applying that principle to his White House.

"We do not or are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward where Russia, living up to its commitments, will return to a partnership of sorts here with NATO," Mattis said at a press conference.

And when asked about Russian meddling in the U.S. election, Mattis responded: "There is very little doubt that they have either interfered or attempted to interfere in a number of elections in democracies."

That came before President Trump tweeted that Democrats "made up" the story that Russia interfered in the U.S. election.

BOEING CEO WAS ON CALL BETWEEN TRUMP, GENERAL: The Air Force general managing the Pentagon's program for F-35 fighter jets, built by Lockheed Martin, confirmed Thursday that the CEO of rival Boeing participated in a call with him and President Trump prior to the inauguration.

Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan said no decisions were made on the Jan. 17 call and said it was his understanding that Trump was trying to get more information about both the F-35 and Boeing programs, including the new Air Force One fleet and the F-18 Super Hornet.

"It's important to understand that the discussions that we had were all pre-decisional," Bogdan told a House Armed Services subcommittee. "There were no decisions made during those conversations, and it was my belief that President-elect Trump at the time was attempting to gain more information about the F-35 and its affordability, trying to gain more information about F-35s capabilities relative to the Super Hornet and to gain more information about the presidential aircraft replacement program."

The call was first reported Thursday morning by Bloomberg. In the Bloomberg report, Lockheed declined to comment and Boeing referred to its CEO's comments after his January meeting with Trump, in which he said they "made some great progress" in their talks.

Follow us on Twitter: @thehill, @Rebecca_H_KSenate Democrats want to delay a Friday vote on Scott Pruitt's nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a judge ordered the Oklahoma attorney general's records to be released next week.

He added that delaying the nomination until Feb. 27 "wouldn't delay the businesses of the Senate at all" because lawmakers are out of town next week.

The Senate is expected to take a final vote Friday afternoon on Pruitt after the Senate voted 54-46 a day earlier to advance his nomination.

ADVERTISEMENT The final vote comes days before Pruitt's office is expected to have to turn over documents requested roughly two years go.

Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons, based in Oklahoma City, ordered the release of up to 3,000 documents by Tuesday in response to a request by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) under Oklahoma’s Open Records Act, E&E News reported.

Democrats argue the emails could shed new light on Pruitt's ties to the oil and gas industry that he will be tasked with helping regulate as EPA administrator.

Democrats pulled an all-night protest from the Senate floor to voice their opposition to Pruitt ahead of the final vote.

"The majority leader is asking his people to vote aye on a very, very difficult case," he said.

But McConnell quickly shut down any speculation that he would delay the vote, arguing that Democrats were trying to buy more time in an effort to sink Pruitt's nomination.

"The effort has been to delay the nominations that they have made controversial as long as possible," he said. "They want to have Pruitt out there over the recess so all their supporters can express themselves."The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 fax

The discrepancy would appear to be rooted in the GOP’s image problem, as the party attempts to recover from a bruising general election and recalibrate for a new generation of voters.

ADVERTISEMENT

Respondents in The Hill Poll were asked to choose which of two approaches they would prefer on the budget, but the question’s phrasing included no cues as to which party advocated for which option.

Presented in that way, 55 percent of likely voters opted for a plan that would slash $5 trillion in government spending, provide for no additional tax revenue and balance the budget within 10 years — in essence, the path recommended by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) last week.

This was almost twice as many voters as opted for a proposal that would include $1 trillion in added tax revenue as well as $100 billion in infrastructure spending, and which would reduce the deficit without eradicating it.

Only 28 percent of voters preferred this option, which reflects the proposal put forth by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray Patty MurraySenate Dems move to nix Trump's deportation order Oprah's network provides Senate with tape of abuse allegations by Puzder's ex-wife: report How many GOP senators will stand up to megadonor DeVos? Just 2. MORE (D-Wash.) last week.

An even stronger majority of respondents, 65 percent, said U.S. budget deficits should be reduced mostly by cutting spending rather than by raising taxes. Just 24 percent said the budget should be balanced mostly by increasing revenue.

In general, Democrats favor a much greater emphasis on tax revenue than do Republicans, most of whom are adamantly opposed to any increased taxes at all.

Notably, many respondents who identified themselves as Democrats actually supported key Republican proposals, according to The Hill poll. Just 44 percent of Democrats said budget deficits should be reduced mostly by raising taxes, while slightly fewer, 40 percent, said balance should be achieved mostly by reining in spending.

By contrast, a strong majority of Republicans toed the party line. Eighty-eight percent, said deficits should be reduced by cutting spending, while just 7 percent said the budget should be balanced by increasing revenue.

However, as soon as respondents heard the words “Republican” and “Democrat,” the picture changed drastically. A plurality of voters, 35 percent, said they trust the Democrats more on budgetary issues, while 30 percent said they trust the Republicans more. A full 34 percent said they trust neither party.

These findings buttress the impression that the Republican label itself incites mistrust among many voters.

Since the 2012 election, which saw GOP losses in Congress as well as President Obama’s reelection, the party has become increasingly divided over how to restore its tarnished reputation.

Speeches by two rising stars to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week reflected the party’s identity crisis. Florida Sen.

One issue around which most of the party’s constituency can coalesce is the objection to President Obama’s healthcare overhaul. The GOP budget put forth by Ryan assumes that most of the healthcare reform law should be repealed.

Notably, a plurality of respondents in The Hill poll agreed with Ryan’s assumption: Forty-five percent of voters said ObamaCare should be fully repealed, while just 37 percent said the law should be fully implemented.

The findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 14 by Pulse Opinion Research.

Yet back in Washington, D.C., the Democrats’ top elected official, Senate Minority Leader(N.Y.), resorted to the same loser playbook that has put his party into such a predicament.

“Pres Trump ought to see the writing on the wall, abandon proposal, roll up his sleeves & come up w/ a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe,” he tweeted, working hard to demobilize and demotivate the resistance movement. No one wants to see Trump roll up his sleeves and do anything. The less he does, the better our chances of surviving his tenure — both figuratively and literally. And really, who does Schumer think he’s impressing with “bipartisan” talk?

Former President Obama spent most of his tenure preaching bipartisanship, yet it was the GOP’s relentless opposition that paid political benefits, netting the party the bulk of state houses and legislatures nationwide, as well as control of Congress. Obama Democrats argued the president was the “adult in the room,” but it was the children who reaped the benefits. Democrats argued that “when they go low, we go high.” And the inmates took over the asylum.

Beltway editorial boards and columnists might be impressed by “reaching across the aisle,” but there isn’t a single voter suddenly motivated to abandon Trump because of Schumer’s appeal to bipartisanship. There isn’t a single nonvoter who now finally has a reason to head to the ballot box, thanks to Schumer’s “bipartisan plan.”

And why would a Democratic senator indulge in Trump’s fantasy of a lawless nation under assault? Contrary to Trump’s “alternative facts,” our nation’s murder rate is the lowest it has been since 1963, and there hasn’t been an epidemic of terrorist attacks covered up by the media — not in Bowling Green nor anywhere else. Not a single refugee has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the United States since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, and beforehand, only three fatal terrorist attacks were carried out by refugees—and all three were right-wing Cubans. Trump’s ban would not have prevented the attacks on 9/11, or in San Bernardino, at the Orlando Pulse nightclub or at the Boston Marathon. So why pretend we need to change our already tough immigration system to deter threats that have never materialized?

The reality is Trump is wrong about the problem and wrong about the solution. Pretty much, he’s wrong about everything, and in the most hateful, vengeful and harmful ways possible. It isn’t just Democratic voters who see this. The latest Gallup poll gives Trump a 40 percent approval rating among all Americans, down from only 46 percent after the inauguration. Republicans were smart enough to wage all-out war against Obama when he was popular, why would Democrats want to play nice with Trump when he’s already radioactive?

The Democratic base—the people itching to sweep the GOP out of power in 2018 and 2020—aren’t interested in bipartisanship. They are interested in fighting, in resistance, and in steadfast opposition.

Schumer can join the resistance and ride the wave, or he can get the hell out of the way for someone who will.

Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.A clear majority – 61 percent – of likely voters consider the presidential election to be more of a choice between President Obama and Mitt Romney than a referendum on the president’s first term in office, according to a new poll for The Hill.

Just over one-third — 34 percent — of voters said they considered the election to be a judgment on Obama’s job performance in the White House.

The results offer a measure of good news for Democrats, who have sought to frame the Nov. 6 election primarily as a choice between two candidates with different visions for the country.

ADVERTISEMENT

“It is critical for the president that this is a choice, not a referendum,” said Wayne Lesperance, a political scientist at New England College in Henniker, N.H.

“If your reelection is based on answering the question, ‘are you better off than four years ago,’ you can’t say ‘yes’ with a straight face. A lot of people are still hurting.”

The survey also includes some sobering findings for the Obama campaign.

A majority of voters say their opinion of Obama has gotten worse since he took office, the poll found.

Forty-one percent said they have a “much worse” view of Obama now than in 2008; 11 percent said their opinion is “slightly worse,” while 38 percent overall said their view of him had improved.

By contrast, a near-majority of voters — 47 percent — say their view of Romney has improved as they have learned more about him, compared to 39 percent who said their opinion of the GOP candidate has become worse.

The poll findings may offer some comfort to Republicans because, even if the fall contest is a “choice election,” Romney has polled stronger than Obama on who is best to handle the economic recovery.

Romney, who faced skepticism from the Republican right during the GOP primaries, has also grown on conservative voters as time has passed, the poll found.

Seventy-three percent of self-identified conservatives said their view of Romney has improved the more they have heard and learned about him.

The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research on Sept. 6, the final day of the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C.

It is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.

Democrats devoted much of their time and effort in Charlotte to drawing contrasts between Romney and Obama — painting the Republican as inexperienced on foreign policy and out of touch with the concerns of average voters.

Obama, in his convention speech last Thursday, stressed several times to voters “you have a choice” in the direction the country takes for the next four years.

Republicans, meantime, have sought to define the election as a verdict on Obama, whose approval ratings overall wallowed below 50 percent until he got a post-Democratic convention bump. The president’s approval rating has been below 40 percent on his handling of the economy. Romney has repeatedly said, “this president cannot tell us that you’re better off today than when he took office.”

The Hill Poll found 67 percent of centrist voters — who are key to victory for both candidates — consider the vote a choice rather than a referendum. Among those who said they were neither Republican nor Democrat, 65 percent considered the election a choice.

Democrats would likely greet the poll results as “fantastic,” Lesperance said.

While the Democratic convention showed Obama would be comfortable with the election being a referendum on some issues, his campaign is less interested in having voters passing judgment on him based on the economy’s overall performance.

“To some extent the president is fine with the election being a referendum on getting (Osama) bin Laden and some of the other successes — but not on the economy,” Lesperance said.

According to the poll, voters paid close attention to both the Democratic and Republican conventions. Thirty-seven percent of voters said they are more likely to vote for Obama after seeing the political conventions, while 37 percent said they are more likely to vote for Romney. Another 25 percent said the conventions made no difference.

The majority of the poll was conducted on Thursday before Obama’s primetime speech, but 7 percent of the voters were polled during the president’s remarks.

Among women, 39 percent said they were more likely to vote for Obama because of the conventions while 35 percent said they were more likely to vote for Romney.

Both Republicans and Democrats made explicit appeals to female voters at their conventions.

The poll offers a mixed view of how centrist voters, and those who are neither Republican nor Democrat, responded to the events in Tampa, Fla., and Charlotte.

Forty-four percent of centrists said they were more likely to vote for Obama because of what they saw and heard at the conventions, while 22 percent said they were more likely to vote for Romney.

Forty-two percent of voters who identified themselves as being neither Republican nor Democrat said they were more likely to vote for Romney after seeing the conventions, while 27 percent chose Obama.

In the latest report, the U.S. ranks 17th out of 180 countries with an economic freedom score of 75.1 out of 100. Last year, the U.S. ranked number 11.

Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand topped the list, with respective scores of 89.8, 88.6 and 83.7. Other countries that placed ahead of the U.S. included Canada, Taiwan and Britain, among others.

The Heritage report said countries with scores between 80-100 are considered economically “free,” while countries scores between 70-79.9 are considered “mostly free.”

Individuals in those countries saw incomes at more than double the average levels in other countries and more than five times higher than the incomes of people living in countries with “repressed” economies.

The conservative political think tank’s report claims the substantial expansion in the size and scope of the U.S. government, increased regulatory and tax burdens in many sectors, and the loss of trust and confidence that has accompanied a growing perception of "cronyism" has severely undermined America’s global competitiveness.

Heritage said a low score could mean less take home pay for Americans, more difficulties for entrepreneurs and greater uncertainty for businesses.

Still, the 2017 index found that 103 countries – the majority of which are less developed or emerging economies – showed advancements in economic freedom over the past year, with 49 countries achieving their highest economic freedom scores ever, including China and Russia.

But the report said 4.5 billion people – 65 percent of the world’s population – are still suffering from lack of economic freedom.

“More than half of these people live in just two countries, China and India, where advancement toward greater economic freedom has been both limited and uneven,” the report says.

In the two most populous economies, structural reforms in a few key sectors have sometimes boosted growth, but the governments have failed to institutionalize open environments that promote broad-based and sustainable improvements in the economic well-being of the population as a whole.”Mexico says its citizens in the U.S. should “take precautions” following the deportation of an undocumented mother following a routine meeting with American immigration authorities.

Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 36, a mother of two, became one of the first undocumented workers removed from the U.S. Thursday under an executive action from President Trump.

“The case involving Mrs. Garcia de Rayos illustrates a new reality for the Mexican community living in the United States, facing the most severe implementation of immigration control measures,” Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement Friday, according to CNN.

“It is important that fellow nationals familiarize themselves with the different scenarios they might encounter and know where they can go to receive new information and know all their rights,” it added.

Rayos was taken into custody Wednesday by U.S. immigration agents during a routine check-in at the Phoenix offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

ICE confirmed Rayos’s deportation to Mexico early Thursday, noting her case “underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals.”

“The judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the U.S.,” the agency said of Rayos, who left Mexico at age 14.

The ministry noted that consular officials from Nogales, Ariz., were present Thursday to ensure Rayos’s deportation was performed by “dignified and safe” methods.

Her case attracted national interest in the U.S., as she had routinely checked in with ICE officials for the last eight years.

Officials caught her using a fake Social Security number at her workplace in 2008, and a judge issued a deportation order against her in 2013.

Rayos was not immediately sent back to Mexico, as the Obama administration prioritized removing people deemed to be a threat. She was not seen as a threat, having not committed any serious felony offenses.

But Trump’s recent executive order prioritized deporting undocumented workers who have committed chargeable criminal offenses, including using a fake Social Security number. Her deportation sparked protests late Wednesday in Phoenix.

Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said that its consulates "have intensified their work of protecting fellow nationals, foreseeing more severe immigration measures to be implemented by the authorities of this country."Thursday’s edition of the Federal Register contains a litany of rulemakings to delay rules finalized in the waning days of the Obama administration as well as a notice from the Food and Drug Administration announcing a public meeting on the use of the term “healthy” on product labels.

HHS said disclosing the records of individuals with substance use disorders has the potential to lead to a host of negative consequences, including: loss of employment, loss of housing, loss of child custody, discrimination by medical professionals and insurers, arrest, prosecution and incarceration.

The agency said the rule aims to ensure the patient privacy is protected.

The rule, scheduled to take effect Feb. 17, has now been delayed until March 21. HHS said it’s following the Trump administration’s order to freeze all regulatory actions.

Agency heads were advised to delay the effective date of rules that had already been published for at least another 60 days.

Disabled workers: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is delaying a rule to require federal agencies to enact hiring policies that favor individuals with disabilities.

The final rule aims to clarifies the affirmative action obligation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by requiring agencies to take specific steps to gradually increase the number of employees who have a disability or targeted disability, which include deafness, blindness, partial or complete paralysis, convulsive disorder, mental illness and missing extremity.

The rule also requires agencies to provide these employees with personal assistance services.

The rule set to take effect March 6 is now delayed until March 21. EEOC said its following President Trump’s order to freeze all regulatory action.

Toxins: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is delaying a rule to amend the list of agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to animals and plants.

Under the Agriculture Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002, the agency is required to review and republish the list every two years. The rule includes a provision to address the inactivation of select toxins, address bio-containment and biosafety and clarify regulatory language concerning security, training, incident response, and records.

The rule is now delayed until March 21.

Healthy: The Food and Drug Administration is planning to hold a public meeting on March 9 to discuss when and if it’s appropriate to use the term “healthy” on food labels.

The meeting will be held at the Hilton Rockville Hotel in Maryland. Those wishing to attend are asked to register on the FDA’s website.

Last year, FDA released guidance advising manufacturers that products labeled as “healthy” must meet FDA’s low-fat requirement and list on the label the amounts of mono- and polyunsaturated fats.Two members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) were asked to leave a meeting between lawmakers and the country's top immigration enforcement official Thursday.

Reps. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) and Norma Torres (D-Calif.) were asked to leave the room, while several other members of the CHC were not allowed into the meeting with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting Director Tom Homan.

The meeting was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but ICE canceled, saying too many attendants had signed up. ICE then coordinated with House leadership, setting up a bipartisan meeting with a limited guest list.

Several Democrats, including House and CHC leadership, did attend the meeting.

Gutiérrez was the first to be asked to leave. Outside the room, he met Reps. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.) and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), who had not been allowed in.

"I was expecting to get let in. We're the ones who were asking for this meeting, now we've been barred from the meeting," said Vargas. "I want to know what they're doing, and now we've been barred from this meeting that we called for."

Vargas, a former member of the Jesuit order, then led a prayer with Gutiérrez and Napolitano. Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) arrived and joined the prayer circle.

"It was the Speaker's staff that came to me, and I know her very, very well, and she said she was speaking on behalf of the Speaker, that there were a limited number of seats," Gutiérrez said.

Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) said later: "Oh my God! That room is big enough. They have not filled it to capacity."

Several Democrats remained in the meeting: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.), and CHC members Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.), the caucus chairwoman, Joaquín Castro (Texas), Lucille Roybal-Allard (Calif.) and Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.). Reps. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), and John Conyers (Mich.) were also in attendance. Republicans sent Goodlatte and Reps. Raúl Labrador (Idaho), John Carter (Texas), David Valadao (Calif.) and Michael McCaul (Texas).

Inside the meeting, Democrats complained about the closed-door policy.

“I've never been in a meeting where an agency can designate who can attend,” said Pelosi, according to an aide. Jennifer Elzea, an ICE spokeswoman, told The Hill in an email that Homan informed the bipartisan group, "hosted by the office of Speaker Paul Ryan," of ICE's "recent successful enforcement operations." "Mr. Homan emphasized that ICE does not conduct arrests indiscriminately and does not establish checkpoints; rather, the agency’s deportation officers target pre-identified individuals for arrest at specific locations based on law enforcement leads," Elzea said. Lujan Grisham said Homan told the group that the agency has interpreted new guidance from the White House to mean that every one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country could be removed at any time. She characterized the comment as a "chilling" shift in the federal approach to immigration enforcement. Trump's recent executive order on immigration expands the definition of criminal alien to include people who've entered the country without authorization, previously a misdemeanor offense. "He confirmed that, given the shift, given the discretion allowed in the executive order … it could include everyone," she said. "They didn't say they were going to do it. He said they could do it — everyone's at risk." Republicans said the meeting was productive and fulfilled its goals. "The Speaker’s office organized a small bipartisan briefing that was, at the request of [the Department of Homeland Security], limited to members with jurisdictional interests in immigration enforcement," said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan. "Members of the CHC expressed interest in attending, and to accommodate the request, we welcomed the chair of the CHC [Lujan Grisham] to join on behalf of the other members. We are confident that the CHC chair is capable of representing the views of her caucus, and this arrangement was made very clear to the CHC ahead of time." Labrador said Democrats shouldn't complain about being left out. "I don't get invited to meetings all the time, and I don't complain about it. I'm a grownup about it," he said after the meeting. But CHC members left outside said the exclusion kept them from demanding information relevant to their constituents. "By refusing me access to information, they are essentially stealing from my constituents the right to be represented," Torres said at the impromptu press conference. Gutiérrez said they were proud of CHC leadership representing them in the meeting. "They're in there fighting for us. We're very proud of Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership; they're in there fighting for us," he said. "We sent them in there, Whip Hoyer and all of them — we sent them in there to fight for us. Now we're gonna stand outside the room." Immediately after the meeting ended, Democrats held a formal press conference. Many Democrats had been highly critical of President Obama's deportation approach, which they considered too strict. Just four weeks into the Trump administration, those same lawmakers appear somewhat traumatized in the recognition that enforcement is likely to get even tougher under the new White House. "It was hard to not leave that meeting and believe that the Trump administration is going to target as many immigrants as possible," Castro said. "The only hesitation they seemed to have was whether they would go after DACA recipients." Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is an Obama program designed to protect certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. Trump has not made clear whether he intends to do away with the policy. "They are only constrained by the resources that they have," added Sánchez, former head of the CHC and current vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Pelosi said the way the administration handled the meeting — first postponing Tuesday's gathering with the CHC, then refusing participation by certain Hispanic lawmakers — was "highly unusual." "I've never seen anything like it," she said. "And hopefully never [will] again."

While 52 percent thought Clinton was qualified for the job, only 38 percent said that about Trump, exit polls showed.

ADVERTISEMENT

Fifty-five percent believed Clinton had the right temperament to be president, but only 35 percent felt that way about Trump.

And while integrity was advertised as Clinton’s Achilles heel, and only 36 percent thought she was honest and trustworthy, even fewer (33 percent) had the same view of Trump.

In short, for Trump to win, voters had to be willing to take a real chance on him. Voters who thought he was unqualified or unsuited for office had to support him, despite their misgivings.

Some did.

Nationally, as well as in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, one in six to one in five voters who thought Trump was unqualified, or temperamentally unsuited, for the presidency cast their ballots for him despite these important reservations.

Assuming that level of risk is most likely a function of one of two things: Either voters were so fed up they were willing to take that kind of chance, or so confident in Clinton’s eventual victory that they felt free to cast a protest vote without consequences.

However, no one could have anticipated quite how risky a choice President Trump would prove to be.

Who could have imagined that the White House would be warned that the president’s now-former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, could be subject to Russian blackmail and that the president would take no action for weeks?

Who could have guessed that that same national security adviser could have made liars out of the vice president and the president’s press secretary, and suffer no consequence for weeks?

Who could foresee an executive order on refugees and immigrants so at odds with humanity and so harmful to our own security?

Who could imagine that to make a few extra bucks at Mar-a-Lago, the president would allow paying guests to photograph the man carrying the nuclear “football” and make policy on North Korea before the very eyes of the paying guests, who certainly got their 200 grand worth that night alone?

Who could imagine that the president would simply bluster at Iran and North Korea, without a plan to back up his words with action?

Who could have imagined that in just a few short weeks, President Trump would earn the enmity of the leaders of nearly every other nation on earth?

Managing world peace just isn’t quite the same thing as negotiating a real estate deal, and the same tactics are not always appropriate to both occasions.

Americans are distraught about the risks Trump is posing.

The president began his first term with weaker ratings than any of his predecessors — and they’ve gotten worse. Just two days after his inauguration, an average of polls showed Americans approved of his performance by a meager 4-point margin.

Today they disapprove on average by an 8-point margin — a 12-point net shift against Trump in just three weeks.

Just 38 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy according to Quinnipiac — 56 percent disapprove.

The number who feel less safe with Trump as president shot up 5 points, to 50 percent, in just two weeks.

When the dangers to which Trump exposed the country this past weekend, and during Flynn’s brief tenure, work their way into the public consciousness, the president’s ratings are likely to deteriorate further.

The fact that voters were willing to take risks doesn’t mean they want their fears realized. They hope the risks will never actually emerge.

Donald Trump represents a serious threat to the security and well-being of this country. It’s time he and his minions stopped embracing risk and started trying to reduce it.

Each side had 30 minutes of argument time conducted over the phone.

Listen to the hearing in the video above.

Hearing concludes

7:10 p.m.

The hearing concluded, with Clifton showing more support for the Trump administration and Friedland appearing to side with the plaintiffs' argument.

Friedland acknowledged the pressing nature of the case and said the court will issue a decision "as soon as possible."

A ruling is not expected Tuesday evening, the court said earlier in the day, but will likely come sometime this week.

Judges address messy rollout

7:08 p.m.

Judges brought up the confusion at airports right after the ban was signed, when it was still unclear whether the policy applies to legal permanent residents.



Clifton asked why the administration didn't issue a new executive order to clarify the order. He questioned whether there is authority to interpret the policy so that it doesn't include legal residents.

Administration lawyer faces more questions

7:02 p.m.

In a short rebuttal, Flentje grew heated when pressed by Friedland on the plaintiff's submitted evidence that Trump has supported a Muslim ban in the past.

He said it's "extraordinary" to second-guess the president's authority over national security "based on newspaper articles."

But Clifton asked whether he denies those statements were made.

"No," Flentje replied.

Judges question states' claims of religious discrimination

6:40 p.m.



Judges pressed Purcell to back up the plaintiffs' claims that Trump's executive action amounts to religious discrimination. The states said they believe the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another.



"I'm not persuaded," Clifton said. The countries targeted "encompass only relatively small percentage of Muslims."



"I'm not persuaded," Clifton said. The countries targeted "encompass only relatively small percentage of Muslims." Purcell said states just needed to prove the order was motivated, in part, by a desire to discriminate against Muslims, citing Trump's remark in December 2015 about a "total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States."

"There are statements that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against Muslims," Purcell said. "The public statement from the president and his top advisers."

Purcell said it is "remarkable" to have this much evidence of intent before the official pre-trial process known as discovery, but Clifton seemed unconvinced by his arguments and lack of hard evidence, pointing to foreign policy that treats citizens from certain nations differently.

Lawyer describes "irreparable harm" of travel ban

6:35 p.m.

Purcell moved on to the merits of the underlying immigration order and said it has inflicted irreparable damage to the states through lost tax revenues, separates families and residents afraid of traveling overseas.

States' attorney begins argument

6:32 p.m.

The attorney for Washington and Minnesota argued that the administration pursued the wrong procedural move in requesting an appeal of a temporary restraining order, which are generally non-appealable. Trump's team says that it should be treated as a preliminary injunction.

"Why should we care?" asked Clifton, who suggested that was the wrong argument to pursue.

Defense concludes argument

6:30 p.m.

Flentje quickly ran up against his 30-minute window — he also reserved five minutes for rebuttal.

As judges continued to pepper him with questions, Flentje made his final pitch to the panel: that the injunction against the travel ban is "over broad" and should be immediately stayed, even if the court takes issue with the executive action itself.

Judges press DOJ lawyer on reviewing Trump action

6:25 p.m.

Canby repeatedly pressed Flentje on whether a state could challenge an order that banned Muslims outright.

"That's not what this order does," Flentje said.



"I know. Could he? Would anyone be able to challenge that?" Canby asked.

"That’s not what the order does," the lawyer said again.

Clifton chimed in, saying it's important because it speaks to whether states have standing to bring a lawsuit.

"This is a far cry from that situation," Flentje said.

Earlier in the hearing, Friedland had asked if Trump's authority made his decision in this situation "unreviewable," to which Flentje responded: "yes."

DOJ lawyer faces questions from judges

6:18 p.m.





Judges on the panel questioned whether there was any real evidence that the countries outlined in the order posed a real risk for terrorism, and asked for examples of federal offenses from visa holders from the seven nations.





Flentje pointed back to the previous actions by Congress and the Obama administration identifying those countries as nations of concern, but said there was no evidence in the record.

"It's pretty abstract," one judge said.

Flentje said of the legal proceedings: "These things are moving pretty fast."

A judge also shot back against Flentje's assertion that states don't have the legal standing to bring the lawsuit and challenge visa denials: "Sure they can," Judge Clifton said.

Department of Justice defends Trump's authority

6:05 p.m.

The Trump administration kicked off its oral argument by pointing out that the seven countries targeted in the immigration order were previously identified as terrorism risks by Congress and the executive branch, and that it is in the president’s broad legal authority to protect the national interest.

Hearing gavels in

6 p.m.

A three-judge appeals court panel in San Francisco began hearing oral arguments over whether to restore President Trump's executive action on immigration and refugees while lawsuits proceed.

The hearing is being conducted by phone.



After Trump's temporary travel ban was put on hold by a federal judge in Washington state, the administration asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to lift the temporary travel ban.

Watch the video above for a preview of what’s to come.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Monday said that 75 percent of the people detained last week in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids were “criminal aliens.”

In a press release, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the department arrested 680 people in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Antonio “who pose a threat to public safety, border security or the integrity of our nation’s immigration system.”

“ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years,” Kelly said. “The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE’s Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis.”

Kelly said the “criminal aliens” committed crimes including, but not limited to, homicide, drug trafficking, sexual crimes, assault, DUI and weapons offenses.

Reports emerged over the weekend that ICE officials had conducted raids in several cities, though an exact number of arrests was not disclosed. An ICE official in the Los Angeles office said the raids were part of an “enforcement surge” but maintained they were routine.

President Trump last month signed an executive order calling for the construction on his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall to begin. Another order ended the “catch and release” policy, which allowed people who crossed the border to return to Mexico without being detained.

The new order also expanded the definition of “criminal alien” to include individuals who entered the country without authorization, which was originally considered a misdemeanor offense. Immigrants who have "committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense" are now priorities under the order, even if they have yet to be convicted.

Following reports of the raids, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus sent a letter to ICE, requesting a meeting about the recent immigration enforcement efforts.

“It is critical that we meet with you in person immediately to discuss the impact these raids have had on our communities as well as obtain clarifying guidance on how ICE policies will differ from the last Administration,” the letter said.Assistant Deputy to President Donald Trump, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, is disappointed with CNN anchor Jake Tapper’s treatment of Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump’s closest counselors.

Conway had claimed in multiple media interviews that the nonexistent "Bowling Green massacre" justified Trump's travel ban, although she's since said that she "misspoke."

“The tone was very disappointing,” Dr. Gorka told The Hill’s Joe Concha. “It was trying to treat a woman as a punching bag, really. It was clear.”

Dr. Gorka, who was on Tapper’s show just days before the host’s heated exchange with Conway, questioned the treatment of Conway, which he described as "aggressive."

In a statement Sunday afternoon, a spokesperson from CNN responded, saying that, "If Gorka or anyone else from the administration had been on The Lead that day they would have received the same interview. It's disappointing to see any administration retreat into false claims of addressing the issues at hand."

Trump’s assault is sure to alter White House media relations for years to come; and it is safe to say no other president has dared to change this dynamic since the day when Teddy Roosevelt first used the term “muckrakers.”

The president and his administration treat the media with an air of contempt. Yet, while we can’t pinpoint which is the chicken or the egg, there is a clear and unabashed reciprocity on the part of most mainstream media outlets.

It’s time for them to stop pretending there isn’t.

In the hours following the event, and in the days leading up to it, there has been an open barrage from the members of the press corps and their news organizations about the way they are treated and outrage at the new standard, almost in some effort to gain public sympathy and support for their plight.

They have even gone as far as questioning the administration’s authority to, of all things, call on smaller and less nationally known news outlets instead of the larger mainstream ones that have been entrenched in attack-mode since the inauguration.

Oh, how the public weeps.

One of the mistakes the press corps is making is that they are trying to insert themselves as a character in the play, rather than just a critic in the audience.

NEW: Trump airs grievances at first full press conference https://t.co/pmKiqpK1Z5 pic.twitter.com/02OygCHUg0 — The Hill (@thehill) February 16, 2017

When you catch a member of the corps in a television interview, it’s becoming more common that their interaction with the president is the story, rather than the subject they were sent to cover.

This is not a knock on the credibility of their work. The Trump administration has and will likely continue to fill that role and confront the press when they feel a story is inaccurately reported. (I actually happen to like many members of the press corps and folks at mainstream outlets)

But while the facts of any given story can be argued, the bias is clear, and the Flynn episode is the latest proof.

Assuming Flynn really did discuss the administration’s willingness to reevaluate the sanctions (the transcripts haven’t been made public, after all), it is no worse than President Obama openly telling the Russian president on a hot mic that he will be more flexible after his election.

Not only is the media not treating it the same, but it is unimaginable that there are more pundits panicking over an allegation that the president’s future employee had a passive conversation with an ambassador than there was when the elected leader of our government colluded on camera with the leader of the Russian government to mislead the public on his true intentions until after an election.

We also see this bias with the coverage of the potential Russian hacking during the election. This is not to say that this isn’t a serious matter, but the headlines, stories, and hysterics do not meet the facts we can confirm.

If you don’t believe that this occurs, watch the video of a New York Times columnist on MSNBC claiming that the hacking of individuals associated with the Clinton campaign is on par with 9/11 and Pearl Harbor …. seriously.

Thomas Friedman: Flynn Resignation Shows Russia Hacking Was On Scale With 9/11, Pearl Harborhttps://t.co/1tcGeH1sYj — RCP Video (@rcpvideo) February 14, 2017

Facing these types of double standards like at every turn, it is no surprise that the administration is trying to pull an end-around on the mainstream media.

To combat this, the largest news outlets are falling back on two things: First, they conflate the president’s accountability to the public with an accountability to the press corps; and second, on their self-insistence of impartiality as a way to tell news consumers that they alone are the guardians of some objective public duty.

Consider the absurdity of their claim to impartiality with this hypothetical experiment:

Ask any cable news watcher which two of the three biggest networks lean left and which one leans to the right? You’ll almost always get the same answer.

This is not a result of some mass hallucination. Rather, it’s simply because in this country, like in nearly every other, news outlets tend to slant to one side or the other.

There is no law or moral duty requiring the American media to be unbiased, and we would all be better served if they abandoned this pretense and accepted reality. The fact that so many Americans can easily identify which outlets take which bias is in itself prima facie evidence of its existence.

"Trump press conference reveals long game. Media still scrambling." https://t.co/HD1u6MbSsA pic.twitter.com/6c6nIB7dZH — The Hill (@thehill) February 17, 2017

The attitude of the networks and newspapers plays out each day within the White House press corps. What may have been true before may no longer be the case. There is a false belief that they alone are the lens through which the public views the president. That’s simply no longer accurate.

More and more Americans, whether on the right or the left, are coming to the realization that they no longer need to get their news from a small pool of likeminded journalists.

Moreover, many of these same people are excited that they have a president who believes in accountability to the public, rather than the big media corporations.

In fact, it is in many ways refreshing to see a president not absolutely paralyzed with fear out of what could said about him on late night TV or obsessed with seeing his name in the favorable editorials of declining newspapers.

The survey found 53 percent of voters believe Obama will triumph on Nov. 6, a huge swing from the 43 percent who held that view immediately before the Democratic convention early last month.

During the same period, the proportion of voters who think GOP challenger Mitt Romney will win shrank from 46 percent to 41 percent, The Hill’s poll found.

The doom-laden numbers for Romney reflect the fact that 50 percent of voters say the president and the Democrats have run a better campaign, while only 41 percent give the nod to Romney and Republicans.

The poll, conducted Sept. 27 for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, highlights the pressure Romney will be under to deliver a strong performance at his first debate with Obama on Wednesday in Denver.

Eighty-five percent of voters said they are likely to watch the opening debate, compared to 12 percent who said they were not likely to tune in.

The Republican candidate has endured a difficult four-week stretch on the campaign trail, while Obama’s Gallup approval rating over the same period has risen to its highest level in more than a year.

Democrats were seen as having a stronger convention than Republicans, who saw actor Clint Eastwood upstage Romney.

The GOP nominee then faced criticism for his initial response to the assaults against U.S. diplomatic missions in Egypt and Libya.

That has hampered his ability to make a bigger issue of the Obama administration’s changing account of the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens.

More problematic, Romney spent several crucial days dealing with the fallout over a secretly recorded video that showed him telling campaign donors that his “job is not to worry about” 47 percent of voters because they are dependent on government and cannot be persuaded to “take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”

The Hill Poll’s results come on the heels of a string of national and swing-state polls showing Obama maintaining a slim-to-comfortable lead over his challenger.

Gallup’s national seven-day tracking poll on Sunday showed Obama with a 49-44 percent lead. Obama also holds advantages over Romney in Ohio, Florida and Virginia: three of the most important Electoral College battlegrounds.

Perhaps not surprisingly, The Hill’s latest poll found Democrats are growing more confident and Republicans more pessimistic just five weeks before the election.

Seventy-two percent of Republicans believe Romney will win the election, down from 76 percent in The Hill’s poll on Sept. 2.

By comparison, 87 percent of Democrats now say Obama will win, up from 78 percent early in September.

More disturbing for Romney’s campaign — and more encouraging for Obama’s — is that far more centrist and non-aligned voters now feel the election is tilting in the president’s direction.

Among centrists, 65 percent think Obama will win, compared to 31 percent who say Romney.

A month ago, only 40 percent of centrist voters thought Obama would win; 44 percent picked Romney.

A similar trend is evident among ‘other’ voters — those who identify as neither Republicans nor Democrats. The Hill’s poll found 52 percent of those people think Obama will win, up from 36 percent in early September.

Obama is favored to win across all age groups, as well. Sixty percent of voters aged 18-39 think the president will get a second term compared to 36 percent who said Romney will win. The margin is narrower among voters aged 40-64 (48 percent said Obama, 45 said Romney) and those over 65 (48 percent said Obama, 46 said Romney).

The Republican has faced a barrage of criticism recently over his campaign’s overall direction, much of it from conservative pundits who say the candidate has lacked focus and been too cautious in his attacks on Obama.

That Republican unease is reflected in the poll.

While 84 percent of Democrats think Obama has run the better campaign, 73 percent of Republicans think their candidate has been more effective.

By a 2-to-1 margin (62 percent to 31), voters who identify themselves as “centrists” say Obama and the Democrats have run a better campaign than Romney.

The view that Obama has outperformed Romney is particularly important because many polls have shown the president began the election with built-in challenges.

He received low marks for his handling of the economy and overall job performance throughout much of the year.

The Hill’s poll on Sept. 2 found that 54 percent of voters said Obama, based on job performance, did not deserve to be reelected.

Despite the struggles Romney has had connecting with voters, the latest Hill Poll found voters believe the former Massachusetts governor matches up well against Obama on a major character issue.

When asked which candidate “most shares your values,” 48 percent said Romney and 46 percent said Obama. That’s similar to Hill Poll results from late July, when Romney led 48 percent to 44 on the same question.

The poll did not ask people which candidate they planned to vote for on Nov. 6.

With three presidential debates looming, however, the Hill Poll found a significant number of voters (9 percent) said they remained either somewhat or very likely to change their mind before election day.

Eighty-nine percent said they were not likely to change their minds.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters and is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.

Thirty-six percent of those polled identified as Republicans, 34 percent said they were Democrats and 30 percent had other or no political affiliation.

"Judge Gorsuch has met every demand placed on him by the Minority. He’s a mainstream judge. He’s displayed independence," Grassley said in a statement. "He’s met with dozens of senators who have nothing but positive things to say. He is well-qualified and respected."

He added that with Gorsuch returning his committee questionnaire, it's "time for him to have the opportunity to speak for himself before the Judiciary Committee."

The hearing will last between three and four days, with Grassley arguing the timeline is in line with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, President Obama's two successful Supreme Court nominees.

President Trump nominated Gorsuch late last month to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant last year by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

Democrats will likely use the hearings to grill Gorsuch on myriad legal issues. They are demanding that he be able to get 60 votes to clear the Senate, which would require he win over at least eight Democratic senators.

Republicans argue that Democrats are trying to apply an unfair higher standard, noting that Sotomayor and Kagan were not subjected to a higher procedural threshold.

Though Democrats lowered the 60-vote threshold for most nominations in 2013, they left the higher bar intact for Supreme Court picks.Greg Nash

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai drinks out of an oversized mug on Tuesday during his first public meeting as chairman of the agency.A strong plurality of voters believe economic conditions in the United States are getting worse, not better, according to a new poll for The Hill — and believe the $85 billion package of cuts known as the sequester will only make things worse.

In the first survey for The Hill conducted since the sequester kicked in a little more than a week ago, 48 percent of respondents said the country’s economy is getting worse, while just 33 percent said the economy is improving.

ADVERTISEMENT

Although many analysts have warned that the automatic cuts and the consequent furloughing of thousands of workers will harm the fragile recovery, last week saw several indications that job growth is actually picking up.

A report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the economy added 236,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent — its lowest level since President Obama took office. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average reached new, record highs four days in a row last week.

One explanation for respondents’ pessimistic outlook despite the spate of encouraging economic news is the emphasis placed on the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestration by the administration and the news media.

According to The Hill poll, a majority of voters, 56 percent, believe the sequester will hurt the U.S. economy. Perhaps surprisingly, though, a strong plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they were not expecting the sequester cuts to have a negative impact on their personal circumstances.

Party affiliation offers a partial explanation for voters’ views on the country’s economic condition. A full 67 percent of Republicans said the economy is worsening, versus just 26 percent of Democrats. On the flip side, just 15 percent of Republicans said the economy is improving, while 56 percent of Democrats believed this to be the case.

Notably, however, respondents who identified as “Other” tended to agree with Republicans: 22 percent of those independent voters said the economy was getting better, while 55 percent said it was getting worse.

But since sequestration became reality, critics of the administration have claimed that Obama and his team cried wolf on the impact the cuts could have on the economy.

In the weeks before the sequester hit, Obama traversed the country, touting the message that under no circumstances should the cuts be allowed to take effect. But he and his team made several dubious claims. Obama declared that Capitol Hill janitors would receive a pay cut under sequestration, but Capitol superintendent Carlos Elias insists that is incorrect. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Arne Duncan Arne DuncanObama Education secretary condemns protest against DeVos at DC school Dems, GOP battle over pace of Trump confirmations The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE asserted on CBS that many teachers had received “pink slips,” but later walked back the statement.

Obama has since toned down his rhetoric, admitting that the cuts won’t be “an apocalypse.” But voters are not letting the president off easy: The Hill poll shows that a strong plurality of voters, 48 percent, said Obama and his team exaggerated the negative effects of the sequester cuts, while just 31 percent said the White House did not overplay its hand.

A plurality of the American public also believes the political news media are too soft on the administration. According to the Hill Poll, a solid 46 percent of respondents said the news media are excessively sympathetic to the president, while 28 percent said the press deliberately tries to hurt Obama and just 17 percent said they offer unbiased coverage.

Voters were mostly split along party lines on the question, but those who identified themselves as “Other” tended to agree with a strong majority of Republicans who said the news media are overly sympathetic to Obama.

These findings come as a spate of prominent national polls indicate that Obama’s post-election honeymoon may be ending. Recent surveys from Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN show that Obama’s approval rating has dropped off slightly in the wake of the sequester. According to the Gallup poll, the president averaged 49 percent approval for the week ending March 3, down from 51 percent the prior week.

These results were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.

Yes, the NBC sketch show’s wall-to-wall Trump bashing has been good for business , but what about the brand? That’s taken a sizable hit and, as a long-time “SNL” fan, I doubt it will recover.

A show once known for its “take no prisoners” approach is now hopelessly liberal, like roughly 98 percent of current comedy institutions.

That’s not edgy. That’s groupthink at its most insufferable.

During the Clinton years, “SNL” standout Darrell Hammond hit the Commander in Chief with everything he had. Will Ferrell hammered President George W. Bush.

Can anyone remember one killer skit poking fun of President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE? It’s hard to forget, though, the show’s final sketch that name checked Obama. Cast members Sasheer Zamata and Cecily Strong serenaded the soon-to-be ex-president with “To Sir, with Love.”

That sound you hear is John Belushi spinning in his grave.

It’s the kind of bald propaganda you’d expect to find in North Korea, not the nation’s most irreverent comedy showcase.

The new “SNL” math is clear. If the politician has a “D” next to his or her name, the jokes are either more measured or nonexistent. If the letter is an “R,” it’s game on. And in the Age of Trump does anyone think that will change?

Every new “SNL” show starts with a “cold open” slamming some aspect of the Trump administration. It might be Trump himself, expertly played by Alec Baldwin. Or Trump spokesman Sean Spicer rages across the screen in the form of Melissa McCarthy.

These comic assaults aren’t simple satire. They’re often mean spirited, and they target anyone in the Trump inner circle. Ferrell’s Dubya may have been withering, but it was rarely cruel.

Heck, do you think liberals might complain if “SNL” depicted David Axelrod as Death, like they’ve done with Steve Bannon?

The show recently featured Trump strategist Kellyanne Conway as the deranged Glenn Close character from “Fatal Attraction.” Has the show ever portrayed a female Obama official in such a fashion? If so, would the National Organization for Women (NOW) remain silent?

None of this means Trump shouldn’t be the butt of “SNL” jokes. He might be the juiciest target for any comedy show to consider. It’s like he sprang to life in a lab dedicated to creating mockable politicians.

So why is “SNL” ignoring so many other ripe targets? What about reporters hyperventilating over every fresh Trump proclamation? What about the campus radicals denying free speech at UC Berkeley while decrying fascism?

The rush to slap a “cultural appropriation” label on every other fad should be serially mocked by “SNL” scribes. The “Not Ready for Prime Time Players” of yore would have shredded today’s Social Justice Warriors. And, even better, made us howl in the process.

Have we forgotten that select universities passed out coloring books to help students process Trump’s election?

Some skits write themselves. Yet “SNL” won’t go near them.

“SNL” used to crank out killer celebrity impressions. The Celebrity Jeopardy sketches may be the show’s finest running gag.

So why not poke fun at all those celebrity “get out the vote” PSAs? The stern messaging. The repetitive phrasing. The “look, I didn’t put on my celebrity makeup” virtue signaling.

Heck, it took conservative scribes to brilliantly do the trick, embarrassing “SNL” in the process.

Meryl Streep’s hysterical rant at the Golden Globes last month should have fueled a delirious sketch or two, particularly when she targeted football.

Football?

It’s hard to escape “SNL” these days. Every sketch is shared not just by your Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? AT&T, Time Warner defend deal Top union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race MORE-loving uncle but by mainstream reporters. Is it really news when Team “SNL” uncorks its 19th Trump sketch of the new year? It’s the ultimate dog bites man story now, but that’s not stopping reporters from treating every bit like a new executive order.

Liberal media bias is real, but that’s an opinion piece for another day.

What’s crystal clear now, though, is that “SNL” has written off attracting right-of-center viewers. That’s roughly half the country, hardly a sound business strategy.

The show started alienating red states with alacrity last year. One sketch insisted Trump voters, not merely Trump himself, were racist.

Comedians should hold politicians’ feet to the fire. It’s a long-standing, and healthy, tradition we hold dear.

So where were all the “SNL” sketches slamming Obama for his health care lies? What about the IRS targeting conservative groups? Dare we mention the 2012 Benghazi attack, which Obama officials initially blamed on a YouTube video?

“SNL” now wants to hold Trump’s feet to the fire, and that’s valuable. But the show has burned its reputation as a fair comedy institution to the ground.

The contents of this site are ©2017 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.Americans argue, persuasively I might add, that immigrants who qualify should be able to adjust to lawful status in the United States and eventually take steps to obtain lawful permanent residence by virtue of time spent as good and valuable residents.

A counter argument advanced by President Trump calls for forced removal. The president argues that we are a nation of laws and leaving the country is the first step in making things right. He believes that rewarding law breakers by permitting them to adjust to lawful immigration status in the United States is a prescription for chaos.

ADVERTISEMENT

These points of view have supporters as well as opponents. Thus, for me, the argument turns on where to draw the line.

Since Trump is president of all Americans, it’s important to know where Americans stand on the issue. Recent polls indicate that nearly 70 percent of Americans favor a plan to permit non-legal residents who have resided here for more than 5 years, have developed equities and set roots in America, and have become productive members of society to have a path to lawful permanent residence. Only 1 in 5 American adults (19 percent) favor any type of forced deportation. Support from a majority of Americans for a path to lawful residence for individuals without legal immigration status has been stable for more than a decade.

As the nation tries to divine a course of action that will provide the greatest national good, we need to know which federal statutes were violated by individuals here without legal status. There are normally two types of violations: improper entry and unlawful presence. Both infractions are now and have always been civil, not criminal, violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Subsequent deportation and associated administrative processes that flow from these violations are civil, not criminal proceedings.

The distinction between civil and criminal law turns on the difference between redress and retribution. Lawmakers must be careful not to confuse redress with revenge. Civil law seeks redress of wrong doing by compelling compensation or restitution from offenders. The offender is not punished but suffers as much redress as is necessary to remedy the venial wrong that has been committed. In the instant case, the INA calls for a minimum of a $50 fine for first time violations of either statute.

On the other hand, when considering violations of criminal statutes, the main objective of the law is to seek retribution by punishing the criminal in a way that will provide a strong inducement not to commit another crime. In other words, that sentiment is to satisfy the public sense that wrongdoing ought to meet with strong punishment.

In ethics and law, the phrase "Let the punishment fit the crime" is a principle that means the severity of penalty for a misdeed or wrongdoing should be reasonable and proportionate. Proportionality requires that the level of punishment be scaled relative to the severity of the offending behavior.

Yet, when trying to conjure up comprehensive immigration reform legislation, there remains a temptation on the part of some in Congress to seek retribution by treating these infractions as though criminal acts. They seek to create heavy penalties in exchange for a path to lawful residence. They believe offenders must pay dearly for entering or remaining in the country unlawfully. Like Shylock, in the Merchant of Venice, they are determined to extract their pound of flesh.

Deporting the roughly 11 million non-legal men, women, and children who now live in the United States, three-fifths of whom have been here for more than a decade, for a violation of civil law would be horrendously cruel, inhumane and totally out of proportion to America’s sense of justice. The destruction of lives, families, and communities would be immense, with the worst trauma inflicted upon those children who have never known any home other than the one they had in this country. This is not redress; this is the most drastic form of retribution.

If the moral and ethical arguments along, with humanitarian concerns, aren’t persuasive enough, there is the question of cost. Rounding up, detaining, obtaining deportation orders and removing 11 million individuals will require an increase in the immigration enforcement budget of hundreds of billions of dollars. Plus, removing 11 million workers and consumers from the country would inflict significant damage on the U.S. economy. It’s much like throwing the baby away with the bath water.

Soon, I expect some type of immigration reform legislation to be initiated. Nearly all Americans believe that a successful adjustment program should combine measured penalties with clear and achievable goals which will enroll the maximum number of people into a benefit program, identify the relatively few who do not belong here based on criminal activity, and integrate those who can contribute their talents as quickly as possible.

In 1987, Alan Bock wrote that our immigration problem is caused by the American Dream. “The Dream,” he wrote, “although tattered around the edges and undermined by an accretion of rules, regulations and conventions is still alive. Those of us who have had the privilege of living here all our lives may have complaints about many things, but for those who view us from afar, whether from across the oceans or from across the border, this is as close to the Promise Land as this troubled world affords.”

Just think how much richer America would be if we could re-discover our heritage of nourishing liberty and opening our hearts to those seeking the same legacy.

Let’s draw the line at doing the right thing, America.

Yet back in Washington, D.C., the Democrats’ top elected official, Senate Minority Leader(N.Y.), resorted to the same loser playbook that has put his party into such a predicament.

“Pres Trump ought to see the writing on the wall, abandon proposal, roll up his sleeves & come up w/ a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe,” he tweeted, working hard to demobilize and demotivate the resistance movement. No one wants to see Trump roll up his sleeves and do anything. The less he does, the better our chances of surviving his tenure — both figuratively and literally. And really, who does Schumer think he’s impressing with “bipartisan” talk?

Former President Obama spent most of his tenure preaching bipartisanship, yet it was the GOP’s relentless opposition that paid political benefits, netting the party the bulk of state houses and legislatures nationwide, as well as control of Congress. Obama Democrats argued the president was the “adult in the room,” but it was the children who reaped the benefits. Democrats argued that “when they go low, we go high.” And the inmates took over the asylum.

Beltway editorial boards and columnists might be impressed by “reaching across the aisle,” but there isn’t a single voter suddenly motivated to abandon Trump because of Schumer’s appeal to bipartisanship. There isn’t a single nonvoter who now finally has a reason to head to the ballot box, thanks to Schumer’s “bipartisan plan.”

And why would a Democratic senator indulge in Trump’s fantasy of a lawless nation under assault? Contrary to Trump’s “alternative facts,” our nation’s murder rate is the lowest it has been since 1963, and there hasn’t been an epidemic of terrorist attacks covered up by the media — not in Bowling Green nor anywhere else. Not a single refugee has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the United States since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, and beforehand, only three fatal terrorist attacks were carried out by refugees—and all three were right-wing Cubans. Trump’s ban would not have prevented the attacks on 9/11, or in San Bernardino, at the Orlando Pulse nightclub or at the Boston Marathon. So why pretend we need to change our already tough immigration system to deter threats that have never materialized?

The reality is Trump is wrong about the problem and wrong about the solution. Pretty much, he’s wrong about everything, and in the most hateful, vengeful and harmful ways possible. It isn’t just Democratic voters who see this. The latest Gallup poll gives Trump a 40 percent approval rating among all Americans, down from only 46 percent after the inauguration. Republicans were smart enough to wage all-out war against Obama when he was popular, why would Democrats want to play nice with Trump when he’s already radioactive?

The Democratic base—the people itching to sweep the GOP out of power in 2018 and 2020—aren’t interested in bipartisanship. They are interested in fighting, in resistance, and in steadfast opposition.

Schumer can join the resistance and ride the wave, or he can get the hell out of the way for someone who will.

Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.With each new day that dawns on the Trump administration, a little more light is shed on possible coordination between the president, his family, his businesses or his campaign and the Russian government before and after November’s election.

And as leaders in Congress, we owe it to our constituents and our country to follow that evidence and hold to account anyone who broke the law or has undisclosed relationships with Russia.

Recent reports indicate National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have broken the law by privately discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador in the month before Trump took office — perhaps signaling that the incoming Trump administration would roll back those new sanctions.

This is objectionable unto itself, but in context, it’s absolutely intolerable.

The sanctions Flynn apparently discussed with the Russian ambassador were imposed by President Obama after our nation’s 17 intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered with our election in order to benefit the Trump campaign.

The potential quid pro quo is as clear as day. It looks as if Flynn without legal authority conspired with a regime that had just attacked our democracy’s foundation to benefit Flynn’s boss, and did so to help that regime deal with the punishment for that attack. Flynn’s efforts to walk back what previously had been blanket denials of such contacts merely deepen suspicion about his actions and motives.

Such a scenario would make it far less surprising that Russian President Vladimir Putin chose not to retaliate in late December after the Obama administration expelled suspected Russian spies and shut down Russian-owned compounds in New York and Maryland. Perhaps Putin already had been promised that penalties would be short-lived and that help would be on the way come Jan. 20.

It’s stunning that President Trump has not yet suspended Flynn and halted his access to classified information until a full investigation can be mounted. Yet all we hear from the White House are the lilting strains of “Stand By Your Man” as the fox continues to guard the henhouse.

Sadly, this is only the latest instance in which President Trump and most of his team seem pathologically unable or diabolically unwilling to utter a cross word about Putin’s Russia.

It surely sounded pleasing when Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, recently condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine. But the administration’s actions belie her tough talk — all we’ve seen so far is disdain for NATO; pooh-poohing of the fact that Putin hacked our election to help Trump; denials or soft-pedalling of Flynn’s and other Trump aides’ contacts with Russia during and after the campaign; the President himself likening our own nation’s moral bottom line to that of a murderous Russian dictator; and a “technical fix” that was promptly praised in Moscow as an easing of sanctions.

To protect the future of this great democracy, we must dig down to the root of this discomfiting Trump-Russia connection. We must create an independent, bipartisan commission to fully investigate and make public Russia’s interference in our election through its illegal theft and selective release of private emails, its dissemination of fake news, or by other means.

Only an independent, bipartisan commission can dedicate itself and its staff to this crucial investigation full-time, without distraction. And only an independent, bipartisan commission can rise above the jurisdictional squabbles and perceptions of partisan bias that inevitably attach to congressional committees’ probes.

The bill I introduced with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) to accomplish this — H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act — is co-sponsored by every member of the House Democratic Caucus. It’s our fervent hope that ever-mounting evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Russia will convince Republican members to sign on as well.

Don’t be fooled: Russia’s geopolitical aims are at odds with our own. It’s lovely to imagine a close alliance in which our nations could collaborate on defeating ISIS, but Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, its saber-rattling in the Baltics and its coddling of Syria’s brutal Assad regime amount to a massive destabilization of the world. And Putin’s ruthless record of imprisoning or even dispatching his rivals and critics are anathema to our most basic values.

It looks as if Michael Flynn might have lain down with dogs and got up with fleas; we must not let him and his boss drag our nation into doing likewise. Any violation of law in Flynn’s secret chats with Russia’s emissary must be pursued and punished to the fullest, lest we allow the impression that American foreign policy can be easily manipulated to other nations’ ends.

Fixing our broken immigration system is something that President Obama never did. In fact, he made the situation worse.

First, his Justice Department did little to enforce the laws on the books, until it became clear that the situation was getting out of hand.

He vaguely promised citizenship to those who were in the country illegally, which encouraged a whole generation of migrants from Central America to bull rush to the border in hopes to get a chance to become citizens themselves.

Mr. Obama, of course, had the chance to reform the system in his first two years of his term, but he and his Democratic allies chose to focus on climate change and healthcare reform. An immigration proposal never made it to the floor in Nancy Pelosi’s short tenure as Speaker.

This issue has been festering for the better part of a decade. More and more people overstay their visas or sneak through our southern border, lured here by the promise of jobs and too scared to go back home for fear that they will never get a chance to get back here.

Estimates range from 10 to 15 million illegal immigrants in this country. That’s a lot of people for a country our size to absorb, a lot of people who are part of an underground economy that drives down wages and who are exploited by unscrupulous employers.

Candidate Trump promised to enforce our immigration laws, and that proved to be a powerful campaign promise that helped to propel him to the White House.

Fixing our broken immigration system is not easy to do piece by piece.

If you want to entice the Chamber of Commerce into accepting an E-verify system, you need to help them get access to more potential employees. That means at least legalization for those who are undocumented and perhaps an expansion of the work visa program.

If you are going to do that for the Chamber, then you need to do something for the agriculture community. That usually means more visas for migrant workers who are essential for the farm economy.

But you can’t do something for the business sector without doing something for organized labor. You need Democratic votes, and those votes are controlled by the labor movement. That means you must do something to protect the rights of immigrants, and that usually comes with some sort of legalization and a pathway to citizenship.

Interior enforcement is always a demand of conservative Republicans. They hate the idea of “sanctuary cities” and they want local police departments to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expel lawbreakers. But you talk to sheriffs whose charge it is to keep their communities safe and they don’t want to do ICE’s work for them, because they have enough on their plate and it is hard enough to build trust among new immigrants. There’s a compromise in there somewhere that needs to be found, perhaps by giving the bulk of the undocumented documents and by kicking the gang-bangers out of the country.

The final piece comes with the so-called “Dreamers,” the children who came with their undocumented parents and who have grown up in this country, knowing no other place to live. President Trump has promised to take care of them, but nobody knows what that means exactly.

Pretty soon, you get back to a comprehensive approach to reform.

President Trump can build a wall and he can issue executive orders. And he can enforce the current laws, which is causing panic in the immigrant community.

He can do all of that because he won the presidential election, fair and square, and because President Obama failed to fix our broken immigration system in his eight years in office.

Democrats can complain all they want about Mr. Trump and his enforcement actions. But if they truly want to help the undocumented, they better come to the table and start negotiating with Republicans for a long-term fix.

“I wanted to share a technique today ... as I’m scrolling through my Facebook feed I see this video and it hits me. I’ve got to teach the defense against thehandshake,” says one of the members of the Relson Gracie Academia de Jiu-Jitsu in the video.

"Somebody grabs your hand and they pull you in — you’ve seen the awkwardness."

"Now I’m not suggesting you do this to the president," he added, then demonstrating the "goose neck" wrist lock he says will defend against the hand shake.

"As he grabs really hard and pulls you in, I go with it. I step in with the outside foot, I wrap around the elbow. As I do that, I’m going to block his arm from here, I bend the wrist in, the other hand wraps over the top of the knuckles and boom — now you have what we call a goose neck."

"Secret Service, I promise, if I meet the president, I probably won't wristlock him," the instructor jokes in the video.Drew Angerer/Getty Images

President Trump salutes as he boards Marine One on Thursday for the first time in his presidency as he heads to Philadelphia for the Joint GOP Issues Conference.Defense Secretary James Mattis on Friday said that NATO has President Trump's "full support" as he sought to reassure allies about the future of the transatlantic security alliance.

“President Trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to NATO,” Mattis said during his opening remarks at the Munich Security Conference before hundreds of security experts and policymakers from around the world. “He too espouses NATO’s need to adapt to today’s strategic situation for it to remain credible, capable and relevant.”

But Mattis also stressed to allies that the new administration expects them to boost defense spending and share more of the burden.

“It is a fair demand that all who benefit from the best alliance in the world carry their proportionate share of the necessary costs to defend our freedoms,” he said.

Mattis is on his first trip to Europe as Pentagon chief, a visit that's seen him work to mend relations with allies worried about Trump's stance on NATO.

During the campaign, in a July interview with The New York Times, Trump suggested that the U.S might not come to the aid of some NATO allies if they were attacked if he believed they had not been contributing their fair share.

And in a January interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper, Trump called NATO “obsolete” and criticized its counter-terrorism efforts.

The Pentagon chief, though, dropped any suggestion that the U.S. might not back its allies.

On Friday, he insisted the U.S. was committed to Europe's security.

“American security is permanently tied to the security of Europe,” he said before hundreds of security experts and policymakers from around the world.

Last week, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen called requests for increased funding “a fair demand” following her first meeting with Mattis.

In his remarks, Mattis also highlighted Europe's Baltic nations, who are increasingly fearful of Russia.

“Unified by these growing threats to our democracies, we possess strong resolve. We are going to adapt the alliance,” Mattis said.

Mattis has taken a tougher tone toward Russia than Trump, who has downplayed Russian hacking in the 2016 election and vowed to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

On Thursday, Mattis said there was "little doubt" Russia had tried to meddle in U.S. politics.

Democrats are formally asking the House Oversight Committee to look into allegations of lax cybersecurity practices in the Trump administration.

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) headed the letter, which was also signed by 14 colleagues.

The letter specifies a few different areas of concern, including reports of President Trump's continued use of an unsecure, outdated Android phone, reports that his team discussed North Korea in public at his Mar-a-Lago resort last week, photos showing that the president left keys to a briefcase “containing classified documents” in the briefcase and staffers continuing to use private email accounts for official business.

A similar case was made by Democrats on the House Science Committee this week, who used a hearing about cybersecurity to discuss Trump’s cybersecurity practices.

“Referring to the complex problem of cybersecurity, President Trump recently said in an interview, ‘I’m not sure you have the kind of security that you need.’ We fully agree," reads the letter.

Obama made the remarks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on Sunday.

The president was asked for his take on the Democratic Party, following losses across the board on Election Day. Over the summer, former President George W. Bush told a group of aides he feared he'd be the last Republican president.

In response, Obama said, "I'm not worried about being the last Democratic president — not even for a while."

In 2010, the Senate Republican leader said of his conference, "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."

He also came close to endorsing Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is being challenged for her leadership position in the House. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) jumped from relative obscurity into the spotlight this week when he launched a challenge to unseat Pelosi.

"I think Nancy Pelosi is an outstanding and historic political leader," Obama said.Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) has become the first House Republican to co-sponsor a bill calling for an independent investigation of foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Republicans have generally opposed setting up a special committee to look into Russia's hacking Democratic organizations and individuals, which President Trump has repeatedly minimized. At his press conference on Thursday, he called it a "ruse."

But Jones has a long history of bucking his leadership, so his support for the Democratic bill does not come as a surprise.

Jones signs on as the White House faces a storm of allegations relating to Russia. National security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign earlier in the week after misleading Vice President Pence about the contents of conversations he had with Russia's U.S. ambassador before Trump took office. A subsequent New York Times article claimed multiple Trump campaign aides had contact with Russia throughout the election season.

Jones, who served in the North Carolina House as a Democrat before switching parties, has a long career of taking positions against his party. Though he voted for the war in Iraq, he later became a critic. He also took a stand against rule changes that shielded former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) from ethics charges.Russia isn’t disappointed in the direction U.S.-Russia relations are heading under the Trump administration, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday, according to Reuters.

"We haven't been wearing rose-tinted glasses, we never harbored illusions, so there is nothing to be disappointed in," he said during a conference call.

Peskov pointed out that there hasn’t been extended contact between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin yet and said that the Kremlin would have to wait until the two men converse more before identifying possible areas of mutual cooperation.

"There has not yet been substantive contact between the two heads of state,” Peskov said. “It's not known when this will happen.”

“And probably only after they talk will it be clear where significant differences remain and where it is possible to discover areas for cooperation,” he added.

As a presidential candidate, Trump spoke fondly of Putin and has frequently expressed a desire to improve relations with Russia, saying that the country could be a valuable ally in the United States’ fight in Syria against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

But that call for cooperation has been marred by revelations that Russia carried out a hacking and influence campaign to aid Trump’s 2016 presidential bid. And recent reports that former national security adviser Michael Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia’s ambassador have aimed more scrutiny at Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin.

Trump on Thursday defended Flynn, who resigned earlier this week, as a “fine man” and claimed that his communications with the Russian ambassador weren't inappropriate. He also reiterated his calls to work with the Kremlin toward common goals, but complained that the media is undermining his ability to negotiate with Putin.Sen.

AT&T, Time Warner defend deal Top union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race MORE (I-Vt.) is rolling out legislation to bolster Social Security payments and make high-income earners pay more into the retirement system.

"Anyone who tells you Social Security is going broke is lying,” Sanders said. “We can increase Social Security benefits for millions of Americans and extend the life of Social Security if we have the political will to tell the wealthiest Americans to pay the same rate as everyone else.”

The legislation would increase Social Security benefits by about $1,300 annually for seniors who make less than $16,000, while boosting the amount of taxes paid by high-income earners by subjecting incomes above $250,000 to payroll taxes.

ADVERTISEMENT Sanders argued that his proposal has an "overwhelming majority" of support in both parties, pointing to an Oct. 2016 Public Policy Polling survey that found that 72 percent of Americans support increasing the entitlement program.

Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) is introducing a House version of the bill.

Social Security's trust fund is currently expected to be solvent through 2034, after which it is expected to only be able to pay roughly 79 percent of benefits.

Sanders's legislation would extend its solvency through 2078, according to a report from the Social Security Administration. The legislation would also increase monthly payments for most beneficiaries by $43 per month starting at age 80 and $73 at age 90, according to a breakdown of the bill from Sanders's office.Fox News anchor Shepard Smith on Thursday criticized President Trump for bashing reporters gathered at a lengthy Thursday press conference, calling on him to answer legitimate questions from news outlets.

"(Trump) keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we're some kind of fools for asking the question. Really?" Smith said. "Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening and we're fools for asking the questions?"

Trump was repeatedly asked by reporters from different publications about reported conversations between his campaign aides and Russian officials. Trump blasted such stories as "fake news" and berated journalists.

"Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media," he said at one point.

Trump maintained that he is not aware that any of his campaign aides had any improper communications with Russian officials.

"No sir," Smith continued. "We are not fools for asking this question, and we demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the American people. Your supporters will support you either way. If your people were on the phone, what were they saying? We have a right to know, we absolutely do and that you call us fake news and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential. The people deserve an answer to this question at very least."

Smith also defended CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who pressed Trump for answers on several points. Acosta and Trump have frequently sparred at past press conferences. Thursday Trump said he was upgrading CNN from "fake news" to "very fake news."

Smith defended Acosta during the segment Thursday, calling him "an accomplished reporter, a guy I've never met, but a good reporter."

Jim Acosta thanked Smith for his defense in a tweet shortly after the segment aired.

Thanks @ShepNewsTeam https://t.co/s6oeo2AINy — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 16, 2017

During Thursday's press conference, Acosta told Trump, "Just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you," as he prefaced his question for the president.

Trump shot back, “Ask [CNN President] Jeff Zucker how he got his job, OK?” adding that CNN’s ratings aren’t “good right now.”A GOP lawmaker escorted by police from a town hall meeting in his Northern California district over the weekend says he will continue to hold open town hall meetings at home.

"I'm not going to stop meeting with my constituents because a disruptive element has emerged in the body politic," Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said in an interview with The Hill's Molly K. Hooper.

McClintock was one of several Republican lawmakers to face taunts at recent constituent events held in their respective districts.

ADVERTISEMENT

Democrats seized on the headlines of such incidents, comparing them to the Tea Party movement starting in 2009, a comparison McClintock and fellow Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) dispute.

"This seems like political operatives have been hired, websites set up, on-the-ground dispatches and so forth — it seems highly coordinated compared to the organic nature of a Tea Party," Roskam, who also faced rowdy crowds, said.

Veteran Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) explained that the Tea Party heated up during the summer of 2009 as then-President Barack Obama pressed for overhaul of the healthcare system and environmental regulations.

"This began literally the day after the election and [the Tea Party supporters] were coming out to actually oppose policies ... It wasn't nearly as organized as this is," Cole said, noting that "people are allowed to exercise their constitutional right but, I don't think it helps you when it degenerates into violence or shouting."

For his part, McClintock says he's going to be doing "a lot more security planning ... and get much bigger venues" as precautions for his future town hall meetings.

"He's someone who understands the world. He understands the threats of radical Islamic terrorism," Cruz told CNN's Manu Raju. "He understands the threats of an over-aggressive [Russian President Vladimir] Putin."

"And at the same, I think he has demonstrated an understanding that we should be reluctant to use military force. That we should do so only when absolutely necessary."

Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who served as President George W. Bush's ambassador to the U.N., has also been a rumored pick for deputy secretary of State.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito administered the oath of office to Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. President Trump and Vice President Pence, who have sworn in most of the previous Cabinet officials, are both out of town.

The swearing-in ceremony came hours after the Senate voted 52-46 , mostly along party lines, to confirm Pruitt, capping off a frequently contentious nomination process.

ADVERTISEMENT The agency has 15,000 employees around the country and is responsible for enforcing laws on air, water and ground pollution, as well as numerous others.

To Republicans, Pruitt represented in a nominee exactly what the EPA needs: A leader who will roll back Obama’s aggressive environmental agenda and give states more power to enforce environmental laws.

Democrats said that Pruitt’s litigious history with the EPA shows that he does not support its mission. They also pushed to delay his vote pending the release of emails between he and his staff at the attorney general’s office and industry.

Sources say that Trump is planning to visit the EPA soon and sign a number of executive orders concerning regulations and other priorities he would like to get started with at the agency. Inside EPA first reported on the orders earlier this week.

Pruitt is planning to address EPA employees at the agency’s headquarters Tuesday.The Department of Homeland Security is funding new research to counter a type of cyberattack that brought down Twitter, PayPal and other websites last year.

The attacks, known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, work when hackers send a massive amount of web traffic to a site, rendering it unable to function. DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate announced Thursday that its cybersecurity division is funding several research projects to counter these attacks.

In October, hackers blocked users from accessing popular websites including Twitter, PayPal, and Spotify by launching DDoS attacks targeting Dyn, an internet performance management company used by those websites. The attacks affected millions of users.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to DHS, there has been an “exponential increase” in the intensity and frequency of these attacks over the past six months as a result of hackers using malware to turn computer systems into “bots” and creating “botnet armies” to wage DDoS attacks.

“The goal of the DDoS project is to build effective and easily implemented network defenses and promote adoption of best practices by the private sector to bring about an end to the scourge of DDoS attacks,” said Daniel Massey, who is managing the cybersecurity research project.

“Our performers are developing exciting new defense approaches that will help organizations defend against very large-scale DDoS attacks,” Massey said.

The DHS project aims to slow the growth of attacks and improve defense networks against them. It will also address other denial of service attacks including those aimed at emergency management systems, like 911.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump Senate confirms Pruitt to lead EPA MORE (R-Ky.) said Friday that while he likes the actions the Trump administration is taking, he's not as enthused about the president's penchant for tweeting.

"I've been pretty candid with him and all of you that I'm not a fan of the daily tweets," he told reporters during a press conference on Friday.

Asked if he thought President Trump was taking Republicans off message, McConnell said he's not a "fan of the extra discussion that he likes to engage in."

ADVERTISEMENT But McConnell stressed that he liked the early actions taken by the Trump administration and praised Trump's Cabinet selections.

Trump's constant stream of tweets has at times created headaches for GOP lawmakers, who have spent months fielding questions from reporters over his social media remarks.

McConnell noted repeatedly during the presidential campaign that he wished Trump would "stick to the script."

The Senate GOP leader and the president are in some ways a study in opposites. While Trump uses the bully pulpit and Twitter to weigh in on numerous topics at any hour, McConnell is well known for his rigid message discipline.

McConnell's press conference comes less than a day after Trump held a freewheeling presser in which he lashed out at the media, once more talked about his Electoral College margin of victory and defended his administration as a "fine-tuned machine."

McConnell declined to comment on Trump's press conference on Friday, telling reporters, "I don't have any observation about that."From Ricardo Alfaro

For the first time in history, Puerto Rico has been handed a blueprint by the U.S. Congress that enables the territory to push an aggressive federal agenda to address its long-term economic burdens. The Congressional Task Force Report on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico includes the name of the program, agency, congressional committee and description of the differential treatment in Puerto Rico. Until now, the way that the federal strategy usually worked was by untangling programs designed to help the economic and social well-being of the over 3.4 million American citizens living in the island. This time a congressional report provides a clear path from pages 95 to 125. The report was published on Dec. 20, 2016.

Only three bills that have been formally introduced in the House of Representatives: the “Puerto Rico Admission Act” (H.R. 260), the “Puerto Rico Medicare Part B Equality Act” (H.R. 261) and a bill “[t]o prevent the territories of the United States from losing current Medicaid funding” (H.R. 259). This doesn’t even come to near half of the alternatives described in the Congressional Task Force Report. Given this outlook and the ongoing economic crisis on the island, it makes one ask: What are we waiting for?

During the election cycle, the state chairwoman of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party and newly elected representative from Puerto Rico admitted her influence over the Republican agenda. She sits on three committees: Energy and Commerce, Natural Resources, and Ways and Means. Two of these committees have jurisdiction over one of the hottest issues being addressed in Congress: the future of ObamaCare. Although as resident commissioner she is barred from a floor vote, this is not the same case as a committee vote. In other words: yes, she does have an inherent influence on the Republican agenda over issues that affect ongoing federally funded programs, such as healthcare, which are on the verge of collapse in Puerto Rico. But again, it makes one ask: What is she waiting for?

If the agenda exists, if we already know which door to knock on in Congress, and if Puerto Rico truly has the influence in a Republican-controlled federal government, what are we waiting for? The clock is ticking.

Alexandria, Va.

The 9th Circuit's position will stand

From Earl Beal

Media talking heads continue to search for an answer of what will happen to the president’s executive order enjoining immigration authorities to temporarily halt foreign nationals from entering the United States.

The 9th Circuit will uphold the Seattle federal district court judge’s dictum. The government will then appeal to the Supreme Court.

The high court’s current configuration will not change, given these Democrats’ childish tantrums, until at least April. In the meantime, the court’s rendering will be along these current justices’ party and philosophical lines. Such will come down 4-4.

The case will be remanded back to the 9th for further consideration, perhaps with variously nuanced adjustments to the district court judge’s opinion. But in the totality of this circumstance, the circuit court will vacate the original intent of the president’s order.

In theory, such a decision should apply only to those states within the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, yet the way things are so convoluted nowadays in this country, the order to abrogate the president’s executive order will be applied nationwide.

And, sadly, America’s national security will be forced to take a back seat to the incessantly sickening usage and application of this 21st century’s popularized abstraction known as “political correctness.”

Terre Haute, Ind.A meeting between congressional Hispanic Democrats and the Trump administration's top immigration enforcement officer was canceled abruptly Tuesday in the wake of national immigration raids that have roiled Latino leaders.

Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Tuesday that he would not be attending the meeting, according to CHC aides.

CHC Chairwoman Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.) and Homan had a phone call at 2 p.m. to discuss the cancellation. The CHC is expected to hold a press conference later Tuesday.

An ICE representative speaking on background said the CHC added attendants to the meeting last minute, forcing the agency to reschedule to comply with House rules.

ADVERTISEMENT

CHC staff said a larger, bipartisan meeting was not a reasonable replacement for the canceled sit-down because it would shield Homan from directly facing members who represent the constituency most affected by ICE raids.

"It's more of the same from the Trump administration," said an aide.

Hundreds of immigrants have been arrested in ICE raids in at least six states over the past week, in what the administration has called an effort to deport dangerous criminal aliens.

But Hispanic leaders have argued that large-scale raids are not targeted enforcement and unnecessarily round-up undocumented immigrants who are not dangerous criminals.

President Trump last month signed an executive order calling for construction to begin on his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The wall was one of Trump’s signature campaign promises, and he vowed Mexico would pay for it.

Another order issued last month ended the “catch and release” policy, which allowed people who crossed the border to return to Mexico without detention. The order also expanded the definition of “criminal alien” to include individuals who have entered the U.S. without authorization.

The Department of Homeland Security on Monday said of the 680 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week, 75 percent were “criminal aliens.”

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has asked for a meeting with ICE officials to discuss the raids, arguing they "have struck fear in the hearts of the immigrant community.”Shinny! Fudge! Son of a buck! Judas Priest!

When those exclamations echoed through the halls of the second floor of the U.S. Capitol you knew Bob Michel was upset.

ADVERTISEMENT

He was a man of incredible calm, of combat-tested self-discipline. His Midwestern values prevented him from cursing or speaking ill of his fellow man or breaking his word or violating the bonds of family and friends. He couldn’t even gesture with his middle finger. He would raise three digits and make you read between the lines.

So the outbursts were rare. He found it easy to smile, easy to forgive and he was “awe shucks” humble right up until he, as he would describe it, shuffled off his mortal coil in the early morning of Friday at the age of 93.

Michel lived one of the most incredible lives of any American, not because of luck or happenstance, opportunism or narcissistic ambition like some of his fellow travelers in politics and governance.

He did it the old-fashioned way. He earned it from mowing lawns as a youth to his heroism on the battlefields of Europe in World War II, to his devotion to country in what became a lifetime of public service in the House of Representatives, and his devotion to his family.

The qualities that made him a terrific human being and a great legislator propelled him into national leadership, but ultimately led to his retirement from public service in 1994.

Former House GOP leader Bob Michel dies at 93 https://t.co/dy8NuT9qBg pic.twitter.com/jy62KuKERo — The Hill (@thehill) February 17, 2017

His critics said he was too nice, too accommodating, and not partisan enough. He was a better practitioner of governance than politics. He may have encouraged those perceptions with his favorite pastimes. He was a devoted gardener, who loved music, golf and the Chicago Cubs. I always thought it funny that this politician’s favorite song was Send in the Clowns. Oddly enough, it was only on the golf course that I ever saw him lose his temper.

Michel, however, had guts (he called it intestinal fortitude) far in excess of his detractors. He was measured but not meek. He compromised but never really capitulated. There’s a difference.

Robert Henry Michel (true French pronunciation Michelle) grew up in Peoria, the son of European immigrants, his father French and his mother, German. He learned to speak both French and German, which he used to convince German soldiers to surrender on a battlefield in Belgium.

Michel went to Peoria public schools, then to the Army’s Ninth Infantry Regiment, which landed in Normandy and fought its way through the Battle of the Bulge, where he was severely wounded. He spent months in the hospital and lost most of his hearing.

He came home, was graduated from Bradley University and married Corrine Woodruff, who he met in the choir. He was destined to become a life insurance salesman before Bradley’s president recommended him to Congressman Harold Velde, who needed an administrative aide. Michel took the job and the rest is history.

Michel was one of the unsung heroes of the Reagan revolution. The Reagan agenda, or at least major chunks of it would not have survived had it not been for Michel’s stewardship in the House.

He and his legislative tactician, Bill Pitts, set up a war room to successfully combat Hillarycare, the precursor to Obamacare, and produced Republican health care alternatives shaped and introduced by Congressman Mike Bilirakis.

Michel led on NAFTA and tax reform, defense, criminal justice reform, Social Security and spending cuts.

He took the helm of one of the most dynamic leadership teams in history, the likes of Jack Kemp, future HUD secretary and candidate for Vice President; Dick Cheney, future Defense Secretary and Vice President; Trent Lott, future Senate Majority leader; Lynn Martin, future Labor Secretary; Guy VanderJagt, one of the architects of the eventual Republican majority; Jerry Lewis, future Appropriations Chairman; and Mickey Edwards, future author and scholar, all of whom marched to different drummers.

Also among their ranks were the talented and tenacious young turks, Newt Gingrich, Bob Walker, John Boehner John BoehnerFormer House leader Bob Michel, a person and politician for the ages Former House GOP leader Bob Michel dies at 93 Keystone pipeline builder signs lobbyist MORE and Vin Weber. Another giant occupied the White House and another, Howard Baker, ran the Senate, followed soon after by another shrinking violet, Bob Dole. There hasn’t been anything like it since.

Michel’s mission throughout the Reagan and Bush years was turning ideas into laws. He was good at it. He knew how to reach consensus with people with whom he disagreed. He knew how to earn trust and keep it.

His most important attribute was his ability to listen. He knew how important it was to keep the ego in check. Michel never worried about who got the credit for what he did or helped get done.

When it came to partisan politics, Michel was a die-hard, dyed in the wool, dead to rights traditional Barry Goldwater conservative Republican. But he lit his partisan way with candles while more and more of his colleagues were using flame-throwers. Personal attacks on adversaries, a practice becoming more popular, just violated his core, made him put his head in his hands. He just couldn’t do it.

Crossing from one century to another, Bob’s personal nature, his political instincts, and his deep devotion to good governance came and went. The current environment was foreign to him.

However, he believed unequivocally in the durability and transcendence of Congress as an institution, as the First Branch of Government, second to none, including the presidency.

I suspect that Bob Michel’s time will come again. It will have to if we are to survive as a great, unique experiment in self-government and a society that is both civil and free.

It will come. It’s just too bad the Leader won’t be here to see it. Such a shame.

Thank God, the Cubs finally won a World Series before Bob went home.

Mike Johnson is a former journalist, who worked on the Ford White House staff and served as press secretary and chief of staff to House Republican Leader Bob Michel, prior to entering the private sector. He is co-author of a book, Surviving Congress, a guide for congressional staff. He is currently a principal with the OB-C Group.

The letter, not public but obtained by The Hill, is written by AT&T Executive Vice President for Federal Relations Tim McKone and Time Warner Senior Vice President of Global Public Policy Steve Vest. They say the merger would allow the combined company to offer cheaper and more robust services to their consumers.

“The merger will allow us to offer customers more attractive bundles of broadband and video services, prodding cable companies and other competitors to respond by improving their own services,” it states. “And the merger will further incentivize AT&T and other wireless carriers to deploy lightning-fast 5G wireless technology faster and deeper in their networks.”

The merger has come under criticism from President Trump and liberal Democratic senators.

In their letter replying to those concerns, the company executives defended the current process in which the Department of Justice is solely responsible for assessing the deal.

“The Department of Justice will thoroughly scrutinize this transaction after receiving input from a vast range of market participants, government agencies, and public interest groups,” they wrote.

“Congress entrusted the Department with broad merger-review authority to protect the public's interest in competitive markets.”

Franken responded to the letter in a Facebook post Friday afternoon, saying that it did not reassure him.

"While I'm glad they responded to me, their letter does little to address my concerns and essentially asks American consumers to trust that the combined company won’t engage in anticompetitive behavior, raise prices, violate the principles of net neutrality, or decrease access to diverse voices," Franken wrote

"But we’ve seen some of these behaviors before—both as a result of past mega-mergers and straight from AT&T itself. So if I’m being honest, nothing in their letter eases my very serious concerns that this deal will lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for you," he added.

Franken and other Democrats had voiced skepticism at a December hearing that the merger would actually benefit the public.

Trump has also publicly spoken out against the deal.

On the campaign trail, he blasted it as too much power in the hands of too few.

But in a January interview with Axios, he softened his stance slightly, saying that he hasn’t “seen any of the facts” of the merger, while also noting that he had “been on the record in the past of saying it's too big and we have to keep competition.”

Industry experts expect the vertical merger to be approved, but have noted that there is still uncertainty because of Trump's expressed positions.

"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" he wrote.

He had posted and then quickly deleted a slightly different version of the tweet just a few minutes earlier, which omitted ABC and CBS. He also included the word "SICK!" at the end of the original post.

The tweet came one day after Trump held an adversarial and lengthy news conference, in which he berated the media as "very fake news” and dismissed news reports about his and his associates’ ties to Russia as a “ruse.”

About an hour later, he posted a second tweet criticizing the media's coverage of the press conference.

"'One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!' says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA calls it differently! Dishonest," Trump wrote.

Trump has long had an antagonistic relationship with the press, and often labels news stories he sees as unfavorable as “fake news.” Trump’s campaign issued a survey to supporters on Friday, asking them to gauge the trustworthiness of the media.

The news outlets singled out in Trump’s Friday afternoon tweet are not new targets for the president. He has often lambasted CNN and The New York Times, referring to them as “failing” and out of touch with voters.

In a rare interview with The New York Times last month, Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon, the former chair of the far-right Breitbart News, called reporters the “opposition party” and said “the media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.”

“They don’t understand this country,” Bannon said. “They still do not understand why Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE is the president of the United States.”

Trump echoed Bannon’s comments shortly after, telling “The Brody File” that “the media is the opposition party in many ways.”

- Updated at 7:16 p.m.A small African government that was affected by the Trump administration's original travel ban has hired a lobbying and public affairs firm in Washington.

Glover Park Group is working for the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, a breakaway region that declared its independence from Somalia in 1991.

It is not, however, internationally recognized as a separate country and is still seeking that recognition.

New documents posted to the Justice Department website, and signed on Feb. 14, show that Glover Park Group will “act as an advisor to the foreign principal on communications and government relations matters” for Somaliland.

The services provided by the firm for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be a part of Somaliland’s bilateral relations with the United States, forms say.

One day before the contract with Glover Park Group appeared in government disclosure databases, the Somaliland government wrote a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.

In that letter, the government asked for an exemption from an executive order signed by President Trump temporarily banning travel from seven countries with Muslim-majority populations: Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Iran, Sudan and Somalia.

Trump is poised to rescind that order next week and issue a revised order that can stand up in court. The details are not yet known.

It is the second foreign government covered by the travel ban to turn to K Street lobbying firms in roughly as many weeks. Iraq hired Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck at the end of January, but the details of that contract were not specific either.

Somaliland, its foreign minister, Sa'ad Ali Shire, wrote, does not have “deteriorating conditions … [that] due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States” that are described by the order.

The breakaway region fought to obtain independence from Somalia and succeeded after the overthrow of Somali military dictator Siad Barre 26 years ago.

Now, it strives to maintain a peaceful reputation, especially in comparison to its Somali neighbor to the south, which is battling the extremist group al-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaeda.

The autonomous region is not recognized as its own nation by any country in the world.

Somaliland has its own parliament and president, trained military and police forces, currency and flag. It also has a population of about 3.5 million people, according to the BBC.

There is also a boarding school in Somaliland that has sent dozens of students to high-profile American universities, including Harvard, Yale and MIT, in the last several years, according to CNN.

Students with Somaliland passports risk being banned from entry into the United States if Trump enacts a similar travel prohibition affecting the same seven countries.

An exception for Somaliland would show “that strong and responsible governance provides a foundation upon which America’s partners can secure progress for their citizens and contribute to shared international objectives,” reads the letter from Shire.

The contract with Glover Park Group has not yet been finalized, disclosures say, so there is no specifics about how much the firm is being paid or for how long the contract will last. The firm did not respond to emails for comment.

Glover Park Group has other foreign government clients, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and a communications firm in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that advises, and is paid by, the government.The last Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator under President Obama on Friday warned her Republican successor against undoing the agency’s climate and environmental work.

In a statement after the Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, Gina McCarthy Gina McCarthyObama EPA chief: Pruitt must uphold ‘law and science’ Overnight Energy: Congress does away with Obama coal mining rule GOP suspends rules to push through EPA pick despite Dem boycott MORE said she is watching his “every action very closely to ensure the Trump Administration upholds science and the law, respects its dedicated public servants and builds on the agency's long track record of protecting public health and the environment.”

ADVERTISEMENT

She added, “Now is not the time to rollback the agency's work or weaken our long held protections, it's time to work hand-in-hand with states, local communities and tribes to protect the most vulnerable among us and create the jobs of the future.”

McCarthy was one of Obama’s chief allies in his push to combat climate change in the closing years of his presidency.

While she was administrator, the EPA released several of its most sweeping environmental rules, from the Clean Power Plan limits on power plant pollution to methane restrictions at drilling sites and a rule expanding federal jurisdiction over water.

Republicans opposed most of those measures. During the campaign, President Trump often said he would undo much Obama’s climate work, and Pruitt is expected to help him do so.

Shortly after she left the EPA at the end of Obama’s term, McCarthy said she hadn’t met with Pruitt to discuss his plans for running the agency. The Senate confirmed Pruitt on a 52-46 vote on Friday. Only two Democrats supported his nomination, and one Republican opposed him.

“The need for clean air, water and land does not go out of style and is not limited to any one party,” McCarthy said in her statement. “My hope is when Mr. Pruitt heads to EPA, he fully understands the grave responsibility of the agency he now leads and upholds it remarkably important and timeless work.”Throughout the presidential campaign, Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE repeated a particular line of attack against Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonMark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game The latest scheme in the left’s war on Trump Local broadcast news knows America better than cable MORE over and over, with great impact. Her decades of experience and grasp of policy nuances were irrelevant; when placed in a position of trust, she had exercised poor judgment and could not be afforded that opportunity again as commander in chief. With the selection of retired Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser, however, Trump showed that he, too, was prone to egregious lapses in judgment. Now, with Flynn resigning in the wake of escalating leaks about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, the country is learning just how bad this judgment call was Trump so early in his presidency.

It’s easy to forget that Flynn once had a laudable and respected military career. Becoming a 3-star general is not an accomplishment for the faint of heart and takes decades of service and persistence to achieve. Flynn played significant roles in the intelligence arena, particularly during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He had seeming bipartisan political approval and served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama.

ADVERTISEMENT

That, however, is where things appear to have gone off the rails. Maybe it was “mission fatigue” after three decades of military service. Maybe it was hubris. Maybe it was plain old arrogance. Whatever the reason, Flynn became erratic, struggled to manage the DIA’s sprawling bureaucracy and developed a penchant for relying upon erroneous factual information. He even began brazenly flouting his agency’s own security rules that he personally deemed “stupid” but which he nonetheless continued to impose upon the rest of his employees. He was forced into retirement in 2014.

During the presidential campaign, Flynn hitched his comeback bid to Trump. Flynn and Trump shared a lot of the same “black and white” views of the world, particularly with respect to the threat of jihadist terrorism. They shared the same disdain for what they saw as the Obama administration’s restrained and “politically correct” approach to countering threats from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria abroad and self-radicalized threats within the United States. They both reveled in the “lock her up” chants directed toward Clinton and her sloppy handling of her email communications while serving as secretary of State.

When Trump was elected, however, it would have been understandable if he had chosen to push Flynn to the bench. Controversies surrounding Flynn’s ties to Russia were already well known. There was video of him in 2015 sitting at a table with Vladimir Putin at a celebration for the Russian president, an event for which Flynn was paid to attend. The private consulting firm he had led after leaving the military had eyebrow-raising ties to the Turkish government. Flynn was a wild card, much like other Trump campaign surrogates that were pushed aside after the campaign, and it would have made sense for Trump to pass on placing Flynn in a sensitive government position. Trump did so anyway, making Flynn his national security adviser — a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

At the time, the choice merely seemed controversial and risky. Now, however, we know that the Trump administration appears to have deliberately kept in a position of authority a man the intelligence community had explicitly warned was compromised by the Russian government. In a bombshell report, The Washington Post has revealed that the White House was warned by the Justice Department that Flynn had misled them, particularly then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence Mike (Michael) Richard PencePence tells Europe: We will ‘hold Russia accountable’ Dem senator: 'This is not the presidency we were promised' Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump MORE, about the nature of the phone calls Flynn had with the Russian government around the same time that the Obama administration was imposing new sanctions. Flynn had reassured Pence and the transition team that the calls never touched upon the issue of sanctions, something that was restated in public by the Trump transition team repeatedly for weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration.

The intelligence community knew better and wanted the White House to know about it. Intelligence intercepts picked up the calls Flynn had with the Russians, the contents of which proved Flynn’s claims to be false. The Justice Department notified the White House counsel at the end of January that Flynn had misled the White House and was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail as a result.

Trump now had his moment to exercise the type of judgment he felt Clinton had failed to utilize at State. Two weeks were allowed to pass, however, with no action taken against Flynn. He maintained his access to classified information and remained involved in sensitive national security matters, including coordinating a response to the recent missile test by the North Korean government. The White House continued until just recently to maintain that Flynn’s original story was accurate.

It was only within the last 72 hours, as media leaks exposed what the White House already knew, that Flynn’s job was finally in jeopardy. Flynn offered his resignation and Trump accepted, a choice that was correct to make. It was a choice, however, that Trump should have made two weeks ago. When it comes to exercising good judgment, the president failed his own test miserably.

Conway continued to defend Trump's Twitter use as a way to reach his "25 million followers."

Watch the video above to learn what is on tap for Capitol Hill this week.A group of Senate Democrats want to roll back President Trump's executive order on deportation in the wake of a string high-profile immigration raids.

Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.),(Ill.) and(Hawaii) introduced legislation Thursday to rescind the order, which includes guidelines for prioritizing the deportation of "criminal" undocumented immigrants.

Cortez Masto accused the Trump administration of creating an "unprecedented deportation machine."

"The president's executive order sends a clear message to our immigrant families: You are a target for deportation," she said at press conference with immigrant groups opposed to the order.

Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly defended the arrests earlier this week, noting that roughly 75 percent of the 680 undocumented immigrants arrested were "criminal aliens."

The legislation would also undo Trump's crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities," which don't follow federal immigration law.

Under the new order, the Trump administration expanded the definition of “criminal alien” to include individuals who entered the country without authorization, which was originally considered a misdemeanor offense.

Immigrants who have "committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense" are now priorities under the order, even if they have not yet been convicted.

Top Democrats and outside groups have decried the recent string of raids, arguing they are sparking fear in the Hispanic community.

Durbin argued on Thursday that the change threatens millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the country.

"[They] are currently living in the United States with no threat to our country, no criminal record, with strong families," he said.

It’s the first bill newly elected Nevadan Cortez Masto has sponsored.

Reports emerged over the weekend that ICE officials had conducted raids in several cities, though an exact number of arrests was not disclosed. The Department of Homeland Security said the operations were "consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by" immigration enforcement teams "on a daily basis."

Trump took a hard line on immigration during his presidential campaign pledging to deport roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.

But he appeared to soften that stance more recently, saying he would reach a "deal" on undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children and focus on immigrants with criminal records.

He also defended his policies during a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week, pledging he would step up his effort to deport "criminal" aliens.

“I said we will get the criminals out — the drug lords, the gang members — we're getting them out,” Trump said.

But Daniel Ramirez Medina, a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, was detained this week by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials when they showed up at his house to arrest Ramirez's father.

Medina filed a lawsuit against the administration on Wednesday, arguing it violated his Fith Amendment rights by failing to adhere to the terms of DACA.

On Thursday, immigrants and activists in several cities planned “Day Without Immigrants” protests to speak out against Trump’s executive actions on immigrants.

“Many of those people are very impatient with me because they don't think I'm pure. For example, they think I should be voting against all of Trump's nominees and of course I'm judging each nominee on its own merit," she said.

In her Thursday interview, McCaskill took aim at her own party, saying that the Democrats haven’t listened to the concerns of voters “that fundamentally think Washington, D.C., is not paying any attention to their needs.”

More ideologically stringent party members have pushed Senate Democrats to reject Trump’s Cabinet nominees and Supreme Court pick on the spot, McCaskill said. Among the 13 Cabinet picks that have been confirmed so far, McCaskill has voted in favor of seven and against five. She said she hadn’t yet decided how she will vote on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.

"As of today it's about half and half of the ones I've voted no on and the ones I've voted yes on and I'm making an individual decision based on merit on each one," McCaskill said. "That's not good enough for some of these folks who want me to be just against Trump everywhere.”Democrats were immediately skeptical of President Trump on Thursday when he suggested he may try to keep one of the most controversial programs of his predecessor: the temporary legalization of undocumented immigrants brought to the country as kids.

"I have absolutely no reason to believe anything that comes out of his mouth or anything that he tweets," said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's campaign arm.

During a frenetic press conference in the White House Thursday, the president said he's agonizing over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program because he's torn between following "very rough" deportation laws and helping "incredible kids" who benefit from DACA.

At one point he suggested he supports the continuation of the program but needs some time to convince the congressional critics — virtually all of them Republicans — of its merits.

ADVERTISEMENT "We're gonna deal with DACA with heart," Trump said when asked of the program's future. "I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right."

Trump claimed some of the youngsters enrolled in DACA, also called "dreamers," are "gang members" and "drug dealers," suggesting there's plenty of room to improve the screening process. "But," he was quick to add, "you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly.

"It's a very, very tough subject."

Democrats were immediately dubious.

They're already up in arms over a recent series of enforcement operations, conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which have led to the arrests of almost 700 undocumented immigrants in cities around the country — one of whom had twice enrolled in DACA.

And after meeting with ICE's acting director on Thursday, they have little faith that Trump will adopt anything but a hard-line approach to enforcement.

"It was hard to not leave that meeting and believe that the Trump administration is going to target as many immigrants as possible," Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) said. "The only hesitation they seemed to have was whether they would go after DACA recipients."

Asked if Trump's recent comments lend any bit of hope, Cárdenas was terse.

"No, because I don't believe a word Donald Trump says," he said.

Created by President Obama in 2012, DACA offers high-achieving undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before the age of 16 permission to work without fear of deportation. Supporters, including most Democrats, have hailed the initiative as a commonsense way to ensure the limited ICE resources target only violent criminals and those who pose a safety threat.

But Republicans have long railed against the program, accusing Obama of acting unilaterally to grant "amnesty" to illegal immigrants in a manner that sidestepped Congress and defied the Constitution, a message Trump adopted on the campaign trail. As a candidate, he vowed to terminate the program on "day one."

But on Thursday, the president sounded a different tone. He said DACA is "one of the most difficult subjects" he's confronting.

"It's a very difficult thing for me because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and, you know, the law is rough," Trump said.

"I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law, is very rough," he added. "It's very, very rough."Top Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee are calling on their Republican colleagues to investigate national security adviser Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the panel's ranking member, said the full committee should probe Flynn’s ties to Russia and whether Flynn promised to help roll back sanctions on Russia during the December phone call that led to his firing.

“The conduct engaged in by the former National Security Advisor is another example of why this Administration must be held to account for its actions,” wrote Waters in a Wednesday letter to committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) and the chairmen of the panel’s subcommittees. “The Americans had substantial concerns about Trump’s ties to Russia, and this most recent event only serves to validate them.”

Waters letter was cosigned by the top Democrats on the panel’s subcommittees.

Flynn was fired by President Trump this week after misleading White House officials, including Vice President Pence, about calls he made to Russia’s ambassador to the United States prior to Trump's inauguration. Lawmakers from both parties and chambers have called for various committees, probes and briefings to investigate Flynn’s relationship with Russia.

The Financial Services Committee has some oversight jurisdiction over the implementation of United States financial sanctions and efforts to stop terrorism financing. Waters said the committee’s purview in those fields is relevant to investigating Flynn’s calls to Russia.

“We are deeply concerned the previously undisclosed communications General Flynn had with Russia indicate a potential quid pro quo arrangement whereby he made commitments on behalf of the Trump Administration to lift sanctions imposed by former President Obama, either in turn for interfering in the election or for some other potential benefit,” wrote Waters.

Flynn told the FBI that he didn’t discuss sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, contradicting evidence gathered by U.S. intelligence agencies, according to The Washington Post.The Washington Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that a florist who refused to provide flowers to a gay couple violated a state law that bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

In a unanimous ruling, the nine members of the court sided with a gay couple from Kennewick, Wash., who sued a local florist for discrimination. The florist, a devout Southern Baptist, told the couple she could not provide flowers for their wedding because of her religious beliefs.

The florist, Barronelle Stutzman, said she believes participating in or allowing her employees to participate in same-sex weddings by providing flowers would be condoning same-sex marriage, counter to her religious beliefs. A lower court judge sided with the couple and fined Stutzman $1,001 in penalties.

Stutzman appealed, marking the first time the nondiscrimination law reached the state Supreme Court in Olympia. “Discrimination based on same-sex marriage constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,” Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud wrote for the court. The court said the state’s anti-discrimination law does not unduly burden the florist’s free exercise of religion.

Gay rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued on behalf of the couple, hailed the ruling as a win for nondiscrimination ordinances that have passed in 19 states.

“This was a reasonable application of a state non-discrimination law. It’s consistent with the way that states and frankly the federal government have applied non-discrimination law across time,” said Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign.

But religious conservatives said the ruling trampled on Stutzman’s right to religious expression.

“The Washington State Supreme Court’s ruling tramples on our nation’s long-held tradition of respecting the freedom of Americans to follow their deeply held beliefs, especially when it comes to participating in activities and ceremonies that so many Americans consider sacred,” said Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council. “The time to protect religious freedom is now.”

Stutzman could appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, though her attorneys did not immediately say whether they would continue the case.

The verdict comes as legislatures in Republican-dominated states consider new measures that would allow businesses, and in some cases government agencies, to refuse service to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

States including Texas, Kentucky, Missouri and South Carolina are considering legislation that would prohibit cities or counties from requiring private entities to allow transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. States including Virginia, Oklahoma, Illinois and Alabama are considering bills that would allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, such as in situations similar to the Washington case.

More than 70 pieces of legislation dealing with discrimination ordinances have been introduced in nearly two dozen states, according to the Human Rights Campaign.Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) is urging President Trump to take actions to prevent immigrants in the country illegally from claiming the child tax credit.

“Most Americans are astonished to learn that each year billions of taxpayer dollars are given out to people who are in our country illegally,” Messer said in a news release. “This is just one example of how our broken tax and immigration systems continue to incentivize immigrants to come here illegally. It’s long past time to change it.”

The request from Messer — a member of the House GOP leadership team who is eyeing a Senate run in 2018 — comes as Trump has made tax reform and curbing illegal immigration two of his top priorities. Trump has already issued executive orders to direct federal agencies to start work on a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to strengthen immigration enforcement.

The child tax credit benefits low- and middle-income families. Families that have a greater credit amount than tax liability can get a refund for the difference.

Under current law, taxpayers do not have to have Social Security numbers to claim the credit on their returns, though they can only claim the credit for dependents who are U.S. citizens, nationals and alien residents. A 2011 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that people who weren't authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable child tax credits during the 2010 tax-processing year.

Messer has introduced legislation that would bar taxpayers who don't have Social Security numbers from claiming the child tax credit. In a letter sent to Trump on Saturday, he asked Trump to take executive actions to prevent undocumented immigrants from getting the credits while Congress works on passing his bill.

Messer asked Trump to take steps to bar the IRS from allowing individuals without Social Security numbers that are valid for employment from claiming the credit. He also asked Trump to have the Office of Management and Budget designate the credit "as a high priority program to subject the program to greater levels of oversight and review in an attempt to reduce the volume of improper payments made by the program."

Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee approved on a party-line vote legislation to require Social Security numbers for taxpayers claiming the refundable child tax credit. Democrats opposed the measure, saying that the bill would hurt 3 million children, most of whom are citizens with undocumented parents.The Air Force general managing the Pentagon’s program for F-35 fighter jets, built by Lockheed Martin, confirmed Thursday that the CEO of rival Boeing participated in a call with him and President Trump prior to the inauguration.

Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan said no decisions were made on the Jan. 17 call and said it was his understanding that Trump was trying to get more information about both the F-35 and Boeing programs, including the new Air Force One fleet and the F-18 Super Hornet.

“It’s important to understand that the discussions that we had were all pre-decisional,” Bogdan told a House Armed Services subcommittee. “There were no decisions made during those conversations, and it was my belief that President-elect Trump at the time was attempting to gain more information about the F-35 and its affordability, trying to gain more information about F-35s capabilities relative to the Super Hornet and to gain more information about the presidential aircraft replacement program."

The call was first reported Thursday morning by Bloomberg . In the Bloomberg report, Lockheed declined to comment and Boeing referred to its CEO’s comments after his January meeting with Trump, in which he said they “made some great progress” in their talks.

Speaking with reporters after the hearing, Bogdan declined to say whether he thought it was appropriate for Muilenburg to be on the call. But, Bogdan added, all the information he provided in the call was "clearly" allowed to be released publicly.

Bodgan also said the call was “very, very forthright” and that Trump asked “a lot of very, very, very good” questions.

“He was in the learning mode,” Bogdan said of Trump.

In December, Trump tweeted that costs for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet program were “out of control.”

In tweets, Trump also pitted Lockheed against Boeing, saying that he asked Boeing to price out an F-18 that’s comparable to the F-35.

Bogdan first met with Trump on Dec. 21 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, along with several other military officers in a meeting that was widely reported at the time. The same day, Trump also met with Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg and Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson.

Bogdan then had two follow-up calls with Trump, Bogdan said Thursday. The first, on Jan. 9, was between him and Trump. The second was the Jan. 17 call between him, Trump and Muilenburg.

The calls informed a review since ordered by Defense Secretary James Mattis of the F-35 program to find ways to reduce costs, Bogdan said. The review will also include a comparison of the F-35C to the F-18.

“The questions that [Trump] asked and the answers that I gave were the foundation of the tasks that came out from Secretary Mattis two weeks ago, which are ongoing right now,” Bogdan said.

Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio), chairman of the tactical air and land forces subcommittee, said it’s important to compare the F-35 to the F-18 to understand their capabilities.

“We all know that the F-35 can do that job of the F-18; the F-18 cannot do the job of the F-35,” Turner said. “But you don’t always need an F-35 to the job. The question is to that mix and how we proceed.”

Updated 11:37 a.m.Republican congressional leaders are encouraging rank-and-file members to hold town halls during the week-long Presidents Day recess – urging them to be prepared.

The past few weekends of raucous town hall meetings prompted GOP leaders this week to advise lawmakers to be kind, firm and polite and take "precautions," as they return home to work in the district and hold public meetings on hot-button issues such as repealing and replacing Obamacare.

"Be firm, be nice, be polite but understand this is part of what we deal with when we're making big changes," Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) told The Hill's Molly K. Hooper of his advice to colleagues.

GOP leaders held a number of briefings this week to help members understand the details of the party's direction on Obamacare, so that they can answer questions at home.

Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said his advice for colleagues is, "Don't shy away from the public.” “Be prepared intellectually, knowledge-wise, be polite and don't fall for the bait if [protestors] try to get you in an uncomfortable situation."

Leaders also advised GOP members to take proper "security precautions," said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who warned those precautions can sometimes be too rigid.

Sanford plans to hold a town hall meeting on Saturday that is more "free form, free flow,” he said. “Other people have become quite regimented in their town hall meetings, but I think the more regimented you become the further away you get from real spirit of town halls."

Both sides could potentially face fired up Bernie Sanders supporters on matters such as President Trump's Supreme Court pick.

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said his colleagues can't hide from feisty meetings.

"If the Bernie people or whoever else wants to show up and want to holler that's wonderful,” he said.

“What is not OK is members of Congress who refuse to have those meetings. I understand they are tough … [but] it is your job, do them," Himes said, noting that he held more than a dozen town hall events at the height of the tea party protests in 2009.It’s difficult to keep track of all the headlines out of Washington since Inauguration Day, let alone rank them in importance. In many ways, I think President Trump is a human Rorschach test where you see whatever policy changes you want (or fear) most.

But as an investor, I take a dispassionate view of political rhetoric right now. What matters most to me is how policies are likely to look in reality vs. in the White House briefing room, and how those policies will alter market sentiment in the next several months.

And what increasingly matters to markets right now is the future of financial regulations.

To be clear, market sentiment is different than tangible success. Wall Street regularly sees biotech companies or cybersecurity startups go sky-high on the promise of future profits even though the stocks may currently be awash in red ink. For a bigger picture, consider that the S&P 500 stock market index gained more than 60 percent in nine months from its March 2009 lows to the end of the year, even though the unemployment rate was still climbing and stayed above 9 percent until late 2011.

Wall Street knows a thing or two about making a profit even when times are tough for Main Street. So it’s important to consider the difference between policies that are good for regular Americans and the overall economy, and those that are mostly just for well-heeled investors.

As always, the devil is in the details. And while it’s tempting to only talk about Iranian missiles and Mexico border walls, it’s crucial to not overlook the minutia of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment right now. Because these decisions could matter a lot, both to Wall Street in the short-term and Main Street in the long-term.

Here are three key issues I’m watching that may be under your radar, but that are crucial to the stock market, the financial industry, and the economy in 2017.

The ‘Volcker Rule’

There’s a whole lot of posturing going on with the Dodd-Frank Act. On one hand, there’s the hysterical claim from President Trump that even his well-heeled friends “can’t get any money because banks just won’t let them borrow,” and on the other, there are bank CEOs actually rising in defense of the law and simply asking for more clarity instead of dramatic changes. But don’t let the many facets of Dodd-Frank overshadow the big fish that bankers are trying to land: significant changes to the so-called “Volcker Rule” that places limits on how (and how much) banks can invest their money.

In the short-term, that could result in much larger profits as banks get to take the gloves off and get aggressive with trading. But it’s worth noting that the reason America spiraled into crisis in 2007 and 2008 was because everyone with a financial division was making incredibly risky investments, which resulted in deep losses for the financial arms of General Electric and General Motors, as well as banks and investment firms. This facet of Dodd-Frank may be arcane and may not apply to Main Street, but it could dramatically affect the stock market and the economy.

Federal Reserve regulation chief

Former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE refused to nominate anyone for vice chairman of regulation at the Federal Reserve, a post established under Dodd-Frank and one of the top regulatory roles in the U.S. financial system. This was in part because it was nigh impossible for Obama to get someone approved, but also because Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo had been acting as the “alpha dog” of financial oversight and an “uber-regulator” under Obama in the absence of a vice chairman. Even if Washington doesn’t make major changes to Dodd-Frank, Wall Street could benefit simply from having a sympathetic ear at the top of the food chain that is more likely to go easy on both enforcement and in fines levied when the industry inevitably overreaches.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

It’s pretty obvious that the CFPB has been a Republican punching bag since its inception. But the million-dollar question for investors and consumers is whether it will move toward a more bipartisan mission in the vein of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or be scrapped or rendered irrelevant instead. Lawmakers have already started targeting the CFPB, such as Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) leading an effort to repeal rules that limit prepaid credit cards. But will they keep cutting away small slices with a scalpel, or just rev up the chainsaw in the coming months? The CFPB has wide-reaching powers, and a wholesale change could have sweeping and immediate impact on the financial industry and the overall economy in 2017.

The views expressed by contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.Two New Jersey Democrats unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would require greater transparency about train safety audits after a deadly train crash in their state last year.

Reps. Donald Payne Jr. and Albio Sires co-authored the bill, which would inform the public whenever a railroad or rail transit agency is under investigation by the federal government for safety violations.

The measure comes in the wake of a fatal New Jersey Transit crash last fall, in which a packed commuter train slammed into the Hoboken station and killed a woman standing on the platform.

It was only revealed after the deadly incident, however, that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) had been conducting a “deep audit” of NJ Transit in response to an uptick in safety violations.

Payne and Sires said it’s concerning that the passengers who ride the train every day were unaware of the audit.

“I am pleased to introduce this legislation that will ensure that people know when the railroads they rely on are under investigation for safety reasons,” Sires said in a statement. “It is imperative that Members of Congress and Senators can inform their constituents when a railroad or rail transit agency is violating safety regulations.”

The measure would require the FRA and the Federal Transit Administration to notify lawmakers if they conduct any safety audits on railroads or rail transit agencies. It also would require federal agencies to submit a report to Congress detailing the results of the investigation within 90 days of the audit’s completion.

“We need to make sure that safety audits are transparent in order for Congress to provide effective oversight of rail transit agencies,” Payne said. “I’m pleased to join Rep. Sires in introducing this legislation, and will continue to work with my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to improve the safety of this nation’s railroads.”The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is requesting a meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials over recent raids on undocumented immigrants.

Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), who chairs the caucus, sent a letter to ICE asking for “an open and candid discussion” on the enforcement changes, saying the raids "have struck fear in the hearts of the immigrant community.”

“It is critical that we meet with you in person immediately to discuss the impact these raids have had on our communities as well as obtain clarifying guidance on how ICE policies will differ from the last Administration,” the letter reads.

Democratic Reps. Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), Lucille Roybal-Allard (Calif.), John Conyers (Mich.), Luis Gutierrez Luis GutierrezDems: White House canceled ICE immigration meeting ICE head cancels meeting with Hispanic Dems Hispanics are split in DNC race MORE (Ill.) and Judy Chu (Calif.) also signed the letter calling for a meeting by Wednesday.

The letter stated that congressional offices had contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security about the recent raids in California, but has yet to year back about the enforcement.

A report on Friday said more than 300 undocumented immigrants had been arrested in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Chicago in raids this week.

An ICE official in the Los Angeles office called the raid an “enforcement surge,” but maintained that they were routine.

Trump last month signed an executive order on immigration that ended the “catch and release” policy that allowed people who crossed the border to return to Mexico without being detained.To achieve its laudable goal of improving the health of our nation, the National Institutes of Health will soon advocate for an increase in its funding. But before NIH receives even one additional penny, its misguided, wasteful spending priorities need an overhaul. The Trump administration should turn a critical eye to NIH and demand the agency make funding decisions based on the best science, not on habit.

Each year, NIH awards fully forty percent of its research budget to experiments that use dogs, rats, monkeys, mice, and other animals as “models” of humans. The return on this investment has been dismal, with little of this experimentation translating into cures or effective treatments.

ADVERTISEMENT

Intrinsic biological and genetic differences among species mean that results of animal studies usually don’t translate to humans. Study results vary even among different strains of the same species.

A 2015 analysis concluded that as much as 89 percent of animal studies could not be reproduced, a fundamental step used to confirm the validity of scientific results. This amounts to a staggering $28 billion wasted every year.

The current NIH administration acknowledges the debacle. Director Francis Collins has written, “Preclinical research, especially work that uses animal models, seems to be the area that is currently most susceptible to reproducibility issues.”

A 2014 review published in the British Medical Journal found that “even the most promising findings from animal research often fail in human trials and are rarely adopted into clinical practice. For example, one study found that fewer than 10 percent of highly promising basic science discoveries enter routine clinical use within 20 years.”

Yet animal experimenters continue to give patients false hope. Witness the recent failure in a late-stage clinical trial of Eli Lilly’s much-hyped Alzheimer’s drug, solanezumab, which had been tested successfully in mice and monkeys.

These animals don’t suffer from Alzheimer’s disease—no non-human animal is known to—so experimenters fiddle with an animal’s genome to force the buildup of amyloid plaques similar to those in afflicted human brains. The result: Mice seem to have relief from symptoms that look like —but aren’t— Alzheimer’s. Human patients continue to suffer.

The clinical failure rate for new Alzheimer’s drugs now stands at a whopping 99.6 percent. Cancer drugs that work in animals have less than a seven percent chance of succeeding in even the earliest clinical trials.

Multiple systematic reviews have documented the overwhelming failure of animal experimentation to benefit human health in other areas, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, mental illness, addiction and more.

NIH is well aware of this, too.

In its most recent five-year strategic plan, the agency stated, “Petri dish and animal models often fail to provide good ways to mimic disease or predict how drugs will work in humans, resulting in much wasted time and money while patients wait for therapies.”

While NIH has expressed interest in reducing and replacing animal studies, it continues to fund dead-end experiments for which there is growing abhorrence on the part of the American public.

The agency must tackle this waste head-on by diverting funds from flawed animal experimentation to promising animal-free, human-relevant research methods.

In just one of many examples, tiny human brain “organoids”– models of living brains created from 3D cultures of neural cells–have allowed researchers to identify the root causes of a rare genetic disorder that leads to fatal brain malformations. Previous studies on this condition, known as Miller-Dieker Syndrome, relied on mouse models that scientists admit were critically flawed.

The NIH must also conduct systematic reviews of all areas of research in which animals are used. When chimpanzee studies were subjected to this analysis, it was determined that experiments on these primates could be performed in other ways. NIH acted on this information and shut down the funding, sparing both chimpanzees and our tax dollars.

We deserve the wiser use of our money. Patients deserve cures. And the animals deserve to be left alone. That’s something people of any political stripe can get behind.

The views expressed by this author are their own and are not the views of The Hill.President Trump on Thursday signed legislation ending a key Obama administration coal mining rule.

The bill quashes the Office of Surface Mining's Stream Protection Rule, a regulation to protect waterways from coal mining waste that officials finalized in December.

The legislation is the second Trump has signed into law ending an Obama-era environmental regulation. On Tuesday, he signed a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution undoing a financial disclosure requirement for energy companies.

Both the mining and financial disclosure bills are the tip of a GOP push to undo a slate of regulations instituted in the closing days of the Obama administration. The House has passed several CRA resolutions, and the Senate has so far sent three of them to President Trump for his signature.

Regulators finalized the stream protection rule in December, but they spent most of Obama’s tenure writing it.

The rule is among the most controversial environment regulations the former administration put together. The coal mining industry said it would be costly to implement and lead to job losses across the sector, which is already suffering from a market-driven downturn in demand for its product.

At the signing, Trump called the regulation "another terrible job killing rule" and said ending it would save "many thousands American jobs, especially in the mines, which, I have been promising you — the mines are a big deal."

"This is a major threat to your jobs and we’re going to get rid of this threat," he added. "We’re going to fight for you."

Republicans on Congress, especially from Appalachia, supported that argument and sought to block the rule several times before finally passing the CRA resolution this month.

“In my home state of Kentucky and others across the nation, the stream buffer rule will cause major damage to communities and threaten coal jobs,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump Senate confirms Pruitt to lead EPA MORE (R-Ky.) said before the bill passed. “We should heed their call now and begin bringing relief to coal country.”

Environmentalists supported the administration rule, saying it would protect waterways from pollution and preserve public health. They have criticized the GOP for repealing environmental rules in the name of supporting coal mining jobs, but doing little else to help displaced workers in mining areas.

The Senate this week sent Trump a CRA resolution blocking a gun sales regulation. Members could soon take up a measure undoing a methane rule for natural gas drilling operations on public land.

This story was updated at 4:10 p.m.The House Select Committee on Benghazi released an 800-page report on Tuesday that is filled with new criticism of Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonMark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game The latest scheme in the left’s war on Trump Local broadcast news knows America better than cable MORE, the former secretary of State who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.

The report, after more than two years of work and $7 million in expense, does not fundamentally alter the public’s understanding of the attacks, which left four Americans dead and has stirred controversy throughout President Obama’s time in office.

ADVERTISEMENT

But the analysis includes new facts sure to be seized upon by the administration’s critics and which are likely to serve as points of attack against Clinton during the general election.

Clinton herself is chided more for her actions before and after the night of the attack, rather than in the heat of the moment itself.

Clinton and other officials did not adequately heed concerns about the growing extremism in Benghazi and other parts of Libya, the report concluded.

“It is not clear what additional intelligence would have satisfied either [Undersecretary of Management Patrick] Kennedy or the secretary in understanding the Benghazi Mission compound was at risk—short of an attack,” the report claimed.

“The intelligence on which Kennedy and the secretary were briefed daily was clear and pointed—Al Qa’ida, al Qa’ida like groups, and other regional extremists took refuge in the security vacuum created by the Libya government and its inability to take command of the security situation.”

After the violence occurred, the report accuses her of knowing that it was sparked by extremist militia members but nonetheless blamed it on an anti-Muslim video responsible for other protests.

The day after the violence, Clinton told Egypt’s prime minister that U.S. officials “know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film.

“It was a planned attack — not a protest,” she added.

In public, however, Clinton and other senior officials appeared to conflate the violence with the video for days to come.

Then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice caused a stir when she appeared on multiple Sunday political shows offering a performance scoffed at even by government officials.

“I think Rice was off the reservation on this one,” one senior State Department official working on Libya wrote in an email after her appearances.

“Off the reservation on five networks!” responded another official.

In a statement, the Clinton campaign blasted the report as a partisan-driven exercise filled with conspiracy theories.

"The Republicans on the House Benghazi Committee are finishing their work in the same, partisan way that we've seen from them since the beginning," Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.

"In refusing to issue its report on a bipartisan basis, the Committee is breaking from the precedent set by other Congressional inquiries into the Benghazi attacks. And in leaking out select portions from their report in the middle of the night, without even allowing some of the committee's own members to see it, the Republican members are clearly seeking to avoid any fact-checking of their discredited, conspiracy theories.

Fallon also noted House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) comments last year saying that the Benghazi panel was put together to bring down Clinton's poll numbers.

"This report just confirms what Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and even one of Trey Gowdy Trey GowdyCongress asserts itself GOP rep says media is 'blurring' fact and opinion Oversight panel demands answers on Pentagon waste report MORE's own former staffers admitted months ago: this Committee's chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave Americans in order to try to attack the Obama administration and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign," Fallon said.

Among the report's new revelations is the notion that Ambassador Chris Stevens, one of the Americans killed, was in Benghazi with the aim of erecting a permanent diplomatic post, to replace the temporary one that came under fire.

Military orders also appeared to have gotten lost or misinterpreted on their way down the chain, the report claims.

And details were lost about which responsibilities fell to the Pentagon, which were in the hands of the State Department and who — if anyone — needed to be evacuated.

“The response to the attacks suffered from confusion and misinformation circulating between the agencies,” the report claims, “underscoring that no one effectively took charge of the U.S. government’s response.”

Troops remained motionless for hours after then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta ordered forces to deploy to the scene of the violence.

At one point, a platoon of U.S. Marines changed into and out of their uniforms four different times as they waited to be deployed, due to changing orders about “the image that would present” of having uniformed U.S. forces marching through the city.

Additionally, the Libyan forces that eventually evacuated the surviving Americans from the CIA annex were in fact former loyalists of deposed strongman Moammar Gadhafi and not militia groups with a previous relationship with the U.S.

In the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks, Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith died when their diplomatic compound came under attack. Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died from mortar fire hours later, at a nearby CIA annex.

Scrutiny over the terror attack has dogged the Obama administration for the last four years and in the process has become a byword for scandal on par with Watergate.

Critics suspect the Obama administration of having turned a blind eye to security, failing to come to the victims aid and then misleading the public in the aftermath.

The episode has become political weight for Clinton in particular. Her presumptive Republican opponent, Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE, has hammered her for “bad judgment” and suggestions that the violence was sparked in protest to an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube. The video was the source of protests elsewhere in the Muslim world, but the Benghazi attacks were spearheaded by a member of a radical Islamist militia.

Committee Democrats attempted to get out ahead of the report on Monday, by releasing their rebuttal analysis and dozens of interview transcripts a day early.

In their analysis, Democrats acknowledged that the committee had uncovered additional details about the 2012 violence but maintained that nothing altered the underlying narrative supported by previous investigations.

The committee’s Tuesday release accomplishes a key goal of Gowdy’s by ensuring it is public before the party nominating conventions next month. The conventions had been an informal deadline for the committee to release its report, and a delay would likely have been seen as the committee inserting itself into the campaign season.

“Now, I simply ask the American people to read this report for themselves, look at the evidence we have collected, and reach their own conclusions,” Gowdy said in a statement on Tuesday morning. “You can read this report in less time than our fellow citizens were taking fire and fighting for their lives on the rooftops and in the streets of Benghazi.”

The committee is investigating Russian interference in the U.S. election, including probing any contact between campaign officials and Russia. Trump’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, resigned Monday following revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about the contents of a pre-inauguration phone call with the Russian ambassador.

Trump has repeatedly denied any contact between his campaign and Russia in the course of the election. The New York Times reported earlier in the week that campaign associates had repeated contact with senior Russian officials in the year before the election.

Both Senate and House leadership have insisted that any investigation into Russian involvement in the election is the purview of the respective Intelligence Committees — a decision Democrats have argued is an attempt to sweep the issue under the rug.

Both committees are notoriously secretive.

Al Franken Al FrankenAT&T, Time Warner defend deal The Hill's 12:30 Report FCC chair responds to Franken's net neutrality concerns MORE (D-Minn.) that he will work to preserve a “free and open” internet amid a possible reexamination of net neutrality rules.

Franken had sent a letter to Ajit Pai last month shortly after the FCC commissioner, who voted against the regulations, was tapped by President Trump to lead the agency.

“We share the same goals of promoting a free and open Internet and protecting fully Americans' rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,” Pai wrote in response in a letter dated last week but released Friday. “I look forward to working with you to ensure that the FCC's regulatory framework preserves each of these values.”

Net neutrality was enshrined in the 2015 Open Internet Order passed by a Democrat-led FCC. It required service providers to treat all internet traffic equally and not throttle or block certain sites.

What angered conservatives and the telecom industry was that the order reclassified service providers as common carriers, thereby opening them up to tougher regulation from the FCC.

While Pai committed to keeping the internet “free and open,” he did not address how he would handle the reclassification order.

“Allowing giant corporations to pick and choose the content available to everyday Americans would threaten the basic principles of our democracy,” Franken wrote in his initial letter in January. “I urge you to protect freedom of speech by maintaining and enforcing the Open Internet Order.”

“Two years ago, American consumers and businesses celebrated the FCC's landmark vote to preserve a free and open internet by reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act.”An appeals court heard oral arguments Tuesday evening on whether to restore President Trump’s executive action on immigration and refugees as lawsuits proceed.

Hearing concludes

7:10 p.m.

The hearing concluded, with Clifton showing more support for the Trump administration and Friedland appearing to side with the plaintiffs' argument.

Friedland acknowledged the pressing nature of the case and said the court will issue a decision "as soon as possible."

A ruling is not expected Tuesday evening, the court said earlier in the day, but will likely come sometime this week.

Judges address messy rollout

7:08 p.m.

Judges brought up the confusion at airports right after the ban was signed, when it was still unclear whether the policy applies to legal permanent residents.



Clifton asked why the administration didn't issue a new executive order to clarify the order. He questioned whether there is authority to interpret the policy so that it doesn't include legal residents.

Administration lawyer faces more questions

7:02 p.m.

In a short rebuttal, Flentje grew heated when pressed by Friedland on the plaintiff's submitted evidence that Trump has supported a Muslim ban in the past.

He said it's "extraordinary" to second-guess the president's authority over national security "based on newspaper articles."

But Clifton asked whether he denies those statements were made.

"No," Flentje replied.

Judges question states' claims of religious discrimination

6:40 p.m.



Judges pressed Purcell to back up the plaintiffs' claims that Trump's executive action amounts to religious discrimination. The states said they believe the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another.



"I'm not persuaded," Clifton said. The countries targeted "encompass only relatively small percentage of Muslims."



"I'm not persuaded," Clifton said. The countries targeted "encompass only relatively small percentage of Muslims." Purcell said states just needed to prove the order was motivated, in part, by a desire to discriminate against Muslims, citing Trump's remark in December 2015 about a "total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States."

"There are statements that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against Muslims," Purcell said. "The public statement from the president and his top advisers."

Purcell said it is "remarkable" to have this much evidence of intent before the official pre-trial process known as discovery, but Clifton seemed unconvinced by his arguments and lack of hard evidence, pointing to foreign policy that treats citizens from certain nations differently.

Purcell moved on to the merits of the underlying immigration order and said it has inflicted irreparable damage to the states through lost tax revenues, separates families and residents afraid of traveling overseas.

States' attorney begins argument

6:32 p.m.

The attorney for Washington and Minnesota argued that the administration pursued the wrong procedural move in requesting an appeal of a temporary restraining order, which are generally non-appealable. Trump's team says that it should be treated as a preliminary injunction.

"Why should we care?" asked Clifton, who suggested that was the wrong argument to pursue.

Defense concludes argument

6:30 p.m.

Flentje quickly ran up against his 30-minute window — he also reserved five minutes for rebuttal.

As judges continued to pepper him with questions, Flentje made his final pitch to the panel: that the injunction against the travel ban is "over broad" and should be immediately stayed, even if the court takes issue with the executive action itself.

Judges press DOJ lawyer on reviewing Trump action

6:25 p.m.

Canby repeatedly pressed Flentje on whether a state could challenge an order that banned Muslims outright.

"That's not what this order does," Flentje said.



"I know. Could he? Would anyone be able to challenge that?" Canby asked.

"That’s not what the order does," the lawyer said again.

Clifton chimed in, saying it's important because it speaks to whether states have standing to bring a lawsuit.

"This is a far cry from that situation," Flentje said.

Earlier in the hearing, Friedland had asked if Trump's authority made his decision in this situation "unreviewable," to which Flentje responded: "yes."

DOJ lawyer faces questions from judges

6:18 p.m.





Judges on the panel questioned whether there was any real evidence that the countries outlined in the order posed a real risk for terrorism, and asked for examples of federal offenses from visa holders from the seven nations.





Flentje pointed back to the previous actions by Congress and the Obama administration identifying those countries as nations of concern, but said there was no evidence in the record.

"It's pretty abstract," one judge said.

Flentje said of the legal proceedings: "These things are moving pretty fast."

A judge also shot back against Flentje's assertion that states don't have the legal standing to bring the lawsuit and challenge visa denials: "Sure they can," Judge Clifton said.

Department of Justice defends Trump's authority

6:05 p.m.

The Trump administration kicked off its oral argument by pointing out that the seven countries targeted in the immigration order were previously identified as terrorism risks by Congress and the executive branch, and that it is in the president’s broad legal authority to protect the national interest.

Vice President Pence walks through the Capitol between meetings on Tuesday, when he also cast the deciding vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary.A clear majority – 61 percent – of likely voters consider the presidential election to be more of a choice between President Obama and Mitt Romney than a referendum on the president’s first term in office, according to a new poll for The Hill.

Just over one-third — 34 percent — of voters said they considered the election to be a judgment on Obama’s job performance in the White House.

The results offer a measure of good news for Democrats, who have sought to frame the Nov. 6 election primarily as a choice between two candidates with different visions for the country.

“It is critical for the president that this is a choice, not a referendum,” said Wayne Lesperance, a political scientist at New England College in Henniker, N.H.

“If your reelection is based on answering the question, ‘are you better off than four years ago,’ you can’t say ‘yes’ with a straight face. A lot of people are still hurting.”

The survey also includes some sobering findings for the Obama campaign.

A majority of voters say their opinion of Obama has gotten worse since he took office, the poll found.

Forty-one percent said they have a “much worse” view of Obama now than in 2008; 11 percent said their opinion is “slightly worse,” while 38 percent overall said their view of him had improved.

By contrast, a near-majority of voters — 47 percent — say their view of Romney has improved as they have learned more about him, compared to 39 percent who said their opinion of the GOP candidate has become worse.

The poll findings may offer some comfort to Republicans because, even if the fall contest is a “choice election,” Romney has polled stronger than Obama on who is best to handle the economic recovery.

Romney, who faced skepticism from the Republican right during the GOP primaries, has also grown on conservative voters as time has passed, the poll found.

Seventy-three percent of self-identified conservatives said their view of Romney has improved the more they have heard and learned about him.

The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research on Sept. 6, the final day of the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C.

It is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.

Democrats devoted much of their time and effort in Charlotte to drawing contrasts between Romney and Obama — painting the Republican as inexperienced on foreign policy and out of touch with the concerns of average voters.

Obama, in his convention speech last Thursday, stressed several times to voters “you have a choice” in the direction the country takes for the next four years.

Republicans, meantime, have sought to define the election as a verdict on Obama, whose approval ratings overall wallowed below 50 percent until he got a post-Democratic convention bump. The president’s approval rating has been below 40 percent on his handling of the economy. Romney has repeatedly said, “this president cannot tell us that you’re better off today than when he took office.”

The Hill Poll found 67 percent of centrist voters — who are key to victory for both candidates — consider the vote a choice rather than a referendum. Among those who said they were neither Republican nor Democrat, 65 percent considered the election a choice.

Democrats would likely greet the poll results as “fantastic,” Lesperance said.

While the Democratic convention showed Obama would be comfortable with the election being a referendum on some issues, his campaign is less interested in having voters passing judgment on him based on the economy’s overall performance.

“To some extent the president is fine with the election being a referendum on getting (Osama) bin Laden and some of the other successes — but not on the economy,” Lesperance said.

According to the poll, voters paid close attention to both the Democratic and Republican conventions. Thirty-seven percent of voters said they are more likely to vote for Obama after seeing the political conventions, while 37 percent said they are more likely to vote for Romney. Another 25 percent said the conventions made no difference.

The majority of the poll was conducted on Thursday before Obama’s primetime speech, but 7 percent of the voters were polled during the president’s remarks.

Among women, 39 percent said they were more likely to vote for Obama because of the conventions while 35 percent said they were more likely to vote for Romney.

Both Republicans and Democrats made explicit appeals to female voters at their conventions.

The poll offers a mixed view of how centrist voters, and those who are neither Republican nor Democrat, responded to the events in Tampa, Fla., and Charlotte.

Forty-four percent of centrists said they were more likely to vote for Obama because of what they saw and heard at the conventions, while 22 percent said they were more likely to vote for Romney.

Forty-two percent of voters who identified themselves as being neither Republican nor Democrat said they were more likely to vote for Romney after seeing the conventions, while 27 percent chose Obama.

Click here to view data from The Hill Poll.New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has taken it on the chin recently, which should be expected considering that many of his views run contrary to the previous chairman's.

But much of the criticism is overwrought.

Some aspects of his first few weeks were positive. Increasing transparency in the agency's rule-making processes is long overdue. New ideas on closing the digital divide should be considered, hopefully with an eye toward cost-effectiveness.

On the more negative side of the ledger, however, the process by which the chairman took certain actions as well as retracting certain reports were not in keeping with promises to be more inclusive than his predecessor.

Pai's actions to increase transparency are unambiguously good. Taking Commissioner Michael O'Rielly's advice and releasing draft proposals and orders to the public prior to a FCC vote while tightening "editorial privileges" granted to bureaus after the vote is a win for good governance. It ends a decades-old process that made public scrutiny of rulemaking difficult.

ADVERTISEMENT

Granting editorial privileges is a bizarre practice dating to the 1970s that includes voting on notices and orders before publicly releasing the text, and allowing changes — sometimes substantive — after the vote. Hopefully this more open approach will become standard practice.

Pai has received intense criticism for his actions on Lifeline, including in The New York Times and The Washington Post. The crux of the criticism focuses on his decision to change the application status of nine companies that wanted to offer Lifeline broadband service back to "pending" after having been approved in December 2016 and January 2017.

But that decision is a red herring. As many have pointed out, those nine companies are in addition the hundreds of companies that already provide Lifeline service, and the added delay in their approval has little, if any, effect on access to subsidies.

More importantly, the issue of the nine companies distracts from the real question: Do existing programs address the digital divide? The evidence to date suggests that they do not, at least not in any cost-effective way.

In 2012, the FCC ran an excellent pilot program testing how subsidies and digital learning programs might encourage non-adopters to sign up. They result was surprising: They did not attract low-income nonadopters. Subscribership was, on average, about 10 percent of what participating companies had expected.

The experiment demonstrated how little we know about getting the last group of low-income people online. Instead of pausing to understand why the subsidized plans attracted so little interest, the FCC ignored the results and plowed ahead with its Lifeline subsidy program.

In short, the problem with Lifeline is not that it needs to give subsidies to more companies. It needs additional experiments, real evaluation and more thought about how we might actually close the adoption gap.

Pai recently outlined his plans for addressing the digital divide. The next Open Commission meeting agenda includes plans to move ahead on the Mobility Fund Phase 2, which focuses on adding 4G coverage where it does not currently exist, and more money for rural broadband buildout.

Hopefully those plans will include experimenting with how to spend the money in the most cost-effective manner, evaluating whether the programs work and analyses — especially when considering an additional $2 billion on rural subsidies — that takes to heart his comment that "every dollar that is spent on subsidizing somebody who doesn't need the help by definition does not go to someone who does."

All that said, however, the process by which he made some decisions could have been better. Pai frequently criticized Wheeler for not consulting the minority and acting unilaterally. So it was regrettable, then, that on Feb. 3, he unilaterally revoked a number of orders, causing Commissioner Mignon Clyburn to make the same critique about Pai that he previously made about Wheeler.

Pai should strive to live up to the standards of collegiality and engagement he expressed in his initial confirmation hearing. Few expect Pai, O'Rielly and Clyburn to agree on all, or even most, issues. But they are all well-meaning people with deep knowledge of the issues and a shared desire to achieve certain goals like ensuring continued investment in world-class networks and closing the digital divide.

Another concerning action was his retraction of two documents: a paper titled "Improving the Nation’s Broadband Infrastructure" by the former chief of the Office of Strategic Planning and Polices Bureau and an "E-Rate Modernization Progress Report" by the Wireless Bureau.

Heads of government agencies should not retract papers and reports with which they disagree. Instead, they should explain why the reports are deficient.

For example, in the E-Rate report, Pai might have asked for a justification for the "short-term goal" of 100 kilobits per second/student connectivity. What research demonstrates that this is a meaningful goal? Are the benefits of that increased speed above what the schools had already worth the multiple billions of dollars spent? Why is recipients' confidence in their ability to receive future subsidies an indicator of success? (Seriously. Check out page 5.) Addressing the substance of a paper is a better strategy than trying to remove it from the discussion.

Overall, Pai is off to a good start. He has moved to increase transparency of the FCC's decision-making process and has suggested new ideas for addressing the digital divide. His unilateral actions, on the other hand, may generate better policy outcomes, but were not good policy process.

Hopefully, in the future, Chairman Pai will better engage other commissioners. Doing so would help promote good telecom policy and ensure the success of his long-term agenda.

The views of contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.Two-thirds of likely voters say the weak economy is Washington’s fault, and more blame President Obama than anybody else, according to a new poll for The Hill.

It found that 66 percent believe paltry job growth and slow economic recovery is the result of bad policy. Thirty-four percent say Obama is the most to blame, followed by 23 percent who say Congress is the culprit. Twenty percent point the finger at Wall Street, and 18 percent cite former President George W. Bush.

The results highlight the reelection challenge Obama faces amid dissatisfaction with his first-term performance on the economy.

The poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, found 53 percent of voters say Obama has taken the wrong actions and has slowed the economy down. Forty-two percent said he has taken the right actions to revive the economy, while six percent said they were not sure.

Obama has argued throughout the presidential campaign that his policies have made the economy better. He says recovery is taking a long time because he inherited such deep economic trouble upon taking office in 2009.

“The problems we’re facing right now have been more than a decade in the making,” he told an audience last month in Cleveland.

Obama’s campaign, under the slogan “Forward,” has sought to steer voter attention less toward current and past economic performance and more toward questions about Republican Mitt Romney’s work in the private sector economy. It has launched attacks on the challenger’s role as head of the private equity firm Bain Capital, casting him as a jobs “outsourcer” whose firm shipped thousands of U.S. positions overseas.

The Hill Poll, however, shows the extent to which voters hold Obama responsible for the economy and reveals his vulnerability should the election become primarily a referendum on his economic management.

It finds that voters strongly believe more could have been done by the White House and in Congress to achieve growth in the economy and employment.

While 64 percent of voters consider this downturn to be “much more severe” than previous contractions, barely one quarter (26 percent) say the agonizingly slow pace of the recovery was unavoidable.

While voters feel Obama carries a greater portion of the blame than others, the poll found almost 6-in-10 are unhappy with the actions of Republicans in Congress who have challenged the president on an array of policy initiatives.

Fifty-seven percent of voters said congressional Republicans have impeded the recovery with their policies, and only 30 percent overall believe the GOP has done the right things to boost the economy.

The tension between a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Democratic-run White House has also featured in Obama’s campaign strategy.

In his economic speech last month in Cleveland, Obama cast the 2012 election as a chance to choose between two competing visions for the nation.

“What’s holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction America should take,” he said. “This election is your chance to break that stalemate.”

Romney agrees that the election is a choice between two radically different views of America, but he characterizes it as a contest between his own vision of an industrious people free to achieve their dreams and Obama’s faith in big government.

If there is a silver lining for Obama in the poll results, it’s that centrist voters, who may well decide the 2012 outcome, tend to blame Republicans in Congress more than the president for hindering a more robust recovery.

Twenty-six percent of centrists cited Congress as most to blame for U.S. economic woes, compared to 20 percent who blame Obama.

Similarly, 53 percent of centrists said Obama has taken the right actions as president to boost the economy, compared with 38 percent who said he had taken the wrong steps.

Seventy-nine percent of centrist voters said Republicans had slowed the economy by taking wrong actions. Only 13 percent of centrists credited GOP lawmakers with policies that have helped the economy.

The poll found sharp differences in opinions along racial lines, with 94 percent of African-Americans saying Obama had taken the right actions on the economy, compared to 34 percent of white voters.

The Hill poll was conducted July 19 among 1,000 likely voters, and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.

Former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush mocked President Trump’s plan for a wall along the U.S.’s southern border with a three-word tweet on Friday.

“Reality sets in,” Bush tweeted with a link to a Wall Street Journal commentary piece titled “Trump Can’t Build a Border Wall Without the Real Estate.”

Reality sets in. https://t.co/OnjcBTelhV — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) February 17, 2017

The piece says the federal government would need to own the nearly 2,000 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, most of which is currently private property, in order to build a wall.

In order to gain ownership of land it does not own, the Trump administration would need to employ eminent domain, which under the Fifth Amendment allows the government to seize public property for private use with “just compensation." The post says that buying the land could put the price of the wall well above the $10 billion estimate Trump floated during the campaign.

The Trump administration has set its sights on making the border wall a priority.

Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said earlier this month he wants to complete the wall within two years.Height Securities is an investment bank with headquarters in Washington, DC, that specializes in regulatory and policy research for institutional and corporate clients.

The chamber is set to consider Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, by Friday, and Republicans are aiming for a vote on Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin soon after.

The Senate already voted to confirm Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Betsy DeVos for Education secretary this week.

Watch the video above for a preview of what’s to come.A majority of voters believe President Obama has been no better than his immediate predecessor, President George W. Bush, when it comes to balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties, according to a new poll for The Hill.

Thirty-seven percent of voters argue that Obama has been worse than Bush while 15 percent say he has been “about the same.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The results cannot be fully explained as party line responses. More than one in five self-identified Democrats, 21 percent, assert that the Obama administration has not improved upon Bush’s record. So do 23 percent of liberals.

The results are especially striking given the liberal hopes that attended Obama’s election, the opprobrium he heaped upon Bush’s national security policies during the 2008 campaign and his early promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.

The vexing issue of how to balance security with respect for civil liberties has taken center-stage since a document detailing the legal justification for drone strikes on overseas al Qaeda members was leaked to NBC News earlier this month.

The Justice Department “white paper” surfaced ahead of last Thursday’s Senate confirmation hearing of President Obama’s choice for CIA director, his chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan.

The leaked memo stipulates that the government can lawfully kill one of its own citizens overseas if it determines the person has ties to al Qaeda or one of its affiliates and poses an “imminent threat.”

But critics have said the broad language used in the document allows for an elastic interpretation, raising questions over how much authority the administration should have over the lives of American citizens.

Americans are, however, inclined to support the government in its lethal attacks on citizens and non-citizens it deems to be terrorists, according to the Hill Poll.

The poll found that 53 percent of likely voters said it should be legal for the U.S. government to kill non-U.S. citizens who meet that description. Meanwhile, 44 percent said it should be legal for the U.S. government to kill American citizens who it believes are terrorists and present an imminent threat.

By contrast, 21 percent of respondents thought such an action should be illegal if the target is a non-U.S. citizen. A slightly higher percentage of voters, 31 percent, thought killing individuals whom the government believes are terrorists should be illegal when the target is an American citizen.

A significant proportion of respondents — 26 percent and 24 percent, respectively — said they were not sure if such attacks should be legal, regardless of whether the target was an American or not.

When asked whether they oppose or back the administration’s drone program, however, a significantly higher percentage of voters voiced their support. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they support the use of unmanned drones to kill “people in foreign countries whom the US government says are terrorists and present an imminent threat,” while just 19 percent of voters said they oppose the policy.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.

A full panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit unanimously ruled that the 2011 law violates the First Amendment right to free speech.

“Despite its majestic brevity—or maybe because of it—the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment sometimes proves difficult to apply,” Judge Adalberto Jordan wrote in one of two majority opinions.

“Yet certain First Amendment principles can be applied with reasonable consistency, and one of them is that, subject to limited exceptions, content-based regulations of speech are presumptively invalid.”

Florida officials claimed the Firearms Owners’ Privacy Act was needed to protect Floridians’ Second Amendment right to own firearms.

The court, however, found that the law’s provisions prohibiting doctors from asking patients if they own a gun, from disclosing information about gun ownership in patient medical records and unnecessarily harassing patients about gun ownership violated doctors’ free speech rights.

The court said only the law’s provision prohibiting doctors from discriminating against patients solely for owning a gun was valid.

In an effort to prevent and reduce firearm-related deaths and injuries, particularly to children, the American Medical Association (AMA) “encourages its members to inquire as to the presence of household firearms as a part of childproofing the home and to educate patients to the dangers of firearms to children,” a policy similarly followed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, according to court documents.

In a statement Friday, AMA President Andrew Gurman called Thursday’s decisions a “clear victory against censorship of private medical discussions between patients and physicians.”The Environmental Protection Agency broke its silence on Twitter on Friday for the first time since President Trump took office, tweeting out congratulations to its new administrator, Scott Pruitt.

The Department of Agriculture on Friday reposted some of the animal welfare records it had removed from its website, after outcry from animal rights groups when the material was taken down.

The documents that were removed earlier this month included records of animal welfare violations at zoos, commercial breeders and research labs.

USDA claimed it removed the records as part of a comprehensive review to balance the need for transparency with rules that protect individual privacy.

In a statement Friday, the agency said it reposted the first batch of annual reports of research institutions and inspection reports for certain federal research facilities.

“The reports posted are part of a comprehensive review of the documents the agency removed from its website in early February and are in the same redacted form as before,” the statement read.

“As announced on Feb. 7, 2017, the agency will continue to review records and determine which information is appropriate for reposting.”

PETA and five other animal rights advocates and groups filed a lawsuit earlier this week claiming USDA violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in removing the records. The law requires federal agencies to provide certain records to the public as a whole and disclose any other records to individuals in response to FOIA requests

The groups argues that the records are needed to keep the public informed about the agency’s implementation and enforcement — or lack thereof — for the 1966 Animal Welfare Act (AWA).

The Humane Society of the United States called the USDA action on Friday a step in the right direction, but noted that years of material are still missing from the website.

“This is an important turnaround and a good start, but the USDA has a lot more to do here,” Wayne Pacelle, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

“Lawmakers, the press, animal advocates, and even the regulated community want transparency and accessible records.”

Rep. Vern Buchanan Vern (R-Fla.), co-chair of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, said the partial restoration of the website was “not good enough.”

“There’s no reason to hold back this vital information,” he said in a statement. “This website protects animals and the database should be fully restored. At the end of the day, putting a few documents back online is not good enough.”



Buchanan, along with 100 other members of Congress, sent a letter to President Trump on Tuesday asking for the database to be restored immediately.Win McNamee/Getty Images

President Obama and Vice President Biden meet with combatant commanders and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Wednesday.The cost of protecting President Trump's family is on track to far outstrip that of his predecessor, according to estimates.

According to estimates by the Washington Post, the expenses of the first four weeks of Trump's presidency suggest that the U.S. government may end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars more that it did on the Obamas, largely because of extensive travel.



According to the estimate, Trump's three trips to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida since the inauguration cost approximately $10 million in travel, security and more.

Guarding the Trump Tower in New York City, the current residence of the first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron, would cost the taxpayers $183 million a year. Melania and Barron are expected to move to the White House at the end of the school year.Additional costs also included $100,000 in hotel fees for Secret Service personnel that accompanied Eric Trump's trip to Uruguay, and another estimated $1.5 million a year to rent appropriate space for authorities in the Trump Tower, if the Pentagon decides to prepare for the commander-in-chief's possible to return to his Manhattan residence.Judicial Watch, a conservative organization that tracked Obama's travel expenses, calculated that approximately $97 million was spent on on protection during his two terms in office.The Washington Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that a florist who refused to provide flowers to a gay couple violated a state law that bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

In a unanimous ruling, the nine members of the court sided with a gay couple from Kennewick, Wash., who sued a local florist for discrimination. The florist, a devout Southern Baptist, told the couple she could not provide flowers for their wedding because of her religious beliefs.

The florist, Barronelle Stutzman, said she believes participating in or allowing her employees to participate in same-sex weddings by providing flowers would be condoning same-sex marriage, counter to her religious beliefs. A lower court judge sided with the couple and fined Stutzman $1,001 in penalties.

Stutzman appealed, marking the first time the nondiscrimination law reached the state Supreme Court in Olympia. “Discrimination based on same-sex marriage constitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,” Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud wrote for the court. The court said the state’s anti-discrimination law does not unduly burden the florist’s free exercise of religion.

Gay rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued on behalf of the couple, hailed the ruling as a win for nondiscrimination ordinances that have passed in 19 states.

“This was a reasonable application of a state non-discrimination law. It’s consistent with the way that states and frankly the federal government have applied non-discrimination law across time,” said Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign.

But religious conservatives said the ruling trampled on Stutzman’s right to religious expression.

“The Washington State Supreme Court’s ruling tramples on our nation’s long-held tradition of respecting the freedom of Americans to follow their deeply held beliefs, especially when it comes to participating in activities and ceremonies that so many Americans consider sacred,” said Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council. “The time to protect religious freedom is now.”

Stutzman could appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, though her attorneys did not immediately say whether they would continue the case.

The verdict comes as legislatures in Republican-dominated states consider new measures that would allow businesses, and in some cases government agencies, to refuse service to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

States including Texas, Kentucky, Missouri and South Carolina are considering legislation that would prohibit cities or counties from requiring private entities to allow transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. States including Virginia, Oklahoma, Illinois and Alabama are considering bills that would allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, such as in situations similar to the Washington case.

More than 70 pieces of legislation dealing with discrimination ordinances have been introduced in nearly two dozen states, according to the Human Rights Campaign.Three times as many voters believe the Obama administration is not supportive enough of Israel as believe it is too supportive, according to a new poll for the Hill.

The proportion of voters who now say the president does not give strong enough backing to Israel is higher than it was in each of three similar surveys conducted for The Hill since May 2011. Correspondingly, fewer voters now find the White House’s policy excessively supportive of Israel.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the latest Hill Poll, just 13 percent of respondents say the president’s policy toward Israel is too supportive. A full 39 percent said Obama is not supportive enough, the highest percentage The Hill Poll has seen.

Over the past two years, recent surveys for The Hill show a fluctuating number of voters who believe the president needs to express stronger support of Israel.

In a poll for The Hill conducted in May 2011, 27 percent of voters said Obama was too supportive toward Israel, while 31 percent said he was not supportive enough.

In September 2011, the proportion of voters who said Obama was too supportive of Israel went down, and those insisting he was not supportive enough increased slightly.

March 2012 saw a slight uptick in the number of respondents who said Obama was too supportive of the Jewish state, to 25 percent, while slightly fewer voters, 32 percent, said the president was not supportive enough.

Meanwhile, in the most recent survey for The Hill, a slightly larger percentage of likely voters say Obama is generally anti-Israel than say he is pro-Israel, 30 percent to 28 percent. The percentage of voters who label Obama as pro-Israel is up slightly from a September 2011 survey for The Hill, as is the number of voters who say Obama is anti-Israel.

Overall though, the data hasn’t changed much since 2011. In the September survey, 23 percent dubbed Obama pro-Israel, while 29 percent said the president was anti-Israel. In the most recent survey, 29 percent of likely voters said Obama is neither, which is a somewhat smaller figure than the 38 percent of voters who gave that answer in 2011.

These findings underline the American public’s concern about Obama’s policy on the Jewish state at a time of heightened fears about Iran’s nuclear program. Israel has insisted that Iran must be stopped by any means necessary, including a military strike, from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The Obama administration has expressed its preference for a diplomatic solution, a posture that pro-Israel critics say is insufficiently muscular.

The White House appears to be refocusing on the U.S.-Israel alliance after spending the last few months on domestic issues. Vice President Biden is scheduled to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s upcoming conference Monday, and Obama will make his first visit to Israel as president later this month.

Another question central to the U.S.-Israel alliance is how involved the White House should be in brokering a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. According to the latest Hill Poll, a majority of voters said Obama should be somewhat or very involved in brokering a deal, while just 32 percent of voters overall said he should be not at all or not very involved in the process.

By way of broad comparison, in a May, 2011 survey, just 24 percent said Obama should be more involved in brokering a peace between the two nations, while 50 percent of voters said Obama should not be more involved and a solid 26 percent said they were not sure.

As Obama embarks on a second-term push to secure his place in history, the president is no doubt thinking about his global reputation.

But according to a comparison of two recent surveys for The Hill, fewer voters now believe Obama has improved the United States’ standing in the world.

In May 2011, 47 percent said Obama had improved the country’s standing, while 38 percent said Obama damaged the nation’s reputation. But in the Hill Poll’s most recent survey, just 37 percent said the United States is more respected internationally than it was prior to Obama taking office, while a full 43 percent said the country is less respected in the world.

These findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 28 by Pulse Opinion Research.

So, I took the time to study his positions on the issues and talked to him on the phone for some time over Christmas break 2016. I liked what I saw and heard.

First, I was impressed by his message, which should have appeal to working class and rural voters. He seems to understand their anxieties and fears regarding jobs losses due to trade and other factors, and articulates these issues well – which we Democrats need to do better in the months and years ahead. He certainly understood that, while he was part of the progressive Democratic Party base (as I am), we have to do better as a party by moving to the center and appealing to a broader electorate than our base. He also agreed with the approach of former DNC Chair Howard Dean – we need to strengthen our state and local parties at the grassroots, with an aim of a 50-state party strategy, not just focusing on Blue states.

Second, when I talked to Ellison on the phone, I understood his broad appeal beyond our base. He speaks with humility about economic justice, respect for values and faith, and tolerance for views different than his. He is a good listener and comes across as humble and open-minded. He presents himself well on TV — a vital strength for DNC chair.

Finally, I need to contradict some calls I received from Jewish Americans who believe Ellison is anti-Israel. This is false. Israel has enough real adversaries without mischaracterizing someone who is a true friend as an opponent. Recently, I read a strong endorsement of Ellison for DNC chair from 300 Jewish American leaders from across the country, including more than 100 rabbis.

Ellison has publicly and strongly opposed the obscenely hypocritical “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions” (BDS) movement, supported among fringe elements of the left and on college campuses. We all see the hypocrisy of these BDS supporters. They ignore Israel’s pro-civil rights, human rights, women’s rights and gay rights laws, and rule of law and democracy, and their silence on anti-human rights policies — especially the mistreatment of women — among surrounding Arab nations is deafening.

Ellison has also publicly repudiated past positions, such as his brief association with the notorious anti-Semite Minister Louis Farrakhan during the days leading up to his Million Man March in 1995, 22 years ago. What he has done most recently is far more important: He voted in favor of the record $38 billion, 10-year military aid package for Israel.

Like myself, Ellison supports a two-state solution, as stated in the National Democratic Convention platform — but only if that solution is “negotiated directly by the parties” and “guarantees Israel’s future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders.” I have highlighted the word “Jewish” because that means the congressman understands the importance of Israel as the historic post-Holocaust homeland for Jews all over the world — a place where the Jewish people resided as a nation and a religion more than 3,000 years ago.

I know and have great respect for other contenders for DNC chair. But I believe, as a former DNC member, that Ellison’s proven ability to win congressional elections with large numbers of rural and working class voters is a critical difference between him and the other candidates. We need a national chair with a 50-state strategy — red states, blue states and purple states. Ellison has shown he has the broader appeal that our party needs now more than ever.

Bush, when it comes to balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties, according to a new poll for The Hill.

Thirty-seven percent of voters argue that Obama has been worse than Bush while 15 percent say he has been “about the same.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The results cannot be fully explained as party line responses. More than one in five self-identified Democrats, 21 percent, assert that the Obama administration has not improved upon Bush’s record. So do 23 percent of liberals.

The results are especially striking given the liberal hopes that attended Obama’s election, the opprobrium he heaped upon Bush’s national security policies during the 2008 campaign and his early promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.

The vexing issue of how to balance security with respect for civil liberties has taken center-stage since a document detailing the legal justification for drone strikes on overseas al Qaeda members was leaked to NBC News earlier this month.

The Justice Department “white paper” surfaced ahead of last Thursday’s Senate confirmation hearing of President Obama’s choice for CIA director, his chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan.

The leaked memo stipulates that the government can lawfully kill one of its own citizens overseas if it determines the person has ties to al Qaeda or one of its affiliates and poses an “imminent threat.”

But critics have said the broad language used in the document allows for an elastic interpretation, raising questions over how much authority the administration should have over the lives of American citizens.

Americans are, however, inclined to support the government in its lethal attacks on citizens and non-citizens it deems to be terrorists, according to the Hill Poll.

The poll found that 53 percent of likely voters said it should be legal for the U.S. government to kill non-U.S. citizens who meet that description. Meanwhile, 44 percent said it should be legal for the U.S. government to kill American citizens who it believes are terrorists and present an imminent threat.

By contrast, 21 percent of respondents thought such an action should be illegal if the target is a non-U.S. citizen. A slightly higher percentage of voters, 31 percent, thought killing individuals whom the government believes are terrorists should be illegal when the target is an American citizen.

A significant proportion of respondents — 26 percent and 24 percent, respectively — said they were not sure if such attacks should be legal, regardless of whether the target was an American or not.

When asked whether they oppose or back the administration’s drone program, however, a significantly higher percentage of voters voiced their support. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they support the use of unmanned drones to kill “people in foreign countries whom the US government says are terrorists and present an imminent threat,” while just 19 percent of voters said they oppose the policy.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.

Click here to view data from The Hill Poll.An Army memo says Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl showed signs of mental illness when he walked off his post in Afghanistan in 2009.

The memo was one of a number of new documents released by Bergdahl's defense attorneys Thursday.

It details the findings of a Sanity Board Evaluation that Bergdahl had a "severe mental disease or defect" when he walked off his post and was clinically diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder.

ADVERTISEMENT

Those with schizotypal personality disorder generally don't fully understand the impact of their behavior on others and may develop significant distrust of other people, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Bergdahl is facing a court-martial for charges of desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy for leaving his post in Afghanistan.

He was subsequently captured by the Taliban and held prisoner for five years. He was released in 2014 as part of a prisoner swap by the Obama administration for five senior Taliban commanders held at Guantanamo.

In interviews aired on NPR's "Serial" podcast, Bergdahl said he left his post because he hoped to trigger an alert and gain the attention of senior military leaders. He wanted to alert them to what he believed were dangerous actions by his commanders.

Bergdahl said he believed his commander hated his unit and could purposely send it out on suicide missions.

The board also said, however, that "though SGT Bergdahl did have a severe mental disease or defect at the time of the alleged criminal conduct, he was able to appreciate the nature and quality and wrongfulness of his conduct."

It also said that Bergdahl was not "presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense."

The documents appeared on a website created by Bergdahl's defense attorneys.

Bergdahl is being prosecuted by a military court, and there is no federal repository for court documents.Shortly before the terrorist attacks in Nice, France, The Hill spoke with Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) about his push for NATO action against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

From Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive attacks against American democracy in 2016 designed to elect President Trump to his cyber-invasion of France in 2017 designed to elect far right extremist Marine Le Pen as president of France, which I discussed in my previous column titled “The Battle of Europe,” we must resist and thwart this dangerous assault against democracy.

ADVERTISEMENT

In his Feb. 5 interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, when O’Reilly referred to Putin as a “killer,” Trump replied by morally equating America with Russia. These sickening comments slandering America were unprecedented for an American president and sent chills up the spines of many Republicans as well as Democrats.

In the latest revelations of what I call the Putingate scandal, we learned that Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, was forced out after only three weeks because of conversations with the Russian ambassador, whose ultimate boss is unanimously believed by our intelligence services to have engaged in covert cyber war designed to elect Trump as president.

Flynn lied about these conversations to our people, the press and Vice President Pence. The vice president was so far outside the inner loop of the Trump White House that he was not told for two weeks by the president or his staff that Justice Department and intelligence service leaders were so alarmed they warned the White House that Trump’s then-chief of the National Security Council could be blackmailed by the Russian dictator.

The Putingate scandal is eerily similar to the Watergate scandal. Both cases involve breaking and entering into internal Democratic Party operations for the purpose of electing a Republican president. Both cases involve criminal acts with political motives followed by false denials. Both cases involve attacks against the free press for publishing information that the public has a right and need to know.

Both Putingate and Watergate involve a White House that is contemptuous of the federal judiciary that is a bulwark against authoritarian leaders who are tempted to believe they are above the law. Both involve presidents who at times treated our intelligence services like political enemies rather than guardians of democracy against adversaries who threaten our freedom.

Both Putingate and Watergate involve presidents with well-earned reputations for repeatedly saying things that were not true, surrounded by staff who often mirrored their habit of repeatedly bearing false witness, pitching denials that were repeatedly proven false.

In a stunning similarity between Watergate and Putingate, both the Nixon and Trump administrations included internal voices who exposed untruths and warned Americans against grave dangers that escalate every day. The extraordinary infighting and leaking from within the Trump administration is eerily reminiscent of Deep Throat during the Nixon years exposing wrongdoing through The Washington Post.

With new reports of countless and continuous communications between high-level Trump aides and Russian officials before and after election day, which according to some reports may include Russian intelligence operatives or officials, is there a John Dean-like figure in Trump circles who might reveal what the president knew, and when he knew it?

The EPA congratulatory message came a day after The New York Times reported that agency employees were calling their senators to urge them to vote against Pruitt, who sued the environmental agency more than a dozen times as Oklahoma's top law enforcement official.

That reported backlash from agency employees suggested that Pruitt could face stern internal opposition in his new post, according to the Times.

Government Twitter accounts regularly tweeted unflatteringly about Trump at the start of his administration. Soon after, Trump's staff ordered some government accounts to stop tweeting.

As a presidential candidate, Trump vowed to roll back environmental rules and regulations and expressed a desire to abolish the EPA.A handful of lawmakers tell The Hill they fear that Tuesday's terrorist attacks in Brussels may be a precursor to attacks within the United States in the near future.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito administered the oath of office to Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. President Trump and Vice President Pence, who have sworn in most of the previous Cabinet officials, are both out of town.

The swearing-in ceremony came hours after the Senate voted 52-46 , mostly along party lines, to confirm Pruitt, capping off a frequently contentious nomination process.

ADVERTISEMENT The agency has 15,000 employees around the country and is responsible for enforcing laws on air, water and ground pollution, as well as numerous others.

To Republicans, Pruitt represented in a nominee exactly what the EPA needs: A leader who will roll back Obama’s aggressive environmental agenda and give states more power to enforce environmental laws.

Democrats said that Pruitt’s litigious history with the EPA shows that he does not support its mission. They also pushed to delay his vote pending the release of emails between he and his staff at the attorney general’s office and industry.

Sources say that Trump is planning to visit the EPA soon and sign a number of executive orders concerning regulations and other priorities he would like to get started with at the agency. Inside EPA first reported on the orders earlier this week.

It's Thursday evening here in Washington where President Trump's critics said it felt life Festivus after he spent much of his first full press conference airing his grievances with the intelligence community, the press and Senate Democrats.

Now its time for the feats of strength... "Seinfeld" fans know what I'm talking about.

THE BIG STORIES

President Trump on Thursday announced he was nominating Alexander Acosta to be his Labor secretary, less than 24 hours after his first nominee for the position withdrew amid criticism from Republican senators.

"He has had a tremendous career," Trump said of Acosta in a press conference at the White House, listing off highlights of his nominee's resume. Acosta was not present at the press conference.

"I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of Labor," the president added, noting that Acosta has gotten through the Senate confirmation process before.

Acosta is a former member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and is currently the dean of Florida International University's law school.

A Republican, Acosta served on the NLRB from December 2002 to August 2003 and authored more than 125 opinions, according to his bio on FIU's website.

A Harvard law graduate, he was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2003 to be the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.

Acosta was the first Hispanic U.S. assistant attorney general and longest-serving U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.

If confirmed, he would be Trump's first Hispanic Cabinet member.

Trump was scheduled to meet with members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Thursday afternoon as a courtesy to discuss possible candidates for the Labor secretary position, a source familiar with discussions said.

Picking Acosta ahead of that meeting, the source said, is a surprise and another example that the White House and the RNC are not on the same page.

Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander Lamar AlexanderGOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered Overnight Regulation: Trump's new Labor pick | Trump undoes Obama coal mining rule Trump unveils new pick to head Labor Department MORE (R-Tenn.) praised Acosta's nomination, noting he has been confirmed by the Senate three times before.

"He has an impressive work and academic background," Alexander said. "We will schedule a hearing promptly after his nomination papers arrive in the Senate, and I look forward to exploring his views on how American workers can best adjust to the rapidly changing workplace."

Acosta's selection came a day after Trump's previous labor pick, Andrew Puzder released a statement withdrawing his nomination after it became apparent that he did not have the votes to get confirmed.

Puzder had been slated to have his Senate hearing on Thursday.

Senate leaders had warned the White House that anywhere from four to 12 Republicans planned to oppose Puzder, sinking his chances, according to a CNN report.

Puzder had been under attack by Democrats and labor unions for his record of labor violations as the CEO of the fast food conglomerate CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns the burger chains Hardee's and Carl's Jr.

And he was sure to face tough questions during his hearing on why he hired an illegal immigrant housekeeper and why his ex-wife Lisa Fierstein had accused him of physically abusing her -- accusations she has since retracted.

Business groups were quick to praise Trump for selecting a new nominee so quickly.

"We look forward to learning more about Alexander Acosta and his position on the issues important to the restaurant industry," Cicely Simpson, executive vice President of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

But Allied Progress accused Trump of failing to vet another nominee.

In a statement from the liberal group, Executive Director Karl Frisch called Acosta "wholly unqualified for the job."

"We understand that the President is still reeling from his last failed Labor nomination, but that doesn't mean he should nominate someone who is wholly unqualified for the job," he said.

"Americans deserve a Secretary of Labor who will fight for workplace safety, fair wages, and the rights of working families. It's clear Mr. Acosta is not that person."

Puzder's withdrawal followed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's resignation Monday night. Flynn had reportedly misled senior White House officials about his conversations with Russia.

It was a busy day for Trump.

The president also signed legislation Thursday to end a coal mining rule aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste.

As The Hill's Devin Henry reports, this was the second piece of legislation Trump has signed into law to undo an Obama-era environmental rule. Earlier this week he signed a resolution to do away with a financial disclosure requirement for energy companies.

GOP lawmakers have been using the Congressional Review Act as a new found tool to assail rules finalized in the waning days of the Obama administration.

The rule is reportedly among the former administration's most controversial with industry complaining it was too costly to implement.

QUOTE OF THE DAY

"I don't mind bad stories, I can handle a bad story better than anybody, as long as it's true," Trump said while blasting the media during his press conference Thursday. Read more on Trump's presser here.It is not an overstatement to suggest that every activity we engage in is subject to taxation. The system behind these taxes is a bureaucratic mammoth, a deadweight on the economy. It also erodes public trust in our government. If a person is well-connected and surrounds himself with savvy lawyers and accountants, he might be able to game the system. But struggling families and small-business owners such as my grandparents are not able to bend the rules for personal gain.

ADVERTISEMENT

Nothing illustrates best the debacle that our tax system has become than the federal income tax code. This tax alone, with all its complex rules and interpretations, is estimated to be about 10 million words and rising. The taxes themselves, however, are only a fraction of the cost of having this code. The Mercatus Center estimates the cost of complying with such rules — measured in terms of the time, money and effort that it takes to prepare one’s taxes — to be as high as $600 billion per year. Those are resources that could be used in developing new goods and services, investing in education and infrastructure, and enforcing key social programs.

The best solution to this conundrum is a simple flat tax with no deductions, except for a deduction for each adult and each child. This policy would simplify the process of preparing our taxes, as well as transform our political system by ending the complexity that gives government bureaucrats so much power. Indeed, a flat tax would encourage transparency because politicians would no longer be able to broker tax breaks that favor special interests. Everyone would pay less in taxes and in terms of compliance. Further, studies show that a flat tax would grow the tax base and increase revenue for government. This system would allow hard-working individuals to keep more of their money, underscoring a robust work ethic in society. By eliminating loopholes and requiring everyone to pay their fair share, a flat tax offers a model of fairness and productivity.

Congressional leaders need to lead

I’m a 72-year-old independent voter who can no longer watch our political leaders in Washington act like children and get so little done. I make no party distinctions; they are all equally at fault. While I could go back much further, let me just go back 16 years. We are still talking about immigration — this inaction can be traced back at least 50 years — and we refuse to confront national debt. The date on which we run out of funds for Medicare and Medicaid approaches while Washington does nothing. I have no idea if President Trump can fix things. My issue is mainly with our Congress. “We the people” have elected 535 “leaders” that have been pretty much ineffective. It’s our fault for electing them, and it’s their fault for not performing. Consider this: The top four congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump Senate confirms Pruitt to lead EPA MORE (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Democrats declare victory after Puzder bows out MORE (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — have been in Congress for about 116 combined years. We have a Congress led by senior members who cannot lead, deliberate, solve problems or act in a civil manner. However, I would give them a perfect score for being childish. Along that line, I’m asking Americans to consider March 10, 2017, as our first — and, hopefully, last — “Pacifier Day.” If interested, citizens would send pacifiers to the four leaders named above. They would be a reminder to them that we the people are not paying children.

A power outage occurs during the confirmation hearing of Rep. Mike Pompeop (R-Kan.) to be the director of the Central Intelligence Agency on Thursday. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing was moved to the Dirksen Senate Office Building.A mood of economic gloom hangs over the nation as President Obama and Republican leaders scramble to strike a deficit deal that avoids automatic tax hikes and spending cuts, according to a new poll for The Hill.

The poll, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, found nearly 6-in-10 people (59 percent) feel the country is on the wrong track. It also showed people are deeply pessimistic about their chances for future prosperity, with 54 percent saying they believe their children will be worse off as adults than their parents.

The poll results cast a shadow over talks in Washington aimed at averting the “fiscal cliff” of $500 billion in tax hikes and $109 billion in automatic spending cuts set to take effect Jan. 1.

Barely a month after Obama won a second term, and even as the nation continues to make modest job gains, fewer than 1-in-3 (31 percent) say the country is on the right track.

Only 34 percent of people feel they will be better off at the end of Obama’s second term than they are right now. And just 16 percent believe a better economic future awaits their children when they grow up.

The dour sentiment is particularly striking among Republicans, who were crestfallen over GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s defeat on Nov. 6.

Among voters who identified themselves as Republicans, 87 percent said the country is on the wrong track and a mere 8 percent said it is on the right track.

Seven-in-10 Republicans believe they will be worse off at the end of Obama’s presidency, and 80 percent said their children’s future is bleaker than their own.

Only 4 percent of Republicans think their children will be better off.

By contrast, Democrats are in a somewhat sunnier — though not overwhelmingly upbeat — post-election mood. Fifty-four percent of Democrats said they think the country is on the right track compared to 31 percent who said it is on the wrong track.

Six-in-10 Democrats, meanwhile, believe they’ll be better off in four years.

But even Democrats are worried about the country’s long-term future. Only 30 percent said their children face a brighter future and 30 percent said they will be worse off.

African Americans — who have endured high unemployment rates throughout the economic recession and recovery — are more upbeat about the country’s future than white Americans, the poll found.

While just 30 percent of whites said the country is on the right track, 44 percent of black voters believe the nation is headed in the right direction.

Similarly, 64 percent of blacks believe their families will be better off in four years compared to just 30 percent of whites. Over the long term, 56 percent of African Americans say their children face a brighter future, compared to 10 percent of whites.

The poll was taken Dec. 13 among 1,000 likely voters and is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.

The poll’s sample was 32 percent Republican, 38 percent Democrat and 30 percent who identified as neither.

Voters are evenly divided in their views on the country’s overall ideological leaning, the poll found.

Twenty-six percent of people said they believe the United States is a predominantly left-of-center nation, while 30 percent feel it is a right-of-center country. Another 25 percent felt the U.S. is neither right nor left.

Among Democrats, only 17 percent said they believe the U.S. is a left-of-center country, compared to 29 percent of Republicans who felt that way.

A near-equal number of Democrats and Republicans (31 percent and 30 percent, respectively) said the U.S. is predominantly a right-of-center country.

The Hill’s poll found a strikingly large number of voters, 59 percent, believe the U.S. is less admired around the globe than it was four years ago when Obama took office. Just 37 percent said the country is much more, or somewhat more, admired than it was four years ago.

When Obama took office, he pledged to try and restore the nation’s international standing, which he felt had been damaged during George W. Bush’s presidency.

Republicans strongly feel the opposite has occurred, with 87 percent saying the country is somewhat or much less admired than it was four years ago. Only 10 percent of Republicans say the country’s image has improved.

Sixty-five percent of Democrats say the country is more admired now than when Bush left office, while 32 percent say it is less admired.

President-elect Donald Trump released a video on Monday night touting his executive agenda.

Take a look at the top six items Trump hopes to enact in his first 100 days in office.The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is requesting a meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials over recent raids on undocumented immigrants.

Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), who chairs the caucus, sent a letter to ICE asking for “an open and candid discussion” on the enforcement changes, saying the raids "have struck fear in the hearts of the immigrant community.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“It is critical that we meet with you in person immediately to discuss the impact these raids have had on our communities as well as obtain clarifying guidance on how ICE policies will differ from the last Administration,” the letter reads.

Democratic Reps. Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), Lucille Roybal-Allard (Calif.), John Conyers (Mich.), Luis Gutierrez Luis GutierrezDems: White House canceled ICE immigration meeting ICE head cancels meeting with Hispanic Dems Hispanics are split in DNC race MORE (Ill.) and Judy Chu (Calif.) also signed the letter calling for a meeting by Wednesday.

The letter stated that congressional offices had contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security about the recent raids in California, but has yet to year back about the enforcement.

A report on Friday said more than 300 undocumented immigrants had been arrested in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Chicago in raids this week.

An ICE official in the Los Angeles office called the raid an “enforcement surge,” but maintained that they were routine.

Trump last month signed an executive order on immigration that ended the “catch and release” policy that allowed people who crossed the border to return to Mexico without being detained.Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) on Friday blasted President Trump's job performance, accusing the commander-in-chief of not keeping his campaign promises.



“Let’s be honest, this is not the presidency we were promised," the freshman senator said in the Democratic weekly address.



"Americans deserve a president whose word they can trust, but the number of broken promises are adding up quickly."

“This president has certainly made a lot of promises, but so far he has an abysmal record of keeping them."

Duckworth argued that Trump did not live up to his pledge to separate himself from his business interests and fight for the jobs of the middle-class factory workers and farmers across the nation.“We can and must do better. Senate Democrats believe we need officials at every level of government capable of doing their jobs," she said."Despite the president’s promise to 'drain the swamp,' he has selected senior advisers and Cabinet officials who are unqualified, poorly vetted and ethically challenged — many are his old Wall Street friends."Duckworth also called for an independent investigation into Michael Flynn's contact with Moscow.It may be the first time that Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE and the ACLU ever agreed on anything. On Nov. 9, 2016, the ACLU issued a statement with a direct message to the president-elect. When it comes to many of his proposed policies — deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, reauthorizing torture or a ban on Muslims entering the country — the ACLU said simply: “See you in court.”

Ironically enough, when Trump lost his appeal on a ban on nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries entering the U.S. before the 9th District Court of Appeals last week, he tweeted the same message: “See you in court.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Those four words speak volumes. They demonstrate that both sides recognize the critical role of the courts in the Trump administration’s ability to carry out its agenda. They also show that opponents of Trump’s policies realize that their only hope for stopping him lies not in the hands of a cowardly Congress, but in the heads of judges sworn to uphold the Constitution.

Trump’s disdain for the judiciary is nothing new. It first surfaced in May 2016 when he attacked U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the Southern District of California for being “Mexican” and therefore unable to reach a fair verdict in a case against Trump University. Curiel was actually born in the United States.

The latest judge to feel his wrath was Seattle’s James Robart, a Republican appointed to the federal court by former President George W. Bush. When Robart ruled that Trump’s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries was likely unconstitutional, Trump called his ruling “ridiculous,” dismissed him as a “so-called judge” and falsely claimed that his decision meant “anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into the U.S.”

The legal wrangling didn’t end there, and neither did Trump’s attacks on judges. When a three-judge panel of the 9th District Court upheld the hold placed on the Muslim ban by Judge Robart, Trump accused them of issuing a “political decision” and suggested that “even a bad student in high school” could have done a better job, comments that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, found “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”

But over the weekend, Trump’s senior advisor Stephen Miller out-Trumped Trump. Questioning the role of the judiciary on Sunday talk shows, Miller made the jaw-dropping assertion “that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.”

Really? The president’s powers “will not be questioned?” What country are we living in? Vladimir Putin’s Russia? It makes you wonder whether Donald Trump and his team have read the Constitution or taken Civics 101. Does he even know there are three equal branches of government? Does he understand that not even the president has unlimited or unchecked power?

In its consideration of the Muslim ban, the 9th Circuit heard that argument by the administration and shot it down: “There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.”

Thanks to the genius of our Founding Fathers, our protection from the overreaching and illegal actions of President Donald Trump is built into the Constitution. And the Trump administration will soon learn: Black robes matter.

But the public also feel strongly that the budget should be balanced on the back of reductions to defense spending rather than through cuts to programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

ADVERTISEMENT

As the clock ticks down on any possibility of averting the sequester’s across-the-board spending cuts, a solid 58 percent of respondents in The Hill Poll prioritized cutting America’s debt over maintaining current spending levels on domestic and military programs. This figure is almost double the share of voters, 28 percent, who believed the opposite.

In order to reduce America’s debts and deficits, more than twice as many voters said they would support defense cuts as said they would support cuts to social programs.

Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would support cutting military spending, while just 23 percent said they would support slashing Social Security and Medicare. An overwhelming majority, 69 percent, said they would oppose cuts to social programs.

The findings are particularly striking as Washington prepares for the looming sequester. Cuts amounting to $85 billion are scheduled to go into effect on March 1 if Congress cannot come to an agreement over deficit reduction.

Both parties agree that sequestration would have a damaging effect on the economy, but so far neither side has shown much willingness to compromise. President Obama has proposed the outline of a deal that would contain equal amounts of new revenues and spending cuts, but Republicans have refused to countenance new taxes and have complained that Obama’s plan is overly vague.

Some voters appeared to cross party lines in their views on how to reduce the debt.

High numbers of both Republicans and Democrats said they would oppose cuts to social programs: 62 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats opposed cutting Medicare and Social Security, while just 29 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of Democrats supported potential cuts in those areas.

Notably, a higher percentage of Republicans opposed cuts to social programs (62 percent) than professed opposition to defense cuts (56 percent).

Further underlining the general preference for reductions in defense spending over cuts to social programs, 37 percent of respondents said America spends too much on the military, while just 18 percent said America spends too little.

Party affiliation is a factor underlying voters’ choice between cutting the debt and maintaining spending levels, the survey found. Sixty-seven percent of Republicans say cutting America’s debt is the more pressing need, in contrast to just 43 percent of Democrats. Conversely, 23 percent of Republicans said maintaining domestic and military programs at their current levels should be the priority. However, just 36 percent of Democrats prioritized maintaining current spending levels.

Notably, respondents who identified themselves with neither party appeared to align themselves with Republicans on the general issue of debt versus spending: 66 percent said cutting America’s debt was more important, while just 22 percent chose maintaining current spending levels.

When asked whether America spends too much, too little or about the right amount on the military, voters also tended to break along party lines. But those respondents who identified as “Other” tended to align themselves with Democrats on that question: 49 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of those who identified as “Other” said America spends too much on the military, while just 13 and 12 percent, respectively, said America spends too little. Similarly, voters who viewed themselves as “centrist” tended to express similar views to those who identified themselves as “liberal.”

Washington gridlock aside, some economists have pointed in recent months to positive economic news, like a recovery in the housing market and the rise of consumer spending. But in the face of the squabbling over the sequester, just 15 percent of likely voters say their personal financial position has improved over the past 12 months, while 37 percent of voters say it has gotten worse and 47 percent say it has stayed about the same. Democrats tended to be more optimistic: 20 percent of Democratic respondents said their situation had improved, while just 7 percent of Republicans agreed. A full 50 percent of Republicans said their situation had gotten worse, while just 24 percent of Democrats took such a negative view.

The findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 21 by Pulse Opinion Research.

“This plane was built right here in the great state of South Carolina,” Trump said. “Our goal as a nation is to rely less on imports and rely more on products made here in the USA.”

Boeing rolled out its first 787-10 aircraft in dramatic fashion on Friday afternoon, kicking off the event with a prayer and theme music and ending with Trump exclaiming, “God bless Boeing.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The new aircraft, the latest and biggest model of Boeing’s Dreamliner family, is exclusively made in the company’s facility in North Charleston, S.C.

“The name says it all: Dreamliner,” Trump said. “Our country is all about making dreams come true.”

Boeing’s stock appeared to hit an all-time high at 1:55 p.m. of $173 per share, around the time Trump ended his speech.

Trump, who has been critical of the high cost of Boeing’s Air Force One contract, is the first sitting president to visit Boeing’s South Carolina facility.

The aircraft manufacturing industry contributes billions to the economy and supports millions of jobs. In South Carolina alone, the industry supports more than 100,000 jobs and generates $19 billion annually in economic activity, according to Boeing.

Trump touted his efforts to save American jobs and threatened a “substantial penalty” on companies that shift their operations overseas. The president told the crowd that manufacturing jobs were already coming back to the country and highlighted language he put into an executive order requiring pipelines to be made with U.S. steel.

“As your president, I’m going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work,” Trump said. “It has to be much easier for manufacturers in our country, and much harder [for them] to leave.”

The speech represented a return to the core economic message of Trump's campaign.

It comes at a time when his White House is struggling to maintain focus after being thrown off course by a seemingly endless string of controversies.

A day earlier, Trump held a rollicking 77-minute news conference in which he denied reports detailing a White House consumed by chaos, deepened his ongoing feud with the media and parried questions about his team's ties to Russia.

Trump, who owns his own fleet of aircrafts, gushed over the 787-10. He took a tour of the cockpit following the speech and was spotted sitting in the pilot’s seat, according to pool reports.

“That is one beautiful airplane,” he said. “Congrats to the men and women here who have built it. What an amazing piece of art. What an amazing piece of work.”

The event comes after Trump harshly criticized Boeing before his Jan. 20 inauguration, calling for the company to lose its contract over the high cost of its Air Force One plane.

A Government Accountability Office report from March 2016 estimated the cost of two new Air Force One planes at roughly $3.2 billion before their scheduled completion in 2023.

“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016. “Cancel order!”

Boeing’s CEO said last month that his company has since made inroads with Trump on shrinking the cost of the next generation of Air Force One planes.

“We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Dennis Muilenburg told reporters after meeting with Trump on Jan. 17. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there.”

On Friday, Trump acknowledged that the contract was a “difficult project,” but said “we’re getting closer and closer.”The Director of the Coalition for Life Sciences is responsible for coordinating all programs and advocacy activities that serve the mission of the Coalition for Life Sciences (CLS), according to the direction from the Board of Directors and leadership from the CLS member organizations.

Welcome to Overnight Regulation, your daily rundown of news from the federal agencies, Capitol Hill, the courts and beyond. It's Wednesday evening here in Washington where it's been an eventful week. First Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Adviser and now Andy Puzder, Trump's pick for Labor secretary, is out too.

Here's the latest.

THE BIG STORY

Andy Puzder on Wednesday withdrew his nomination to be President Trump's Labor secretary, avoiding what would have been a rocky confirmation battle.

"After careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for secretary of Labor. I am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE to lead the Department of Labor and put America's workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity," he said in a statement.

Puzder thanked his family and backers who voiced support for "the policies and new thinking I would have brought to America as secretary of Labor."

"While I won't be serving in the administration, I fully support the president and his highly qualified team," Puzder said.

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee was scheduled to consider Puzder's nomination Thursday in a hearing that had previously been delayed five times.

Top GOP members reportedly urged the White House to withdraw Puzder's nomination, according to CNN.

Puzder, the CEO of the fast-food conglomerate that owns the burger chains Hardee's and Carl's Jr., has been under attack by Democrats and outside groups for weeks for admitting he hired an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper and past allegations that he abused his ex-wife and treated employees poorly.

Oprah Winfrey's network reportedly provided committee members with a copy of a 1990 episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" in which Puzder's ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, reportedly appeared in disguise to speak out as a domestic violence victim.

She discussed allegations of physical abuse against her former husband in the show. Fierstein has since retracted her allegations, including in a recent letter to the Senate committee, Politico reported.

In a call with reporters Wednesday, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who is now running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, called the news of Puzder's withdrawal just another day of chaos in the Trump administration.

"Through this appointment he's shown he was trying to make it harder for workers to get ahead and stay ahead," he said of President Trump.

"I'm pleased, but not optimistic the next pick will have any more moral authority given that the president has taken so many actions not to drain the swamp, but make sure the swamp full of his Wall Street cronies."

The news of Puzder bowing out comes less than two days after Michael Flynn resigned as Trump's national security adviser amid reports that he misled senior White House officials about his conversations with Russia.

Perez said Puzder, like Flynn, was not only incompetent, but also dangerous.

"If I had half the transgressions of Andy Puzder I never would have gotten through," he said.

Puzder supporters, meanwhile, called his decision "extremely unfortunate."

"Andy Puzder would have made a great Labor Secretary," Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

"We hope that President Trump's next Labor Secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy."

(Source: Federal Register)A bipartisan duo in the Senate is planning to craft legislation to advance autonomous vehicle technology as part of a major congressional effort to speed up the deployment of self-driving cars.



Sen. John Thune John ThuneVerizon angling to lower price of Yahoo purchase: report Congress should take hands off the wheel of self-driving cars Ryan tries to save tax plan MORE (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) announced Monday that they are exploring ways to reduce hurdles for self-driving car manufacturers.



While Congress has held multiple hearings on the emerging technology, there are not yet significant federal laws governing the development and operation of self-driving vehicles.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released voluntary guidelines last fall that created a 15-point safety assessment for automakers with the hope of eventually taking the checklist through the formal rulemaking process.“As we seek to identify areas where Congress should assist innovators in bringing this new technology to our roads, we will work closely with our colleagues, interested safety and mobility advocates, and other leaders in automated vehicle technology to find solutions that enable the safe testing and deployment of self-driving vehicles and assure public confidence,” the senators said in a statement.“We both recognize that public policy must adapt to this new, rapidly-changing technology to ensure the federal government maintains safety while leaving room for innovators to reach their full potential.”The announcement comes prior to a House hearing on Tuesday exploring driverless cars, in which automakers are expected to plead with lawmakers to ease current industry safety regulations.Under current standards, for example, cars are required to have a steering wheel and floor pedals. Autonomous vehicle makers need to apply for an exemption, but federal officials can only grant 2,500 per year, which could become a problem as more companies seek to develop the technology.Raising the cap could be one legislative solution. Thune and Peters hinted that their joint initiative will explore how current standards may impede autonomous vehicle development.“Many current federal vehicle safety standards reference placement of driver controls and other systems that assume a human operator,” they said.“While these requirements make sense in today’s conventional vehicles, they could inhibit innovation or create hazards for self-driving vehicles. Left on its own, the slow pace of regulation could become a significant obstacle to the development of new and safer vehicle technology in the United States.”But the lawmakers said they are “particularly interested” in how they could improve regulatory flexibility for self-driving cars without changing regulations that impact conventional automobiles.Another issue likely to come up is the increasing concern over states advancing their own laws on the topic, thus creating a messy patchwork of regulations. The NHTSA guidance sought to clarify the state versus federal role, but some critics have said there is still a lack of clarity.“Our effort will also include a discussion on the existing patchwork of laws and regulations and the traditional roles of federal and state regulators,” Thune and Peters said.It may be the first time that Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE and the ACLU ever agreed on anything. On Nov. 9, 2016, the ACLU issued a statement with a direct message to the president-elect. When it comes to many of his proposed policies — deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, reauthorizing torture or a ban on Muslims entering the country — the ACLU said simply: “See you in court.”

Ironically enough, when Trump lost his appeal on a ban on nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries entering the U.S. before the 9th District Court of Appeals last week, he tweeted the same message: “See you in court.”

Those four words speak volumes. They demonstrate that both sides recognize the critical role of the courts in the Trump administration’s ability to carry out its agenda. They also show that opponents of Trump’s policies realize that their only hope for stopping him lies not in the hands of a cowardly Congress, but in the heads of judges sworn to uphold the Constitution.

Trump’s disdain for the judiciary is nothing new. It first surfaced in May 2016 when he attacked U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the Southern District of California for being “Mexican” and therefore unable to reach a fair verdict in a case against Trump University. Curiel was actually born in the United States.

The latest judge to feel his wrath was Seattle’s James Robart, a Republican appointed to the federal court by former President George W. Bush. When Robart ruled that Trump’s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries was likely unconstitutional, Trump called his ruling “ridiculous,” dismissed him as a “so-called judge” and falsely claimed that his decision meant “anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into the U.S.”

The legal wrangling didn’t end there, and neither did Trump’s attacks on judges. When a three-judge panel of the 9th District Court upheld the hold placed on the Muslim ban by Judge Robart, Trump accused them of issuing a “political decision” and suggested that “even a bad student in high school” could have done a better job, comments that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, found “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”

But over the weekend, Trump’s senior advisor Stephen Miller out-Trumped Trump. Questioning the role of the judiciary on Sunday talk shows, Miller made the jaw-dropping assertion “that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.”

Really? The president’s powers “will not be questioned?” What country are we living in? Vladimir Putin’s Russia? It makes you wonder whether Donald Trump and his team have read the Constitution or taken Civics 101. Does he even know there are three equal branches of government? Does he understand that not even the president has unlimited or unchecked power?

In its consideration of the Muslim ban, the 9th Circuit heard that argument by the administration and shot it down: “There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.”

Thanks to the genius of our Founding Fathers, our protection from the overreaching and illegal actions of President Donald Trump is built into the Constitution. And the Trump administration will soon learn: Black robes matter.

It found that 66 percent believe paltry job growth and slow economic recovery is the result of bad policy. Thirty-four percent say Obama is the most to blame, followed by 23 percent who say Congress is the culprit. Twenty percent point the finger at Wall Street, and 18 percent cite former President George W. Bush.

The results highlight the reelection challenge Obama faces amid dissatisfaction with his first-term performance on the economy.

The poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, found 53 percent of voters say Obama has taken the wrong actions and has slowed the economy down. Forty-two percent said he has taken the right actions to revive the economy, while six percent said they were not sure.

Obama has argued throughout the presidential campaign that his policies have made the economy better. He says recovery is taking a long time because he inherited such deep economic trouble upon taking office in 2009.

“The problems we’re facing right now have been more than a decade in the making,” he told an audience last month in Cleveland.

Obama’s campaign, under the slogan “Forward,” has sought to steer voter attention less toward current and past economic performance and more toward questions about Republican Mitt Romney’s work in the private sector economy. It has launched attacks on the challenger’s role as head of the private equity firm Bain Capital, casting him as a jobs “outsourcer” whose firm shipped thousands of U.S. positions overseas.

The Hill Poll, however, shows the extent to which voters hold Obama responsible for the economy and reveals his vulnerability should the election become primarily a referendum on his economic management.

It finds that voters strongly believe more could have been done by the White House and in Congress to achieve growth in the economy and employment.

While 64 percent of voters consider this downturn to be “much more severe” than previous contractions, barely one quarter (26 percent) say the agonizingly slow pace of the recovery was unavoidable.

While voters feel Obama carries a greater portion of the blame than others, the poll found almost 6-in-10 are unhappy with the actions of Republicans in Congress who have challenged the president on an array of policy initiatives.

Fifty-seven percent of voters said congressional Republicans have impeded the recovery with their policies, and only 30 percent overall believe the GOP has done the right things to boost the economy.

The tension between a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Democratic-run White House has also featured in Obama’s campaign strategy.

In his economic speech last month in Cleveland, Obama cast the 2012 election as a chance to choose between two competing visions for the nation.

“What’s holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction America should take,” he said. “This election is your chance to break that stalemate.”

Romney agrees that the election is a choice between two radically different views of America, but he characterizes it as a contest between his own vision of an industrious people free to achieve their dreams and Obama’s faith in big government.

If there is a silver lining for Obama in the poll results, it’s that centrist voters, who may well decide the 2012 outcome, tend to blame Republicans in Congress more than the president for hindering a more robust recovery.

Twenty-six percent of centrists cited Congress as most to blame for U.S. economic woes, compared to 20 percent who blame Obama.

Similarly, 53 percent of centrists said Obama has taken the right actions as president to boost the economy, compared with 38 percent who said he had taken the wrong steps.

Seventy-nine percent of centrist voters said Republicans had slowed the economy by taking wrong actions. Only 13 percent of centrists credited GOP lawmakers with policies that have helped the economy.

The poll found sharp differences in opinions along racial lines, with 94 percent of African-Americans saying Obama had taken the right actions on the economy, compared to 34 percent of white voters.

The Hill poll was conducted July 19 among 1,000 likely voters, and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.

A bill designed to require a review of economic costs of adding a species to the endangered or threatened species list before doing so under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was introduced in the House of Representatives. Reps. Michael Burgess Michael BurgessCongress must not pass Endangered Species reform bill Trump admin moves to 'stabilize' ObamaCare markets Trump touts border crackdown MORE, Louie Gohmert Louie GohmertCongress must not pass Endangered Species reform bill Gohmert calls Yates 'a political hack' Dem Castro weighs challenge to Cruz MORE and Brian Babin, all Texas Republicans, co-sponsored H.R. 717, which was introduced Jan. 27 and referred to the House Natural Resources Committee.

This bill is absurd.

ADVERTISEMENT

It is foolish to suggest that the experts making a decision to classify or not based on anything other than the data that will allow them to determine if it meets the definition. The definition per the Endangered Species Act is, “any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.” By definition, a species is endangered if those conditions are met, and is threatened if it is likely to meet those criteria within the foreseeable future. If a species meets the criteria as defined, it is endangered; it is endangered regardless of how convenient it is to any of us. Science cannot be dictated by politics or economics.

Revising the Endangered Species Act as proposed is also impractical, and would introduce additional cost to carrying out the process of making a species determination. Currently, only after a species has been listed is a recovery plan created to map out a plan to save the species. To request that this process be undertaken prior to determining if a species even is endangered and thus determining if a plan is even needed at all, is a ludicrous waste of the very dollars the co-sponsors of this bill assuredly wish to save.

The economic cost of not protecting a species is left out of these economic equations, and is often difficult to predict or calculate. With any species proposed for the list, there are these “hidden” economic values to their existence. Every species plays a role in an ecosystem, and other species will be impacted by their loss. Ignoring what we do not know could have unexpected consequences.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is in danger of having its ability to protect wildlife stripped away. Our Congress must not pass H.R. 717 and must continue to stand for the preservation of the resources that we are responsible for stewarding responsibly. Future generations depend on it.

See more of Bernal's reporting hereIt sounds odd to express happiness over being sued. There are, however, situations where being sued shows that you are fighting for justice and what is right. That was the position I found myself in when I was sued by a predatory lending company that was targeting 9/11 survivors.

Just recently, the New York State attorney general and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) accused a third-party lending company, RD Legal, of fraud and predatory business practices.

It was the latest twist in a saga that began because former New York City Police Officer Elmer Santiago was forced to retire due to severe lung disease he developed as a result of exposure to the toxic dust at the World Trade Center site following the 9/11 attacks on our nation.

ADVERTISEMENT

It was the same disease that took the life of another of my clients, NYPD Officer James Zadroga , for whom the federal Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act is named, and to whom the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund (VCF) is dedicated.

The Zadroga Act was originally enacted in 2011 with a five-year expiration date. In 2015, the topic of extending healthcare coverage and compensation for injured 9/11 victims was heavily debated in Congress and the media. In December 2015, Congress reauthorized the Zadroga Health & Compensation Act. Healthcare coverage was extended through 2090 and compensation was extended through 2020.

In 2014, the VCF awarded Mr. Santiago compensation for his injuries and future lost income. At the time, he had been forced into retirement and, with no income, was in dire financial straits, living out of the back of his Jeep, his family sleeping on friends’ couches. As part of the normal VCF protocol, Mr. Santiago had to wait until 2016 to receive his federal compensation.

Desperate to provide his family with a home and relocate to an environment that eased his chronic breathing problems, Mr. Santiago utilized his federal VCF award letter as collateral for a loan from that third-party lender and purchased a modest home in Florida.

The lender gave the disabled former police officer a $355,000 loan at 19 percent interest, an unusually high rate, especially given that his collateral was backed by the most secure entity known, the United States Treasury. However, due to his family’s dire financial straits, Mr. Santiago agreed to those arduous terms.

Eighteen months later he received his full VCF award payment. He was shocked to discover that RD Legal was demanding not just the $355,000 he had borrowed but an additional $505,000 in interest. This amounted to an outrageous interest rate of 67 percent. While I am certainly not an expert in banking laws, this appeared to be financial usury.

On Mr. Santiago’s behalf, I repaid RD Legal the $355,000 principal it had given Mr. Santiago, but I refused to pay any interest without the approval of the NYS attorney general and the Department of Justice, which administers both the CFPB and the VCF. When I told RD Legal that I was blowing the whistle on them, it sued both Mr. Santiago and my firm. Never has being sued felt so good!

Thankfully, both the New York AG and CFPB were willing to investigate. Apparently, Mr. Santiago was just one of many 9/11 responders who was victimized by this lending company. Just last week, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced that his office and the CFPB were commencing suit against RD Legal, alleging predatory lending to 9/11 victims and to sick, retired NFL players awaiting concussion litigation settlements.

I am honored to have represented NYPD Detective Zadroga, as well as some 10,000 other sick 9/11 first responders, local residents and office workers. I have worked closely with all three VCF special masters: Kenneth Feinberg, Sheila Birnbaum and its current leader, Rupa Bhattacharyya. Both the first VCF, created in 2001, and the Zadroga VCF created in 2011 have been staffed by incredibly professional and dedicated public servants. They work tirelessly to ensure that those whose lives were altered by the attacks are treated with respect and dignity.

The recent actions we take in union with the New York attorney general and the CFPB are no less critical. These first responders answered the call when our nation and New York City needed them. Though no fault of their own, they became ill. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has linked 68 cancers to the WTC toxins. Thanks to the Zadroa Act, both houses of Congress and the president showed their support. I am delighted that other governmental entities continue to look out for our first responders who were victimized on 9/11. They shouldn’t be victims again.

Let’s hope that Attorney General Schneiderman and CFPB Director Richard Cordray win justice for them.

Michael Barasch is an attorney and managing partner at Barasch McGarry Salzman & Penson. His law firm has over 36 years of experience representing injured NYC firefighters. The firm has represented more 9/11 victims before the Victim Compensation Fund than any other firm in the country. In 1997, he was appointed to the Urban Justice Center’s Board of Directors, an organization that represents battered women, runaway youths, disabled veterans, the mentally ill and the homeless.

Fifty-four percent of those surveyed in the poll said that the White House should continue the tours of the mansion, while 28 percent said they should not be resumed. The poll found that 18 percent were unsure of whether the tours should be brought back.

The national survey of 1000 likely voters was conducted on March 14. It has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

The White House has been on the defensive since announcing tours would be canceled because of the $85 billion in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.

It’s the most high-profile stumble by the White House in the messaging war over the sequester, as congressional Republicans have repeatedly criticized the decision as a stunt to hurt Congress, where lawmakers have long arranged White House tours for their constituents. One Republican raised the issue during President Obama’s meeting with the conference this week, provoking the only tense moment of an otherwise polite back and forth.

The White House has taken responsibility for the decision but has suggested it was ultimately made by the Secret Service, which spends about $74,000 a week for the tours. White House officials have said that the Secret Service made the decision in order to maintain its core mission and to avoid furloughs and other cutbacks stemming from the cuts.

“We had to cancel the tours. It's our job to cancel the tours,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. "[The Secret Service] cannot cancel them ... this is not a tour of the Secret Service building. It's a tour of the White House and the grounds, and we run the tours and the invitations and that process.”

But Carney went on to blame Republicans for triggering the sequester.

"Let’s go back to the fact that none of this was necessary,” he said. “These choices are all bad. ... I think we’re now seeing that there are unhappy results of sequester. It may be a home run in some folks’ eyes, a victory for the Tea Party for some. But it’s bad for America."

Even before he heard from lawmakers, Obama, sensing the public outcry over the move, said in an interview with ABC News this week that the White House is looking into ways of continuing with some tours for students.

“What I’m asking ... is, are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups who may have traveled here with some bake sales,” Obama said. “Can we make sure that kids, potentially, can still come to tour?”

So far, it's unclear when the tours will resume.

"I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of Labor," the president added, noting that Acosta has gotten through the Senate confirmation process before.

Acosta is a former member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and is currently the dean of Florida International University’s law school.

A Republican, Acosta served on the NLRB from December 2002 to August 2003 and authored more than 125 opinions, according to his bio on FIU’s website.

ADVERTISEMENT A Harvard law graduate, he was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2003 to be the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.

Acosta was the first Hispanic U.S. assistant attorney general and longest-serving U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.

If confirmed, he would be Trump’s first Hispanic Cabinet member.

Trump was scheduled to meet with members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Thursday afternoon as a courtesy to discuss possible candidates for the Labor secretary position, a source familiar with discussions said. Picking Acosta ahead of that meeting, the source said, is a surprise and another example that the White House and the RNC are not on the same page.

One day before a scheduled Senate hearing, Andrew Puzder released a statement Wednesday afternoon withdrawing his nomination after it became apparent that he did not have the votes to get confirmed.

Senate leaders had warned the White House that anywhere from four to 12 Republicans planned to oppose Puzder, sinking his chances, according to a CNN report.

Puzder had been under attack by Democrats and labor unions for his record of labor violations as the CEO of the fast food conglomerate CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns the burger chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.

And he was sure to face tough questions during his hearing on why he hired an illegal immigrant to clean his home and why his ex-wife Lisa Fierstein had accused him of physically abusing her — accusations she has since retracted.

“If President Trump is remotely serious about standing up for workers, he will nominate someone for Labor Secretary that champions workers’ rights rather than suppresses them.”

Business groups were quick to praise Trump for selecting a new nominee so quickly. “We look forward to learning more about Alexander Acosta and his position on the issues important to the restaurant industry,” Cicely Simpson, executive vice President of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement. The National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons called Acosta a “proven leader, who understands the complexities of the modern workplace.” “We are hopeful that he will listen to manufacturers’ concerns as we work to strengthen employer–employee relationships and provide workers with the right skills to succeed,” Timmons said in a statement. “In recent years, regulations coming out of the Department of Labor have too often been overreaching and counterproductive, harming manufacturers’ abilities to create jobs and do what’s best for the millions of hardworking men and women employed in manufacturing careers.” But Allied Progress accused Trump of failing to vet another nominee. The liberal group pointed to a 2008 report on an investigation into the allegations of politicized hiring and other improper personnel actions in the civil rights division in which the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General said Acosta did not take sufficient action in response to information he was provided about potential problems with the conduct and judgment of his Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bradley Schlozman. Acosta had received reports that Schlozman had hired unqualified applicants and forwarded a racially insensitive email to other department officials, according to the report. “Although these incidents did not directly relate to the consideration of political or ideological affiliations in hiring, these matters should have put Acosta on notice of potential problems with Schlozman’s conduct and judgment,” the report said. The report went on to find that Schlozman, first as a deputy assistant attorney general and then as principal deputy assistant attorney general and acting assistant attorney general, considered political and ideological affiliations in hiring career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division. "In doing so, he violated federal law – the Civil Service Reform Act – and Department policy that prohibit discrimination in federal employment based on political and ideological affiliations, and committed misconduct," the OIG said in its report. In a statement, Allied Progress Executive Director Karl Frisch called Acosta “wholly unqualified for the job.” “We understand that the President is still reeling from his last failed Labor nomination, but that doesn’t mean he should nominate someone who is wholly unqualified for the job,” he said. “Americans deserve a Secretary of Labor who will fight for workplace safety, fair wages, and the rights of working families. It’s clear Mr. Acosta is not that person.”

Puzder’s withdrawal followed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's resignations Monday night. Flynn had reportedly misled senior White House officials about his conversations with Russia.

- Updated at 2:39 p.m.Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) is making a bold prediction: that the GOP Congress working with President Trump will be the most productive “in our lifetimes.”

In an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity that aired Thursday, Ryan said patience now will lead to a big payoff later in the Trump administration.

Hannity pressed Ryan on when Congress would starting moving to repeal and replace the healthcare law.

“People have been asking me — it’s the top story on the Drudge Report today. Where’s Congress, because for eight years, you guys had a plan. You kept saying and promising you'll repeal, replace ObamaCare. And I guess what people want to know is, when are these things going to get done?” Hannity asked.

“I would love to do this stuff yesterday, but getting Congress to act on all those things you just said in just one year’s time — unprecedented!” Ryan said. “This will be the most productive presidency and Congress in our lifetimes.”

At the same time, Ryan noted that the Senate typically moves legislation at a slower pace than the House, something that could be a source of tension in the months ahead.

“We have cushion in our schedule, if anything slips because of Senate issues, we still have time to accommodate all of that stuff in 2017," he said.

“So I have cushions built in the schedule to make sure this all gets done in 2017 in case something happens and goes sideways on the Senate.”

Hannity, an ally of Trump who is a force on the right, has in the past been critical of Ryan, especially during last year's election. But they appear to have buried the hatchet, with the Speaker making appearances on Hannity's program this year.

Ryan insisted Trump and GOP lawmakers are "exactly on track" to accomplish their agenda, even though Republicans haven't coalesced around specific legislation yet to fulfill their pledges of repealing and replacing ObamaCare and overhauling the tax code.

GOP leaders have talked of their agenda being enacted in the first 200 days of Trump's tenure, rather than the first 100 days.

Trump, in a combative press conference on Thursday, said his administration is "running like a fine-tuned machine" despite turmoil over the rollout of his travel ban and the departure of his national security adviser who misled the public about communications with the Russian ambassador.

The House has spent most of the last several weeks considering measures to scale back Obama-era regulations. The last three weeks in the House were dedicated to votes on resolutions to overturn regulations issued late in President Obama’s term.

Under a law known as the Congressional Review Act, Congress can vote to undo regulations within 60 days after they go into effect.

President Trump has signed a handful of the measures approved by the GOP Congress so far, including ones to eliminate regulations that would protect waterways from coal mining waste and require energy companies to disclose payments to foreign governments.MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough on Friday blasted President Trump's tweet about the media, calling the the commander-in-chief a "fake president" for attacking the press.



"Only a FAKE PRESIDENT would declare the First Amendment to be the enemy of the American people," Scarborough tweeted.

Only a FAKE PRESIDENT would declare the First Amendment to be the enemy of the American people. https://t.co/ZFZvlTf8Az — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) February 17, 2017

Minutes earlier, Trump berated the "fake news media," tweeting that the press "is the enemy of the American People."

"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" he wrote.

Trump also criticized multiple outlets for reporting that ties several of his campaign advisers to Russian intelligence officials.Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) will tour the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas later this month, The Monitor reported Tuesday.

President Trump last month signed an executive order calling for construction to begin on his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The wall was one of Trump’s signature campaign promises, and he vowed Mexico would pay for it.

Another order issued last month ended the “catch and release” policy, which allowed people who crossed the border to return to Mexico without detention. The order also expanded the definition of “criminal alien” to include individuals who have entered the U.S. without authorization.

The Department of Homeland Security on Monday said of the 680 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week, 75 percent were “criminal aliens.”

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has asked for a meeting with ICE officials to discuss the raids, arguing they "have struck fear in the hearts of the immigrant community.”A mood of economic gloom hangs over the nation as President Obama and Republican leaders scramble to strike a deficit deal that avoids automatic tax hikes and spending cuts, according to a new poll for The Hill.

The poll, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, found nearly 6-in-10 people (59 percent) feel the country is on the wrong track. It also showed people are deeply pessimistic about their chances for future prosperity, with 54 percent saying they believe their children will be worse off as adults than their parents.

The poll results cast a shadow over talks in Washington aimed at averting the “fiscal cliff” of $500 billion in tax hikes and $109 billion in automatic spending cuts set to take effect Jan. 1.

Barely a month after Obama won a second term, and even as the nation continues to make modest job gains, fewer than 1-in-3 (31 percent) say the country is on the right track.

Only 34 percent of people feel they will be better off at the end of Obama’s second term than they are right now. And just 16 percent believe a better economic future awaits their children when they grow up.

The dour sentiment is particularly striking among Republicans, who were crestfallen over GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s defeat on Nov. 6.

Among voters who identified themselves as Republicans, 87 percent said the country is on the wrong track and a mere 8 percent said it is on the right track.

Seven-in-10 Republicans believe they will be worse off at the end of Obama’s presidency, and 80 percent said their children’s future is bleaker than their own.

Only 4 percent of Republicans think their children will be better off.

By contrast, Democrats are in a somewhat sunnier — though not overwhelmingly upbeat — post-election mood. Fifty-four percent of Democrats said they think the country is on the right track compared to 31 percent who said it is on the wrong track.

Six-in-10 Democrats, meanwhile, believe they’ll be better off in four years.

But even Democrats are worried about the country’s long-term future. Only 30 percent said their children face a brighter future and 30 percent said they will be worse off.

African Americans — who have endured high unemployment rates throughout the economic recession and recovery — are more upbeat about the country’s future than white Americans, the poll found.

While just 30 percent of whites said the country is on the right track, 44 percent of black voters believe the nation is headed in the right direction.

Similarly, 64 percent of blacks believe their families will be better off in four years compared to just 30 percent of whites. Over the long term, 56 percent of African Americans say their children face a brighter future, compared to 10 percent of whites.

The poll was taken Dec. 13 among 1,000 likely voters and is considered accurate within 3 percentage points.

The poll’s sample was 32 percent Republican, 38 percent Democrat and 30 percent who identified as neither.

Voters are evenly divided in their views on the country’s overall ideological leaning, the poll found.

Twenty-six percent of people said they believe the United States is a predominantly left-of-center nation, while 30 percent feel it is a right-of-center country. Another 25 percent felt the U.S. is neither right nor left.

Among Democrats, only 17 percent said they believe the U.S. is a left-of-center country, compared to 29 percent of Republicans who felt that way.

A near-equal number of Democrats and Republicans (31 percent and 30 percent, respectively) said the U.S. is predominantly a right-of-center country.

The Hill’s poll found a strikingly large number of voters, 59 percent, believe the U.S. is less admired around the globe than it was four years ago when Obama took office. Just 37 percent said the country is much more, or somewhat more, admired than it was four years ago.

When Obama took office, he pledged to try and restore the nation’s international standing, which he felt had been damaged during George W. Bush’s presidency.

Republicans strongly feel the opposite has occurred, with 87 percent saying the country is somewhat or much less admired than it was four years ago. Only 10 percent of Republicans say the country’s image has improved.

Sixty-five percent of Democrats say the country is more admired now than when Bush left office, while 32 percent say it is less admired.

Several Senate Democrats penned a letter to the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general Friday, raising questions about President Trump’s potential conflicts of interest.

The senators say that Trump may have violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars the president from using the office for personal gain.

“It would appear that any payment for goods or services, or benefit conferred, from the federal government to the Trump Organization would benefit the President and therefore be an emolument prohibited by the Constitution,” the letter to Inspector General John Roth reads.

The letter is signed by Sens.

They specifically focus on the arrangement of Trump’s large business holdings, under which he handed control of the Trump Organization to his sons and put his assets into a trust.

“The arrangement raises significant potential for conflicts of interest and risks the perception that President Trump is exploiting his public office for his family’s private gain,” they wrote.

And they raise questions about the cost associated with Trump and his family’s visits to their properties outside of Washington; Trump has spent the past three weekends at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.

The senators write that if staff, security and military aides are being charged for stays at Mar-a-Lago, “it directly benefits the President’s business and allows him to profit off of every vacation he takes to one of his properties.”

“We believe your office must conduct a thorough investigation into these issues and continuously monitor the potential for conflicts and violations of the Domestic Emoluments Clause of the Constitution during President Trump’s term,” they write.

They list several specific topics to be addressed as part of such an investigation, including whether DHS plans to rent property or make purchases from the Trump Organization, such as in Trump Tower in New York, where first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron currently reside.

They also ask about the threat of terrorist attacks on real estate projects around the world branded with the Trump name and whether DHS has done any risk assessments of such scenarios.

Lastly, they inquire whether Trump’s real estate holdings obligate DHS to protect the properties, and if so, at what cost.House Democrats are pressing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to ask former national security adviser Michael Flynn to testify before the panel.

Flynn resigned late Monday after revelations that he misled top White House officials about the nature of his conversations with a Russian envoy to the U.S. during the transition. Nunes has said he’s not interested in investigating Flynn.

"I've just heard that there's a letter circulating to the chairman to ask Michael Flynn to come before the committee," said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who serves on the Intelligence Committee.

Adam Schiff (Calif.), the panel’s ranking Democrat, intends to ask Nunes at a meeting Wednesday afternoon to expand the scope of the committee's investigation into Kremlin interference in last year’s election to include Flynn's communications with the Russians.

"If you are Michael Flynn do you come? Are you subpoenaed? Do you demand, for example, immunity? Do you demand immunity because there's been an indictment? There's just a lot of moving pieces," Himes said.

He also joined Democratic leadership in calling for an independent investigation into the matter.

While Senate Republicans expressed openness to probing Flynn's interactions with the Russian ambassador, some Republicans in the House dismissed the effort, saying the matter was closed after President Trump forced Flynn out.

"This White House certainly dealt with this issue rather quickly, it seems to me. General Flynn's no longer the security adviser, so I think it's much to do about nothing," Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told The Hill.

But much of the criticism is overwrought.

Some aspects of his first few weeks were positive. Increasing transparency in the agency's rule-making processes is long overdue. New ideas on closing the digital divide should be considered, hopefully with an eye toward cost-effectiveness.

On the more negative side of the ledger, however, the process by which the chairman took certain actions as well as retracting certain reports were not in keeping with promises to be more inclusive than his predecessor.

Pai's actions to increase transparency are unambiguously good. Taking Commissioner Michael O'Rielly's advice and releasing draft proposals and orders to the public prior to a FCC vote while tightening "editorial privileges" granted to bureaus after the vote is a win for good governance. It ends a decades-old process that made public scrutiny of rulemaking difficult.

ADVERTISEMENT

Granting editorial privileges is a bizarre practice dating to the 1970s that includes voting on notices and orders before publicly releasing the text, and allowing changes — sometimes substantive — after the vote. Hopefully this more open approach will become standard practice.

Pai has received intense criticism for his actions on Lifeline, including in The New York Times and The Washington Post. The crux of the criticism focuses on his decision to change the application status of nine companies that wanted to offer Lifeline broadband service back to "pending" after having been approved in December 2016 and January 2017.

But that decision is a red herring. As many have pointed out, those nine companies are in addition the hundreds of companies that already provide Lifeline service, and the added delay in their approval has little, if any, effect on access to subsidies.

More importantly, the issue of the nine companies distracts from the real question: Do existing programs address the digital divide? The evidence to date suggests that they do not, at least not in any cost-effective way.

In 2012, the FCC ran an excellent pilot program testing how subsidies and digital learning programs might encourage non-adopters to sign up. They result was surprising: They did not attract low-income nonadopters. Subscribership was, on average, about 10 percent of what participating companies had expected.

The experiment demonstrated how little we know about getting the last group of low-income people online. Instead of pausing to understand why the subsidized plans attracted so little interest, the FCC ignored the results and plowed ahead with its Lifeline subsidy program.

In short, the problem with Lifeline is not that it needs to give subsidies to more companies. It needs additional experiments, real evaluation and more thought about how we might actually close the adoption gap.

Pai recently outlined his plans for addressing the digital divide. The next Open Commission meeting agenda includes plans to move ahead on the Mobility Fund Phase 2, which focuses on adding 4G coverage where it does not currently exist, and more money for rural broadband buildout.

Hopefully those plans will include experimenting with how to spend the money in the most cost-effective manner, evaluating whether the programs work and analyses — especially when considering an additional $2 billion on rural subsidies — that takes to heart his comment that "every dollar that is spent on subsidizing somebody who doesn't need the help by definition does not go to someone who does."

All that said, however, the process by which he made some decisions could have been better. Pai frequently criticized Wheeler for not consulting the minority and acting unilaterally. So it was regrettable, then, that on Feb. 3, he unilaterally revoked a number of orders, causing Commissioner Mignon Clyburn to make the same critique about Pai that he previously made about Wheeler.

Pai should strive to live up to the standards of collegiality and engagement he expressed in his initial confirmation hearing. Few expect Pai, O'Rielly and Clyburn to agree on all, or even most, issues. But they are all well-meaning people with deep knowledge of the issues and a shared desire to achieve certain goals like ensuring continued investment in world-class networks and closing the digital divide.

Another concerning action was his retraction of two documents: a paper titled "Improving the Nation’s Broadband Infrastructure" by the former chief of the Office of Strategic Planning and Polices Bureau and an "E-Rate Modernization Progress Report" by the Wireless Bureau.

Heads of government agencies should not retract papers and reports with which they disagree. Instead, they should explain why the reports are deficient.

For example, in the E-Rate report, Pai might have asked for a justification for the "short-term goal" of 100 kilobits per second/student connectivity. What research demonstrates that this is a meaningful goal? Are the benefits of that increased speed above what the schools had already worth the multiple billions of dollars spent? Why is recipients' confidence in their ability to receive future subsidies an indicator of success? (Seriously. Check out page 5.) Addressing the substance of a paper is a better strategy than trying to remove it from the discussion.

Overall, Pai is off to a good start. He has moved to increase transparency of the FCC's decision-making process and has suggested new ideas for addressing the digital divide. His unilateral actions, on the other hand, may generate better policy outcomes, but were not good policy process.

Hopefully, in the future, Chairman Pai will better engage other commissioners. Doing so would help promote good telecom policy and ensure the success of his long-term agenda.

2017 will be one of the most important years in the modern history of Europe. European unity and democracy are challenged by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a dictator who seeks to subvert and discredit liberal democracy, and President Trump, who foments disunity everywhere, repeatedly praises Putin and insults our democratic allies including leaders of Germany, Australia and Mexico.

In the battle of Europe that takes center stage in 2017, European unity and democracy are challenged by a series of crucial elections where far right parties would take Europe back to the early 1930s. They are competing first in the Netherlands and France, to be followed by critical elections in Germany and potentially Italy.

ADVERTISEMENT

The battle of France has already reached white hot intensity. The two leading candidates in the first round of French elections in April will face a decisive final vote in May. One of the finalists in May will probably be Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far right National Front, which has financial ties to Russia. Le Pen wants France to leave the European Union, which could be a powerful blow to European unity and NATO and a major victory for Putin and his far right allies across Europe.

Until recently analysts expected the other finalist in May to be Francois Fillon, a pro-Putin conservative who favors harsh economic austerity but is now embroiled in a financial scandal. While the situation in France is fluid, at this time the most likely opponent of Le Pen will be Emmanuel Macron, the fast-rising former minister in the Socialist government who is now running as a center-left independent.

This week The Washington Post and BBC reported that Macron is under attack from sources with Russian ties that are spreading malicious rumors against him. Putin may be employing the same tactics of espionage and covert action to support Le Pen and defeat Macron that he used to support Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonMark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game The latest scheme in the left’s war on Trump Local broadcast news knows America better than cable MORE, which remains under investigation by U.S. authorities.

A future column will further consider this “war of the worlds” in the battle of Europe that will involve repeated Russian attacks against champions of liberal democracy in other European nations, fueled by the far right in Europe, aiming to destroy European unity and undermine NATO and Western security.

A recent story in The New York Times highlighted skyrocketing sales in France of books discussing the fears of political doom and decline in Europe and France.

There is indeed a crisis of confidence in democracy across Europe and America, but let me offer here a counterthesis.

The rise of Trump, far right parties in Europe and Russian aggression against democracy may well create a counter-reaction that could ultimately bring Europe closer together by mobilizing the left, center and all who reject anti-semitic and anti-Muslim bigotry and reject the aggressive nationalism and jingoism that drenched Europe in the bloodshed that gave birth to NATO and the EU.

Presidents Kennedy and Reagan visited Berlin to speak great truths about freedom and rally a continent that first defeated fascism and then communism with the unity of America and Europe after World War II.

Kennedy and Reagan, who spoke truths about tearing down walls and building up alliances, would reject Trump, who speaks many falsehoods and would create new walls, and would reject voices of hatred and extremism in nations across Europe.

Let Trump come to Berlin, and stand where Kennedy and Reagan stood, and praise Vladimir Putin. This Trump will dare not do because he fears peaceful armies of protestors who will stand against him in the great battle for Europe, if he does.

"Probably not to the same degree that you're seeing the tweets and things right now. He's going to be too busy, quite frankly, for that," Carson told Fox News on Friday.

ADVERTISEMENT The retired neurosurgeon and Trump adviser mentioned Iraq, North Korea and the South China Sea as situations Trump would be preoccupied handling.

"He's not gonna have time, you know, to be tweeting about that," Carson said.

Carson, who ended his own presidential bid earlier this year, was asked whether Trump as president would react differently to major incidents — such as the EgyptAir jetliner that went missing on Thursday — than he does currently. Trump quickly linked the disappearance of the plane flying from Paris to Cairo to terrorism in a tweet early Thursday and later claimed that a bomb brought down the plane. Officials said there was not yet an indication of a blast.

Clinton was more cautious, saying it did "appear that it was an act of terrorism" in describing the disappearing passenger jet while pointing to the coming investigation into its disappearance.

"It's clear that he's expressing his opinion," Carson said of Trump. "Everybody forms opinions about what's going on. I suspect that when all the dust has settled there will be some mischief implicated in this crash.

"I would expect him obviously to entertain all of the different possibilities and more than likely as president he's going to have a spokesperson and they're going to be issuing statements and they're going to be talking about all the different possibilities."Like many other issues in our country right now, a case before the United States Supreme Court, Endrew F. vs. Douglas County School District, is causing heated national debate. The case involves a child with autism in Colorado whose parents are suing the school district over whether he is being denied his legal right for a meaningful education in the public school setting.

At the root of the argument is the level of education public schools are required to provide students with disabilities. Existing legislation defines this requirement as “free appropriate public education.” But, what does that really mean? There are those who interpret it as “some” education — often understood as the bare minimum — while others believe it should be defined as providing “meaningful,” substantial benefit. Beyond this “blizzard of words,” as Justice Alito described it, is an even more pressing issue – one that presents the greatest barrier to learning for children with disabilities.

ADVERTISEMENT

Children with disabilities — particularly those with intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, and communication or sensory related disabilities — are disproportionately secluded and restrained in classroom settings on a regular basis. According to recent data from the U.S. Department of Education, students with disabilities comprise two-thirds of the 277,000 children who are secluded from their classmates or restrained annually, despite representing only 12 percent of the overall student population.

Why is this important in this particular case? If a special needs student is spending the majority of their day restrained or in a seclusion room, it doesn’t matter how challenging the lessons, what goals are set or how good the intention; a child simply can’t learn if they are in emotional or physical submission for the majority of the school day.

Surely, a free appropriate education, regardless of the nuances used to define that term, ensures children are not physically or emotionally abused.

However, for many years, teachers have been taught that physical restraint and seclusion as the default approach when a student acts out. Until educators are given training that offers meaningful intervention, which includes safe, physical alternatives to use before restraint or seclusion, our classrooms will not be productive educational environments for any child, not just children with disabilities.

While these “behavioral modification techniques” have historically been considered appropriate, we now know these techniques have potentially deadly and, without question, traumatic consequences. They are not evidence-based practices and there is no data to suggest that either leads to reduced violent or uncontrolled behavior. In fact, research indicates that restraint and seclusion actually cause, reinforce and maintain aggression and violence. And they are certainly barriers to education.

As demonstrated by the Supreme Court case, parents are often the greatest advocates. New statistics recently released by the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) cites a significant increase in complaints involving restraint and seclusion of children with disabilities. According to the report, Securing Equal Educational Opportunity, the overall number of complaints filed last year with the U.S. Department of Education's OCR soared to a record 16,720, with the largest increases in the areas of restraint or seclusion of students with disabilities.

I anticipate the number of complaints will continue to rise unless educators are given training that offers meaningful intervention and alternatives to restraint and seclusion. Only then will these complaints decrease.

But this can be done. Grafton Integrated Health Network — an organization serving children and adults with autism and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses — initiated an agency-wide restraint reduction over a decade ago, achieving compelling results: reducing the use of restraints by 99.8 percent and significantly reduced the number of injuries to both clients and those who care for them.

Today, Grafton is helping other organizations’ to do the same through Ukeru Systems, a division of the organization which provides training for a safe, comforting and restraint-free approach to crisis management.

"There are openings there to talk with Republicans who are not totally on board with Donald Trump," freshman Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said in an interview with The Hill's Molly K. Hooper.

"I think moderate Republicans [are] open to discussion on social issues."

Espaillat is one of several Democrats to introduce measures aimed at blocking construction of Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

His bill would "prohibit the construction of new border barriers, including walls or fences, on certain Federal land."

Though his measure only has Democratic co-sponsors, the former undocumented immigrant said he is reaching out to border-state Republicans for support.

Several moderate GOP lawmakers, including Reps. Charlie Dent (Pa.) and Tom Reed (N.Y.), said they were meeting with Democrats as recently as Wednesday to find common ground on matters such as tax reform and infrastructure.

"There’s a lot of dialogue going on in the Tuesday Group and New Dems and Blue Dogs ... particularly in context of again, tax reform, infrastructure," Dent, co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group Caucus, told The Hill.

Tillerson was apparently late to confirm his attendance at the gathering of foreign ministers and diplomats, and the city’s hotels were completely booked by the time he did.

That meant that other leading diplomats, such as United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, reportedly had to make the 30-minute trek out to the sanitarium to meet with Tillerson.

The stay at the sanitarium marked an unusual start for Tillerson’s new State Department career, especially during a meeting the former Exxon Mobil CEO intended to use as an opportunity to introduce himself to foreign ministers and diplomats.

Still, the trip was busy for Tillerson, who held numerous bilateral meetings on Thursday. One State Department official told Bloomberg that the secretary of State would be in “listening mode” during the gathering.

Trump himself has had mixed interactions with world leaders since taking office last month. He reportedly engaged in confrontational phone calls with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.

But the president also appeared to mesh well with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, both of whom visited with Trump over the past week.(This story originally appeared in The Hill Extra.)

House Republicans are heading home for a one-week recess with a new outline on their plans for replacing and repealing ObamaCare, but the document leaves many key questions unanswered.

GOP leadership issued the 17-page memo on Thursday, with a mix of traditional healthcare talking points and elements from previous Republican health plans.

The memo was shared with lawmakers after a closed-door briefing, and is aimed at helping members who have faced some tough questions about their ObamaCare plans in recent weeks.

For now, it appears Republican lawmakers are still in the education phase.

"There was no attempt to come to a consensus today; today was more informational," Rep. Morgan Griffith Morgan GriffithGOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered Use Holman Rule on federal employees that work full-time for union Adopting old-school rule would show House is serious about reform MORE (R-Va.), who sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said.

House Energy and Commerce Chairman(R-Ore.) and Ways and Means Chairman(R-Texas) outlined ObamaCare replacement items leadership wants to include in its bill gutting major provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

These include how to reform Medicaid and deal with the states that chose to expand the program; tax credits to help Americans pay for insurance; high-risk pools; and health-savings accounts.

“I think the membership is going to have to have time to digest a lot of this,” Griffith said.

To be clear, legislative text hasn’t yet been released, so the details are limited. Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) said he’s waiting on scores from the Congressional Budget Office before unveiling a bill.

Ryan has previously said he plans to repeal and replace parts of ObamaCare by spring.

But several main questions — and potential sticking points — remain.

1. Tax credits vs. deductions.

The new outline calls for an advanceable, refundable tax credit for those who don’t have insurance through an employer or other government program.

Brady told reporters that tax credits cover “more people because it applies to those who don't have a tax liability. And it’s advanceable, so it's available today. A deduction is available a year or 16 months later whenever you do your taxes. So the thinking is to have that help immediately to allow an individual to have it sent to that insurance company.”

But other lawmakers, such as Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), say they prefer a deduction.

“I like the deduction because I think it encourages you to look for the cheapest plan,” Roe, co-chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus, said. He added he understands the disadvantage of the deduction is Americans would have to finance their plan for a year or more.

Policy analysts see a big difference between the two. That’s because the deduction doesn’t necessarily help those in the lower tax brackets who don’t pay federal income taxes, and the new outline echoes that sentiment.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he prefers deductions, but he doesn't draw a hard line between the two — unless it’s advanceable and refundable tax credits. He argued the latter is prone to fraud.

2. Helping governors who did — and didn’t — expand Medicaid.

Determining how to tackle Medicaid is one of the prickliest debates the GOP will likely encounter. GOP governors who originally bucked the party line and expanded the program want to ensure their constituents don’t lose coverage. Those who didn’t expand don’t want to get financially dinged for it.

“How we deal with that tricky little thing is going to be hard,” Roe told The Hill Extra. “I’m not saying I‘m pessimistic, I’m just saying it’s going to be hard.”

According to a source in the room, members are aware of the differences between expansion and nonexpansion states, and that conversations on how to address that will continue.

The updated GOP proposal would repeal Medicaid expansion for able-bodied adults, but states would continue to receive the enhanced federal match rate for a limited time. Later, states that choose to keep their expansion programs would be reverted back to their pre-expansion match rates. The proposal says nonexpansion states could receive additional, temporary resources for safety net providers.

The outline also allows states to choose between block grants and per capita caps.

One of the concerns is that the proposal might be getting too expensive, House Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-S.C.) said.

“My concern is with this Medicaid is that it gets off the chain,” he said. “We’re waiting for the CBO numbers, that’s one of the two major sticking points as far as everybody signing off on this particular plan.”

3. Capping the employer tax exclusion.

One thing the outline was noticeably missing: money.

“That’s going to be the $94 question, whether it’s on tax reform or whether it’s on healthcare reform,” said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who is working on a companion bill to Sen.

That’s a good thing, and Democrats should take him up on it.

Fixing our broken immigration system is something that President Obama never did. In fact, he made the situation worse.

First, his Justice Department did little to enforce the laws on the books, until it became clear that the situation was getting out of hand.

He vaguely promised citizenship to those who were in the country illegally, which encouraged a whole generation of migrants from Central America to bull rush to the border in hopes to get a chance to become citizens themselves.

Mr. Obama, of course, had the chance to reform the system in his first two years of his term, but he and his Democratic allies chose to focus on climate change and healthcare reform. An immigration proposal never made it to the floor in Nancy Pelosi’s short tenure as Speaker.

This issue has been festering for the better part of a decade. More and more people overstay their visas or sneak through our southern border, lured here by the promise of jobs and too scared to go back home for fear that they will never get a chance to get back here.

Estimates range from 10 to 15 million illegal immigrants in this country. That’s a lot of people for a country our size to absorb, a lot of people who are part of an underground economy that drives down wages and who are exploited by unscrupulous employers.

Candidate Trump promised to enforce our immigration laws, and that proved to be a powerful campaign promise that helped to propel him to the White House.

Fixing our broken immigration system is not easy to do piece by piece.

If you want to entice the Chamber of Commerce into accepting an E-verify system, you need to help them get access to more potential employees. That means at least legalization for those who are undocumented and perhaps an expansion of the work visa program.

If you are going to do that for the Chamber, then you need to do something for the agriculture community. That usually means more visas for migrant workers who are essential for the farm economy.

But you can’t do something for the business sector without doing something for organized labor. You need Democratic votes, and those votes are controlled by the labor movement. That means you must do something to protect the rights of immigrants, and that usually comes with some sort of legalization and a pathway to citizenship.

Interior enforcement is always a demand of conservative Republicans. They hate the idea of “sanctuary cities” and they want local police departments to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expel lawbreakers. But you talk to sheriffs whose charge it is to keep their communities safe and they don’t want to do ICE’s work for them, because they have enough on their plate and it is hard enough to build trust among new immigrants. There’s a compromise in there somewhere that needs to be found, perhaps by giving the bulk of the undocumented documents and by kicking the gang-bangers out of the country.

The final piece comes with the so-called “Dreamers,” the children who came with their undocumented parents and who have grown up in this country, knowing no other place to live. President Trump has promised to take care of them, but nobody knows what that means exactly.

Pretty soon, you get back to a comprehensive approach to reform.

President Trump can build a wall and he can issue executive orders. And he can enforce the current laws, which is causing panic in the immigrant community.

He can do all of that because he won the presidential election, fair and square, and because President Obama failed to fix our broken immigration system in his eight years in office.

Democrats can complain all they want about Mr. Trump and his enforcement actions. But if they truly want to help the undocumented, they better come to the table and start negotiating with Republicans for a long-term fix.

President Trump this week walked back his earlier pronouncement that the GOP would have a bill ready to go shortly after he took office, to say he might not have a measure to sign until next year.

A handful of House Republicans, including McClintock, believe that tax reform can move more swiftly through both chambers.

Watch the video above to learn what is on tap for Capitol Hill this week.Retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus has reportedly pulled his name from consideration to replace Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal Friday, Petraeus's name was floated for the role, but the White House was miffed by his concerns about staffing and independence. It's not clear how seriously he was being considered.

Still reportedly on the short list for the position are acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg, a retired three-star Army general and Flynn's chief of staff, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, and Army strategist Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.

The Washington Examiner reported that Kellogg, Bolton and McMaster will meet with Trump separately at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this weekend to discuss the position, citing an administration official.

Former Army Chief of Staff and retired Gen. Ray Odierno is also believed to be under consideration, according to the Journal.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Ted CruzReports: Petraeus off the list, Trump down to three candidates to replace Flynn Cruz backs former UN Ambassador John Bolton to replace Flynn Jake Tapper fires back: Media didn't fire Flynn, Trump did MORE made a pitch for Bolton to get the position to CNN earlier Friday.

Flynn resigned from his post after reports that he misled White House officials about discussing sanctions on Russia with the country's ambassador to the U.S. before Trump took office.

Trump's top pick to fill the seat was retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, who turned down the job, citing "financial and family issues."

However, contradictory reports have emerged over why Harward turned down the offer. According to a Financial Times report, a source familiar with Harward's decision said he was concerned about whether the top advisers in Trump's administration would allow him to install his own staff on the National Security Council. Flynn's deputy, K.T. McFarland, told The Hill on Tuesday that Trump had "asked that I stay on."

MSNBC's Chris Hayes reported Friday night that Harward's decision was not based primarily on staffing, but on the fact that the White House would not meet his conditions — and President Trump's press conference sealed the deal, a former national security official familiar with his decision told MSNBC.

Harward had reportedly wanted a clear chain of command and direct line to Trump in which he was the sole national security adviser. He also wanted the structure of the National Security Council to be restored to the model of past administrations so that political advisers, namely Steve Bannon, would not have a seat at the key Principals Committee.

MSNBC reported that Harward sent a letter to the White House Thursday declining the offer. The White House then reportedly invited him to meet and asked him to reconsider, which he was open to. But after watching Trump's Thursday press conference, the source said, he made a final decision.

Petraeus said on Friday at a conference in Munich that anyone considering the job should have control over personnel and gain a commitment from the White House to have a disciplined process for crafting security policy.

“Whoever it is that would agree to take that position certainly should do so with some very, very significant assurances that he or she would have authorities over the personnel of the organization, that there would be a commitment to a disciplined process and procedures,” Petraeus said at the Munich Security Conference.

Officials told the WSJ that the White House wasn't open to Petraeus's demands.A clear plurality of voters believe the nation’s gun laws are too lax and they expect President Obama and Congress to tighten them, according to a new poll for The Hill.

At the same time, however, voters tend to believe that stricter gun laws will not significantly reduce deaths from gun violence in the United States.

Those opinions reflect the complexity of an issue that has been center-stage politically since the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., last month in which 20 children and eight adults, including the killer, died.

ADVERTISEMENT

Vice President Biden is leading a White House working group examining how to lower rates of gun violence. Biden is expected to deliver his recommendations to Obama this week.

As a senator, Biden was a driving force behind the 1994 bill that banned many assault weapons, but it appears unlikely that he or Obama will push for such a broad-ranging measure this year. Instead, the administration may focus on expanding obligatory background checks for gun-buyers and perhaps banning high-capacity magazines.

In The Hill Poll, 49 percent of voters asserted that current gun laws are too lax, against 35 percent who said they were about right. The gun laws were judged to be too strict by 11 percent of voters.

A striking consensus was evident around the belief that Obama and Congress would come together to make the current laws pertaining to firearms more rigorous.

Asked to set aside their personal opinions about the desirability of such a change, a full 64 percent of voters asserted that action was very likely or somewhat likely. Only 26 percent said that it was not very likely or not likely at all.

The number of voters who thought that such a move was likely was broadly similar among Republicans and Democrats: 63 percent and 68 percent, respectively.

There were much sharper partisan divides on other questions. Three-quarters of Democratic voters asserted that the current gun laws were too lax, yet that opinion was shared by only 24 percent of Republicans. Conversely, 53 percent of Republicans argued that the current state of the gun laws was “about right”, a position that was endorsed by only 17 percent of Democrats.

Democrats were also far more likely to believe that tightening gun laws was likely to deliver a direct dividend, in terms of reducing the number of deaths from gun violence. Two-thirds of Democrats, 66 percent, asserted that this would be the case, whereas only 15 percent of Republicans agreed.

Gun-rights advocates have long insisted that making regulations stricter is likely to restrict law-abiding citizens’ access to firearms, while those with criminal intent might acquire weapons by illicit means.

Asked directly about the mass shooting in Connecticut, 47 percent of voters said that it had made them more supportive of tighter gun controls while 32 percent said that it had not altered their views.

Almost one-in-five voters — 19 percent — said that the events in Connecticut had made them less supportive of stricter gun laws. In the wake of the tragedy, representatives of the National Rifle Association (NRA) suggested that giving teachers permission to carry firearms might help prevent future atrocities.

Last week, the NRA was among several groups that met with Biden at the White House. Afterward, the group released a statement accusing the Obama administration of having “an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.”

Gun-rights groups had been put on edge earlier last week by Biden’s assertion that “executive orders, executive action, can be taken” on the gun issue.

The Hill Poll found more voters opposed to such an action than supportive of it, by 49 percent to 42 percent.

Here, again, the partisan split was deep. Seventy-one percent of Democrats would support executive action to make the laws tighter, but 82 percent of Republicans would oppose it.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters on January 10 by Pulse Opinion Research. The margin of error is three percentage points.

“This plane was built right here in the great state of South Carolina,” Trump said. “Our goal as a nation is to rely less on imports and rely more on products made here in the USA.”

Boeing rolled out its first 787-10 aircraft in dramatic fashion on Friday afternoon, kicking off the event with a prayer and theme music and ending with Trump exclaiming, “God bless Boeing.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The new aircraft, the latest and biggest model of Boeing’s Dreamliner family, is exclusively made in the company’s facility in North Charleston, S.C.

“The name says it all: Dreamliner,” Trump said. “Our country is all about making dreams come true.”

Boeing’s stock appeared to hit an all-time high at 1:55 p.m. of $173 per share, around the time Trump ended his speech.

Trump, who has been critical of the high cost of Boeing’s Air Force One contract, is the first sitting president to visit Boeing’s South Carolina facility.

The aircraft manufacturing industry contributes billions to the economy and supports millions of jobs. In South Carolina alone, the industry supports more than 100,000 jobs and generates $19 billion annually in economic activity, according to Boeing.

Trump touted his efforts to save American jobs and threatened a “substantial penalty” on companies that shift their operations overseas. The president told the crowd that manufacturing jobs were already coming back to the country and highlighted language he put into an executive order requiring pipelines to be made with U.S. steel.

“As your president, I’m going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work,” Trump said. “It has to be much easier for manufacturers in our country, and much harder [for them] to leave.”

The speech represented a return to the core economic message of Trump's campaign.

It comes at a time when his White House is struggling to maintain focus after being thrown off course by a seemingly endless string of controversies.

A day earlier, Trump held a rollicking 77-minute news conference in which he denied reports detailing a White House consumed by chaos, deepened his ongoing feud with the media and parried questions about his team's ties to Russia.

Trump, who owns his own fleet of aircrafts, gushed over the 787-10. He took a tour of the cockpit following the speech and was spotted sitting in the pilot’s seat, according to pool reports.

“That is one beautiful airplane,” he said. “Congrats to the men and women here who have built it. What an amazing piece of art. What an amazing piece of work.”

The event comes after Trump harshly criticized Boeing before his Jan. 20 inauguration, calling for the company to lose its contract over the high cost of its Air Force One plane.

A Government Accountability Office report from March 2016 estimated the cost of two new Air Force One planes at roughly $3.2 billion before their scheduled completion in 2023.

“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016. “Cancel order!”

Boeing’s CEO said last month that his company has since made inroads with Trump on shrinking the cost of the next generation of Air Force One planes.

“We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Dennis Muilenburg told reporters after meeting with Trump on Jan. 17. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there.”

On Friday, Trump acknowledged that the contract was a “difficult project,” but said “we’re getting closer and closer.”Former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Ed Rendell has endorsed Pete Buttigieg's bid to lead the Democratic Party, becoming the fourth former DNC chairman to back the Indiana mayor.

Rendell will hit the phones to help woo DNC members onto Buttigieg's side, a campaign aide told The Hill. In a statement, Rendell lauded the mayor as the "fresh face" that the party needs after a "year of historic division within the Democratic Party."

"After a year of historic division within the Democratic Party, I believe we need a fresh face at the helm of the DNC. We need someone who understands the needs and values of middle class Americans and what that means in different parts of the country. Someone who will be an innovative thinker not wedded to solutions proffered only inside the Beltway," Rendell said.

"I believe that person is Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, led the party from 1999 to 2001

Buttigieg also has the support of three other former DNC chairmen — Steve Grossman, David Wilhelm and Joe Andrew.

Buttigieg trails the two frontrunners in the DNC race, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison (D) and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, in first-ballot support from voting members. Ellison is the preferred choice of the progressive wing of the party, while Perez has won substantial support from more establishment Democrats.

Aides to Perez and Ellison are claiming that both men are closing in on the 224 DNC members needed to win the chairman vote next Saturday in Atlanta.

But if no candidate reaches that majority by Saturday, DNC members will vote on subsequent ballots until a majority coalesces. That could provide the chance for another candidate to emerge.President Trump will announce his choice for a Supreme Court nominee to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat.

The arrests were made in Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, New York and nearby areas.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement did not say how many were arrested in total, but 161 arrests were made in Los Angeles and 200 were made in Atlanta.

David Marin, a director in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Los Angeles field office, said the arrests, which were made over the course of five days, were an “enforcement surge.”

"The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps, that’s all false and that’s dangerous and irresponsible," he said. "Reports like that create a panic.”

President Trump last month signed an executive order on immigration enforcement, which ended the previous “catch and release” policy that allowed those who crossed the border to return to Mexico without being detained.

A Los Angeles Times analysis found that 8 million undocumented workers in the U.S. may be at risk for deportation under the new order.Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) is urging President Trump to take actions to prevent immigrants in the country illegally from claiming the child tax credit.

“Most Americans are astonished to learn that each year billions of taxpayer dollars are given out to people who are in our country illegally,” Messer said in a news release. “This is just one example of how our broken tax and immigration systems continue to incentivize immigrants to come here illegally. It’s long past time to change it.”

The request from Messer — a member of the House GOP leadership team who is eyeing a Senate run in 2018 — comes as Trump has made tax reform and curbing illegal immigration two of his top priorities. Trump has already issued executive orders to direct federal agencies to start work on a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to strengthen immigration enforcement.

The child tax credit benefits low- and middle-income families. Families that have a greater credit amount than tax liability can get a refund for the difference.

Under current law, taxpayers do not have to have Social Security numbers to claim the credit on their returns, though they can only claim the credit for dependents who are U.S. citizens, nationals and alien residents. A 2011 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that people who weren't authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable child tax credits during the 2010 tax-processing year.

Messer has introduced legislation that would bar taxpayers who don't have Social Security numbers from claiming the child tax credit. In a letter sent to Trump on Saturday, he asked Trump to take executive actions to prevent undocumented immigrants from getting the credits while Congress works on passing his bill.

Messer asked Trump to take steps to bar the IRS from allowing individuals without Social Security numbers that are valid for employment from claiming the credit. He also asked Trump to have the Office of Management and Budget designate the credit "as a high priority program to subject the program to greater levels of oversight and review in an attempt to reduce the volume of improper payments made by the program."

Last year, the House Ways and Means Committee approved on a party-line vote legislation to require Social Security numbers for taxpayers claiming the refundable child tax credit. Democrats opposed the measure, saying that the bill would hurt 3 million children, most of whom are citizens with undocumented parents.A meeting between congressional Hispanic Democrats and the Trump administration's top immigration enforcement officer was canceled abruptly Tuesday in the wake of national immigration raids that have roiled Latino leaders.

Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Tuesday that he would not be attending the meeting, according to CHC aides.

CHC Chairwoman Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.) and Homan had a phone call at 2 p.m. to discuss the cancellation. The CHC is expected to hold a press conference later Tuesday.

An ICE representative speaking on background said the CHC added attendants to the meeting last minute, forcing the agency to reschedule to comply with House rules.

CHC staff said a larger, bipartisan meeting was not a reasonable replacement for the canceled sit-down because it would shield Homan from directly facing members who represent the constituency most affected by ICE raids.

"It's more of the same from the Trump administration," said an aide.

Hundreds of immigrants have been arrested in ICE raids in at least six states over the past week, in what the administration has called an effort to deport dangerous criminal aliens.

But Hispanic leaders have argued that large-scale raids are not targeted enforcement and unnecessarily round-up undocumented immigrants who are not dangerous criminals.

Reps. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), Judy Chu (D-Calif.) and Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) had planned to attend the meeting.A meeting between members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and the country's top immigration enforcement officer was canceled at the behest of Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and the White House, according to House Democrats.

The closed-door meeting, scheduled for Tuesday following a series of high-profile immigration raids, was canceled at the last minute.

"I will confirm that in my conversation with [Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Thomas] Holman, he made it clear to me that this decision came from higher up and I believe I’m accurately reflecting his statement when he said, ‘Kelly and the White House,’" said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), chairwoman of the CHC.

CHC members and other Democrats with a special interest in immigration were expected to ask Holman to produce specific data about people detained in ICE raids over the past two weeks, including why they were prioritized for removal.

ADVERTISEMENT A representative for ICE told The Hill the meeting had been canceled because the attendance had nearly tripled in size, forcing ICE to contact House leadership to coordinate a bipartisan meeting. But Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.) didn't buy that explanation.

"Bullshit," said Napolitano.

Democrats at a press conference held to address the cancellation all agreed there is no House rule that requires meetings with administration officials of a certain size be cleared by leadership.

"Unless it's a new Trump rule," said Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.)

Lujan Grisham said Holman had confirmed to her that ICE reached out to House leadership to request the bipartisan meeting, tentatively scheduled for later this week.

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Gillian Christensen later confirmed the decision to postpone the meeting had been taken because of the growing number of attendants.

“ICE leadership agreed to meet with six Democratic Members of Congress who signed a request on Friday, February 10, with the purpose of updating them on ICE’s recent enforcement operations. Because the attendees list grew substantially, DHS reached out to the House leadership staff to arrange a bipartisan, in-depth briefing, which the Speaker’s office arranged and scheduled for Thursday of this week. ICE looks forward to sharing information on its enforcement operations and how they are humanely and professionally enforcing U.S. immigration law,” said Christensen

Still, Democrats said they were "more than disappointed" by the decision to cancel Tuesday's meeting, which they saw as an opportunity to provide clarity to immigrant constituencies in panic over the changes in immigration enforcement.

"It’s disappointing that we’re having this press conference. We hoped to have a press conference to express further clarification as to what ICE is doing," said Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Caucus, "and instead we’re left in the lurch here and I’m being told they want to have a bipartisan meeting."

"It is really immoral to divide and destroy families, especially to make cheap, cowardly, political points at the expense of those families. Yeah, you lost in court, but you’re going to lose in the most important court, the court of public opinion," said Gutierrez.

Rep. Nannette Diaz-Barragan (D-Calif.) said ICE agents in her Los Angeles-area district confirmed to her people who had not committed crimes had been arrested.

"I want answers because my constituents in particular are getting picked up," said Diaz-Barragan.

Trump's executive orders on immigration expanded the definition of criminality for immigration cases and the rules for considering an immigrant a deportation priority.

"The definition in the executive order broadens the concept of crime in an amazing way," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.).

"If you did an act that would be considered a crime, you would be a target for enforcement. Well, what does that mean?"

Lujan Grisham said the group wasn't opposed to a larger, bipartisan meeting, but a meeting with the enforcement agencies directly targeting its constituency was the CHC's right.

"The request to have the meeting was to get real information, data about who was apprehended, who were the targets, where and confirm that information with our constituents for several reasons, but not the least of which is to make sure we’re following the law, that we’re clear people are getting due process, that they know their rights and in effect that we’re not causing, which we are, fear and panic in our communities," she said.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Gen. Valery Gerasimov met Thursday in Azerbaijan, the first meeting between the nations' top military officers since military cooperation was suspended three years ago amid Russian aggression in Ukraine.

“The U.S. and Russian militaries have undertaken efforts to improve operational safety of military activities in order to decrease the prospects for crisis and avoid the risk of unintended incidents,” the office said in a statement, in an apparent reference to existing de-escalation efforts in Syria. “The leaders further agreed to enhance communications on such stabilizing measures.”

The meeting has been in the works for months but happens at a time of turmoil in the United States over President Trump aides’ alleged communication with Russian intelligence officials.

Trump has come under increasing pressure in recent days over his stated desire to improve relations with Russia after Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser Monday night. The resignation came after it was revealed that Flynn spoke with the Russian ambassador to the United States about sanctions and misled top White House officials about the phone conversations.

The New York Times also reported Tuesday night that Trump campaign aides were in “constant” contact with Russia officials during the presidential campaign.

The U.S. statement on Thursday’s meeting did not elaborate on where “unintended incidents” might arise, but there are several areas where Russia and the United States have had encounters recently.

Both militaries operate in Syria, where the United States is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Russia is backing the Syrian regime. The U.S. and Russian militaries already regularly communicate about air operations there in an effort to avoid midair accidents between pilots.

But the Pentagon has also accused Russian jets and ships of “unsafe and unprofessional” behavior in the Black, Baltic and Mediterranean seas several times in the last year.

Most recently, last week, Russian jets repeatedly buzzed a U.S. guided missile destroyer in the Black Sea, U.S. European Command said Tuesday.

Thursday's conversation also included an exchange of "views on the state of U.S.-Russian military relations and of the international security situation in Europe, the Middle East, and other key regions," the statement said.

Russia’s statement about Dunford and Gerasimov’s meeting also said the discussion included talk of work “aimed to raise the safety level of military activities, decrease tensions and risks of incidents.”

“General of the Army Valery Gerasimov and General Joseph Dunford exchanged their views on condition of the Russia-America relationship, assessments of situations in the field of international security in Europe, Middle East, North Africa and other key regions of the world,” the Russian Defense Ministry statement added.

Despite Thursday’s talks, Defense Secretary James Mattis has ruled out military cooperation with Russia.

“We do not or are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level,” Mattis said Thursday morning in Brussels. “But our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward where Russia, living up to its commitments, will return to a partnership of sorts here with NATO.”The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 fax

The past few weekends of raucous town hall meetings prompted GOP leaders this week to advise lawmakers to be kind, firm and polite and take "precautions," as they return home to work in the district and hold public meetings on hot-button issues such as repealing and replacing Obamacare.

"Be firm, be nice, be polite but understand this is part of what we deal with when we're making big changes," Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) told The Hill's Molly K. Hooper of his advice to colleagues.

GOP leaders held a number of briefings this week to help members understand the details of the party's direction on Obamacare, so that they can answer questions at home.

Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said his advice for colleagues is, "Don't shy away from the public.” “Be prepared intellectually, knowledge-wise, be polite and don't fall for the bait if [protestors] try to get you in an uncomfortable situation."

Leaders also advised GOP members to take proper "security precautions," said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who warned those precautions can sometimes be too rigid.

Sanford plans to hold a town hall meeting on Saturday that is more "free form, free flow,” he said. “Other people have become quite regimented in their town hall meetings, but I think the more regimented you become the further away you get from real spirit of town halls."

Both sides could potentially face fired up Bernie Sanders supporters on matters such as President Trump's Supreme Court pick.

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said his colleagues can't hide from feisty meetings.

"If the Bernie people or whoever else wants to show up and want to holler that's wonderful,” he said.

“What is not OK is members of Congress who refuse to have those meetings. I understand they are tough … [but] it is your job, do them," Himes said, noting that he held more than a dozen town hall events at the height of the tea party protests in 2009.Andy Puzder on Wednesday withdrew his nomination to become President Trump’s secretary of Labor after it became apparent that he would not have enough Republican support to be confirmed.

The dramatic withdrawal came on the eve of Puzder’s confirmation hearing and at the urging of Senate Republican leaders who warned that anywhere from four to 12 of their members could defect in a confirmation vote, according to CNN.

“After careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor,” Puzder said in a statement. “I am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE to lead the Department of Labor and put America’s workers and businesses back on a path of sustainable prosperity.”

“While I won’t be serving in the administration, I fully support the president and his highly qualified team,” he added.

Puzder is President Trump’s first Cabinet nominee to withdraw, giving Democrats their first scalp after weeks of determined opposition.

Democrats and labor unions had assailed Puzder for his record as CEO of the fast-food conglomerate CKE Restaurants, which owns the burger chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.

“The fact that someone so anti-labor was even nominated shows how far President Trump is from where he campaigned,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Democrats declare victory after Puzder bows out MORE (D-N.Y.).

Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenAT&T, Time Warner defend deal Scott Brown being considered for ambassador to New Zealand: report Warren: Trump's EPA pick the 'attorney general for Exxon' MORE (D-Mass.) — who blasted Puzder from the Senate floor — said that Puzder should “get out of the kitchen” if he couldn’t withstand congressional scrutiny.

Puzder’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — a hearing that had been delayed several times — appeared at risk of becoming a spectacle.

For starters, Puzder was certain to face tough questions about why he had for years employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper — the type of offense that has doomed Cabinet nominees in the past.

Democrats were also likely to grill Puzder about accusations from his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, that he physically abused her.

Fierstein has since retracted those accusations, saying they were motivated by the divorce battle. But she appeared in disguise on “Oprah” to talk about the alleged abuse in March 1990, something she now calls a lapse in judgment.

Senators on the Labor Committee had viewed that video ahead of the hearing, according to Politico.

In perhaps the final straw for Puzder, his nomination was facing intense opposition from the right, with conservatives calling his selection a betrayal of Trump’s promise to get tough on immigration.

“Puzder himself has been a reliable font of clichés in favor of higher levels of legal immigration,” the conservative National Review wrote Wednesday.

“He has suggested that ‘the fact is that there are jobs in this country that U.S. citizens, for whatever reason, are reluctant or unwilling to perform’ — a cliché that ignores the possibility of raising wages to attract citizens — and as recently as 2015 encouraged reviving the Gang of Eight approach to immigration,” the magazine wrote.

“Over the past few days, I shared those concerns with Senate leadership and Chairman [Lamar] Alexander,” he said in a statement.

Alexander (R-Tenn.) had backed Puzder and reiterated his support on Wednesday, saying he would have made an excellent Labor secretary.

“He understands the difficulties American workers face in a rapidly changing workforce, and I look forward to continuing to hear his insights,” ­Alexander said.

Puzder’s withdrawal was yet another setback in a difficult week for the White House, coming just two days after Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser under a cloud of accusations about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to discuss whether Trump has another candidate for Labor secretary in mind.

When asked if the president is disappointed that both Flynn and Puzder are out, Spicer blamed Democrats for slow-walking the nominees.

“Where’s the role of Senate Democrats in this? We are now entering a point where we have slow-walked senior officials that can help make the government run as a whole,” he said.

“So when you tell me that you have asked Chuck Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Democrats declare victory after Puzder bows out MORE that, I’d be glad to answer the question. But at some point there is no focus on these guys having a double standard [from] what they had for Obama nominees.”

Democrats, meanwhile, were eager to celebrate their victory after failing to stop several of Trump’s other nominees, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

In a call with reporters Wednesday, Tom Perez, a former Labor secretary under President Obama who is now running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the news of Puzder’s withdrawal just another example of chaos in the Trump administration.

“Through this appointment he’s shown he was trying to make it harder for workers to get ahead and stay ahead,” he said of Trump.

Perez said Puzder, like Flynn, was not only incompetent, but also dangerous.

“If I had half the transgressions of Andy Puzder, I never would have gotten through,” he said.

Jordan Fabian and Jordain Carney contributed.A group of Senate Democrats want to roll back President Trump's executive order on deportation in the wake of a string high-profile immigration raids.

Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.),(Ill.) and(Hawaii) introduced legislation Thursday to rescind the order, which includes guidelines for prioritizing the deportation of "criminal" undocumented immigrants.

Cortez Masto accused the Trump administration of creating an "unprecedented deportation machine."

"The president's executive order sends a clear message to our immigrant families: You are a target for deportation," she said at press conference with immigrant groups opposed to the order.

Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly defended the arrests earlier this week, noting that roughly 75 percent of the 680 undocumented immigrants arrested were "criminal aliens."

The legislation would also undo Trump's crackdown on so-called "sanctuary cities," which don't follow federal immigration law.

Under the new order, the Trump administration expanded the definition of “criminal alien” to include individuals who entered the country without authorization, which was originally considered a misdemeanor offense.

Immigrants who have "committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense" are now priorities under the order, even if they have not yet been convicted.

Top Democrats and outside groups have decried the recent string of raids, arguing they are sparking fear in the Hispanic community.

Durbin argued on Thursday that the change threatens millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the country.

"[They] are currently living in the United States with no threat to our country, no criminal record, with strong families," he said.

Reports emerged over the weekend that ICE officials had conducted raids in several cities, though an exact number of arrests was not disclosed. The Department of Homeland Security said the operations were "consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by" immigration enforcement teams "on a daily basis."

Trump took a hard line on immigration during his presidential campaign pledging to deport roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.

But he appeared to soften that stance more recently, saying he would reach a "deal" on undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children and focus on immigrants with criminal records.

He also defended his policies during a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week, pledging he would step up his effort to deport "criminal" aliens.

“I said we will get the criminals out — the drug lords, the gang members — we're getting them out,” Trump said.

But Daniel Ramirez Medina, a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, was detained this week by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials when they showed up at his house to arrest Ramirez's father.

Medina filed a lawsuit against the administration on Wednesday, arguing it violated his Fith Amendment rights by failing to adhere to the terms of DACA.

The contents of this site are ©2017 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.Mexico's top diplomat is denying a report that he helped President Trump draft a speech about U.S. relations with Mexico.

"I never thought I would use this phrase, but today I'm doing it: FAKE NEWS," Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Luis Videgaray tweeted on Thursday.

Videgaray was likely referring to a CBS News story on Thursday that claimed he met privately in the Oval Office with Trump and presidential adviser Jared Kushner and helped draft a speech announcing Trump's border wall executive order.

A White House source also denied to CBS News that Videgaray played a role in drafting the speech, disputing Mexican officials' version of the events.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the CBS report, which cites unnamed sources, Videgaray was upset by the tone of the speech and warned the two that it would seriously harm relations. Videgaray and Kushner pushed Trump to soften his stance on Mexico in the speech.

In the speech, Trump announced his executive order directing federal agencies to begin working toward constructing a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The speech was delivered the same day Trump signed the order.

Videgaray was also in Washington that day for meetings with top White House staff, along with Mexican Secretary of the Economy Ildefonso Guajardo.

Despite Videgaray's alleged intervention, the executive order and Trump's insistence that Mexico pay for the wall led to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's announcement the following morning that he was canceling a scheduled trip to Washington.

A similar report in The Washington Post said Videgaray's influence in the White House has him on first name basis with aides. The Post also reported Kushner was invited to a private meeting between Videgaray and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Despite the denials, some see Videgaray's influence in Trump's relations with Mexico.

While Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall, he has also raised other issues, including the problem of American guns being smuggled south. That issue, long a concern for Mexico, had been mostly dealt with behind closed doors by previous administrations.

When Trump visited Peña Nieto in Mexico City in August, both men openly talked about the smuggling of guns and illicit cash from the United States to Mexico.

Ron Johnson Ron JohnsonDems ask for hearings on Russian attempts to attack election infrastructure GOP senators unveil bill to give Congress control of consumer bureau budget GOP gets bolder in breaking with Trump MORE (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The letter calls for the committee to investigate alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.

The seven Democrats on the committee heavily cited the intelligence community’s unclassified report concluding that the Russian government ordered a hacking and disinformation campaign with the intent of getting President Trump elected.

“An investigation of Russia’s attempts to infiltrate and influence the U.S. presidential election, particularly the attacks on state voter databases, would fall squarely within the jurisdiction of this committee,” the Democrats, led by ranking member(D-Mo.), wrote.

“This committee should investigate what happened in the 2016 election to ensure that DHS’s assistance is appropriately tailored to prevent infiltration of election boards and other election infrastructure in the future,” they wrote.

“Russian intelligence accessed elements of multiple state or local electoral boards. Since early 2014, Russian intelligence has researched U.S. electoral processes and related technology and equipment,” the intelligence community wrote. “DHS assesses that the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying.”

Reports emerged in August that hackers had breached election databases in Illinois and Arizona. Leading up to the presidential election, dozens of states requested help from the DHS to secure their voting systems from cyber threats.

The Obama administration in January designated U.S. election infrastructure as “critical,” in timing with the report about the Russian influence campaign. John Kelly, Trump’s DHS secretary, has indicated that he will keep that designation in place.

The senate Democrats asked Johnson to launch an investigation into Russia’s election interference by subpoenaing individuals from the government and private sector and scheduling regular public hearings on the matter.

“Russia’s organized campaign to undermine our presidential election and target our election infrastructure is certainly one of the most pressing issues facing our nation,” they wrote.

Other congressional panels, including the House and Senate Intelligence committees, are already probing Russia’s election meddling.

While former Labor Secretary Tom Perez is a leading contender for the race, many liberal Latinos are backing his main rival, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.).

“Obviously, as a Latina I’m interested in creating greater opportunities of representation for all people of color,” said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the New York City Council speaker who is backing Ellison.

“I do promote Latino candidates, but there should never be the assumption that one automatically supports a Latino candidate,” she added.

Perez has received top-level endorsements, including from former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTop union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race John Kerry to teach at Yale on global issues Ellison needles Perez for 'unverifiable' claim of DNC support MORE — an indication of support from former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE.

But Ellison has attracted a large swath of the progressive wing of the party. And some major players are switching sides.

Hilda Solis, Perez’s predecessor as secretary of Labor and a Clinton supporter in last year's campaign, supports Ellison and says he's the right person to bring the progressive and centrist wings of the party together.

“Keith will help to bridge that because I’ve seen him do it,” said Solis.

Still, many Hispanic Clinton allies have stuck to Perez, who himself was a top Clinton surrogate.

“Tom Perez is a proven and qualified progressive leader who has fought for the rights of communities of color, immigrants, women, the LGBTQ community and young people throughout his entire career, and we know he is the right person to unify and lead the Democratic Party,” said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the Latino Victory Fund.

The race's hallmark has been inclusiveness, a central theme raised by all candidates, not just Perez and Ellison.

“We’ve got to expand the party at every corner. Whether it’s Latinos (and I have a little experience at that), whether it’s folks who used to be Democrats and are now Republicans or voted for Jill Stein and we’ve got to bring home,” Perez said in an interview with The American Prospect Monday.

But Ellison has garnered endorsements from prominent Hispanics, including Reps. Luis Gutierrez Luis GutierrezDems: White House canceled ICE immigration meeting ICE head cancels meeting with Hispanic Dems Hispanics are split in DNC race MORE (D-Ill.) and Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), suggesting no single candidate has the inside track with the group.

Dolores Huerta, a prominent labor activist and civil rights icon who was a staunch Clinton surrogate, has also endorsed Ellison.

Ellison's early entry into the race may have also helped his cause, because he received immediate endorsements before any other big names had jumped in.

“Jumping early is indicative of how much he wants it, which I think is a very, very favorable thing,” said Mark-Viverito.

“Him coming early really is a reflection to me of how much thought he had given it.”

Ellison's pledge to focus on grassroots growth has also struck a nerve with many Hispanics, who feel the community suffers from chronic political underrepresentation. While Hispanics make up 17 percent of the national population, only 7 percent of members of Congress are Hispanic.

“I’m basing [my support] on my experience, and I know Keith as a candidate, as an elected official who has had to raise money,” said Mark-Viverito.

Despite the similarities in Perez and Ellison's proposals, the 2016 election is still present in Democrats' minds.

Asked if there is an establishment candidate in the race, Solis replied, “all I can say is that I really do think that the party has to think very hard in terms of the direction that we go in.”

Despite the drubbing, the 2016 campaign energized Latinos, yielding some of the few promising storylines of the election for Democrats. Wins in Nevada and Colorado, plus increased participation in California and relatively good showings in Arizona and Texas generated grassroots organizations the party is keen to bank on in future elections.

And the growth of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, from 27 to 31 members — now 30 because of former Rep. Xavier Becerra Xavier BecerraHispanics are split in DNC race Becerra launches 2018 bid for full term as California AG The green movement must continue in Trump era MORE's (D-Calif.) appointment as state attorney general — spurred Latino political activism.

“I'm proud to have the support of so many Latino leaders across the country,” said Ellison. “I'm an organizer at my very core, and Latinos are some of the best organizers we have. They've organized for better working conditions, higher wages, fighting climate change, immigration reform, and were a key presence at the women's marches across the country.”

But the main uniting factor for Democrats remains opposition to President Trump, with his executive actions on immigration taking center stage for Latinos.

“We've already seen what a Trump administration intends to do — to sow fear in communities by conducting raids and separating families — and our party won't stand for that,” said Ellison.House Democrats are pressing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to ask former national security adviser Michael Flynn to testify before the panel.

Flynn resigned late Monday after revelations that he misled top White House officials about the nature of his conversations with a Russian envoy to the U.S. during the transition. Nunes has said he’s not interested in investigating Flynn.

"I've just heard that there's a letter circulating to the chairman to ask Michael Flynn to come before the committee," said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who serves on the Intelligence Committee.

Adam Schiff (Calif.), the panel’s ranking Democrat, intends to ask Nunes at a meeting Wednesday afternoon to expand the scope of the committee's investigation into Kremlin interference in last year’s election to include Flynn's communications with the Russians.

"If you are Michael Flynn do you come? Are you subpoenaed? Do you demand, for example, immunity? Do you demand immunity because there's been an indictment? There's just a lot of moving pieces," Himes said.

He also joined Democratic leadership in calling for an independent investigation into the matter.

While Senate Republicans expressed openness to probing Flynn's interactions with the Russian ambassador, some Republicans in the House dismissed the effort, saying the matter was closed after President Trump forced Flynn out.

"This White House certainly dealt with this issue rather quickly, it seems to me. General Flynn's no longer the security adviser, so I think it's much to do about nothing," Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told The Hill.

Trump did not see a transcript of the communications but was given a summary of Flynn's discussions with the Russian ambassador prior to his resignation, Fox News reported Thursday.

Flynn also reportedly was able to remember his discussions and told the White House counsel’s office about the details.

"The president was, in fact, fully briefed on the content of those conversations that Gen. Michael Flynn had with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, by people who would know what the content of those phone conversations was,” Fox News chief White House correspondent John Roberts told Bill O’Reilly on Thursday night.

“And under repeated questioning during an investigation conducted by the White House counsel’s office, Gen. Flynn, I'm told, had a full recollection of what he talked about with the Russian ambassador.”

A spokesman for Flynn prior to his resignation said that Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up,” according to The Washington Post.

"Mike was doing his job," Trump said at his press conference Thursday. "He was calling countries and his counterparts. ... I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it. I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.”

Trump said he believes Flynn “did nothing wrong.”House Intelligence Committee member Pete King (R-N.Y.) said Congress should investigate all U.S. ties to Russia, including any connections to former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

"We should obviously include anything involving Russia’s dealing with the United States," King told The Hill’s Molly K. Hooper when asked if Congress should specifically investigate Flynn’s conversations about sanctions with the Russian ambassador.

Though he would not speak for Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) — who reportedly nixed the idea of opening a new investigation into Flynn — King noted the Intelligence Committee “has been investigating Russian involvement going back a year.”

“What I think he’s saying is there's no need for a new investigation,” King said. “There is an ongoing investigation by the House Intelligence Committee."A strong majority of voters oppose the deportation of people living in the United States illegally, but an equally large share of the electorate thinks that the nation’s borders are not as secure as they should be, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill.



The findings underline the complexity of an issue that has taken center-stage since President Obama and a bipartisan group of senators put forward separate proposals for comprehensive immigration reform last week.

ADVERTISEMENT

A decisive 64 percent of respondents in The Hill Poll said illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country, with 47 percent supporting the additional step of creating a pathway to citizenship for the same people.

By contrast, only 27 percent of voters called for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to be deported.

But exactly the same share of voters — 64 percent — asserted that the borders of the United States are either “not very secure” or “not secure at all.”

The latter finding could be a sign that the Senate’s plan might be the more popular, because it would make the citizenship benefits “contingent upon securing the border.”

Obama, by contrast, is supportive of tougher border measures but doesn’t want to make the citizenship benefits dependent upon the security steps being taken first.

Party affiliation is a big factor underlying voters’ views on immigration, the survey found, with 62 percent of Democrats supporting a pathway to citizenship versus 32 percent of Republicans; and 39 percent of Republicans backing mandatory deportations, versus 16 percent of Democrats.

Overall, respondents graded Democrats and Republicans almost equally when it comes to “immigration and border security,” with 41 percent favoring Obama’s position and 39 percent preferring the GOP’s.

Another question amid the immigration debate is whether same-sex couples should receive the same consideration as heterosexual couples under an overhaul of the system.

Behind Obama, Democrats are pushing for such equal treatment, which in practical terms would mean that non-citizen partners of Americans in same-sex unions would be entitled to a green card, just as is the case with heterosexual marriages.

But Republicans aren’t on board with that proposal, and the Senate’s reform blueprint excludes that language as a result.

The Hill’s poll indicates that voters are split almost evenly on the issue, with 46 percent of respondents supportive of Obama’s position and 45 percent opposed to it.

On that issue, both party and gender appear to play a significant role, with 59 percent of Democrats — and 52 percent of women — supporting the extension of benefits to same-sex couples, while 64 percent of Republicans — and 54 percent of men — oppose the same provision.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Jan. 31 by Pulse Opinion Research, an independent polling firm that borrows the automated procedures of Rasmussen Reports.

The push for immigration reform has risen near the top of the congressional to-do list this year, largely as a result of November’s elections, which found Obama winning the support of Hispanic voters by a thumping margin of 71 percent to 27 percent over GOP contender Mitt Romney. Since then, GOP leaders have been seeking ways to attract more Hispanic voters to their side. A bipartisan reform bill, they hope, will do just that.

The details of an infrastructure proposal are murky, particularly given Republican opposition to any move that could heavily increase spending.

But such a bill could find Trump common ground with Democrats, who have so far opposed his government at every turn, many of whom could benefit from an influx of infrastructure spending but have thus far felt alienated by Trump's immigration actions.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 27.3 percent of all construction workers in 2015 were Hispanic. Comparatively, Hispanics make up about 17 percent of the total population of the United States.

“People are talking about infrastructure in different ways, some are talking about development projects, others about repairing the infrastructure that we have, and others are talking about digital infrastructure,” said Eric Rodriguez, vice president of the National Council of La Raza.

“We look at all those things in terms of whether they’re going to benefit the economy directly,” he added.

While Latinos and other low-income communities could benefit from a spending uptick, that would only happen if development projects happened in their communities and hired workers within those communities.

Rodriguez cited former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE's stimulus package after the 2008 financial crisis as an example of spending on projects not benefitting those most in need.

“In the case of the stimulus package, the Latino community and African-American community were the least to benefit from the stimulus in projects,” he said.

Those groups instead benefitted from the tax credits offered by the package, which allowed them to have more liquidity and spend money in their communities.

“It’s smart to make institutional and federal investments if in fact they’re investments that generate economic activity,” said Rodriguez.

Even if Trump successfully picks investments that generate growth, he'll have to pair his proposal with deep spending cuts to keep Republicans on board.

“I am typically resistant to doing something without any benefit, so I would have to see what the proposal is, and I'm hoping this administration would have some proposals the includes how to reduce spending,” said Sen. Tim Scott Tim ScottOvernight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Puzder withdraws nomination for Labor secretary Ryan tries to save tax plan MORE (R-S.C.).

And any spending project is likely to meet even tougher resistance from the GOP's conservative Freedom Caucus in the House.

Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho), one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, said “everything has to be paid for.”

House Democrats, meanwhile, are quickly losing faith in the president to make good on those campaign promises where Democrats were hoping to lend an assist, and infrastructure is among them.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said this week that Democrats would jump at the chance to move “a real investment in infrastructure,” but she’s not ready to support the public-private approach Trump and the Republicans favor, which she deems “a tax break for his rich friends.”

“So far we haven’t seen anything from the administration that would justify any kind of cooperation,” Pelosi said Wednesday during the Democrats’ annual strategy retreat in Baltimore. “They have put forth nothing.”

Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, piled on, saying the public-private approach would be a deal-breaker.

“That’s not a partnership. That’s a transfer of ownership responsibility and liability,” she said. “If it really does look like that, that’s going to be a problem, and I would guess that that would be a huge problem for the Caucus.”

Rodriguez warned that those kinds of partnerships could even prove counterproductive, because costs passed down to the final user are relatively more expensive for low-income individuals.

“Fees and tolls are regressive,” Rodriguez said.

A failure to move a bill this year would be a lost opportunity, Lujan Grisham added, because the local projects supported by such a bill provide a quicker economic boost than most other federal spending.

In terms of bang for your buck, she said, “infrastructure’s the fastest.”

“It typically has bipartisan support; it gets to our priorities immediately; it’s easy to recruit workers,” she said.

But Rodriguez said other policy issues could get in the way of recruiting workers.

“We’re in a new environment, which is there’s a good deal of fear and anxiety in communities about raids and deportations," he said. "Nobody knows where that’s really going to go, but that’s bad for business."

And the choice of projects would affect whether they stimulate the economy or simply maintain employment levels.

“You’d look at communities with high unemployment rates and target them and prioritize local hiring, rather than reinvesting in already developed major areas of cities,” he said.

“You’d want to have a job training component to it so you wouldn’t have workers coming from other communities.”

But given the deep chasm between Trump and Democrats on most issues, infrastructure spending is likely to be one of the few areas where they see eye-to-eye.

“I would take any economic investment, but infrastructure really moves the needle quick, and it also then creates local jobs as a result,” said Lujan Grisham. “Retail pops up; other businesses move in. And so it really gives you the biggest bang for your buck I think in the shortest amount of time.”A Maryland Democrat is leading a House effort to boost funding for Washington’s Metrorail in exchange for a series of reforms to its labor agreements and governance structure.



Rep. John Delaney, who surveyed over 1,700 people about how best to upgrade the beleaguered transit system, unveiled legislation on Thursday that would give Metro an additional $75 million in annual federal funding over 10 years. D.C., Maryland and Virginia would also have to kick in a combined $75 million per year under the measure.



Metro is projected to face a nearly $300 million budget shortfall in fiscal 2018, as it has implemented a massive repair project in an effort to fix on-going safety issues. Congress already provides $150 million per year for Metro’s capital budget.

But to receive the extra cash under Delaney’s bill, the three local jurisdictions would have to reduce Metro’s board of directors from 16 members to nine, require all members to meet certain qualifications and give the general manager a seat on the board.The measure also would require Metro’s collective bargaining agreement to be overhauled in a way that allows for necessary improvements “while maintaining key wage protections.”If the local jurisdictions do not implement these changes within 18 months, the federal government could withdraw its consent from Metro’s Compact, which is the transit system’s founding document.“This legislation removes the brakes that have held back reform for too long,” Delaney said. “We give the jurisdictions a powerful two-pronged incentive — more funding coupled with a ticking clock on the Compact — to take two necessary actions: create a world-class Board of Directors for Metro comprised of experts with a fiduciary responsibility and make sure that management-labor provisions allow the system to perform better and become safer for everyone.”A D.C. business council has long advocated for Metro’s compact to be rewritten so that the transit agency can restructure its finances and governance structure.“Metro is suffering from an existential problem as old as Metro itself: The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact, which governs the operation of the Metro system, is fundamentally flawed,” the Federal City Council wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post last year. “It is hard to fix Metro when its member jurisdictions can veto productive changes or well-conceived management plans are not effectively executed in the field.”The Washington Post reported that Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock is also preparing legislation to overhaul Metro’s Compact, but her measure will aim to extract bigger concessions from labor unions before granting any extra funding to the transit agency.A Democratic lawmaker is advising his colleagues on how to not get suckered by fake Twitter accounts, which happened to some top Democrats on Tuesday.

Rep. Eric Swalwell’s (D-Calif.) tip: Look for the telltale blue check mark that denotes a verified account.

"Look for the check mark, make sure they're verified, step one," Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, advised fellow lawmakers.

Earlier Tuesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) cited a fake Twitter account purporting to belong to former national security advisor Michael Flynn as they called for investigations into Flynn.

Flynn resigned late Monday after reports he misled top White House officials about the nature of his conversations with Russia’s U.S. ambassador in December.

Even though the Twitter account Pelosi and Cummings referenced ended up being phony, Swalwell joins the top Democrats in saying an investigation into Flynn is still warranted.

Watch the video above to hear Swalwell in his own words.President Trump’s surprise press conference Thursday was a clear attempt to turn the page on what has been a tumultuous start to his administration.

But for all the flamboyant, combative and outright bizarre moments during Trump’s extended East Room confrontation with the press corps, questions about Russia are still crowding in on the president.

The hastily arranged event looked like an effort to change the subject after national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned over a phone call with the Russian ambassador and The New York Times published allegations that Trump aides had “repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials” in the year leading up to November’s presidential election.

ADVERTISEMENT

The difficulties for the White House go beyond Flynn, with questions swirling about the administration’s competence and policies, the persistent leaks of damaging information and rumors of staff infighting.

At times, the president sought to frame allegations of Russian meddling within a broader framework of “fake news” and media malfeasance — jabs he threw over and over again in a news conference that lasted well over an hour.

At one point, he described media focus on Russia as “a ruse.” Earlier he taunted the press that “you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all, you know, a fake news, fabricated deal.”

Intentionally or otherwise, the president also created plenty of water-cooler moments.

He engaged in a prolonged verbal joust with CNN’s Jim Acosta; asked reporter April Ryan, who is black, if members of the Congressional Black Caucus were friends of hers; and asserted in one of many curious asides that “drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars.”

When Trump sought to reconcile his assertion that he was the victim of false stories with his anger at people who have been leaking information, he came up with one of the most memorable soundbites of the news conference.

“The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake,” he said.

While some reporters engaged Trump in a discussion of journalistic ethics and First Amendment rights, others pressed Trump on what connections, if any, existed between his campaign and Moscow.

The president adamantly denied anything untoward, saying “nobody that I know of” had been in any such communication.

On another occasion, Trump insisted: “I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.”

But the issue is one that holds real peril for the president. It is unlikely to be put to bed anytime soon, especially with some of Trump’s Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill insisting that the matter needs to be fully investigated.

Trump defended Flynn in some respects and never made clear whether he believes the ousted national security adviser did anything wrong by raising the issue of U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. At the time, President Obama was still in office and had just announced the new measures in response to allegations of Russian interference in the election.

More generally, the fractious tone of the press conference did little to allay the sense that the Trump administration is struggling to right itself as it approaches the end of its first month.

The president insisted in the early stages of his news conference that “this administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.” But his tone at times undercut that message.

Especially in the opening minutes, Trump seemed angry and resentful about media coverage that he clearly believes is unfair and a press corps whom he sees as unwilling to acknowledge the magnitude of his achievement in winning the White House.

He returned once again to the scale of his victory in the Electoral College, just as he had during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. One of his most telling complaints came much later when he lamented, “Story after story after story is bad! I won! I won!”

Trump’s poll ratings are the worst recorded for a new president — a Pew poll released earlier on Thursday showed him with only a 39 percent approval rating — but the president instead emphasized a Rasmussen poll that put his approval a full 16 points higher.

“The Rasmussen poll has me through the roof,” he said.

The ostensible purpose of the news conference was to announce Trump’s new pick for Labor secretary in the wake of Andrew Puzder’s withdrawal. But by the end of the East Room event, the selection of Alexander Acosta, the current dean of the law school at Florida International University, seemed like an afterthought.

Some of Trump’s most fervent fans expressed enthusiasm for his performance at the news conference. Fox News anchor Sean Hannity called it “amazing” and “a total beat down” on Twitter.

But another anchor at the same network, Shepard Smith, had a very different take.

Trump, Smith said on-air, “keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all, and sort of avoiding the issue of Russia as if we’re some kind of fools for asking the question. Really?”Throughout the presidential campaign, Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE repeated a particular line of attack against Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonMark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game The latest scheme in the left’s war on Trump Local broadcast news knows America better than cable MORE over and over, with great impact. Her decades of experience and grasp of policy nuances were irrelevant; when placed in a position of trust, she had exercised poor judgment and could not be afforded that opportunity again as commander in chief. With the selection of retired Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser, however, Trump showed that he, too, was prone to egregious lapses in judgment. Now, with Flynn resigning in the wake of escalating leaks about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, the country is learning just how bad this judgment call was Trump so early in his presidency.

It’s easy to forget that Flynn once had a laudable and respected military career. Becoming a 3-star general is not an accomplishment for the faint of heart and takes decades of service and persistence to achieve. Flynn played significant roles in the intelligence arena, particularly during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He had seeming bipartisan political approval and served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under President Obama.

That, however, is where things appear to have gone off the rails. Maybe it was “mission fatigue” after three decades of military service. Maybe it was hubris. Maybe it was plain old arrogance. Whatever the reason, Flynn became erratic, struggled to manage the DIA’s sprawling bureaucracy and developed a penchant for relying upon erroneous factual information. He even began brazenly flouting his agency’s own security rules that he personally deemed “stupid” but which he nonetheless continued to impose upon the rest of his employees. He was forced into retirement in 2014.

During the presidential campaign, Flynn hitched his comeback bid to Trump. Flynn and Trump shared a lot of the same “black and white” views of the world, particularly with respect to the threat of jihadist terrorism. They shared the same disdain for what they saw as the Obama administration’s restrained and “politically correct” approach to countering threats from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria abroad and self-radicalized threats within the United States. They both reveled in the “lock her up” chants directed toward Clinton and her sloppy handling of her email communications while serving as secretary of State.

When Trump was elected, however, it would have been understandable if he had chosen to push Flynn to the bench. Controversies surrounding Flynn’s ties to Russia were already well known. There was video of him in 2015 sitting at a table with Vladimir Putin at a celebration for the Russian president, an event for which Flynn was paid to attend. The private consulting firm he had led after leaving the military had eyebrow-raising ties to the Turkish government. Flynn was a wild card, much like other Trump campaign surrogates that were pushed aside after the campaign, and it would have made sense for Trump to pass on placing Flynn in a sensitive government position. Trump did so anyway, making Flynn his national security adviser — a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

At the time, the choice merely seemed controversial and risky. Now, however, we know that the Trump administration appears to have deliberately kept in a position of authority a man the intelligence community had explicitly warned was compromised by the Russian government. In a bombshell report, The Washington Post has revealed that the White House was warned by the Justice Department that Flynn had misled them, particularly then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence Mike (Michael) Richard PencePence tells Europe: We will ‘hold Russia accountable’ Dem senator: 'This is not the presidency we were promised' Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump MORE, about the nature of the phone calls Flynn had with the Russian government around the same time that the Obama administration was imposing new sanctions. Flynn had reassured Pence and the transition team that the calls never touched upon the issue of sanctions, something that was restated in public by the Trump transition team repeatedly for weeks leading up to Trump’s inauguration.

The intelligence community knew better and wanted the White House to know about it. Intelligence intercepts picked up the calls Flynn had with the Russians, the contents of which proved Flynn’s claims to be false. The Justice Department notified the White House counsel at the end of January that Flynn had misled the White House and was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail as a result.

Trump now had his moment to exercise the type of judgment he felt Clinton had failed to utilize at State. Two weeks were allowed to pass, however, with no action taken against Flynn. He maintained his access to classified information and remained involved in sensitive national security matters, including coordinating a response to the recent missile test by the North Korean government. The White House continued until just recently to maintain that Flynn’s original story was accurate.

It was only within the last 72 hours, as media leaks exposed what the White House already knew, that Flynn’s job was finally in jeopardy. Flynn offered his resignation and Trump accepted, a choice that was correct to make. It was a choice, however, that Trump should have made two weeks ago. When it comes to exercising good judgment, the president failed his own test miserably.

A full 51 percent of voters said the former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state is running for president in the 2016 election, while just 21 percent said she is not running. Meanwhile a plurality, 41 percent, believe Clinton will be the Democratic Party’s 2016 nominee. Just 7 percent of voters said the party would anoint Vice President Biden, while 35 percent said the nominee would be someone else.

Democratic voters were more confident that Clinton would be the ultimate pick, with 53 percent saying she will be the nominee, 6 percent saying Biden will be chosen and 24 percent saying the party will go with someone else. Among Republicans, just 39 percent said Clinton would be the Democratic nominee, 7 percent predicted Biden, while 42 percent said the party would choose another candidate.

The question of whether Clinton will run for president in 2016 is not a new one, but the announcement last week that she will pen a memoir about world affairs and her experience as secretary of state has amped up speculation over her political future to almost feverish levels.

Clinton’s closest advisers have insisted that she has not yet made a decision on a run for the White House, but that has not stopped the formation of a political action committee dedicated to promoting her candidacy called “Ready for Hillary.” James Carville, a close friend of the Clinton family, a key advisor to Bill Clinton Bill ClintonC-SPAN survey: Obama 12th-best president Does a national public infrastructure bank make sense?

As Clinton’s supporters encourage her into making another bid for the nation’s highest office, a spate of recent polls show Clinton trouncing her potential opponents, both Democrats and Republicans, in hypothetical match-ups. An April 3 poll from Public Policy Poll showed Clinton leading a pack of potential Democratic nominees by 64 percent to 18 percent for the closest rival, Biden.

Although Clinton, if elected, would be the first female president, The Hill poll results showed no significant divide between male and female voters on these questions.

Almost four years out from the next presidential election, Washington is already buzzing about another potential Democratic frontrunner: Biden. But the results from The Hill Poll showed bad news for the vice president: A majority of voters, 57 percent, said Clinton would make a better president, while just 10 percent said Biden would make a better leader.

Notably, blacks tended to support a Biden candidacy more than any other race. A majority, 52 percent, of blacks said Biden is running for president, while only 28 percent of whites and 22 percent of other races said he is running. When asked which of the two would make a better president, whites picked Clinton by 59 to 9 percent. Blacks picked her by a much slimmer margin: 36 to 28 percent.

This discrepancy could be due to the vice president’s close relationship with Obama, or to residual resentment toward Clinton from the heated 2008 Democratic primary.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on April 4 by Pulse Opinion Research.

Daniel Ramirez Medina, a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, was detained Tuesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials when they showed up at his house to arrest Ramirez's father.

The complaint alleges that agents violated Ramirez's Fifth Amendment due process rights by failing to adhere to the terms of DACA.

ICE agents were allowed into the home by Ramirez's father to notify Ramirez and his brother of the arrest, according to a complaint filed by lawyers.

ADVERTISEMENT

ICE agents then asked whether Ramirez was legally in the country, to which he replied, “Yes, I have a work permit,” before declining to answer any further questions.

Ramirez has protected status under DACA, which he initially received in 2014 and renewed in 2016, reported NPR.

Democrats say Medina’s detention raises questions about whether ICE’s deportation efforts are legal.

“Medina was arrested even after identifying himself as a legal U.S. resident, and was reportedly pressured to confess to unfounded accusations by ICE agents. If President Trump truly believes in the rule of law, upholding our country’s 4th Amendment rights would be a good place to start,” Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a statement.

President Trump has not overturned the executive order signed by former President Obama that created DACA, essentially leaving the program in the books.

ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson defended Ramirez's detention, telling NPR he is a “self-admitted gang member.”

But Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), in a statement Wednesday, said that false accusations of gang membership are “a reality for many Latino men.”

“Right after I graduated college something happened to me that has happened to many other Latino men but few other Members of Congress,” he said.

“My brother and I were pulled over by the police in broad daylight. Suddenly there were five police cars surrounding us. My car was turned inside out without reason. I was questioned belligerently by the police. And we were asked, ‘what gang are you a member of?’ I remember it like it was yesterday,” he said.

Ramirez passed background checks when he initially applied for DACA in 2014 and when he renewed his permit in 2016.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who represents parts of Seattle, said she's spent much of the last 24 hours on the phone with Ramirez's lawyers, who are confused about the charges.

“This was somebody who had DACA status, legal status, and presented those papers, and now is being accused of being a criminal … a self-admitted gang member. We don't know what that means, but his attorneys say he has never admitted to any such thing. And we've actually seen this in other ICE cases around the country,” Jayapal told reporters Wednesday in the Capitol.

Trump vowed to prioritize the deportation of foreigners with criminal records, and his executive actions on immigration greatly expanded the definition of criminality, broadening the number of people who can be targeted as deportation priorities.

To qualify for DACA, recipients provided the federal government with extensive personal information, as well as an admission of having entered the country illegally, albeit not of their own volition.

Immigration activists have consistently expressed concern that this database could be used as a target list by the Trump administration.

“Dreamers like Daniel are young people who grew up in this country and represent the striving and ambition at the heart of the American dream. They came out of the shadows, gave their information to the government, and went through background checks, all believing that they would be protected from deportation. Targeting Dreamers is a betrayal of that trust and it is a betrayal of who we are as a country,” said Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.).

Ramirez's detention received strong reactions from immigration advocates, especially in the wake of increased immigration raids over the past week and the deportation of Arizona resident Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, who was apprehended as she voluntarily complied with a yearly inspection at her local ICE headquarters.

“If not quickly reversed, ICE’s arrest of a young immigrant who was granted deferred action could make a travesty of the federal government’s promises to DACA grantees across the country, who came to the U.S. as children and are an integral part of our communities,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

Under DACA, foreign citizens brought to the country illegally as minors were protected from deportation and given a work permit, valid for two years after each renewal.

The nearly 750,000 recipients of the program, known as Dreamers after the failed Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, have been at the center of the immigration debate.

A bipartisan group of legislators reintroduced in January the Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy (BRIDGE) Act, designed to put DACA formally into law. Under BRIDGE, the temporary relief afforded to dreamers by DACA would be formally protected by law.The Secret Service is reportedly investigating after a vehicle in President Trump's motorcade was hit by an object in south Florida, where the president is spending his weekend.

President Trump is in Florida visiting his Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago for a third straight weekend; last weekend he was joined by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Trump is expected to appear at a rally in Melbourne, Fla., on Saturday.Hispanic organizers are struggling to tamp down panic in their communities as federal authorities begin to implement President Trump's executive orders on immigration.

One of the first cases to receive national attention, the deportation of Arizona resident Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, has put undocumented and mixed status communities on edge.

"It's fair to say we’re all extremely troubled by the deportation action we saw take place yesterday in Arizona," said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza.

"The first deportation [after] his executive order is of a working mom with two U.S. kids," she added.

On the campaign trail, Trump initially promised to enact a deportation force to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, starting with dangerous criminals.

“They’re going to be out of here so fast, your head will spin,” Trump told Fox News in August. “As far as the rest, we’re going to go through the process, like they are now — perhaps with a lot more energy.”

Trump softened his tone somewhat over the campaign, saying at the final presidential debate in October that he would prioritize the removal of "bad hombres."

And as president-elect, Trump said his government would seek out "three or four million" dangerous criminals immigrants for deportation.

Many Hispanic advocates feel that the Garcia de Rayos case shows the Trump administration will aggressively pursue all undocumented immigrants.

"This reaffirms that when the Trump administration said they would go after criminals, they really meant everybody," Murguia said.

The perception that Trump is shifting back to his early campaign proposals has shaken many Hispanics, including many who are legally in the country.

"The uncertainty and the confusion is prevalent with undocumented, legal residents and also citizens," said Telemundo anchorman José Diaz-Balart. "There are millions of mixed status families in the United States of America."

And community organizers admit they have few tools to quell the trepidation.

NCLR is one of many organizations that has set up a legal defense structure and started programs to inform immigrants of their rights, but under current law, an undocumented immigrant who comes in contact with federal enforcement officers has relatively few options.

"We want people to stay calm and we want to give them assurances but we can’t give them assurances," Murguía said.

Community organizations and media are focusing on keeping people informed of their options and the government's ability to persecute undocumented immigrants.

"What we are asking of the community is to get more plugged into community organizations," said Erika Andiola, political director of Our Revolution, a political action group spun off Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? AT&T, Time Warner defend deal Top union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race MORE's (I-Vt.) presidential campaign.

"[We're] providing know-your-rights training, things you can do to protect yourself if you have a house raid or work raid," Andiola said.

Diaz-Balart, the anchor for Noticieros Telemundo, the network's nightly news program, is hosting a town hall event Sunday for his viewers to better understand the administration's immigration actions.

"[Immigrants are] now asking, 'how is this going to have an impact on me?'" said Diaz-Balart.

"It’s a town hall that is going to be dealing with the questions that we hear over and over and over again from the people that we serve," he said. "It’s not about telling people what they want to hear, it’s about making sure the people are informed about things."

Through his executive orders, Trump went after so-called "sanctuary cities" that restrict the degree to which their law enforcement agents collaborate with federal immigration enforcement. He has also redefined who could be labeled a "criminal alien."

That redefinition greatly expanded the number of undocumented immigrants liable to be targeted for removal, beyond the "three or four million" that Trump had mentioned.

José Magaña-Salgado, an attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, cited a study that said as many as 8 million people could now be targeted for deportation.

Under Trump's order, the definition of criminality was expanded to include misdemeanors like illicitly crossing the border.

It also expanded the definitions for immigrants to be considered priorities for deportation. Foreigners who have "committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense" are priorities, even before conviction. It also includes those who have committed "fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency," a category that includes using fake Social Security numbers to work.

While Trump campaigned on the prospect of removing dangerous criminals, Magaña-Salgado said the very structure of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would provide an incentive for indiscriminate enforcement.

"The general philosophy of ICE agents and CBP agents, they view their job as expelling as many people from the country as possible," said Magaña-Salgado.

"It benefits them to have high deportation numbers because they can justify their budget, they can justify their mission," he added.

And cases like Garcia de Rayos provide an easy target for federal agents.

Garcia de Rayos was apprehended during a yearly inspection at her local ICE headquarters, in which she voluntarily presented herself keeping with orders given to her when she was originally apprehended.

As a low-risk offender — Garcia de Rayos was convicted of using a fake Social Security Number to work — she was not on the Obama administration's deportation priority list despite have been slated for deportation by an immigration judge.

Beyond the detention of Garcia de Rayos, ICE conducted large raids this week on homes and workplaces that further alarmed Hispanic communities.

Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said agents denied access to immigration lawyers after one such raid in Los Angeles that rounded up about 100 people.

"Immigration attorneys flocked to the scene," Tumlin said. "They were shut out."

"[It's] absolutely unacceptable and potentially unlawful," she added.

Similar cases to Garcia de Rayos could also attract the attention of federal enforcement officers because of the shortage of immigration judges to prosecute cases. People who have already been slated for deportation by a judge can be removed without further due process.

The lack of immigration judges is "certainly going to be a constraint," said Magaña-Salgado.

But agents can use expedited removal procedures, curbed under the Obama administration but not taken off the books, to get detainees to accept a quick deportation over a lengthy wait for an immigration judge, in many cases while incarcerated.

"They’re going to use that tool to take people out of the court system and due process," Magaña-Salgado said.

Activists warn that going after easy targets can damage communities in several ways.

People who would otherwise be economically active could go into hiding, trust in law enforcement agencies could be diminished, and dangerous criminals could more easily slip through the cracks as federal agents pursue non-dangerous undocumented immigrants.

"People want to comply with the enforcement agencies," Murguia said. "They’re supposed to report in with these check ins; if they see they’re going to put themselves at risk, it’s a very difficult situation."

"These are gut wrenching, heart-breaking stories," she added. "In a civilized society, we can’t find a better way to deal with these issues?"

Click here to view data from The Hill Poll.President Trump signed legislation Tuesday to repeal a controversial regulation that would have required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments.

The legislation is the first time in 16 years that the Congressional Review Act (CRA) has been used to repeal a regulation, and only the second time in the two decades that act has been law. It is the third piece of legislation Trump has signed since taking office three weeks ago.

It is the start of one front in an aggressive deregulatory effort that the Trump administration and the GOP Congress are undertaking to roll back Obama-era rules on fossil fuel companies, financial institutions and other businesses that they say have suffered for the last eight years.

ADVERTISEMENT

The resolution repeals a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule written under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.

It was meant to fight corruption in resource-rich countries by mandating that companies on United States stock exchanges disclose the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas, coal and mineral companies make to governments.

At a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump said the legislation is part of a larger regulatory rollback that he and congressional Republicans are undertaking with the goal of economic and job recovery.

The administration and congressional allies say the SEC rule imposes massive, unnecessary costs on United States oil, natural gas and mining companies, putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that do not have to comply.

“Misguided federal regulations such as the SEC rule addressed by H.J.R. 41 inflict real cost on the American people and put our businesses, especially small businesses, at a significant disadvantage,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said earlier Tuesday.

“It’s a priority for the Trump administration to fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances American productivity and well-being without imposing unnecessary costs and burdens,” he said.

“Signing this joint resolution is one more step toward achieving this goal.”

The House passed the repeal measure earlier this month, followed shortly by the Senate.

Democrats and supporters of the SEC rule see the rollback as a victory for corruption.

“The rule they’re trying to repeal protects U.S. citizens and investors from having millions of their dollars vanished into the pockets of corrupt foreign oligarchs,” Sen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod BrownHouse bill would prevent Trump from lifting Russian sanctions Dem senators call for independent Flynn probe Overnight Regulation: Trump signs repeal of oil industry transparency rule MORE (D-Ohio), top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said earlier this month. “This kind of transparency is essential to combating waste, fraud, corruption and mismanagement.”

Supports argued in part that if the United States takes a leading role on foreign payment transparency, other major nations would follow.

Exxon Mobil Corp., whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is now secretary of State, was one of the most vocal opponents of the rule, along with other major oil companies.

The SEC is still obligated under the Dodd-Frank law to write some form of a transparency rule for extractive industries.

But under the CRA, the agency can never publish any rule that is “substantially the same” as the one that has now been overturned.

Both chambers of Congress have also passed a CRA resolution to overturn the Interior Department’s stream protection rule for coal mining, and Trump supports the repeal.

The House has passed numerous other regulatory repeal measures under the CRA, including ones on methane pollution and gun ownership, and the Senate is likely to take up at least some of them.Only 36 percent of voters know what the sequester is, even as the topic dominates discussion inside the beltway, according to a new poll from The Hill.

Even more (38 percent) chose one of the incorrect explanations. Just over one-in-three voters correctly pegged it as a package of spending cuts that will soon take effect.

Washington has been feeding the public a steady diet of news headlines about the doom and gloom surrounding fiscal issues for some time. As policymakers lurch from one fiscal crisis to another, it perhaps should not be surprising that voters are having a hard time keeping track of it all.

Roughly one-fifth of those polled, 21 percent, had some sense the sequester was a fiscal issue, but got their crises tangled, believing that the term describes the possibility that the United States could soon exceed its debt limit.

Congress put that standoff to bed (for now) in January. Meanwhile, the real sequester is set to begin taking effect March 1.

Another eight percent of voters claimed to know about the sequester, but got their branches of government confused. Those voters believe the term refers to an upcoming ruling by the Supreme Court on the federal budget. Such a case would come as news to Chief Justice John Roberts.

In addition, The Hill Poll found that nine percent believe the term “sequester” actually describes the process by which an elected official is tossed out of office. Voters might not be happy with Washington, but the sequester won’t get rid of them any more quickly than usual.

When it comes to admitting a lack of knowledge, it turns out the gender divide is just as pronounced on fiscal policy as it is on a willingness to seek driving directions. Women were almost twice as likely as men — 32 percent to 18 percent — to admit that they didn’t know what the sequester was.

Regarding party affiliation, voters who identify as Democrats were significantly more likely to nail the sequester question.

Forty-one percent of left-leaning voters knew the right answer, compared to just 28 percent of Republicans. In fact, a plurality of GOP voters, 29 percent, believed the sequester referred to the debt limit.

Voters who did not identify with either party correctly answered the question to the tune of 40 percent.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters by Pulse Opinion Research on Feb. 7 and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

The letter, not public but obtained by The Hill, is written by AT&T Executive Vice President for Federal Relations Tim McKone and Time Warner Senior Vice President of Global Public Policy Steve Vest. They say the merger would allow the combined company to offer cheaper and more robust services to their consumers.

“The merger will allow us to offer customers more attractive bundles of broadband and video services, prodding cable companies and other competitors to respond by improving their own services,” it states. “And the merger will further incentivize AT&T and other wireless carriers to deploy lightning-fast 5G wireless technology faster and deeper in their networks.”

The merger has come under criticism from President Trump and liberal Democratic senators.

AT&T, Time Warner defend deal Top union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race MORE (I-Vt.), in a January letter to AT&T's Randall Stephenson and Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes argued the deal should be subject to a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) review that would require the FCC to determine whether the deal would serve the public interest.

In their letter replying to those concerns, the company executives defended the current process in which the Department of Justice is solely responsible for assessing the deal.

“The Department of Justice will thoroughly scrutinize this transaction after receiving input from a vast range of market participants, government agencies, and public interest groups,” they wrote.

“Congress entrusted the Department with broad merger-review authority to protect the public's interest in competitive markets.”

Franken responded to the letter in a Facebook post Friday afternoon, saying that it did not reassure him.

"While I'm glad they responded to me, their letter does little to address my concerns and essentially asks American consumers to trust that the combined company won’t engage in anticompetitive behavior, raise prices, violate the principles of net neutrality, or decrease access to diverse voices," Franken wrote

"But we’ve seen some of these behaviors before—both as a result of past mega-mergers and straight from AT&T itself. So if I’m being honest, nothing in their letter eases my very serious concerns that this deal will lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for you," he added.

Franken and other Democrats had voiced skepticism at a December hearing that the merger would actually benefit the public.

Trump has also publicly spoken out against the deal.

On the campaign trail, he blasted it as too much power in the hands of too few.

But in a January interview with Axios, he softened his stance slightly, saying that he hasn’t “seen any of the facts” of the merger, while also noting that he had “been on the record in the past of saying it's too big and we have to keep competition.”

Industry experts expect the vertical merger to be approved, but have noted that there is still uncertainty because of Trump's expressed positions.

Updated: 5:20 p.m.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) on Friday picked up the backing of the head of the nation’s largest teachers union in his bid to lead the Democratic National Committee.

In a statement announcing her personal endorsement, National Education Association president Lily Eskelsen García said she knows Ellison will be a unifying force for Democrats.

“Keith’s emphasis and well-documented commitment to party building and grassroots organizing in every community is exactly what we need as the nation finds itself at a crossroad under the divisive Trump administration,” she said.

Eskelsen García’s endorsement comes just hours after the Service Employees International Union called on its members who can vote for DNC chair to cast their votes for Ellison.

ADVERTISEMENT Ellison has been jockeying for the support of leading labor organizations in the race against his chief rival for the post, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez. So far his supporters include the AFL-CIO, Teamsters, United Steelworkers, American Federation of Government Employees, Communications Workers of America, UNITE HERE and National Nurses United.

But at least five AFL-CIO affiliated groups have broken with the labor giant to back Perez over Ellison, including the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers.

In a statement, Ellison said he is honored to receive Eskelsen García’s support and reiterated his plan to return Democrats to elected offices across the country at all levels of government.

“As Chair of the Democratic Party, I will make sure every Democrat and every educator has the tools and resources they need to fight attacks on public education, and to ensure every student has the opportunity to a quality education, regardless of their ZIP code,” he said.

“That means the DNC must institute more than a 50 state strategy. It needs a 3,143 county strategy, like the NEA.”Less than a month into his presidency, President Trump has moved quickly to fulfill his major campaign pledges on trade and immigration but has yet to announce an infrastructure program.

The details of an infrastructure proposal are murky, particularly given Republican opposition to any move that could heavily increase spending.

But such a bill could find Trump common ground with Democrats, who have so far opposed his government at every turn, many of whom could benefit from an influx of infrastructure spending but have thus far felt alienated by Trump's immigration actions.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 27.3 percent of all construction workers in 2015 were Hispanic. Comparatively, Hispanics make up about 17 percent of the total population of the United States.

“People are talking about infrastructure in different ways, some are talking about development projects, others about repairing the infrastructure that we have, and others are talking about digital infrastructure,” said Eric Rodriguez, vice president of the National Council of La Raza.

“We look at all those things in terms of whether they’re going to benefit the economy directly,” he added.

While Latinos and other low-income communities could benefit from a spending uptick, that would only happen if development projects happened in their communities and hired workers within those communities.

Rodriguez cited former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE's stimulus package after the 2008 financial crisis as an example of spending on projects not benefitting those most in need.

“In the case of the stimulus package, the Latino community and African-American community were the least to benefit from the stimulus in projects,” he said.

Those groups instead benefitted from the tax credits offered by the package, which allowed them to have more liquidity and spend money in their communities.

“It’s smart to make institutional and federal investments if in fact they’re investments that generate economic activity,” said Rodriguez.

Even if Trump successfully picks investments that generate growth, he'll have to pair his proposal with deep spending cuts to keep Republicans on board.

“I am typically resistant to doing something without any benefit, so I would have to see what the proposal is, and I'm hoping this administration would have some proposals the includes how to reduce spending,” said Sen. Tim Scott Tim ScottOvernight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Puzder withdraws nomination for Labor secretary Ryan tries to save tax plan MORE (R-S.C.).

And any spending project is likely to meet even tougher resistance from the GOP's conservative Freedom Caucus in the House.

Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho), one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, said “everything has to be paid for.”

House Democrats, meanwhile, are quickly losing faith in the president to make good on those campaign promises where Democrats were hoping to lend an assist, and infrastructure is among them.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said this week that Democrats would jump at the chance to move “a real investment in infrastructure,” but she’s not ready to support the public-private approach Trump and the Republicans favor, which she deems “a tax break for his rich friends.”

“So far we haven’t seen anything from the administration that would justify any kind of cooperation,” Pelosi said Wednesday during the Democrats’ annual strategy retreat in Baltimore. “They have put forth nothing.”

Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, piled on, saying the public-private approach would be a deal-breaker.

“That’s not a partnership. That’s a transfer of ownership responsibility and liability,” she said. “If it really does look like that, that’s going to be a problem, and I would guess that that would be a huge problem for the Caucus.”

Rodriguez warned that those kinds of partnerships could even prove counterproductive, because costs passed down to the final user are relatively more expensive for low-income individuals.

“Fees and tolls are regressive,” Rodriguez said.

A failure to move a bill this year would be a lost opportunity, Lujan Grisham added, because the local projects supported by such a bill provide a quicker economic boost than most other federal spending.

In terms of bang for your buck, she said, “infrastructure’s the fastest.”

“It typically has bipartisan support; it gets to our priorities immediately; it’s easy to recruit workers,” she said.

But Rodriguez said other policy issues could get in the way of recruiting workers.

“We’re in a new environment, which is there’s a good deal of fear and anxiety in communities about raids and deportations," he said. "Nobody knows where that’s really going to go, but that’s bad for business."

And the choice of projects would affect whether they stimulate the economy or simply maintain employment levels.

“You’d look at communities with high unemployment rates and target them and prioritize local hiring, rather than reinvesting in already developed major areas of cities,” he said.

“You’d want to have a job training component to it so you wouldn’t have workers coming from other communities.”

But given the deep chasm between Trump and Democrats on most issues, infrastructure spending is likely to be one of the few areas where they see eye-to-eye.

“I would take any economic investment, but infrastructure really moves the needle quick, and it also then creates local jobs as a result,” said Lujan Grisham. “Retail pops up; other businesses move in. And so it really gives you the biggest bang for your buck I think in the shortest amount of time.”(This story originally appeared in The Hill Extra.)

House Republicans are heading home for a one-week recess with a new outline on their plans for replacing and repealing ObamaCare, but the document leaves many key questions unanswered.

GOP leadership issued the 17-page memo on Thursday, with a mix of traditional healthcare talking points and elements from previous Republican health plans.

The memo was shared with lawmakers after a closed-door briefing, and is aimed at helping members who have faced some tough questions about their ObamaCare plans in recent weeks.

For now, it appears Republican lawmakers are still in the education phase.

"There was no attempt to come to a consensus today; today was more informational," Rep. Morgan Griffith Morgan GriffithGOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered Use Holman Rule on federal employees that work full-time for union Adopting old-school rule would show House is serious about reform MORE (R-Va.), who sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said.

ADVERTISEMENT

House Energy and Commerce Chairman(R-Ore.) and Ways and Means Chairman(R-Texas) outlined ObamaCare replacement items leadership wants to include in its bill gutting major provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

These include how to reform Medicaid and deal with the states that chose to expand the program; tax credits to help Americans pay for insurance; high-risk pools; and health-savings accounts.

“I think the membership is going to have to have time to digest a lot of this,” Griffith said.

To be clear, legislative text hasn’t yet been released, so the details are limited. Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) said he’s waiting on scores from the Congressional Budget Office before unveiling a bill.

Ryan has previously said he plans to repeal and replace parts of ObamaCare by spring.

But several main questions — and potential sticking points — remain.

1. Tax credits vs. deductions.

The new outline calls for an advanceable, refundable tax credit for those who don’t have insurance through an employer or other government program.

Brady told reporters that tax credits cover “more people because it applies to those who don't have a tax liability. And it’s advanceable, so it's available today. A deduction is available a year or 16 months later whenever you do your taxes. So the thinking is to have that help immediately to allow an individual to have it sent to that insurance company.”

But other lawmakers, such as Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), say they prefer a deduction.

“I like the deduction because I think it encourages you to look for the cheapest plan,” Roe, co-chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus, said. He added he understands the disadvantage of the deduction is Americans would have to finance their plan for a year or more.

Policy analysts see a big difference between the two. That’s because the deduction doesn’t necessarily help those in the lower tax brackets who don’t pay federal income taxes, and the new outline echoes that sentiment.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he prefers deductions, but he doesn't draw a hard line between the two — unless it’s advanceable and refundable tax credits. He argued the latter is prone to fraud.

2. Helping governors who did — and didn’t — expand Medicaid.

Determining how to tackle Medicaid is one of the prickliest debates the GOP will likely encounter. GOP governors who originally bucked the party line and expanded the program want to ensure their constituents don’t lose coverage. Those who didn’t expand don’t want to get financially dinged for it.

“How we deal with that tricky little thing is going to be hard,” Roe told The Hill Extra. “I’m not saying I‘m pessimistic, I’m just saying it’s going to be hard.”

According to a source in the room, members are aware of the differences between expansion and nonexpansion states, and that conversations on how to address that will continue.

The updated GOP proposal would repeal Medicaid expansion for able-bodied adults, but states would continue to receive the enhanced federal match rate for a limited time. Later, states that choose to keep their expansion programs would be reverted back to their pre-expansion match rates. The proposal says nonexpansion states could receive additional, temporary resources for safety net providers.

The outline also allows states to choose between block grants and per capita caps.

One of the concerns is that the proposal might be getting too expensive, House Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-S.C.) said.

“My concern is with this Medicaid is that it gets off the chain,” he said. “We’re waiting for the CBO numbers, that’s one of the two major sticking points as far as everybody signing off on this particular plan.”

3. Capping the employer tax exclusion.

One thing the outline was noticeably missing: money.

“That’s going to be the $94 question, whether it’s on tax reform or whether it’s on healthcare reform,” said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who is working on a companion bill to Sen. Rand Paul Rand PaulCruz backs former UN Ambassador John Bolton to replace Flynn GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered Overnight Healthcare: House GOP floats option on Medicaid expansion | Conservatives back ObamaCare plan | CMS offers rule to 'stabilize' markets MORE's (R-Ky.) ObamaCare replacement legislation.

The Better Way proposal included capping the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health coverage, and GOP lawmakers discussed the concept during their closed-door meeting Thursday.

“It is a tough approach,” Rep. Bill Flores Bill FloresGOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered Republicans impatient with anti-Trump civil servants Republicans who oppose, support Trump refugee order MORE (R-Texas) said, “but if you really want to fix healthcare and make healthcare available for all, then you've got to look at the imbalance between the way employers can buy healthcare coverage and the way families buy healthcare coverage. Somewhere those disparate treatments need to be broken down and equalized.”

But Republicans aren’t 100 percent sure they’re going to go down that path, Brady said. Either way, they’ll have to find a way to pay for their proposals.

“President Trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to NATO,” Mattis said during his opening remarks at the Munich Security Conference before hundreds of security experts and policymakers from around the world. “He too espouses NATO’s need to adapt to today’s strategic situation for it to remain credible, capable and relevant.”

But Mattis also stressed to allies that the new administration expects them to boost defense spending and share more of the burden.

“It is a fair demand that all who benefit from the best alliance in the world carry their proportionate share of the necessary costs to defend our freedoms,” he said.

Mattis is on his first trip to Europe as Pentagon chief, a visit that's seen him work to mend relations with allies worried about Trump's stance on NATO.

During the campaign, in a July interview with The New York Times, Trump suggested that the U.S might not come to the aid of some NATO allies if they were attacked if he believed they had not been contributing their fair share.

And in a January interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper, Trump called NATO “obsolete” and criticized its counter-terrorism efforts.

The Pentagon chief, though, dropped any suggestion that the U.S. might not back its allies.

On Friday, he insisted the U.S. was committed to Europe's security.

“American security is permanently tied to the security of Europe,” he said before hundreds of security experts and policymakers from around the world.

Last week, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen called requests for increased funding “a fair demand” following her first meeting with Mattis.

In his remarks, Mattis also highlighted Europe's Baltic nations, who are increasingly fearful of Russia.

“Unified by these growing threats to our democracies, we possess strong resolve. We are going to adapt the alliance,” Mattis said.

Mattis has taken a tougher tone toward Russia than Trump, who has downplayed Russian hacking in the 2016 election and vowed to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

On Thursday, Mattis said there was "little doubt" Russia had tried to meddle in U.S. politics.

Recent reports indicate National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have broken the law by privately discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador in the month before Trump took office — perhaps signaling that the incoming Trump administration would roll back those new sanctions.

This is objectionable unto itself, but in context, it’s absolutely intolerable.

The sanctions Flynn apparently discussed with the Russian ambassador were imposed by President Obama after our nation’s 17 intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered with our election in order to benefit the Trump campaign.

The potential quid pro quo is as clear as day. It looks as if Flynn without legal authority conspired with a regime that had just attacked our democracy’s foundation to benefit Flynn’s boss, and did so to help that regime deal with the punishment for that attack. Flynn’s efforts to walk back what previously had been blanket denials of such contacts merely deepen suspicion about his actions and motives.

Such a scenario would make it far less surprising that Russian President Vladimir Putin chose not to retaliate in late December after the Obama administration expelled suspected Russian spies and shut down Russian-owned compounds in New York and Maryland. Perhaps Putin already had been promised that penalties would be short-lived and that help would be on the way come Jan. 20.

It’s stunning that President Trump has not yet suspended Flynn and halted his access to classified information until a full investigation can be mounted. Yet all we hear from the White House are the lilting strains of “Stand By Your Man” as the fox continues to guard the henhouse.

Sadly, this is only the latest instance in which President Trump and most of his team seem pathologically unable or diabolically unwilling to utter a cross word about Putin’s Russia.

It surely sounded pleasing when Nikki Haley, Trump’s U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, recently condemned Russian aggression in Ukraine. But the administration’s actions belie her tough talk — all we’ve seen so far is disdain for NATO; pooh-poohing of the fact that Putin hacked our election to help Trump; denials or soft-pedalling of Flynn’s and other Trump aides’ contacts with Russia during and after the campaign; the President himself likening our own nation’s moral bottom line to that of a murderous Russian dictator; and a “technical fix” that was promptly praised in Moscow as an easing of sanctions.

To protect the future of this great democracy, we must dig down to the root of this discomfiting Trump-Russia connection. We must create an independent, bipartisan commission to fully investigate and make public Russia’s interference in our election through its illegal theft and selective release of private emails, its dissemination of fake news, or by other means.

Only an independent, bipartisan commission can dedicate itself and its staff to this crucial investigation full-time, without distraction. And only an independent, bipartisan commission can rise above the jurisdictional squabbles and perceptions of partisan bias that inevitably attach to congressional committees’ probes.

The bill I introduced with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) to accomplish this — H.R. 356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act — is co-sponsored by every member of the House Democratic Caucus. It’s our fervent hope that ever-mounting evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Russia will convince Republican members to sign on as well.

Don’t be fooled: Russia’s geopolitical aims are at odds with our own. It’s lovely to imagine a close alliance in which our nations could collaborate on defeating ISIS, but Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, its saber-rattling in the Baltics and its coddling of Syria’s brutal Assad regime amount to a massive destabilization of the world. And Putin’s ruthless record of imprisoning or even dispatching his rivals and critics are anathema to our most basic values.

It looks as if Michael Flynn might have lain down with dogs and got up with fleas; we must not let him and his boss drag our nation into doing likewise. Any violation of law in Flynn’s secret chats with Russia’s emissary must be pursued and punished to the fullest, lest we allow the impression that American foreign policy can be easily manipulated to other nations’ ends.

Riding the wave: Bucking the tradition of past presidents, Trump has shown no reticence for taking credit for the stock market surge since Election Day. He tweeted about it Thursday morning, and noted it as a credit for his policy plan at the press conference later in the day. It's clear that markets have spiked to record highs since Trump's surprising win, as investors gear up for tax and regulatory cuts. But in the past, administrations have been reluctant to take a victory lap on stock market gains, out of concern that they could be held to account if the market collapses. http://bit.ly/2lcxZW1

Ryan relied on two reporters' recorders during a press conference to highlight exactly how the House plan would tax imports while exempting exports.

The latest strategy? Become the Tea Party of the left in order to regain power.

ADVERTISEMENT

“A grassroots insurrection successfully transformed the Republican Party. Progressives need to emulate it,” Eric Sasson wrote in the New Republic after Trump’s election. “The left must now find inspiration from the right by starting their own Tea Party revolution.”

The irony of this suggestion is quite rich considering the slander repeatedly leveled against everyday American men and women who dared to participate in the original Tea Party movement. Who could forget Obama administration official Steve Rattner equating Tea Party members with suicide bombers in 2011?

“These Tea Party guys are, like, strapped with dynamite, standing in the middle of Times Square at rush hour and saying, ‘Either you do it my way, or we’re going to blow you up, ourselves up, and the whole country up with us,’ ” Ratner said during an interview with MSNBC.

Or how about when New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman called the movement a “Hezbollah faction” of the Republican Party that must be snuffed out?

The Tea Party was regularly smeared in media as a violent, bigoted, “astroturf” movement hellbent on opposing the first black president because of his skin color rather than his big-government policies. These classifications were made without evidence, and there were many more.

Obama’s government took things a step further when the IRS unfairly and illegally targeted Tea Party groups and their members.

The Tea Party movement started in late 2008 as a rejection of President George W. Bush’s bailout of the auto industry and Obama’s excessive stimulus spending. It evolved into a movement opposed to ObamaCare, and grassroots efforts were employed to find qualified political candidates who could beat incumbents.

This strategy and work paid off when Republicans won a historic landslide election in 2010, taking back the House of Representatives. The momentum continued, and in 2014 Democrats lost control of the Senate.

Results were driven from political action on the ground, not by smashing windows or burning down buildings. Tea Party participants got together in local homes to tailor their strategy and to find the best candidates for office. The movement centered on opposing specific policy proposals and government overreach. It wasn’t about obstructing progress for the sake of obstruction as we’ve seen on the left since Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE won the White House in November. In the months since, we’ve seen rioting in city streets and college campuses.

On Inauguration Day, dozens of anti-Trump protestors were arrested for destroying property and blocking inauguration attendees from getting through security checkpoints. A number of “comrades” from the Disruptj20 group were charged with felony rioting .

The day after, Madonna took the stage in Washington to declare she’s “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” Across the country a Black Lives Matter protester at an anti-Trump event in Seattle raged about why it’s time to “start killing people” and how “The White House must die.”

On college campuses from coast to coast, pro-Trump speakers are being shouted down, physically attacked and threatened with death. The “resist” movement has taken hold as a way to oppose the new administration and its supporters at every turn, no matter what the cost or the tactic.

As we watch this potential strategy of a progressive Tea Party movement play out in public debate, many have equated the two movements as somehow being the same.

The Tea Party was far better behaved than the leftist mobs we’re seeing now. Equating the two only further smears the movement as something it never was: violent and unhinged.

Pavlich is editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.President Trump’s regulatory freeze is in full effect.

Federal agencies are following orders to delay the rules that Obama administration officials finalized before leaving office but that have not yet taken effect.

This week alone, the Department of Health and Human Services delayed two rules: one to protect the privacy of alcohol and drug abusers who seek treatment, and a second to help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protect against the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission delayed a rule it finalized two days before the inauguration requiring federal agencies to enact hiring policies that favor individuals with disabilities.

Last week, the Federal Railroad Administration delayed new safety rules for commuter trains, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture delayed news standards for how animals should be treated if the farmer wishes to sell the meat as certified organic.

Trump’s regulatory freeze began with a government-wide memo that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sent on Jan. 20. The memo advised agency heads to delay rules that had already been published for at least 60 days, pushing most rules back until March 21.

The effect of Trump’s orders has been noticeable in the Federal Register, the daily docket where new and proposed regulations from government agencies are published.

Before Trump took office, the register would often include dozens of regulations at various stages of completion.

Now the docket is short and mostly includes notices about public meetings.

Though Priebus’s memo told agencies not to issue any new rules, the order did not apply to every agency.

Sophie Miller, a senior policy analyst at George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center, noted that agencies independent of the White House — like the Federal Communications Commission — are still churning out rules.

“Executive orders are not thought to apply to independent agencies,” she said.

Final rules from agencies under Trump’s purview, however, still face the threat of being overturned under the Congressional Review Act, which gives lawmakers 60 legislative days to repeal a regulation after it’s finalized.

The House has already passed over a dozen resolutions to repeal rules; three have made it through the Senate and two have been signed by the president.

Going forward, the Trump administration could ultimately decide to make changes to the rules that have been delayed, but to do so, the agency would have to go through the rulemaking process all over again, Miller said.

While a regulatory freeze is common for new administrations, public health and safety advocates fear the Trump administration is gearing up for a broader attack on the rulemaking process.

“It’s part of a pattern of taking on the rulemaking process in any way they can,” said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch Division.

Public Citizen is one of three groups suing to block Trump’s so-called one-in-two-out rule. That executive order, signed Jan. 30, requires agencies to revoke two regulations for every new rule they want to issue.

Gilbert pointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision earlier this month to take a fresh look at its CEO pay ratio disclosure rule as proof the administration is using every avenue to walk back regulations.

The controversial mandate, finalized in August of 2015 but starting this year, requires companies to publicly disclose how much more money CEOs make than their employees. Democrats required that rule in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in an attempt to shed light on income inequality.

In a statement, SEC acting Chairman Michael Piwowar said some companies “have begun to encounter unanticipated compliance difficulties that may hinder them in meeting the reporting deadline.”

Republicans and businesses hotly contested the rule, arguing that it was too costly and forced companies to disclose information that’s useless to investors.

Piwowar is now giving the public 45 days to submit comments on the rule to better understand the difficulties companies are having.

“To see it reopened yet again for no reason is very troubling,” Gilbert said.The Senate is moving forward with Wilbur Ross's nomination to lead the Commerce Department.

The chamber on Friday voted 66-31 in favor of cloture on Ross, setting up a confirmation vote later this month. Sixteen Democrats joined with all Republicans present in backing Ross, who needed a simple 51-vote majority to overcome Friday's procedural hurdle.

Senators aren't expected to be able to finish his nomination before leaving town for the week-long President's Day recess.

With Democrats able to drag out an extra 30 hours of debate, a final vote is expected as early as the evening Feb. 27.

Democrats raised fresh concerns about Ross’s nomination this week, questioning whether he has ties to Russia.

In a letter obtained by McClatchy , Dems questioned Ross's relationship with Viktor Vekselberg, a shareholder at a bank where Ross still sits on the board.

Vekselberg is friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and was formally one of the directors of the Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft.A man detained by immigration authorities in Seattle despite his protected status under an Obama administration program sued the government Wednesday for violation of his constitutional rights.

Daniel Ramirez Medina, a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, was detained Tuesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials when they showed up at his house to arrest Ramirez's father.

The complaint alleges that agents violated Ramirez's Fifth Amendment due process rights by failing to adhere to the terms of DACA.

ICE agents were allowed into the home by Ramirez's father to notify Ramirez and his brother of the arrest, according to a complaint filed by lawyers.

ICE agents then asked whether Ramirez was legally in the country, to which he replied, “Yes, I have a work permit,” before declining to answer any further questions.

Ramirez has protected status under DACA, which he initially received in 2014 and renewed in 2016, reported NPR.

Democrats say Medina’s detention raises questions about whether ICE’s deportation efforts are legal.

“Medina was arrested even after identifying himself as a legal U.S. resident, and was reportedly pressured to confess to unfounded accusations by ICE agents. If President Trump truly believes in the rule of law, upholding our country’s 4th Amendment rights would be a good place to start,” Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a statement.

President Trump has not overturned the executive order signed by former President Obama that created DACA, essentially leaving the program in the books.

ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson defended Ramirez's detention, telling NPR he is a “self-admitted gang member.”

But Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), in a statement Wednesday, said that false accusations of gang membership are “a reality for many Latino men.”

“Right after I graduated college something happened to me that has happened to many other Latino men but few other Members of Congress,” he said.

“My brother and I were pulled over by the police in broad daylight. Suddenly there were five police cars surrounding us. My car was turned inside out without reason. I was questioned belligerently by the police. And we were asked, ‘what gang are you a member of?’ I remember it like it was yesterday,” he said.

Ramirez passed background checks when he initially applied for DACA in 2014 and when he renewed his permit in 2016.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who represents parts of Seattle, said she's spent much of the last 24 hours on the phone with Ramirez's lawyers, who are confused about the charges.

“This was somebody who had DACA status, legal status, and presented those papers, and now is being accused of being a criminal … a self-admitted gang member. We don't know what that means, but his attorneys say he has never admitted to any such thing. And we've actually seen this in other ICE cases around the country,” Jayapal told reporters Wednesday in the Capitol.

Trump vowed to prioritize the deportation of foreigners with criminal records, and his executive actions on immigration greatly expanded the definition of criminality, broadening the number of people who can be targeted as deportation priorities.

To qualify for DACA, recipients provided the federal government with extensive personal information, as well as an admission of having entered the country illegally, albeit not of their own volition.

Immigration activists have consistently expressed concern that this database could be used as a target list by the Trump administration.

“Dreamers like Daniel are young people who grew up in this country and represent the striving and ambition at the heart of the American dream. They came out of the shadows, gave their information to the government, and went through background checks, all believing that they would be protected from deportation. Targeting Dreamers is a betrayal of that trust and it is a betrayal of who we are as a country,” said Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.).

Ramirez's detention received strong reactions from immigration advocates, especially in the wake of increased immigration raids over the past week and the deportation of Arizona resident Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, who was apprehended as she voluntarily complied with a yearly inspection at her local ICE headquarters.

“If not quickly reversed, ICE’s arrest of a young immigrant who was granted deferred action could make a travesty of the federal government’s promises to DACA grantees across the country, who came to the U.S. as children and are an integral part of our communities,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

Under DACA, foreign citizens brought to the country illegally as minors were protected from deportation and given a work permit, valid for two years after each renewal.

The nearly 750,000 recipients of the program, known as Dreamers after the failed Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, have been at the center of the immigration debate.

A bipartisan group of legislators reintroduced in January the Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy (BRIDGE) Act, designed to put DACA formally into law. Under BRIDGE, the temporary relief afforded to dreamers by DACA would be formally protected by law.House Democrats on the Financial Services Committee are pushing for congressional hearings on tackling poverty and income inequality.

In a letter sent to Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) on Monday, all 27 Democrats on the finance panel pushed for committee hearings on how Congress can “improve wages, housing adequacy and affordability and increased access to the financial mainstream.”

ADVERTISEMENT

That push comes as part of a broader Democratic effort to shine a brighter light on poverty issues and growing economic inequality in the United States. Democrats throughout Congress have vowed to make the issue a priority in 2014, ahead of the midterm elections and coinciding with the 50anniversary of the war on poverty.

The call for hearings also comes as lawmakers continue to search for a compromise to extend emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. That program, in place since 2008, expired at the end of last year.

At Financial Services, Democrats led by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) argued their panel is well-positioned to tackle the issue with a series of hearings, having jurisdiction over housing, banking and insurance matters.

“Hearings could examine strategies that improve accountability in the financial system, expand access to financial services in urban, rural, tribal and suburban communities, invest in locally-based community development activities, community development corporations, community development financial institutions, and enable remittances,” they wrote.House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason ChaffetzGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps The latest scheme in the left’s war on Trump House Dems ask Oversight to investigate Trump security practices MORE (R-Utah) is working on legislation to require future presidential candidates to release the results of an independent physical exam.

The measure, which isn’t finalized, would mandate the major-party presidential candidates to undergo a physical exam by a Navy doctor and release the results to the public.

Recent remarks from Chaffetz before The Washington Post editorial board left fellow lawmakers with the impression that the legislation would specifically include a requirement that presidential candidates undergo a mental health exam.

“If you’re going to have your hands on the nuclear codes, you should probably know what kind of mental state you’re in,” Chaffetz said.

That led House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce, unprompted, at a Capitol news conference that she’d eagerly sign onto Chaffetz’s bill once it’s introduced.

“I can’t wait until he introduces that legislation, to be able to join him as co-sponsor of that,” Pelosi said this month. “I think it’s a very good idea.”

Democrats more recently have taken to raising questions about Trump's mental health.

Chaffetz’s office clarified this week that any insight into the candidates’ mental health would only come from the general physical examination. The results could reveal a physical condition that might affect the candidate’s mood at times, for example.

Presidential candidates are not legally required to release their medical results to the public. Candidates have released the results out of tradition and to assure voters of their good health.

President Trump, 70, released a letter from his personal doctor, a gastroenterologist, that said he “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” and offered other superlative descriptions about his health.

Trump also appeared on the “Dr. Oz Show” to offer results from a physical examination, which revealed he is overweight.

Clinton, 69, faced a media firestorm after video showed her stumbling while leaving a Sept. 11 remembrance event, causing her campaign to disclose that she had pneumonia.

Recent presidents have also released regular updates about their health, even though there isn't a law specifically requiring it.

But a number of presidents in American history have tried to hide their health problems from the public.

President Franklin Roosevelt hid his polio condition from the public.

Grover Cleveland underwent secret surgery for oral cancer during his second term, which wasn't known publicly until nearly a quarter-century later. And Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke in 1919 that resulted in first lady Edith Wilson assuming many presidential functions in his place.

Dianne Feinstein Dianne FeinsteinDem: Trump's China trademark looks like a quid pro quo Senate advances Trump's Commerce pick Flynn told FBI he didn't talk sanctions with Russian envoy: report MORE (D-Calif.) on Friday expressed concern about China's decision to give President Trump a new business trademark after Trump announced his support for a pro-China policy.

“China’s decision to award President Trump with a new trademark allowing him to profit from the use of his name is a clear conflict of interest and deeply troubling,” Feinstein said in a statement.

“If this isn’t a violation of the Emoluments Clause, I don’t know what is.”

“And this is just the start. Media reports state that the president has dozens of additional trademark applications pending just in China. These types of conflicts are exactly what we feared would happen: the president profiting off of his public service," she added. Feinstein noted that China's move came days after Trump voiced support for the "One China" policy, which the U.S. has adhered to for decades but Trump questioned late last year.“The fact that this decision comes just days after a conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping where President Trump reaffirmed the U.S. policy of ‘One China’ is even more disturbing as it gives the obvious impression of a quid pro quo," Feinstein said.“And this is just the start. Media reports state that the president has dozens of additional trademark applications pending just in China. These types of conflicts are exactly what we feared would happen: the president profiting off of his public service," she added.

The “One China” policy dictates that Washington recognizes Beijing as the only official government of China and will not establish formal relations with its rival, Taiwan. Trump angered the Chinese government by accepting a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen after his election, breaking with long-standing protocol. An American president or president-elect had not spoken with Taiwan’s leader since 1979. Just more than a month before he took office, Trump suggested he might use the policy as a bargaining chip to pressure China to change its behavior. "I don't know why we have to be bound by a ‘One China' policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade," Trump said in a December interview with “Fox News Sunday.” Abandoning the policy would have been seen as a major affront to Beijing, which sees the policy as the cornerstone of its relationship with the U.S.

on Wednesday reported that Trump currently has 49 trademark applications that are pending and 77 that are already registered in his name. According to the AP, most of the registered trademarks will need to be renewed during his term.



“I am deeply concerned that China and other countries will make certain decisions that will benefit the president with the hope of influencing his foreign policy decisions," Feinstein said. The Associated Press on Wednesday reported that Trump currently has 49 trademark applications that are pending and 77 that are already registered in his name. According to the AP, most of the registered trademarks will need to be renewed during his term.“I am deeply concerned that China and other countries will make certain decisions that will benefit the president with the hope of influencing his foreign policy decisions," Feinstein said.

"This is yet another reason that President Trump should fully divest his interests. There’s no other way to ensure full transparency and avoid conflicts of interest,” she added.More voters trust the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on budgetary issues, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill — even though a strong majority actually prefer Republican fiscal policies.

The discrepancy would appear to be rooted in the GOP’s image problem, as the party attempts to recover from a bruising general election and recalibrate for a new generation of voters.

Respondents in The Hill Poll were asked to choose which of two approaches they would prefer on the budget, but the question’s phrasing included no cues as to which party advocated for which option.

Presented in that way, 55 percent of likely voters opted for a plan that would slash $5 trillion in government spending, provide for no additional tax revenue and balance the budget within 10 years — in essence, the path recommended by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) last week.

This was almost twice as many voters as opted for a proposal that would include $1 trillion in added tax revenue as well as $100 billion in infrastructure spending, and which would reduce the deficit without eradicating it.

Only 28 percent of voters preferred this option, which reflects the proposal put forth by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray Patty MurraySenate Dems move to nix Trump's deportation order Oprah's network provides Senate with tape of abuse allegations by Puzder's ex-wife: report How many GOP senators will stand up to megadonor DeVos? Just 2. MORE (D-Wash.) last week.

An even stronger majority of respondents, 65 percent, said U.S. budget deficits should be reduced mostly by cutting spending rather than by raising taxes. Just 24 percent said the budget should be balanced mostly by increasing revenue.

In general, Democrats favor a much greater emphasis on tax revenue than do Republicans, most of whom are adamantly opposed to any increased taxes at all.

Notably, many respondents who identified themselves as Democrats actually supported key Republican proposals, according to The Hill poll. Just 44 percent of Democrats said budget deficits should be reduced mostly by raising taxes, while slightly fewer, 40 percent, said balance should be achieved mostly by reining in spending.

By contrast, a strong majority of Republicans toed the party line. Eighty-eight percent, said deficits should be reduced by cutting spending, while just 7 percent said the budget should be balanced by increasing revenue.

However, as soon as respondents heard the words “Republican” and “Democrat,” the picture changed drastically. A plurality of voters, 35 percent, said they trust the Democrats more on budgetary issues, while 30 percent said they trust the Republicans more. A full 34 percent said they trust neither party.

These findings buttress the impression that the Republican label itself incites mistrust among many voters.

Since the 2012 election, which saw GOP losses in Congress as well as President Obama’s reelection, the party has become increasingly divided over how to restore its tarnished reputation.

Speeches by two rising stars to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week reflected the party’s identity crisis. Florida Sen.

One issue around which most of the party’s constituency can coalesce is the objection to President Obama’s healthcare overhaul. The GOP budget put forth by Ryan assumes that most of the healthcare reform law should be repealed.

Notably, a plurality of respondents in The Hill poll agreed with Ryan’s assumption: Forty-five percent of voters said ObamaCare should be fully repealed, while just 37 percent said the law should be fully implemented.

The findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 14 by Pulse Opinion Research.

For the first time in history, Puerto Rico has been handed a blueprint by the U.S. Congress that enables the territory to push an aggressive federal agenda to address its long-term economic burdens. The Congressional Task Force Report on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico includes the name of the program, agency, congressional committee and description of the differential treatment in Puerto Rico. Until now, the way that the federal strategy usually worked was by untangling programs designed to help the economic and social well-being of the over 3.4 million American citizens living in the island. This time a congressional report provides a clear path from pages 95 to 125. The report was published on Dec. 20, 2016.

Only three bills that have been formally introduced in the House of Representatives: the “Puerto Rico Admission Act” (H.R. 260), the “Puerto Rico Medicare Part B Equality Act” (H.R. 261) and a bill “[t]o prevent the territories of the United States from losing current Medicaid funding” (H.R. 259). This doesn’t even come to near half of the alternatives described in the Congressional Task Force Report. Given this outlook and the ongoing economic crisis on the island, it makes one ask: What are we waiting for?

ADVERTISEMENT

During the election cycle, the state chairwoman of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party and newly elected representative from Puerto Rico admitted her influence over the Republican agenda. She sits on three committees: Energy and Commerce, Natural Resources, and Ways and Means. Two of these committees have jurisdiction over one of the hottest issues being addressed in Congress: the future of ObamaCare. Although as resident commissioner she is barred from a floor vote, this is not the same case as a committee vote. In other words: yes, she does have an inherent influence on the Republican agenda over issues that affect ongoing federally funded programs, such as healthcare, which are on the verge of collapse in Puerto Rico. But again, it makes one ask: What is she waiting for?

If the agenda exists, if we already know which door to knock on in Congress, and if Puerto Rico truly has the influence in a Republican-controlled federal government, what are we waiting for? The clock is ticking.

The 9th Circuit's position will stand

From Earl Beal

Media talking heads continue to search for an answer of what will happen to the president’s executive order enjoining immigration authorities to temporarily halt foreign nationals from entering the United States.

The 9th Circuit will uphold the Seattle federal district court judge’s dictum. The government will then appeal to the Supreme Court.

The high court’s current configuration will not change, given these Democrats’ childish tantrums, until at least April. In the meantime, the court’s rendering will be along these current justices’ party and philosophical lines. Such will come down 4-4.

The case will be remanded back to the 9th for further consideration, perhaps with variously nuanced adjustments to the district court judge’s opinion. But in the totality of this circumstance, the circuit court will vacate the original intent of the president’s order.

In theory, such a decision should apply only to those states within the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, yet the way things are so convoluted nowadays in this country, the order to abrogate the president’s executive order will be applied nationwide.

And, sadly, America’s national security will be forced to take a back seat to the incessantly sickening usage and application of this 21st century’s popularized abstraction known as “political correctness.”

Terre Haute, Ind.President Trump tweeted early Friday morning that “the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast,” despite the lack of agreement on Capitol Hill about how to move forward on the healthcare overhaul.

Trump slammed congressional Democrats for their delays in approving his Cabinet, but said with the confirmation of his Health and Human Services secretary, he can begin to move forward with a major campaign promise.

He said he is “anxious” to see what President Trump does about these immigrants, who received protection from deportation in 2012 by an executive order from former President Obama establishing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

"I'm very sympathetic with this situation. These are young people who were brought here at a tender age and who have grown up here or are in the process of growing up here. I'm very sympathetic to that situation and I'm anxious to see what the president decides to do," McConnell told reporters.

Sen.(R-S.C.) and Senate Democratic Whip(Ill.) introduced legislation at the end of last year to protect immigrants who came to the country illegally at a young age but have since stayed out of legal trouble and become productive members of society.

Trump has yet to give a clear indication of what he plans to do about immigrants who fall into this category, who are often referred to as "Dreamers."

The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that an executive order has been drafted to end the DACA program.

By McConnell indicated that such an executive order may not be popular among Republicans on Capitol Hill and there may be support for passing bipartisan legislation to protect them from deportation.

Trump called the status of DACA recipients a "very, very tough subject" during his press conference Thursday.

"We are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them what I'm saying is right," Trump said. "I appreciate your understanding on that, but the DACA situation is a very, very — it's a very difficult thing for me because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids. And grandkids.

“Despite its majestic brevity—or maybe because of it—the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment sometimes proves difficult to apply,” Judge Adalberto Jordan wrote in one of two majority opinions.

“Yet certain First Amendment principles can be applied with reasonable consistency, and one of them is that, subject to limited exceptions, content-based regulations of speech are presumptively invalid.”

Florida officials claimed the Firearms Owners’ Privacy Act was needed to protect Floridians’ Second Amendment right to own firearms.

The court, however, found that the law’s provisions prohibiting doctors from asking patients if they own a gun, from disclosing information about gun ownership in patient medical records and unnecessarily harassing patients about gun ownership violated doctors’ free speech rights.

The court said only the law’s provision prohibiting doctors from discriminating against patients solely for owning a gun was valid.

In an effort to prevent and reduce firearm-related deaths and injuries, particularly to children, the American Medical Association (AMA) “encourages its members to inquire as to the presence of household firearms as a part of childproofing the home and to educate patients to the dangers of firearms to children,” a policy similarly followed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians, according to court documents.

In a statement Friday, AMA President Andrew Gurman called Thursday’s decisions a “clear victory against censorship of private medical discussions between patients and physicians.”A majority of voters believe cutting America’s debt is more important than maintaining domestic and military programs at their current levels, according to a new poll for The Hill.

But the public also feel strongly that the budget should be balanced on the back of reductions to defense spending rather than through cuts to programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

As the clock ticks down on any possibility of averting the sequester’s across-the-board spending cuts, a solid 58 percent of respondents in The Hill Poll prioritized cutting America’s debt over maintaining current spending levels on domestic and military programs. This figure is almost double the share of voters, 28 percent, who believed the opposite.

In order to reduce America’s debts and deficits, more than twice as many voters said they would support defense cuts as said they would support cuts to social programs.

Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would support cutting military spending, while just 23 percent said they would support slashing Social Security and Medicare. An overwhelming majority, 69 percent, said they would oppose cuts to social programs.

The findings are particularly striking as Washington prepares for the looming sequester. Cuts amounting to $85 billion are scheduled to go into effect on March 1 if Congress cannot come to an agreement over deficit reduction.

Both parties agree that sequestration would have a damaging effect on the economy, but so far neither side has shown much willingness to compromise. President Obama has proposed the outline of a deal that would contain equal amounts of new revenues and spending cuts, but Republicans have refused to countenance new taxes and have complained that Obama’s plan is overly vague.

Some voters appeared to cross party lines in their views on how to reduce the debt.

High numbers of both Republicans and Democrats said they would oppose cuts to social programs: 62 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats opposed cutting Medicare and Social Security, while just 29 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of Democrats supported potential cuts in those areas.

Notably, a higher percentage of Republicans opposed cuts to social programs (62 percent) than professed opposition to defense cuts (56 percent).

Further underlining the general preference for reductions in defense spending over cuts to social programs, 37 percent of respondents said America spends too much on the military, while just 18 percent said America spends too little.

Party affiliation is a factor underlying voters’ choice between cutting the debt and maintaining spending levels, the survey found. Sixty-seven percent of Republicans say cutting America’s debt is the more pressing need, in contrast to just 43 percent of Democrats. Conversely, 23 percent of Republicans said maintaining domestic and military programs at their current levels should be the priority. However, just 36 percent of Democrats prioritized maintaining current spending levels.

Notably, respondents who identified themselves with neither party appeared to align themselves with Republicans on the general issue of debt versus spending: 66 percent said cutting America’s debt was more important, while just 22 percent chose maintaining current spending levels.

When asked whether America spends too much, too little or about the right amount on the military, voters also tended to break along party lines. But those respondents who identified as “Other” tended to align themselves with Democrats on that question: 49 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of those who identified as “Other” said America spends too much on the military, while just 13 and 12 percent, respectively, said America spends too little. Similarly, voters who viewed themselves as “centrist” tended to express similar views to those who identified themselves as “liberal.”

Washington gridlock aside, some economists have pointed in recent months to positive economic news, like a recovery in the housing market and the rise of consumer spending. But in the face of the squabbling over the sequester, just 15 percent of likely voters say their personal financial position has improved over the past 12 months, while 37 percent of voters say it has gotten worse and 47 percent say it has stayed about the same. Democrats tended to be more optimistic: 20 percent of Democratic respondents said their situation had improved, while just 7 percent of Republicans agreed. A full 50 percent of Republicans said their situation had gotten worse, while just 24 percent of Democrats took such a negative view.

The findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 21 by Pulse Opinion Research.

Hooper.The big news for the GOP majority on Capitol Hill last week came as a tweet — and it was not from President Trump.

Matt Drudge, the proprietor of The Drudge Report, the conservative website which played a leading role in the rise of the new president, raised eyebrows with this note:

“Republican Party should be sued for fraud. No discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!”

Later he pointed to the inability of the Trump White House to immediately dismantle President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, asking “meanwhile, is Obamacare penalty tax still in place?”

Drudge’s scolding was amplified by another leading voice in the successful Republican takeover of Congress, my Fox News colleague Sean Hannity.

Hannity called the Republicans in Congress “spineless, gutless, timid politicians.” He lambasted them for failing to keep their promise to kill off ObamaCare. During campaign season, Republicans — and their sirens in the media — demonized ObamaCare to win the votes that enabled the GOP to maintain its majorities in the House and Senate. The strategy also helped Trump win control of the White House.

Hannity and Drudge are among the loudest — if not the most powerful — voices speaking to the hard right base. Their unforgiving attacks on Obama, Democrats and the old-school Republican establishment stirred the populist resentments that shaped today’s Congress.

So, the speed with which these conservative media titans have turned on their creations — the politicians they helped put in power at the Capitol and White House — is a sign of the deep divisions already splitting the ruling Republican majority in Washington.

The right-wing media-led assault that won elections with the promise to disrupt Washington politics is now confronting reality. As the governing party, the GOP is now accountable for what comes after the party disrupts and tears down existing programs.

But note that the fire is not evenly distributed.

While Drudge is not happy with what he considers the slow pace of attack coming from the Trump White House, both he and Hannity are aiming their strongest shots at Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Meanwhile, Democrats are smiling as they watch Republican members of Congress come increasingly under siege at town hall meetings. Voters are alarmed at the idea that their ObamaCare benefits might be stripped away by the GOP, and no comparable services offered in their place.

The public anger at the town halls and Trump’s high public disapproval rating — 53 percent of adults give him the thumbs-down, according to the most recent CNN/ORC survey — have led to the rising conservative media discontent.

Less than two months into what Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) called the “dawn of a new, unified Republican government,” the discontent on the right is revealing the shallow limits of negative ads and sloganeering at rowdy rallies.

Ambitious campaign rhetoric about cutting taxes, for example, is now entangled in the reality of negotiations over a “border adjustment tax” and the potential for a trade war, sparked by the tariffs on imports promised by Trump.

As for doing away with ObamaCare, the impassioned GOP promise to repeal now faces the reality that after almost seven years the party has no plan strong enough to attract enough votes to pass both the House and Senate.

Trump admitted last week that repeal of ObamaCare is now an issue to be dealt with down the road: by the end of the year at the earliest and possibly in 2018. All the president could promise is that “it’ll take till sometime into next year but we’re certainly going to be in the process.”

The president also noted that he has discovered the process is “very complicated.”

One source of that complication is division between the Trump White House and veteran Republican leaders, the so-called establishment.

Sen. Lamar Alexander Lamar AlexanderGOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered Overnight Regulation: Trump's new Labor pick | Trump undoes Obama coal mining rule Trump unveils new pick to head Labor Department MORE (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which deals with healthcare, put the populist Republican call for Trump to repeal ObamaCare immediately in perspective this way:

“No one is talking about repealing anything until there is a concrete practical alternative to offer Americans in its place.”

Tax reform and ObamaCare are not the only issues dividing Republicans in power from the media voices that once championed them.

When Trump recently defended Russian President Vladimir Putin against charges that he is a “killer,” by arguing that “there are a lot of killers – you think our country’s so innocent?” – MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, responded angrily.

“President Trump’s claim that America is morally on par with Russia’s corrupt dystopian regime was so historically ignorant that even timid Republicans felt compelled to speak out this week,” Scarborough wrote in The Washington Post. “Perhaps that is because remaining silent in the face of such a morally disorienting claim would make them look like fools.”

Scarborough’s critique reflects the split between the Trump White House and several Republicans in Congress on maintaining sanctions against Russia.

The rally will return Trump to his element: The president loves to appear before large, supportive crowds— it was his favorite thing to do as a presidential candidate.

A crowd of 30,000 is expected to attend the 5 p.m. event in Melbourne, Fla.

“He feeds off the crowd’s energy,” said one Trump associate who is familiar with the president’s thinking.

“For him, it’s a demonstrative visual,” the associate said. “It proves to the country — and the press corps — what people are really thinking and it gets him out of Washington, which is always a good idea.”

It’s typical for a president to hit the road and get some face time with Americans across the country.

The difference with Trump and Saturday’s event, is that he doesn’t appear to have a specific policy issue to push.

Former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE, who like Trump fed off appearing before supportive, arena-sized crowds of adoring fans, aimed to sell his stimulus plan and his healthcare proposal on the road. Obama even set out on a string of bus tours— targeting issues like the congressional deadlock on the debt-ceiling.

After his State of the Union address in 2005, former President George W. Bush hit the road to sell his Social Security plan. He did the same in selling his tax-cut proposal in 2001.

Those familiar with Trump’s plans say the president will speak about immigration and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act in broad brush strokes.

But the lack of detail on policy could be problematic for Trump, who needs to do more than appear before a supportive crowd to push his legislative agenda moving forward in Congress.

Trump supporters say what worked for past presidents doesn’t necessarily work for Trump.

Asked in an interview if Trump should have a specific policy issue, Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord, said, “Ordinarily, I’d say yes.”

“But it’s a little different with him. His supporters are people who are on a mission. It’s a movement. It’s a cause. They want to change Washington, “ Lord said. “People loves these [rallies]. It’s smart for him to do it.”

At the same time, some Republican strategists don’t think that’s the best approach.

“My instinct is that he needs to start behaving in a much more conventional way…until the team is cohesive,” said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. “I’m not sure what it gets him unless he has a focused, salient message.

“I’m not interested in his voters supporting him,” Mackowiak said. “What matters now is, bipartisan accomplishments and can he be disciplined and focused enough to be persuasive? I don’t know that we know that yet.”

Trump associates say they see Saturday as a chance to drive the narrative after weeks of negative headlines, which included a rash of leaks from within the White House, the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and new questions that have arisen about contacts between Trump’s team and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

The rally, coupled with the news conference earlier in the week, will help Trump go on offense.

“He’s very media savvy and I think he did say to himself, ‘I need to get out there and change the narrative,’ Lord said, adding that the combination of press conferences and rallies “are the way he’s going to communicate with the American people over the next four years.”

Lord quipped that Trump has in a way created a new reality show called ‘Beat the Press.”

Trump seemed to employ those tactics when he used his press conference on Thursday at the White House to plug his rally a couple of times during his opening remarks.

“I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard, just heard, that the crowds are massive that want to be there,” he slipped in between comments on the media narrative being driven about his White House.

And before ending his remarks minutes later, before taking questions he reminded his audience of the place and time yet again and then added, “I hope to see you there.”It’s been less than a month since former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE left office, but his legacy is already being remembered fondly, according to C-SPAN’s 2017 presidential historians survey.

Obama ranked 12th on the list of 43 former commanders in chief, placing between Woodrow Wilson (No. 11) and James Monroe (No. 12).

Former President Abraham Lincoln takes the top spot in the survey, which was conducted among 91 historians and other executive branch experts.

Participants were told to give presidents a score of one to 10 on 10 different "qualities of presidential leadership"; these included "economic management," "vision/setting an agenda," "relations with Congress," "crisis leadership" and "public persuasion."

One of the survey’s advisers, Howard University history professor Edna Greene Medford, said she thought Obama could have ranked higher.

"Although 12th is a respectable overall ranking, one would have thought that former President Obama’s favorable rating when he left office would have translated into a higher ranking in this presidential survey,” Greene Medford said in a statement.

“But, of course, historians prefer to view the past from a distance, and only time will reveal his legacy," she added.

At the time he left office in January, Obama’s job approval rating hovered around 57 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.

Lincoln, the country’s 16th president known for abolishing slavery and leading the Union through the Civil War, ranked No. 1 for the third time in a row, according to the survey. Lincoln has taken the top position in every survey since C-SPAN began conducting them in 2000.

Likewise, James Buchanan, the 15th president whose tenure preceded the Civil War, has consistently ranked in the bottom spot since 2000. He’s ranked even lower than William Henry Harrison (No. 38), who fell ill and died a month after taking the oath of office.The big news for the GOP majority on Capitol Hill last week came as a tweet — and it was not from President Trump.

University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which investigates the use of hacking to impact public policy, released their findings over the weekend. Citizen Lab said the attackers tried to install spyware purportedly only sold to governments onto the devices of those who prominently backed the soda tax.

Simón Barquera, a Mexican government health scientist, and Alejandro Calvillo and Luis Encarnación, both of whom direct Mexican health advocacy groups, received an uncommonly aggressive flurry of phishing text messages to try to install spyware known as Pegasus.

Pegasus was developed by the Israeli government contractor, the NGO Group. NGO claims to sell the spyware only to governments. Citizen Lab report notes that the Mexican government signed a $20 million deal with NGO in 2012.

Citizen Lab, which nicknamed the campaign, “Bitter Sweet” believes the Mexican government might have conducted the attack, both due to the restricted access to the malware and because the attacks were conducted so "brazenly" on Mexican soil.Welcome to Overnight Regulation, your daily rundown of news from the federal agencies, Capitol Hill, the courts and beyond. It's Wednesday evening here in Washington where it's been an eventful week. First Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Adviser and now Andy Puzder, Trump's pick for Labor secretary, is out too.

Here's the latest.

THE BIG STORY

Andy Puzder on Wednesday withdrew his nomination to be President Trump's Labor secretary, avoiding what would have been a rocky confirmation battle.

"After careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for secretary of Labor. I am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE to lead the Department of Labor and put America's workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity," he said in a statement.

Puzder thanked his family and backers who voiced support for "the policies and new thinking I would have brought to America as secretary of Labor."

"While I won't be serving in the administration, I fully support the president and his highly qualified team," Puzder said.

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee was scheduled to consider Puzder's nomination Thursday in a hearing that had previously been delayed five times.

Top GOP members reportedly urged the White House to withdraw Puzder's nomination, according to CNN.

Puzder, the CEO of the fast-food conglomerate that owns the burger chains Hardee's and Carl's Jr., has been under attack by Democrats and outside groups for weeks for admitting he hired an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper and past allegations that he abused his ex-wife and treated employees poorly.

Oprah Winfrey's network reportedly provided committee members with a copy of a 1990 episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" in which Puzder's ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, reportedly appeared in disguise to speak out as a domestic violence victim.

She discussed allegations of physical abuse against her former husband in the show. Fierstein has since retracted her allegations, including in a recent letter to the Senate committee, Politico reported.

In a call with reporters Wednesday, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who is now running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, called the news of Puzder's withdrawal just another day of chaos in the Trump administration.

"Through this appointment he's shown he was trying to make it harder for workers to get ahead and stay ahead," he said of President Trump.

"I'm pleased, but not optimistic the next pick will have any more moral authority given that the president has taken so many actions not to drain the swamp, but make sure the swamp full of his Wall Street cronies."

The news of Puzder bowing out comes less than two days after Michael Flynn resigned as Trump's national security adviser amid reports that he misled senior White House officials about his conversations with Russia.

Perez said Puzder, like Flynn, was not only incompetent, but also dangerous.

"If I had half the transgressions of Andy Puzder I never would have gotten through," he said.

Puzder supporters, meanwhile, called his decision "extremely unfortunate."

"Andy Puzder would have made a great Labor Secretary," Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

"We hope that President Trump's next Labor Secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy."

The Chicago Board of Ethics in a 5-0 vote determined that Plouffe broke the rules by not registering as a lobbyist after seeking Emanuel’s support for rules to allow Uber to pick up passengers at Chicago’s airports, reports the Chicago Tribune.

The violation became public after Emanuel released hundreds of emails in December, bowing to pressure from two lawsuits claiming that he had violated Illinois’s open record law.

“Assume both of us thought the airport issue was settled and we would never have to discuss again, but unfortunately two significant new hurdles were introduced,” Plouffe wrote in one email dated Nov. 20, 2015.

“Coming to you because of their severity that would prevent us from operating. We were all set to announce Monday we were beginning pickups.”

“Please speak to Negron and David on my staff. Impossible for me to address from China,” Emanuel replied.

Uber noted their regret in not filing Plouffe's communications with Emanuel and said that they would work with the board moving forward.

"We work hard to ensure our registrations are accurate and up to date," and Uber spokesperson said in a statement. "We regret that in this instance we made a mistake and we will comply with the board's assessment."

Both Plouffe and Emanuel worked for Obama during his first term in the White House. The Chicago mayor was Obama’s chief of staff.

According to the ethics board, Plouffe and Uber did not challenge the allegations but argued that the fine should be reduced to $1,000.

The board pushed back, saying a lower fine wouldn’t prevent others from breaking the rules.

“There would be no deterrent effect as to unregistered lobbying at all,” wrote William F. Conlon, the ethics board's chairman.

People with T-shirts reading “Full Employment Defenders” listen to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress on Tuesday.The head of the House Democratic Caucus said this week there's a simple reason GOP critics of President Trump's tempestuous first month are few and far between: They're terrified of him.

"I think they're tremendously scared of him," Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) said Friday on C-Span's "Newsmakers" program

"I think they feel one tweet away from a primary, one tweet away from being, you know, dismissed — and given a new nickname, I'm sure."

Crowley said Trump's brusque style, indifference toward convention and scandal-tinged first month are all making Republicans uncomfortable. But they can't voice their frustrations publicly, he said, for fear of a backlash from the president — and the loyal conservative base he's built.

"There is angst on their side. They, too, do not know how to deal with this man," Crowley said. "When I look at them, when I talk to them … they shrug their shoulders and turn their head."

Speaking for a growing chorus of Democrats, Crowley said he's particularly frustrated — not to mention bewildered — that Republicans have been so reluctant to investigate Trump's potential financial and political ties to Russia. Although the Intelligence committees in both chambers have launched investigations into Russian hacking of last year's elections — a probe they say could grow to include the administration's ties to the Kremlin — GOP leaders have rejected the Democrats' calls for more public examinations, including the creation of an outside panel akin to the 9/11 Commission.

Trump has insisted he has nothing to hide, and any suggestion otherwise, he says, is "fake news put out by the media."

"I have nothing to do with Russia," he said Thursday during a rowdy press conference at the White House.

But the Democrats are dubious, and Crowley on Friday accused congressional Republicans of blindly defending the president at the expense of "everything they've stood for" in the past.

"They've always been the anti-Russia party," he said. "I think we all can share in that [sentiment] … but they pride themselves on being the patriotic party. And here we have a real incursion by a foreign state — Russia! — into our national elections and: silence."

"That is an issue we'll continue to go after," he warned.

Trump dismissed his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after just 24 days on the job when it was revealed Flynn had misled Pence about conversations he'd had with a Russian diplomat. And Trump's White House raised plenty of eyebrows when it issued a Holocaust remembrance statement that excluded mention of Jews who were, by and large, the victims.

Trump this week dismissed suggestions of chaos, saying his administration is "running like a fine-tuned machine." And he's had plenty of backing from GOP leaders, who have both defended the president's missteps and hailed his moves to eliminate Obama-era regulations and crack down on undocumented immigrants, among other policy changes.

"We're working on the same plan," Ryan told Fox News.

"I'm not a fan of the daily tweets," he told reporters in the Capitol.

"I can't see much difference between what a President Trump is doing and what they might have done," he said.

Democrats have a decidedly different take, warning that Trump's approach to governing — combined with his reported ties to Russia — pose a threat to the very fabric of the country's democratic institutions, particularly if Republicans don't push back.

"It's not just about Trump … it's about our Republican colleagues," Crowley said. "When will they speak up against what he's doing? Because he's usurping their authority."

Crowley hammered Trump for a recent series of federal raids on undocumented immigrants. And he was especially critical of the possibility, reported by the Associated Press Friday morning, that the president would call in the National Guard to help with deportations — a notion the White House adamantly denied.

"It's very reminiscent to what led up to World War II, quite frankly, in Europe. Seeing these kinds of actions potentially taking place, [or] even being talked about," Crowley said.

"Using the National Guard, the Army, to come into our communities, to police our communities, to disrupt and to gather people up for the purposes of deporting them, is a very, very scary thing," he added. "It's not a country that I'm familiar with."

This bill is absurd.

It is foolish to suggest that the experts making a decision to classify or not based on anything other than the data that will allow them to determine if it meets the definition. The definition per the Endangered Species Act is, “any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.” By definition, a species is endangered if those conditions are met, and is threatened if it is likely to meet those criteria within the foreseeable future. If a species meets the criteria as defined, it is endangered; it is endangered regardless of how convenient it is to any of us. Science cannot be dictated by politics or economics.

Revising the Endangered Species Act as proposed is also impractical, and would introduce additional cost to carrying out the process of making a species determination. Currently, only after a species has been listed is a recovery plan created to map out a plan to save the species. To request that this process be undertaken prior to determining if a species even is endangered and thus determining if a plan is even needed at all, is a ludicrous waste of the very dollars the co-sponsors of this bill assuredly wish to save.

The economic cost of not protecting a species is left out of these economic equations, and is often difficult to predict or calculate. With any species proposed for the list, there are these “hidden” economic values to their existence. Every species plays a role in an ecosystem, and other species will be impacted by their loss. Ignoring what we do not know could have unexpected consequences.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is in danger of having its ability to protect wildlife stripped away. Our Congress must not pass H.R. 717 and must continue to stand for the preservation of the resources that we are responsible for stewarding responsibly. Future generations depend on it.

Pelosi's hollow criticism of TrumpThe Department of Homeland Security is funding new research to counter a type of cyberattack that brought down Twitter, PayPal and other websites last year.

The attacks, known as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, work when hackers send a massive amount of web traffic to a site, rendering it unable to function. DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate announced Thursday that its cybersecurity division is funding several research projects to counter these attacks.

In October, hackers blocked users from accessing popular websites including Twitter, PayPal, and Spotify by launching DDoS attacks targeting Dyn, an internet performance management company used by those websites. The attacks affected millions of users.

According to DHS, there has been an “exponential increase” in the intensity and frequency of these attacks over the past six months as a result of hackers using malware to turn computer systems into “bots” and creating “botnet armies” to wage DDoS attacks.

“The goal of the DDoS project is to build effective and easily implemented network defenses and promote adoption of best practices by the private sector to bring about an end to the scourge of DDoS attacks,” said Daniel Massey, who is managing the cybersecurity research project.

“Our performers are developing exciting new defense approaches that will help organizations defend against very large-scale DDoS attacks,” Massey said.

The DHS project aims to slow the growth of attacks and improve defense networks against them. It will also address other denial of service attacks including those aimed at emergency management systems, like 911.A strong plurality of voters believe economic conditions in the United States are getting worse, not better, according to a new poll for The Hill — and believe the $85 billion package of cuts known as the sequester will only make things worse.

In the first survey for The Hill conducted since the sequester kicked in a little more than a week ago, 48 percent of respondents said the country’s economy is getting worse, while just 33 percent said the economy is improving.

ADVERTISEMENT

Although many analysts have warned that the automatic cuts and the consequent furloughing of thousands of workers will harm the fragile recovery, last week saw several indications that job growth is actually picking up.

A report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the economy added 236,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent — its lowest level since President Obama took office. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average reached new, record highs four days in a row last week.

One explanation for respondents’ pessimistic outlook despite the spate of encouraging economic news is the emphasis placed on the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestration by the administration and the news media.

According to The Hill poll, a majority of voters, 56 percent, believe the sequester will hurt the U.S. economy. Perhaps surprisingly, though, a strong plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they were not expecting the sequester cuts to have a negative impact on their personal circumstances.

Party affiliation offers a partial explanation for voters’ views on the country’s economic condition. A full 67 percent of Republicans said the economy is worsening, versus just 26 percent of Democrats. On the flip side, just 15 percent of Republicans said the economy is improving, while 56 percent of Democrats believed this to be the case.

Notably, however, respondents who identified as “Other” tended to agree with Republicans: 22 percent of those independent voters said the economy was getting better, while 55 percent said it was getting worse.

But since sequestration became reality, critics of the administration have claimed that Obama and his team cried wolf on the impact the cuts could have on the economy.

In the weeks before the sequester hit, Obama traversed the country, touting the message that under no circumstances should the cuts be allowed to take effect. But he and his team made several dubious claims. Obama declared that Capitol Hill janitors would receive a pay cut under sequestration, but Capitol superintendent Carlos Elias insists that is incorrect. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Arne Duncan Arne DuncanObama Education secretary condemns protest against DeVos at DC school Dems, GOP battle over pace of Trump confirmations The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE asserted on CBS that many teachers had received “pink slips,” but later walked back the statement.

Obama has since toned down his rhetoric, admitting that the cuts won’t be “an apocalypse.” But voters are not letting the president off easy: The Hill poll shows that a strong plurality of voters, 48 percent, said Obama and his team exaggerated the negative effects of the sequester cuts, while just 31 percent said the White House did not overplay its hand.

A plurality of the American public also believes the political news media are too soft on the administration. According to the Hill Poll, a solid 46 percent of respondents said the news media are excessively sympathetic to the president, while 28 percent said the press deliberately tries to hurt Obama and just 17 percent said they offer unbiased coverage.

Voters were mostly split along party lines on the question, but those who identified themselves as “Other” tended to agree with a strong majority of Republicans who said the news media are overly sympathetic to Obama.

These findings come as a spate of prominent national polls indicate that Obama’s post-election honeymoon may be ending. Recent surveys from Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN show that Obama’s approval rating has dropped off slightly in the wake of the sequester. According to the Gallup poll, the president averaged 49 percent approval for the week ending March 3, down from 51 percent the prior week.

These results were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.

But what is happening? Is there some predictability to this upheaval or is it instead arbitrary, spontaneous and disjointed?

Only a little more than three weeks into the Trump administration, a pattern seems to be developing.

Call it “The Donald Code.”

The list of things that have been jumbled is already fairly long: Mexican relations, Australian relations, oil pipeline plans, immigration policy, a possible new location (Jerusalem rather than Tel Aviv) for the U.S. embassy in Israel. The initiatives explode forth.

But let’s focus on one action as a possible symbol of the larger picture.

This was the order to revamp the National Security Council (NSC).

The NSC has been at the center of most major decisions that have been made by presidents on how to engage with those in the world who threaten us. The body is designed to give the president the information and interpretations necessary to make decisions regarding our nation’s safety and survival.

The president has reordered the NSC in a most interesting manner.

He has directed that the person responsible for coordinating the collection and analyzing of intelligence be included in the meetings of the NSC only when invited, one presumes by the head of the council, retired General Michael Flynn.

He has directed that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the person who is most knowledgeable on military readiness and capacity, also only be included when invited.

The order also permanently includes a top White House political operative on the NSC, a strange juxtaposition.

It is a sweeping directive, not so much for its language or overt proposals, but rather for its subliminal statement of how the president intends to develop and execute operations and policy.

It is a very public demotion of the Director of National Intelligence and the highest ranking uniformed military officer — a one-two punch, of a kind, at those parts of the national security apparatus.

At the same time, it is a dramatic statement of the importance of politics in the evolution of the president’s national security agenda.

Or maybe it is simply a demotion of the whole idea of the NSC as a needed source of counsel.

In outlining these theories, it must be said that it is inherently difficult to anticipate the course to be followed by this administration.

This is because that course does seem to be greatly driven by what the person in the mirror says to the president on any given issue, on any given morning. And no one really seems to know what the person in the mirror is thinking.

But this one action was telling, because it was not unique. It seemed to encompass most of the elements underlying the purposes and processes of this administration.

What does it portend for other areas of action?

Let’s take, for example, dealing with the Congress and especially Republicans in the Congress, as a possible test case for applying The Donald Code. Who gets demoted and what gets bypassed?

The answer is fairly obvious: Everyone.

At some point in the not-too-distant future, the president will decide he neither needs nor wants the counsel of Republicans, especially the leadership, in the Congress. He will act on his own intuition and move forward.

Where does he go? It is doubtful that he knows, yet. The elements of the moment will determine that. It may be that he proceeds on a course that is positive and good for the nation. It is equally possible that, to use the vernacular, he “steps in it.” But it will be largely his course and his alone.

The president’s actions, one suspect, will be pursuant to this Code. They will be his, singularly forthright; unattended by subtlety or complication; and fenced on all sides by his personal experience.

Elected Republicans across the country, not only in Washington, will be uniquely impacted by this Code but they may not understand it.

The president will not really care if they do or do not.

It is, after all, his Code and no one else’s.

What's happening:

Communicable diseases: The HHS is delaying its rule to improve the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s ability to protect against the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus.

The rule, finalized on Jan. 19, sets a 72-hour limit for how long a person can be held without a federal order for isolation or quarantine. It also provides due process protections for people who are subject to public health orders, including a right to counsel for indigent individuals.

CDC under the rule must advise individuals who are subject to medical examinations that the examinations will be conducted by an authorized health worker and with prior informed consent.

The rule set to take effect on Feb. 21 is now delayed until Mach 21. HHS said it’s following the Trump administration’s order to freeze all regulatory actions.

Trump’s chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a memo after the inauguration telling federal agencies to not issue any more regulations.

Agency heads were advised to delay the effective date of rules that had already been published for at least another 60 days.The new director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, is prepared to be the "bad cop" in Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE's administration.



"Part of the job is saying 'no,'" Mulvaney said in an interview with the Post and Courier on Friday. "To a certain extent, I have to be the president's bad cop from time to time."



"I have to look people in the eye and tell them, 'No, we don't have enough money for that.' That is not a very popular thing to do in Washington," he added.

"It is involved with everything. And I thought, 'That's where I want to be,'" Mulvaney told the Post and Courier.

When asked what the term refers to, and presented with a range of options, fully one-quarter of the public admitted that they did not know. Even more (38 percent) chose one of the incorrect explanations. Just over one-in-three voters correctly pegged it as a package of spending cuts that will soon take effect.

Washington has been feeding the public a steady diet of news headlines about the doom and gloom surrounding fiscal issues for some time. As policymakers lurch from one fiscal crisis to another, it perhaps should not be surprising that voters are having a hard time keeping track of it all.

Roughly one-fifth of those polled, 21 percent, had some sense the sequester was a fiscal issue, but got their crises tangled, believing that the term describes the possibility that the United States could soon exceed its debt limit.

Congress put that standoff to bed (for now) in January. Meanwhile, the real sequester is set to begin taking effect March 1.

Another eight percent of voters claimed to know about the sequester, but got their branches of government confused. Those voters believe the term refers to an upcoming ruling by the Supreme Court on the federal budget. Such a case would come as news to Chief Justice John Roberts.

In addition, The Hill Poll found that nine percent believe the term “sequester” actually describes the process by which an elected official is tossed out of office. Voters might not be happy with Washington, but the sequester won’t get rid of them any more quickly than usual.

When it comes to admitting a lack of knowledge, it turns out the gender divide is just as pronounced on fiscal policy as it is on a willingness to seek driving directions. Women were almost twice as likely as men — 32 percent to 18 percent — to admit that they didn’t know what the sequester was.

Regarding party affiliation, voters who identify as Democrats were significantly more likely to nail the sequester question.

Forty-one percent of left-leaning voters knew the right answer, compared to just 28 percent of Republicans. In fact, a plurality of GOP voters, 29 percent, believed the sequester referred to the debt limit.

Voters who did not identify with either party correctly answered the question to the tune of 40 percent.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters by Pulse Opinion Research on Feb. 7 and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

Click here to view data from The Hill Poll.The last Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator under President Obama on Friday warned her Republican successor against undoing the agency’s climate and environmental work.

In a statement after the Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, Gina McCarthy Gina McCarthyObama EPA chief: Pruitt must uphold ‘law and science’ Overnight Energy: Congress does away with Obama coal mining rule GOP suspends rules to push through EPA pick despite Dem boycott MORE said she is watching his “every action very closely to ensure the Trump Administration upholds science and the law, respects its dedicated public servants and builds on the agency's long track record of protecting public health and the environment.”

ADVERTISEMENT

She added, “Now is not the time to rollback the agency's work or weaken our long held protections, it's time to work hand-in-hand with states, local communities and tribes to protect the most vulnerable among us and create the jobs of the future.”

McCarthy was one of Obama’s chief allies in his push to combat climate change in the closing years of his presidency.

While she was administrator, the EPA released several of its most sweeping environmental rules, from the Clean Power Plan limits on power plant pollution to methane restrictions at drilling sites and a rule expanding federal jurisdiction over water.

Republicans opposed most of those measures. During the campaign, President Trump often said he would undo much Obama’s climate work, and Pruitt is expected to help him do so.

Shortly after she left the EPA at the end of Obama’s term, McCarthy said she hadn’t met with Pruitt to discuss his plans for running the agency. The Senate confirmed Pruitt on a 52-46 vote on Friday. Only two Democrats supported his nomination, and one Republican opposed him.

“The need for clean air, water and land does not go out of style and is not limited to any one party,” McCarthy said in her statement. “My hope is when Mr. Pruitt heads to EPA, he fully understands the grave responsibility of the agency he now leads and upholds it remarkably important and timeless work.”Is it any surprise that banks prefer a rigged market when it comes to processing debit and credit card purchases for merchants?

It certainly is when they openly admit they hate competition, a fact they usually prefer not to reveal.

ADVERTISEMENT

Consider the community banks trade association’s recent op-ed (“Don’t buy merchant groups’ latest Durbin argument,” Jan. 30), in which President Camden Fine threw against the wall some of the banks’ same old tired arguments against reform, hoping that, like spaghetti, some would stick.

The reforms Congress passed six years ago required merchants have a choice of two companies to process these transactions to bring a modicum of competition to the business and help consumers by keeping prices lower.

“Since [reforms] have gone into effect, merchants now can select between the two unaffiliated networks,” Mr. Fine complained, “putting the merchant in charge of selecting which network the transaction is routed on.”

Exactly. That’s the point of competition. Without it, banks gouge merchants as much as a 10,000 percent markup on fees for processing credit card purchases. And even after reform of the debit market, big banks still manage to mark up those fees a stunning 500 percent. That means merchants, who compete ferociously, must raise prices to cover at least part of these outrageous “swipe fees.”

Now, Fine complains, “multiple [processing] networks compete for the merchants’ business.” This is supposed to be bad? Merchants think it sounds like a free and open market finally starting to open up.

“Furthermore,” he wrote, “why do merchant groups think retailers are in a better position to make network routing choices than community banks?”

Well, because retailers happen to believe that in the free-market system that built the largest economy in the world, customers are entitled to pick where they shop, not be told where. How can anyone take seriously the argument that we should repeal reform, as Congress is considering now, so as not to inconvenience banks by making them compete?

Banks have long gouged merchants for these processing services because Visa and MasterCard price-fix the swipe fees. The card companies and banks have long tried to squash other companies that dare to compete in this business.

And that’s what they want to go back to, with the result of higher prices for consumers, unfairly heavy burdens on Main Street small businesses, fewer jobs and a slower economy.

If you have a Vizio smart TV, your viewing data may have been sold to advertisers and marketers. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the TVs collected viewing data on 11 million people without their consent. Meanwhile, Samsung smart TVs with voice recognition enabled are able to record what you say and send it to a third-party company. Some smart TVs have cameras on them.

From Chuck Mann, Greensboro, N.C.CIA Director Mike Pompeo flatly denied a report that the U.S. intelligence community is withholding intelligence from the president, in a statement issued late Thursday.

“The CIA does not, has not, and will never hide intelligence from the President, period. We are not aware of any instance when that has occurred,” Pompeo said, calling a Wall Street Journal report to that effect “dead wrong.”

The report “impugns the integrity of thousands of professional intelligence officers by peddling gossip without citing a single example to support its claims,” Pompeo said.

Citing current and former officials, the Journal reported Thursday that intelligence officials were withholding sensitive intelligence from President Trump because they were concerned it could be leaked or compromised.

Both the White House and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence denied the allegations.

But the report underscores deep uncertainty about the health of the relationship between the president and intelligence professionals. Trump has openly blamed the intelligence community — along with the media — for the downfall of his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, who resigned on Monday amidst revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about the contents of a pre-inauguration phone call with the Russian ambassador.

“The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” the president tweeted earlier in the week.

Trump has called the leaks “criminal.”A small African government that was affected by the Trump administration's original travel ban has hired a lobbying and public affairs firm in Washington.

Glover Park Group is working for the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, a breakaway region that declared its independence from Somalia in 1991.

It is not, however, internationally recognized as a separate country and is still seeking that recognition.

New documents posted to the Justice Department website, and signed on Feb. 14, show that Glover Park Group will “act as an advisor to the foreign principal on communications and government relations matters” for Somaliland.

The services provided by the firm for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be a part of Somaliland’s bilateral relations with the United States, forms say.

One day before the contract with Glover Park Group appeared in government disclosure databases, the Somaliland government wrote a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.

In that letter, the government asked for an exemption from an executive order signed by President Trump temporarily banning travel from seven countries with Muslim-majority populations: Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Iran, Sudan and Somalia.

Trump is poised to rescind that order next week and issue a revised order that can stand up in court. The details are not yet known.

It is the second foreign government covered by the travel ban to turn to K Street lobbying firms in roughly as many weeks. Iraq hired Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck at the end of January, but the details of that contract were not specific either.

Somaliland, its foreign minister, Sa'ad Ali Shire, wrote, does not have “deteriorating conditions … [that] due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States” that are described by the order.

The breakaway region fought to obtain independence from Somalia and succeeded after the overthrow of Somali military dictator Siad Barre 26 years ago.

Now, it strives to maintain a peaceful reputation, especially in comparison to its Somali neighbor to the south, which is battling the extremist group al-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaeda.

The autonomous region is not recognized as its own nation by any country in the world.

Somaliland has its own parliament and president, trained military and police forces, currency and flag. It also has a population of about 3.5 million people, according to the BBC.

There is also a boarding school in Somaliland that has sent dozens of students to high-profile American universities, including Harvard, Yale and MIT, in the last several years, according to CNN.

Students with Somaliland passports risk being banned from entry into the United States if Trump enacts a similar travel prohibition affecting the same seven countries.

An exception for Somaliland would show “that strong and responsible governance provides a foundation upon which America’s partners can secure progress for their citizens and contribute to shared international objectives,” reads the letter from Shire.

The contract with Glover Park Group has not yet been finalized, disclosures say, so there is no specifics about how much the firm is being paid or for how long the contract will last. The firm did not respond to emails for comment.

Glover Park Group has other foreign government clients, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and a communications firm in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that advises, and is paid by, the government.The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said Thursday that he doesn’t foresee the United States sending a "large ground force" into Syria.

“I do not see the United States putting a large ground force in to take and occupy territory in Syria,” Rep. Mac Thornberry (Texas) told reporters Thursday. “I do believe this assist role is the right one for us there. Of course, having said that, that’s a long way from saying I see the solution of Syria. I don’t claim that at all.”

CNN reported Wednesday that one of the options the Pentagon is considering presenting to President Trump to help speed up the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is sending conventional ground combat forces into northern Syria for the first time.

"It's possible that you may see conventional forces hit the ground in Syria for some period of time," one Defense Department official told CNN.

U.S. officials are reportedly characterizing the idea as “a point of discussion,” not a formal proposal.

Right now, 500 U.S. special operation forces are authorized to be in Syria, a number set by the Obama administration.

But the United States has yet to send conventional forces into Syria. Doing so would significantly increase the U.S. presence in a country with a battlefield complicated by its own civil war.

In his comments Thursday, Thornberry highlighted the special operators already in the nation.

“I don’t like some of these terms because obviously we have people on the ground who are helping the coalition in Syria, people on the ground who are helping the Iraqi military, and we've had casualties from those people who are on the ground,” he said.

Thornberry also expressed concern, based on testimony the committee received from experts this week, that Syria will continue to be a safe haven for terrorists even if “things go really well.”

“What I am concerned about, among other things, as you heard, was the idea that however Syria goes in the foreseeable future, there will be significant terrorist groups using it as a base of operations, controlling or directing terrorist attacks from there,” he said. “Some of them may be al Qaeda affiliates, some of them may be ISIS, but we have seen all around the world that in ungoverned spaces terrorists thrive and the danger to us increases.”The Senate is moving forward with Wilbur Ross's nomination to lead the Commerce Department.

The chamber on Friday voted 66-31 in favor of cloture on Ross, setting up a confirmation vote later this month. Sixteen Democrats joined with all Republicans present in backing Ross, who needed a simple 51-vote majority to overcome Friday's procedural hurdle.

Senators aren't expected to be able to finish his nomination before leaving town for the week-long President's Day recess.

With Democrats able to drag out an extra 30 hours of debate, a final vote is expected as early as the evening Feb. 27.

Democrats raised fresh concerns about Ross’s nomination this week, questioning whether he has ties to Russia.

In a letter obtained by McClatchy , Dems questioned Ross's relationship with Viktor Vekselberg, a shareholder at a bank where Ross still sits on the board.

Vekselberg is friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and was formally one of the directors of the Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft.Democrats were immediately skeptical of President Trump on Thursday when he suggested he may try to keep one of the most controversial programs of his predecessor: the temporary legalization of undocumented immigrants brought to the country as kids.

"I have absolutely no reason to believe anything that comes out of his mouth or anything that he tweets," said Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's campaign arm.

During a frenetic press conference in the White House Thursday, the president said he's agonizing over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program because he's torn between following "very rough" deportation laws and helping "incredible kids" who benefit from DACA.

At one point he suggested he supports the continuation of the program but needs some time to convince the congressional critics — virtually all of them Republicans — of its merits.

ADVERTISEMENT "We're gonna deal with DACA with heart," Trump said when asked of the program's future. "I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right."

Trump claimed some of the youngsters enrolled in DACA, also called "dreamers," are "gang members" and "drug dealers," suggesting there's plenty of room to improve the screening process. "But," he was quick to add, "you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly.

"It's a very, very tough subject."

Democrats were immediately dubious.

They're already up in arms over a recent series of enforcement operations, conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which have led to the arrests of almost 700 undocumented immigrants in cities around the country — one of whom had twice enrolled in DACA.

And after meeting with ICE's acting director on Thursday, they have little faith that Trump will adopt anything but a hard-line approach to enforcement.

"It was hard to not leave that meeting and believe that the Trump administration is going to target as many immigrants as possible," Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) said. "The only hesitation they seemed to have was whether they would go after DACA recipients."

Asked if Trump's recent comments lend any bit of hope, Cárdenas was terse.

"No, because I don't believe a word Donald Trump says," he said.

Created by President Obama in 2012, DACA offers high-achieving undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before the age of 16 permission to work without fear of deportation. Supporters, including most Democrats, have hailed the initiative as a commonsense way to ensure the limited ICE resources target only violent criminals and those who pose a safety threat.

But Republicans have long railed against the program, accusing Obama of acting unilaterally to grant "amnesty" to illegal immigrants in a manner that sidestepped Congress and defied the Constitution, a message Trump adopted on the campaign trail. As a candidate, he vowed to terminate the program on "day one."

But on Thursday, the president sounded a different tone. He said DACA is "one of the most difficult subjects" he's confronting.

"It's a very difficult thing for me because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and, you know, the law is rough," Trump said.

"I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law, is very rough," he added. "It's very, very rough."A House GOP lawmaker says timing of an ObamaCare repeal measure depends on his colleagues in the Senate.

"There's no reason it can't be out of the House fairly soon,” Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) told The Hill. “Whether it is going to pass the Senate is going to depend largely on Senate Republicans — are they willing to reform their cloture rule?"

President Trump this week walked back his earlier pronouncement that the GOP would have a bill ready to go shortly after he took office, to say he might not have a measure to sign until next year.

A handful of House Republicans, including McClintock, believe that tax reform can move more swiftly through both chambers.

"We're at a national inflection point and we have basically this year to get it done — my preference and my prediction is that this is done by August on the tax side and I think it's entirely possible," Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) said in an interview.

With a long to-do list including the Obamacare repeal and tax reform, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) says Trump and Congress move at a different pace.

"There’s a lot of things moving — I think President Trump is a very ambitious guy and he wants to get things done, and this place isn’t used to getting things done in a fast way," Cole says.

Utah officials were enraged when the Obama administration, in the waning days of its tenure, designated the new Bears Ears National Monument under the Antiquities Act.

Gov. Gary Herbert (R) and Rep. Rob Bishop Rob BishopPublic lands dispute costs Utah a major trade show House votes to overturn Obama drilling rule Overnight Energy: Dems delay vote on Pruitt | GOP options for breaking deadlock | House votes to undo two Obama rules MORE (R), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, have worked to reverse that decision.

The group of businesses, led by executives from REI, North Face and Patagonia, held a call Thursday with Herbert to ask him to drop efforts to block the new park and to abandon a campaign against the Antiquities Act. That law, passed in 1906, gives a president the power to designate national landmarks on federal property for protection.

Herbert, the group said, refused to change his mind.

“It’s disappointing Gov. Herbert and the Utah congressional delegation are in a different place from Republican and Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C., and across the country,” said Amy Roberts, head of the Outdoor Industry Association, which organized the call.

As a consequence, Outdoor Retailer, the industry’s largest semi-annual trade show, will leave Salt Lake City after 20 years. The show, which attracts 40,000 visitors a year and contributes up to $45 million to Utah’s economy, will look for a new home after its summer 2018 edition.

Herbert’s office called the show’s decision to ignore future Utah bids “offensive.”

The decision “perpetuates the false narrative that Utah, a state that derives much of its inspiration and identity from its iconic public lands, a state that invests tens of millions of dollars into the protection of and access to its public lands, is somehow hostile to those public lands,” said Paul Edwards, Herbert’s deputy chief of staff. “It shows how a political agenda, rather than reason or merit, seems to have captured the decision-making at the Outdoor Industry Association.”

Addressing reporters at his monthly press conference Thursday, before the call took place, Herbert said Utah had been as good for the trade show as the trade show had been for the state.

“We’ve been a blessing to them, too. They’ve doubled or tripled over the last 20 years since they’ve been sited here in Utah,” Herbert said.

The trade show has used its economic heft as leverage for public policy changes before. In 2012, as the show considered finding a new home, Utah agreed to create the Office of Outdoor Recreation to promote outdoor tourism within its borders.

"We should obviously include anything involving Russia’s dealing with the United States," King told The Hill’s Molly K. Hooper when asked if Congress should specifically investigate Flynn’s conversations about sanctions with the Russian ambassador.

Though he would not speak for Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) — who reportedly nixed the idea of opening a new investigation into Flynn — King noted the Intelligence Committee “has been investigating Russian involvement going back a year.”

While 52 percent thought Clinton was qualified for the job, only 38 percent said that about Trump, exit polls showed.

ADVERTISEMENT

Fifty-five percent believed Clinton had the right temperament to be president, but only 35 percent felt that way about Trump.

And while integrity was advertised as Clinton’s Achilles heel, and only 36 percent thought she was honest and trustworthy, even fewer (33 percent) had the same view of Trump.

In short, for Trump to win, voters had to be willing to take a real chance on him. Voters who thought he was unqualified or unsuited for office had to support him, despite their misgivings.

Some did.

Nationally, as well as in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, one in six to one in five voters who thought Trump was unqualified, or temperamentally unsuited, for the presidency cast their ballots for him despite these important reservations.

Assuming that level of risk is most likely a function of one of two things: Either voters were so fed up they were willing to take that kind of chance, or so confident in Clinton’s eventual victory that they felt free to cast a protest vote without consequences.

However, no one could have anticipated quite how risky a choice President Trump would prove to be.

Who could have imagined that the White House would be warned that the president’s now-former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, could be subject to Russian blackmail and that the president would take no action for weeks?

Who could have guessed that that same national security adviser could have made liars out of the vice president and the president’s press secretary, and suffer no consequence for weeks?

Who could foresee an executive order on refugees and immigrants so at odds with humanity and so harmful to our own security?

Who could imagine that to make a few extra bucks at Mar-a-Lago, the president would allow paying guests to photograph the man carrying the nuclear “football” and make policy on North Korea before the very eyes of the paying guests, who certainly got their 200 grand worth that night alone?

Who could imagine that the president would simply bluster at Iran and North Korea, without a plan to back up his words with action?

Who could have imagined that in just a few short weeks, President Trump would earn the enmity of the leaders of nearly every other nation on earth?

Managing world peace just isn’t quite the same thing as negotiating a real estate deal, and the same tactics are not always appropriate to both occasions.

Americans are distraught about the risks Trump is posing.

The president began his first term with weaker ratings than any of his predecessors — and they’ve gotten worse. Just two days after his inauguration, an average of polls showed Americans approved of his performance by a meager 4-point margin.

Today they disapprove on average by an 8-point margin — a 12-point net shift against Trump in just three weeks.

Just 38 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy according to Quinnipiac — 56 percent disapprove.

The number who feel less safe with Trump as president shot up 5 points, to 50 percent, in just two weeks.

When the dangers to which Trump exposed the country this past weekend, and during Flynn’s brief tenure, work their way into the public consciousness, the president’s ratings are likely to deteriorate further.

The fact that voters were willing to take risks doesn’t mean they want their fears realized. They hope the risks will never actually emerge.

Donald Trump represents a serious threat to the security and well-being of this country. It’s time he and his minions stopped embracing risk and started trying to reduce it.

Here's the latest.

THE BIG STORY

Republicans successfully used the Congressional Review Act to repeal a regulation for the first time in 16 years Tuesday.

As The Hill's Tim Cama reports, President Trump signed legislation to repeal a controversial rule that would have required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments.

The Securities and Exchange Commission rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, forced energy companies on the United States stock exchanges to disclose the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas, coal and mineral companies make to governments in an effort to fight corruption in resource-rich countries.

Republicans have been working to roll back a series of Obama-era rules. Earlier this month, a resolution to kill Obama's coal mining rule passed both the House and Senate. That rule required coal miners to clean up the waste from mountaintop removal mining and prevent it from going into local waterways.

The administration and congressional allies reportedly claim the SEC rule repealed Tuesday imposes massive, unnecessary costs on United States oil, natural gas and mining companies, putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that do not have to comply.

Supporters, however, say it was needed to protect investors.

TOMORROW'S REGS TODAY

Wednesday's edition of the Federal Register delays a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule published just before President Trump's inauguration.

What to watch:

Communicable diseases: The HHS is delaying its rule to improve the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ability to protect against the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus.

The rule, finalized on Jan. 19, sets a 72-hour limit for how long a person can be held without a federal order for isolation or quarantine. It also provides due process protections for people who are subject to public health orders, including a right to counsel for indigent individuals.

The rule set to take effect on Feb. 21 is now delayed until March 21. HHS said it's following the Trump administration's regulatory moratorium.

Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus issued a memo after the inauguration telling federal agencies not to issue any more regulations.

Agency heads were advised to delay the effective date of rules that had already been published for at least another 60 days.

The arrests were made in Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, New York and nearby areas.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement did not say how many were arrested in total, but 161 arrests were made in Los Angeles and 200 were made in Atlanta.

David Marin, a director in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Los Angeles field office, said the arrests, which were made over the course of five days, were an “enforcement surge.”

"The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps, that’s all false and that’s dangerous and irresponsible," he said. "Reports like that create a panic.”

President Trump last month signed an executive order on immigration enforcement, which ended the previous “catch and release” policy that allowed those who crossed the border to return to Mexico without being detained.

A Los Angeles Times analysis found that 8 million undocumented workers in the U.S. may be at risk for deportation under the new order.Page Not Found | 404

“There is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of the report, according to pool reports.

“That is 100% not true. It is false. It is irresponsible to be saying this.”

Spicer said he could not categorically say the idea was never discussed by the administration.

ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t know what could potentially be out there, but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested,” he said.

The AP, citing a draft memo, earlier Friday reported the White House is considering mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops across 11 states in an anti-illegal immigration effort. The memo was written by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the report said.

A Homeland Security official acknowledged the memo’s existence, saying was a “very early, pre-decisional draft” that was never seriously considered, according to a Cox Media Group reporter Spicer said the draft memo AP referenced was “not a White House document.”

The AP says in its report that it sought comment from the White House and Department of Homeland Security on the story.

Trump promised during his campaign to form a “deportation force” to deport the more than 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally.

But it would be highly unusual for the National Guard, which is typically called up to respond to natural disasters or violent unrest, to carry out deportations.

Immigrant-rights groups said the plan would represent an inhumane militarization of immigration enforcement. "We live in a democracy, not a dictatorship, and we believe in the rule of law, not the might of a strongman," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the liberal group America's Voice.

Some of the first steps Trump has taken in the early days of his presidency have been designed to ramp up deportations.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents rounded up nearly 700 undocumented immigrants in a five-day nationwide operation.

The Department of Homeland Security said 75 percent of those arrested were convicted criminals and that the apprehensions were in line with past practices.

But a directive issued by Trump during his first week in office expands the definition of criminals who are targeted for deportation to include those who entered the country illegally, which is a misdemeanor offense.

That's different from 2011 guidance issued by the Obama administration, which told immigration agents to prioritize recent arrivals, national security threats and serious criminals for deportation.

Updated at 11:44 a.m.Andy Puzder on Wednesday withdrew his nomination to become President Trump’s secretary of Labor after it became apparent that he would not have enough Republican support to be confirmed.

The dramatic withdrawal came on the eve of Puzder’s confirmation hearing and at the urging of Senate Republican leaders who warned that anywhere from four to 12 of their members could defect in a confirmation vote, according to CNN.

“After careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor,” Puzder said in a statement. “I am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE to lead the Department of Labor and put America’s workers and businesses back on a path of sustainable prosperity.”

“While I won’t be serving in the administration, I fully support the president and his highly qualified team,” he added.

Puzder is President Trump’s first Cabinet nominee to withdraw, giving Democrats their first scalp after weeks of determined opposition.

Democrats and labor unions had assailed Puzder for his record as CEO of the fast-food conglomerate CKE Restaurants, which owns the burger chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.

“The fact that someone so anti-labor was even nominated shows how far President Trump is from where he campaigned,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Democrats declare victory after Puzder bows out MORE (D-N.Y.).

“If President Trump is remotely serious about standing up for workers, he will nominate someone for Labor Secretary that champions workers’ rights rather than suppresses them.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenAT&T, Time Warner defend deal Scott Brown being considered for ambassador to New Zealand: report Warren: Trump's EPA pick the 'attorney general for Exxon' MORE (D-Mass.) — who blasted Puzder from the Senate floor — said that Puzder should “get out of the kitchen” if he couldn’t withstand congressional scrutiny.

Puzder’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — a hearing that had been delayed several times — appeared at risk of becoming a spectacle.

For starters, Puzder was certain to face tough questions about why he had for years employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper — the type of offense that has doomed Cabinet nominees in the past.

Democrats were also likely to grill Puzder about accusations from his ex-wife, Lisa Fierstein, that he physically abused her.

Fierstein has since retracted those accusations, saying they were motivated by the divorce battle. But she appeared in disguise on “Oprah” to talk about the alleged abuse in March 1990, something she now calls a lapse in judgment.

Senators on the Labor Committee had viewed that video ahead of the hearing, according to Politico.

In perhaps the final straw for Puzder, his nomination was facing intense opposition from the right, with conservatives calling his selection a betrayal of Trump’s promise to get tough on immigration.

“Puzder himself has been a reliable font of clichés in favor of higher levels of legal immigration,” the conservative National Review wrote Wednesday.

“He has suggested that ‘the fact is that there are jobs in this country that U.S. citizens, for whatever reason, are reluctant or unwilling to perform’ — a cliché that ignores the possibility of raising wages to attract citizens — and as recently as 2015 encouraged reviving the Gang of Eight approach to immigration,” the magazine wrote.

“Over the past few days, I shared those concerns with Senate leadership and Chairman [Lamar] Alexander,” he said in a statement.

Alexander (R-Tenn.) had backed Puzder and reiterated his support on Wednesday, saying he would have made an excellent Labor secretary.

“He understands the difficulties American workers face in a rapidly changing workforce, and I look forward to continuing to hear his insights,” ­Alexander said.

Puzder’s withdrawal was yet another setback in a difficult week for the White House, coming just two days after Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser under a cloud of accusations about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to discuss whether Trump has another candidate for Labor secretary in mind.

When asked if the president is disappointed that both Flynn and Puzder are out, Spicer blamed Democrats for slow-walking the nominees.

“Where’s the role of Senate Democrats in this? We are now entering a point where we have slow-walked senior officials that can help make the government run as a whole,” he said.

“So when you tell me that you have asked Chuck Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Democrats declare victory after Puzder bows out MORE that, I’d be glad to answer the question. But at some point there is no focus on these guys having a double standard [from] what they had for Obama nominees.”

Democrats, meanwhile, were eager to celebrate their victory after failing to stop several of Trump’s other nominees, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

In a call with reporters Wednesday, Tom Perez, a former Labor secretary under President Obama who is now running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the news of Puzder’s withdrawal just another example of chaos in the Trump administration.

“Through this appointment he’s shown he was trying to make it harder for workers to get ahead and stay ahead,” he said of Trump.

Perez said Puzder, like Flynn, was not only incompetent, but also dangerous.

“If I had half the transgressions of Andy Puzder, I never would have gotten through,” he said.

Jordan Fabian and Jordain Carney contributed.The Senate voted Friday to confirm Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ushering in what are likely to be dramatic changes to the agency.

Pruitt’s confirmation came despite repeated pleas from Democrats to delay the vote due to ongoing litigation regarding emails that a liberal group had requested from the office of Pruitt, who is Oklahoma’s attorney general — a position he will leave when he is sworn in as EPA administrator.

Republicans said Pruitt will bring much-needed change to an agency that exemplifies eight years of executive overreach by the administration of former President Obama.

ADVERTISEMENT “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the real-world consequences of EPA actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the long-term.”

Democrats said Pruitt’s record of animosity toward Obama’s EPA — including filing more than a dozen lawsuits to block regulations — shows that he opposes the EPA’s most important functions, and that he is too friendly to the fossil fuel industry.

Pruitt will be responsible for implementing an aggressive deregulatory campaign that Trump outlined on the campaign trail and that the GOP has long sought.

Trump promised to roll back Obama’s entire climate change agenda, including the Clean Power Plan, which sets carbon dioxide limits for power plants. He also pledged to repeal the EPA’s Clean Water Rule, which asserts federal power over small waterways like ponds and streams.

Trump said any new regulations will be judged on whether they benefit workers, and he would refocus the EPA’s mission on clean air and water.

At his confirmation hearing, Pruitt promised to take seriously the EPA’s mission, but also to improve cooperation with states and regulated parties.

“Regulators are supposed to make things regular, to fairly and equitably enforce the rules and not pick winners and losers,” Pruitt told senators.

“A regulator should not be for or against any sector of our economy. Instead, a regulator ought to follow law in setting up the rules so that those who are regulated can plan, allocate resources to meet the standards, versus operating in a state of uncertainty and duress.”

The senators also voted to shoot down a last-minute plea by Democrats to delay the vote until Pruitt’s emails could be released and reviewed.

A state judge ruled late Thursday that Pruitt’s office has to release what could be thousands of emails between him or his staff and various fossil fuel and conservative interests, records that the Center for Media and Democracy requested more than two years ago.

Democrats unsuccessfully sought to delay the Pruitt vote until at least after Tuesday, when the emails are due to be released, so that senators could see them.

The delay would have pushed Pruitt’s vote to Feb. 27 at the earliest, due to a coming Senate recess.

McConnell slammed the pleas as politically-motivated delay tactics, like when the Democrats boycotted Pruitt’s committee vote.

“Over the past several weeks we’ve seen a historic level of obstruction from our democratic colleagues on the president’s cabinet,” he said. “Truly historic, unprecedented, and harmful obstruction. Pointless obstruction … a collection of futile gestures.”

Pruitt is set to be sworn in at 5 p.m.

All too reminiscent of Groundhog Day, Greece's never-ending sovereign debt crisis is again attracting attention. However, while markets and policymakers fret anew over the possibility that Greece might finally be forced out of the euro, Italy's seeming political unraveling is attracting relatively little attention.

This is surprising considering that while the euro could very well survive a Greek exit, it certainly could not survive in anything like its present form were Italy to have a full-blown economic and financial crisis that forced it to default on its public debt mountain.

There is certainly reason for concern that Greece's debt crisis might become acute by the summer of this year. After all, Greece has a large debt repayment falling due in July that it will not be able to make unless it comes to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the country's European creditors.

The prospects for reaching such an agreement are clouded by the fact that the IMF is conditioning its participation in any future Greek bailout program both on the Europeans agreeing to substantially write down their Greek debt claims and on the Greeks agreeing to become more serious about tax and pension system reform.

ADVERTISEMENT

Ahead of German parliamentary elections this summer, the German government is highly unlikely to agree to Greek debt forgiveness. Meanwhile, with his popularity plummeting and with Greece in a deep economic depression, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is highly unlikely to agree to further painful economic medicine for his country. This will make it very difficult for the Europeans to keep the IMF involved in the Greek bailout program.

At the same time that Greece appears to be headed for another serious chapter in its ongoing debt crisis, Italy appears to be headed for early elections most likely this fall. Making such early elections all the more probable is the recent decision of former Italian Prime Minister Mateo Renzi to call for a leadership vote of his Democratic Party. Such a vote runs the real risk of causing a deep split in the ruling party, which might force early parliamentary elections to restore governability to the country.

Among the reasons that there should be greater concern about an Italian, rather than a Greek, economic crisis is that Italy has a very much larger economy than Greece. Being the third-largest economy in the eurozone, Italy's economy is around 10 times the size of that of Greece.

Equally troubling is the fact that Italy has the world's third-largest sovereign bond market with public debt of more than $2.5 trillion. Much of this debt is held by Europe's shaky banking system, which heightens the risk that an Italian sovereign debt default could shake the global financial system to its core.

Were Italy to leave the euro, it would almost certainly default on its debt as the cost of Italian government borrowing after leaving the euro would rise to unsustainable levels.

Another reason to be more concerned about an Italian rather than a Greek crisis is that an Italian crisis would prove to be very difficult to resolve. This is not simply because, in the event of a crisis, Italy would require an outsized bailout package to save it that might put strains on even as robust an economy as Germany's.

Rather, it is that, being largely political in nature, a future Italian crisis might not be as amenable to resolution, as was the case in Greece, by just throwing a lot of money at the problem.

Stuck within a euro straitjacket that has made it difficult for Italy to redress its economic imbalances, the country's economic performance since 2008 has been abysmal. Indeed, Italian living standards today are around 10 percent below where they were 10 years ago. Meanwhile, Italy's banking system has become highly troubled and its public sector debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is now the second highest in the eurozone.

Little wonder, then, that the populist and anti-euro Five Star Movement has the wind in its sails and has now drawn equal in the polls to the ruling Democratic Party. It is also little wonder that almost all of Italy's opposition parties would now like to see Italy out of the euro.

With contentious elections scheduled this year for the Netherlands, France and Germany, and with political storm clouds now gathering in Italy, one has to regret the Trump administration's seemingly cavalier attitude toward Europe's political and economic difficulties. One also has to lament the new administration's seeming disdain for the multilateral lending institutions and for the need for international financial cooperation.

This all makes one have to hope that Europe's many political and economic problems somehow go away and do not reveal how ill-prepared the world is to deal with another and more serious round of the European sovereign debt crisis.

The views of contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.House Republican leaders on Thursday presented to their members the most detailed look yet at their plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare, though some key elements remain to be worked out.

A packet distributed to lawmakers at the meeting and obtained by The Hill says the GOP bill will include tax credits, an expansion of health savings accounts, money for high-risk pools to care for the sick and a major restructuring of Medicaid to cap federal payments.

No dollar figures for any of the Republican proposals have been presented yet. Lawmakers said that is because the Congressional Budget Office is still analyzing the plan.

Still, the document circulated Thursday shows progress, with lawmakers getting down to the brass tacks of what an ObamaCare replacement will look like. Read more here. http://bit.ly/2lnejkX

CMS pick cruises through hearing

President Trump's pick to lead the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) cruised through her confirmation hearing Thursday, though Democrats showed frustration at her refusal to offer specifics.

Seema Verma, a health consultant from Indiana who led the state's Medicaid reforms, didn't offer many details about how she would reform the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs.

She appeared to take a page out of the book of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who said frequently during his own confirmation hearing that he supported access to care but declined to provide specifics about reforms he may usher through.

"We want to make sure all Americans have access to high-quality healthcare," Verma said, offering variations of that phrase throughout the hearing. Read more here. http://bit.ly/2lcstD5

Humana exit highlights uncertainty about ObamaCare replacement plan

Humana's decision to exit the ObamaCare exchanges at the end of the year could trigger a "domino effect" among insurers, with companies abandoning the marketplace and potentially leaving thousands with diminished or zero coverage options in 2018.

Humana became the first insurance company to pull out of the exchanges for 2018 on Tuesday, amid uncertainty from Congress and the Trump administration about what an ObamaCare replacement will look like and when it might be implemented.

"There's a lot of uncertainty and the threat of repeal and delay is not helping things. It's causing a lot of uncertainty, and Humana's exit could be a harbinger of things to come," said Topher Spiro, a health policy expert at the Center for American Progress. Read more here. http://bit.ly/2lczlAr

House votes to let states deny federal funds to abortion providers

The House voted Thursday to roll back an Obama-era regulation that barred states from defunding healthcare providers for political reasons.

Former President Obama's rule required that state and local governments distribute federal Title X funding for services related to contraception, fertility, pregnancy care and cervical cancer screenings to health providers, regardless of whether they also perform abortions.

Democrats argued the GOP's effort was aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood, even though the organization is legally prohibited from using federal funds for abortions. Read more here. http://bit.ly/2kv9V3z

He added that with Gorsuch returning his committee questionnaire, it's "time for him to have the opportunity to speak for himself before the Judiciary Committee."

The hearing will last between three and four days, with Grassley arguing the timeline is in line with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, President Obama's two successful Supreme Court nominees.

President Trump nominated Gorsuch late last month to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant last year by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

Democrats will likely use the hearings to grill Gorsuch on myriad legal issues. They are demanding that he be able to get 60 votes to clear the Senate, which would require he win over at least eight Democratic senators.

Republicans argue that Democrats are trying to apply an unfair higher standard, noting that Sotomayor and Kagan were not subjected to a higher procedural threshold.

But what is happening? Is there some predictability to this upheaval or is it instead arbitrary, spontaneous and disjointed?

Only a little more than three weeks into the Trump administration, a pattern seems to be developing.

Call it “The Donald Code.”

The list of things that have been jumbled is already fairly long: Mexican relations, Australian relations, oil pipeline plans, immigration policy, a possible new location (Jerusalem rather than Tel Aviv) for the U.S. embassy in Israel. The initiatives explode forth.

But let’s focus on one action as a possible symbol of the larger picture.

This was the order to revamp the National Security Council (NSC).

The NSC has been at the center of most major decisions that have been made by presidents on how to engage with those in the world who threaten us. The body is designed to give the president the information and interpretations necessary to make decisions regarding our nation’s safety and survival.

The president has reordered the NSC in a most interesting manner.

He has directed that the person responsible for coordinating the collection and analyzing of intelligence be included in the meetings of the NSC only when invited, one presumes by the head of the council, retired General Michael Flynn.

He has directed that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the person who is most knowledgeable on military readiness and capacity, also only be included when invited.

The order also permanently includes a top White House political operative on the NSC, a strange juxtaposition.

It is a sweeping directive, not so much for its language or overt proposals, but rather for its subliminal statement of how the president intends to develop and execute operations and policy.

It is a very public demotion of the Director of National Intelligence and the highest ranking uniformed military officer — a one-two punch, of a kind, at those parts of the national security apparatus.

At the same time, it is a dramatic statement of the importance of politics in the evolution of the president’s national security agenda.

Or maybe it is simply a demotion of the whole idea of the NSC as a needed source of counsel.

In outlining these theories, it must be said that it is inherently difficult to anticipate the course to be followed by this administration.

This is because that course does seem to be greatly driven by what the person in the mirror says to the president on any given issue, on any given morning. And no one really seems to know what the person in the mirror is thinking.

But this one action was telling, because it was not unique. It seemed to encompass most of the elements underlying the purposes and processes of this administration.

What does it portend for other areas of action?

Let’s take, for example, dealing with the Congress and especially Republicans in the Congress, as a possible test case for applying The Donald Code. Who gets demoted and what gets bypassed?

The answer is fairly obvious: Everyone.

At some point in the not-too-distant future, the president will decide he neither needs nor wants the counsel of Republicans, especially the leadership, in the Congress. He will act on his own intuition and move forward.

Where does he go? It is doubtful that he knows, yet. The elements of the moment will determine that. It may be that he proceeds on a course that is positive and good for the nation. It is equally possible that, to use the vernacular, he “steps in it.” But it will be largely his course and his alone.

The president’s actions, one suspect, will be pursuant to this Code. They will be his, singularly forthright; unattended by subtlety or complication; and fenced on all sides by his personal experience.

Elected Republicans across the country, not only in Washington, will be uniquely impacted by this Code but they may not understand it.

The president will not really care if they do or do not.

It is, after all, his Code and no one else’s.

The views expressed by contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.Three times as many voters believe the Obama administration is not supportive enough of Israel as believe it is too supportive, according to a new poll for the Hill.

The proportion of voters who now say the president does not give strong enough backing to Israel is higher than it was in each of three similar surveys conducted for The Hill since May 2011. Correspondingly, fewer voters now find the White House’s policy excessively supportive of Israel.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the latest Hill Poll, just 13 percent of respondents say the president’s policy toward Israel is too supportive. A full 39 percent said Obama is not supportive enough, the highest percentage The Hill Poll has seen.

Over the past two years, recent surveys for The Hill show a fluctuating number of voters who believe the president needs to express stronger support of Israel.

In a poll for The Hill conducted in May 2011, 27 percent of voters said Obama was too supportive toward Israel, while 31 percent said he was not supportive enough.

In September 2011, the proportion of voters who said Obama was too supportive of Israel went down, and those insisting he was not supportive enough increased slightly.

March 2012 saw a slight uptick in the number of respondents who said Obama was too supportive of the Jewish state, to 25 percent, while slightly fewer voters, 32 percent, said the president was not supportive enough.

Meanwhile, in the most recent survey for The Hill, a slightly larger percentage of likely voters say Obama is generally anti-Israel than say he is pro-Israel, 30 percent to 28 percent. The percentage of voters who label Obama as pro-Israel is up slightly from a September 2011 survey for The Hill, as is the number of voters who say Obama is anti-Israel.

Overall though, the data hasn’t changed much since 2011. In the September survey, 23 percent dubbed Obama pro-Israel, while 29 percent said the president was anti-Israel. In the most recent survey, 29 percent of likely voters said Obama is neither, which is a somewhat smaller figure than the 38 percent of voters who gave that answer in 2011.

These findings underline the American public’s concern about Obama’s policy on the Jewish state at a time of heightened fears about Iran’s nuclear program. Israel has insisted that Iran must be stopped by any means necessary, including a military strike, from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The Obama administration has expressed its preference for a diplomatic solution, a posture that pro-Israel critics say is insufficiently muscular.

The White House appears to be refocusing on the U.S.-Israel alliance after spending the last few months on domestic issues. Vice President Biden is scheduled to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s upcoming conference Monday, and Obama will make his first visit to Israel as president later this month.

Another question central to the U.S.-Israel alliance is how involved the White House should be in brokering a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. According to the latest Hill Poll, a majority of voters said Obama should be somewhat or very involved in brokering a deal, while just 32 percent of voters overall said he should be not at all or not very involved in the process.

By way of broad comparison, in a May, 2011 survey, just 24 percent said Obama should be more involved in brokering a peace between the two nations, while 50 percent of voters said Obama should not be more involved and a solid 26 percent said they were not sure.

As Obama embarks on a second-term push to secure his place in history, the president is no doubt thinking about his global reputation.

But according to a comparison of two recent surveys for The Hill, fewer voters now believe Obama has improved the United States’ standing in the world.

In May 2011, 47 percent said Obama had improved the country’s standing, while 38 percent said Obama damaged the nation’s reputation. But in the Hill Poll’s most recent survey, just 37 percent said the United States is more respected internationally than it was prior to Obama taking office, while a full 43 percent said the country is less respected in the world.

These findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 28 by Pulse Opinion Research.

"And at the same, I think he has demonstrated an understanding that we should be reluctant to use military force. That we should do so only when absolutely necessary."

Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who served as President George W. Bush's ambassador to the U.N., has also been a rumored pick for deputy secretary of State.

Further complicating an appointment, Bolton was a staunch supporter of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Trump has criticized the war after initially supporting the invasion, calling into question whether their perspectives will align.

Reps. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) and Norma Torres (D-Calif.) were asked to leave the room, while several other members of the CHC were not allowed into the meeting with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting Director Tom Homan.

The meeting was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but ICE canceled, saying too many attendants had signed up. ICE then coordinated with House leadership, setting up a bipartisan meeting with a limited guest list.

Several Democrats, including House and CHC leadership, did attend the meeting.

Gutiérrez was the first to be asked to leave. Outside the room, he met Reps. Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.) and Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), who had not been allowed in.

"I was expecting to get let in. We're the ones who were asking for this meeting, now we've been barred from the meeting," said Vargas. "I want to know what they're doing, and now we've been barred from this meeting that we called for."

Vargas, a former member of the Jesuit order, then led a prayer with Gutiérrez and Napolitano. Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) arrived and joined the prayer circle.

"It was the Speaker's staff that came to me, and I know her very, very well, and she said she was speaking on behalf of the Speaker, that there were a limited number of seats," Gutiérrez said.

Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) said later: "Oh my God! That room is big enough. They have not filled it to capacity."

Several Democrats remained in the meeting: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.), and CHC members Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.), the caucus chairwoman, Joaquín Castro (Texas), Lucille Roybal-Allard (Calif.) and Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.). Reps. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), and John Conyers (Mich.) were also in attendance. Republicans sent Goodlatte and Reps. Raúl Labrador (Idaho), John Carter (Texas), David Valadao (Calif.) and Michael McCaul (Texas).

Inside the meeting, Democrats complained about the closed-door policy.

“I've never been in a meeting where an agency can designate who can attend,” said Pelosi, according to an aide. Jennifer Elzea, an ICE spokeswoman, told The Hill in an email that Homan informed the bipartisan group, "hosted by the office of Speaker Paul Ryan," of ICE's "recent successful enforcement operations." "Mr. Homan emphasized that ICE does not conduct arrests indiscriminately and does not establish checkpoints; rather, the agency’s deportation officers target pre-identified individuals for arrest at specific locations based on law enforcement leads," Elzea said. Lujan Grisham said Homan told the group that the agency has interpreted new guidance from the White House to mean that every one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country could be removed at any time. She characterized the comment as a "chilling" shift in the federal approach to immigration enforcement. Trump's recent executive order on immigration expands the definition of criminal alien to include people who've entered the country without authorization, previously a misdemeanor offense. "He confirmed that, given the shift, given the discretion allowed in the executive order … it could include everyone," she said. "They didn't say they were going to do it. He said they could do it — everyone's at risk." Republicans said the meeting was productive and fulfilled its goals. "The Speaker’s office organized a small bipartisan briefing that was, at the request of [the Department of Homeland Security], limited to members with jurisdictional interests in immigration enforcement," said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan. "Members of the CHC expressed interest in attending, and to accommodate the request, we welcomed the chair of the CHC [Lujan Grisham] to join on behalf of the other members. We are confident that the CHC chair is capable of representing the views of her caucus, and this arrangement was made very clear to the CHC ahead of time." Labrador said Democrats shouldn't complain about being left out. "I don't get invited to meetings all the time, and I don't complain about it. I'm a grownup about it," he said after the meeting. But CHC members left outside said the exclusion kept them from demanding information relevant to their constituents. "By refusing me access to information, they are essentially stealing from my constituents the right to be represented," Torres said at the impromptu press conference. Gutiérrez said they were proud of CHC leadership representing them in the meeting. "They're in there fighting for us. We're very proud of Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership; they're in there fighting for us," he said. "We sent them in there, Whip Hoyer and all of them — we sent them in there to fight for us. Now we're gonna stand outside the room." Immediately after the meeting ended, Democrats held a formal press conference. Many Democrats had been highly critical of President Obama's deportation approach, which they considered too strict. Just four weeks into the Trump administration, those same lawmakers appear somewhat traumatized in the recognition that enforcement is likely to get even tougher under the new White House. "It was hard to not leave that meeting and believe that the Trump administration is going to target as many immigrants as possible," Castro said. "The only hesitation they seemed to have was whether they would go after DACA recipients." Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is an Obama program designed to protect certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. Trump has not made clear whether he intends to do away with the policy. "They are only constrained by the resources that they have," added Sánchez, former head of the CHC and current vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Pelosi said the way the administration handled the meeting — first postponing Tuesday's gathering with the CHC, then refusing participation by certain Hispanic lawmakers — was "highly unusual." "I've never seen anything like it," she said. "And hopefully never [will] again."

President Trump turns to House Speaker Paul Ryan as he is joined by the Congressional leadership and his family as he formally signs his cabinet nominations into law.The House passed a resolution Thursday to repeal an Obama-era rule that allowed states to drug test only certain people applying for unemployment benefits.

Members voted 236-189 under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the labor rule finalized in August. Under the rule, states can only drug test individuals applying for unemployment benefits if the work they are suitable for is a job for which workers are regularly drug tested.

The White House supported GOP action to remove the rule, claiming it imposed an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a state's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system.

Supporters, however, claim repealing the rule gives states the ability to randomly drug test workers who through no fault of their own are unemployed, poor or in need of public assistance.

The latest strategy? Become the Tea Party of the left in order to regain power.

“A grassroots insurrection successfully transformed the Republican Party. Progressives need to emulate it,” Eric Sasson wrote in the New Republic after Trump’s election. “The left must now find inspiration from the right by starting their own Tea Party revolution.”

The irony of this suggestion is quite rich considering the slander repeatedly leveled against everyday American men and women who dared to participate in the original Tea Party movement. Who could forget Obama administration official Steve Rattner equating Tea Party members with suicide bombers in 2011?

“These Tea Party guys are, like, strapped with dynamite, standing in the middle of Times Square at rush hour and saying, ‘Either you do it my way, or we’re going to blow you up, ourselves up, and the whole country up with us,’ ” Ratner said during an interview with MSNBC.

Or how about when New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman called the movement a “Hezbollah faction” of the Republican Party that must be snuffed out?

The Tea Party was regularly smeared in media as a violent, bigoted, “astroturf” movement hellbent on opposing the first black president because of his skin color rather than his big-government policies. These classifications were made without evidence, and there were many more.

Obama’s government took things a step further when the IRS unfairly and illegally targeted Tea Party groups and their members.

The Tea Party movement started in late 2008 as a rejection of President George W. Bush’s bailout of the auto industry and Obama’s excessive stimulus spending. It evolved into a movement opposed to ObamaCare, and grassroots efforts were employed to find qualified political candidates who could beat incumbents.

This strategy and work paid off when Republicans won a historic landslide election in 2010, taking back the House of Representatives. The momentum continued, and in 2014 Democrats lost control of the Senate.

Results were driven from political action on the ground, not by smashing windows or burning down buildings. Tea Party participants got together in local homes to tailor their strategy and to find the best candidates for office. The movement centered on opposing specific policy proposals and government overreach. It wasn’t about obstructing progress for the sake of obstruction as we’ve seen on the left since Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE won the White House in November. In the months since, we’ve seen rioting in city streets and college campuses.

On Inauguration Day, dozens of anti-Trump protestors were arrested for destroying property and blocking inauguration attendees from getting through security checkpoints. A number of “comrades” from the Disruptj20 group were charged with felony rioting .

The day after, Madonna took the stage in Washington to declare she’s “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” Across the country a Black Lives Matter protester at an anti-Trump event in Seattle raged about why it’s time to “start killing people” and how “The White House must die.”

On college campuses from coast to coast, pro-Trump speakers are being shouted down, physically attacked and threatened with death. The “resist” movement has taken hold as a way to oppose the new administration and its supporters at every turn, no matter what the cost or the tactic.

As we watch this potential strategy of a progressive Tea Party movement play out in public debate, many have equated the two movements as somehow being the same.

The Tea Party was far better behaved than the leftist mobs we’re seeing now. Equating the two only further smears the movement as something it never was: violent and unhinged.

Pavlich is editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.Pence on Saturday told a security conference in Germany that the Trump administration pledges an “unwavering” commitment to NATO, despite President Trump’s push for a stronger relationship with the Kremlin.

"Know this: the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found," Pence said, according to pool reports. It was the vice president’s first major foreign policy address since taking office.

ADVERTISEMENT "This is President Trump's promise: we will stand with Europe today and every day, because we are bound together by the same noble ideals – freedom, democracy, justice and the rule of law.”

Pence received only “muted applause,” according to Reuters — likely a sign of Europe’s concern over Trump’s criticism of NATO and lauding of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The vice president also told member nations to pay their fair share to back NATO, and said some countries don’t have “a clear or credible path” to do so.

During his presidential campaign, Trump suggested suggested that the U.S might not come to the aid of some NATO allies if they were attacked if he believed they had not been contributing their fair share. And he occasionally called NATO “obsolete.”

Defense Secretary James Mattis on Friday sought to similarly reassure European allies, pledging Trump’s “ full support .”Thursday’s edition of the Federal Register contains a litany of rulemakings to delay rules finalized in the waning days of the Obama administration as well as a notice from the Food and Drug Administration announcing a public meeting on the use of the term “healthy” on product labels.

Here’s the lowdown:

Addicts: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is delaying a final rule aimed at better protecting the privacy of alcohol and drug abuse patients who seek treatment.

The rule, finalized on Jan. 18, allows patients to consent to disclosing their information using a general designation of “my treating providers” to allow patients to benefit from an integrated healthcare system.

But healthcare providers must upon request tell patients who received their information.

HHS said disclosing the records of individuals with substance use disorders has the potential to lead to a host of negative consequences, including: loss of employment, loss of housing, loss of child custody, discrimination by medical professionals and insurers, arrest, prosecution and incarceration.

The agency said the rule aims to ensure the patient privacy is protected.

The rule, scheduled to take effect Feb. 17, has now been delayed until March 21. HHS said it’s following the Trump administration’s order to freeze all regulatory actions.

Agency heads were advised to delay the effective date of rules that had already been published for at least another 60 days.

Disabled workers: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is delaying a rule to require federal agencies to enact hiring policies that favor individuals with disabilities.

The final rule aims to clarifies the affirmative action obligation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by requiring agencies to take specific steps to gradually increase the number of employees who have a disability or targeted disability, which include deafness, blindness, partial or complete paralysis, convulsive disorder, mental illness and missing extremity.

The rule also requires agencies to provide these employees with personal assistance services.

The rule set to take effect March 6 is now delayed until March 21. EEOC said its following President Trump’s order to freeze all regulatory action.

Toxins: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is delaying a rule to amend the list of agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to animals and plants.

Under the Agriculture Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002, the agency is required to review and republish the list every two years. The rule includes a provision to address the inactivation of select toxins, address bio-containment and biosafety and clarify regulatory language concerning security, training, incident response, and records.

The rule is now delayed until March 21.

Healthy: The Food and Drug Administration is planning to hold a public meeting on March 9 to discuss when and if it’s appropriate to use the term “healthy” on food labels.

The meeting will be held at the Hilton Rockville Hotel in Maryland. Those wishing to attend are asked to register on the FDA’s website.

Last year, FDA released guidance advising manufacturers that products labeled as “healthy” must meet FDA’s low-fat requirement and list on the label the amounts of mono- and polyunsaturated fats.Mitt Romney holds thin advantages over President Obama on leadership, personal values and honesty, according to a new poll for The Hill.

The poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, suggests voters see little difference between the candidates on character issues that Democrats have cited as key to Obama’s appeal.

ADVERTISEMENT

It found 48 percent of voters consider Romney the stronger leader, compared to 44 percent who favored Obama.

Similarly, 47 percent of likely voters also said Romney most shares their values while 44 percent picked Obama.

When asked which candidate voters considered more honest and trustworthy, 46 percent said Romney and 44 percent said Obama — a result within the poll’s 3 percentage point margin of error.

The results may prompt new questions about the effectiveness of the Obama campaign’s effort to characterize Romney as a calculating former corporate executive who has little in common with ordinary voters.

♦ Romney says press focusing on overseas stumbles to aid Obama

The findings could also raise a red flag for Obama, who analysts say needs to maintain a strong personal connection with voters to balance off his chief political weakness — the economy.

“I think in a very close election — which this one promises to be — those intangibles do make a difference and it could be a decisive difference for some people,” Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University, told The Hill.

“Even before Romney was the [de facto Republican] nominee, Obama’s character and personality always polled better than his policies and better than his performance,” Jillson said. “If he were being evaluated purely on performance, he would be in great difficulty.”

The poll found 93 percent of voters consider “policies and competence” more important than “likability” when choosing who to support for president.

Jillson said the result shows voters “care about” the candidates’ policies, but he believes “those personal characteristics actually [count] for far more than 3 percent in voter decision making.”

Obama has generally fared better than Romney throughout the campaign in polls assessing the candidates’ personal qualities.

In June, a USA Today/Gallup poll found 60 percent of voters considered Obama honest and trustworthy, compared to 50 percent for Romney. The Gallup survey also showed more people believed Obama shared their values (53 percent) than Romney (45 percent).

Obama’s biggest personal strength has been likability. Obama led Romney 81 percent to 64 percent in the Gallup survey.

The Hill poll’s questions and methodology were different than Gallup’s and can’t be compared directly. But Obama can ill afford to lose any lead he’s had over Romney on personal qualities and perceived leadership skills, Jillson said.

“I think of this as a race where Obama has very small advantages that he will have to struggle to maintain,” he said.

“If [Romney] were able to tighten up that personal connection [with voters] it would certainly do him good. I think a challenger for president needs to be seen as competent, as right on some policies, and a guy I want in my living room for the next four years.”

While The Hill Poll found Romney matches Obama overall, it showed centrist voters — who may well decide the election — still favor the Democratic incumbent.

Forty-eight percent of centrist voters believe Obama is more honest and trustworthy, compared to 42 percent who cited Romney.

Fifty percent of centrists said Obama most shares their values while 36 percent said Romney. The poll also found 48 percent of centrists consider Obama the stronger leader, compared to 43 percent for Romney.

The Hill poll was conducted July 26 among 1,000 likely voters and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.

While former Labor Secretary Tom Perez is a leading contender for the race, many liberal Latinos are backing his main rival, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.).

“Obviously, as a Latina I’m interested in creating greater opportunities of representation for all people of color,” said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the New York City Council speaker who is backing Ellison.

“I do promote Latino candidates, but there should never be the assumption that one automatically supports a Latino candidate,” she added.

Perez has received top-level endorsements, including from former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTop union offers backing for Ellison in DNC race John Kerry to teach at Yale on global issues Ellison needles Perez for 'unverifiable' claim of DNC support MORE — an indication of support from former President Barack Obama Barack Obama'SNL' should test Trump, but how about challenging a Dem for once? Financial regulation has a star role in the stock market and economy Trump looks to energize White House with Florida rally MORE.

But Ellison has attracted a large swath of the progressive wing of the party. And some major players are switching sides.

Hilda Solis, Perez’s predecessor as secretary of Labor and a Clinton supporter in last year's campaign, supports Ellison and says he's the right person to bring the progressive and centrist wings of the party together.

“Keith will help to bridge that because I’ve seen him do it,” said Solis.

Still, many Hispanic Clinton allies have stuck to Perez, who himself was a top Clinton surrogate.

“Tom Perez is a proven and qualified progressive leader who has fought for the rights of communities of color, immigrants, women, the LGBTQ community and young people throughout his entire career, and we know he is the right person to unify and lead the Democratic Party,” said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the Latino Victory Fund.

The race's hallmark has been inclusiveness, a central theme raised by all candidates, not just Perez and Ellison.

“We’ve got to expand the party at every corner. Whether it’s Latinos (and I have a little experience at that), whether it’s folks who used to be Democrats and are now Republicans or voted for Jill Stein and we’ve got to bring home,” Perez said in an interview with The American Prospect Monday.

But Ellison has garnered endorsements from prominent Hispanics, including Reps. Luis Gutierrez Luis GutierrezDems: White House canceled ICE immigration meeting ICE head cancels meeting with Hispanic Dems Hispanics are split in DNC race MORE (D-Ill.) and Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), suggesting no single candidate has the inside track with the group.

Dolores Huerta, a prominent labor activist and civil rights icon who was a staunch Clinton surrogate, has also endorsed Ellison.

Ellison's early entry into the race may have also helped his cause, because he received immediate endorsements before any other big names had jumped in.

“Jumping early is indicative of how much he wants it, which I think is a very, very favorable thing,” said Mark-Viverito.

“Him coming early really is a reflection to me of how much thought he had given it.”

Ellison's pledge to focus on grassroots growth has also struck a nerve with many Hispanics, who feel the community suffers from chronic political underrepresentation. While Hispanics make up 17 percent of the national population, only 7 percent of members of Congress are Hispanic.

“I’m basing [my support] on my experience, and I know Keith as a candidate, as an elected official who has had to raise money,” said Mark-Viverito.

Despite the similarities in Perez and Ellison's proposals, the 2016 election is still present in Democrats' minds.

Asked if there is an establishment candidate in the race, Solis replied, “all I can say is that I really do think that the party has to think very hard in terms of the direction that we go in.”

Despite the drubbing, the 2016 campaign energized Latinos, yielding some of the few promising storylines of the election for Democrats. Wins in Nevada and Colorado, plus increased participation in California and relatively good showings in Arizona and Texas generated grassroots organizations the party is keen to bank on in future elections.

And the growth of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, from 27 to 31 members — now 30 because of former Rep. Xavier Becerra Xavier BecerraHispanics are split in DNC race Becerra launches 2018 bid for full term as California AG The green movement must continue in Trump era MORE's (D-Calif.) appointment as state attorney general — spurred Latino political activism.

“I'm proud to have the support of so many Latino leaders across the country,” said Ellison. “I'm an organizer at my very core, and Latinos are some of the best organizers we have. They've organized for better working conditions, higher wages, fighting climate change, immigration reform, and were a key presence at the women's marches across the country.”

But the main uniting factor for Democrats remains opposition to President Trump, with his executive actions on immigration taking center stage for Latinos.

“We've already seen what a Trump administration intends to do — to sow fear in communities by conducting raids and separating families — and our party won't stand for that,” said Ellison.In the short time that Donald Trump Donald TrumpBudget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' Mark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game News flash: America isn't crying over the plight of the White House press corps MORE has held office, he has proven to be every bit the proverbial bull in a china shop that so many of us saw coming.

Amidst Trump’s headline grabbing flirtations with chaos, little attention was paid when he zeroed out funding for the National Endowments for the Arts (NEA) and Humanities (NEH). At a time when the American people face new threats from this administration on a daily basis, nothing could be more chilling than to see an explicit and intentional effort to suppress self-expression.

Arts and humanities are reflections of the health of our democracy. They transmit our heritage and national identity from one generation to the next, and from our people to nations around the world. Most importantly, they project back the actions of our society through the eyes of people who experience them. In this sense, art gives voice and agency to all of us, along with the power to oppose anything — from a policy to a politician — that we disagree with. It is for this reason that we must protect these fields and ensure they remain accessible to everyone.

Artistic expression also has educational and economic benefits, expanding the minds of students while driving tourism and urban renewal. In 2013, a bipartisan, congressionally initiated study conducted by an ideologically diverse, nonpartisan group of business leaders, former elected officials and scholars argued that exposure to humanities is critical for educating our youth. Ironically, it recommended Congress increase funding.

And increase funding is exactly what Congress should do. Funding the arts is something all great nations do. Providing federal resources in turn encourages local support, extends the reach of vital programs, promotes quality and diversity, and encourages entrepreneurship. But compared to our contemporaries, the United States has not been particularly committed to this goal over time. From 2006 to 2010, a total of 3 percent of funding for performing arts came from state or federal sources. All other funding — 97 percent — came from private donations and generated income. It cuts a stark comparison to many of our European allies — Slovenia, for example, provides 99 percent of their arts funding through the government.

This simple fact tells us two things. First, we are already woefully undercutting the arts sectors in this country while knowing full well how beneficial they could be to our society, and we have been for a long time. Second, and perhaps most important, when Donald Trump tells us he is cutting funds for the NEA and NEH to save money, we know he is lying.

We know he is lying because the total amount we allocate to these fields is less than .016 percent of our annual budget. As The Washington Post pointed out, this is the equivalent of a $10 investment for someone earning $50,000 a year. So as a means of saving our nation trillions of dollars, these cuts are meaningless. But as a means of silencing the masses, they are surgically designed for maximum impact.

If Trump’s cuts become a reality, it will not be the end of art or the study of humanities. It will be the end of access to these fields for anyone without the means to afford them. Considering Trump’s policies will fall hard on the poor and on minority communities, these cuts will effectively muzzle the very people most in need of art’s platform. Given this fact, Trump’s proposal to cut off the NEA and NEH are every bit as corrosive to our national character as his border wall or Muslim ban.

Just like so many of Trump’s other toxic policies, the ulterior motives behind these cuts are easy to see. And just like so many of Trump’s other policies, these cuts are thinly veiled attacks on the vulnerable, intended to cut off a reliable channel for their dissent. With each step that this administration takes toward authoritarianism, their attempts to gag opposition become more alarming. If we allow them to turn the power of art and humanities into a privilege for the rich, we will be accomplices to the effective silencing of every non-affluent person in the country. I, for one, refuse to stand by.

The views expressed by this author are their own and are not the views of The Hill.Is it any surprise that banks prefer a rigged market when it comes to processing debit and credit card purchases for merchants?

It certainly is when they openly admit they hate competition, a fact they usually prefer not to reveal.

ADVERTISEMENT

Consider the community banks trade association’s recent op-ed (“Don’t buy merchant groups’ latest Durbin argument,” Jan. 30), in which President Camden Fine threw against the wall some of the banks’ same old tired arguments against reform, hoping that, like spaghetti, some would stick.

The reforms Congress passed six years ago required merchants have a choice of two companies to process these transactions to bring a modicum of competition to the business and help consumers by keeping prices lower.

“Since [reforms] have gone into effect, merchants now can select between the two unaffiliated networks,” Mr. Fine complained, “putting the merchant in charge of selecting which network the transaction is routed on.”

Exactly. That’s the point of competition. Without it, banks gouge merchants as much as a 10,000 percent markup on fees for processing credit card purchases. And even after reform of the debit market, big banks still manage to mark up those fees a stunning 500 percent. That means merchants, who compete ferociously, must raise prices to cover at least part of these outrageous “swipe fees.”

Now, Fine complains, “multiple [processing] networks compete for the merchants’ business.” This is supposed to be bad? Merchants think it sounds like a free and open market finally starting to open up.

“Furthermore,” he wrote, “why do merchant groups think retailers are in a better position to make network routing choices than community banks?”

Well, because retailers happen to believe that in the free-market system that built the largest economy in the world, customers are entitled to pick where they shop, not be told where. How can anyone take seriously the argument that we should repeal reform, as Congress is considering now, so as not to inconvenience banks by making them compete?

Banks have long gouged merchants for these processing services because Visa and MasterCard price-fix the swipe fees. The card companies and banks have long tried to squash other companies that dare to compete in this business.

And that’s what they want to go back to, with the result of higher prices for consumers, unfairly heavy burdens on Main Street small businesses, fewer jobs and a slower economy.

Smart TVs bring Big Brother home

Are you watching your television, or is your television watching you, recording your conversations, and monitoring the television programs that you watch? If you have a Vizio smart TV, your viewing data may have been sold to advertisers and marketers. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the TVs collected viewing data on 11 million people without their consent. Meanwhile, Samsung smart TVs with voice recognition enabled are able to record what you say and send it to a third-party company. Some smart TVs have cameras on them. Imagine what they have captured.

I am against Big Brotherism, so I think that it should be illegal for any corporation to sell your personal information without your consent and without paying you something. Big Brother is watching you, recording you and selling your personal information.

From Chuck Mann, Greensboro, N.C.It is not an overstatement to suggest that every activity we engage in is subject to taxation. The system behind these taxes is a bureaucratic mammoth, a deadweight on the economy. It also erodes public trust in our government. If a person is well-connected and surrounds himself with savvy lawyers and accountants, he might be able to game the system. But struggling families and small-business owners such as my grandparents are not able to bend the rules for personal gain.

Nothing illustrates best the debacle that our tax system has become than the federal income tax code. This tax alone, with all its complex rules and interpretations, is estimated to be about 10 million words and rising. The taxes themselves, however, are only a fraction of the cost of having this code. The Mercatus Center estimates the cost of complying with such rules — measured in terms of the time, money and effort that it takes to prepare one’s taxes — to be as high as $600 billion per year. Those are resources that could be used in developing new goods and services, investing in education and infrastructure, and enforcing key social programs.

The best solution to this conundrum is a simple flat tax with no deductions, except for a deduction for each adult and each child. This policy would simplify the process of preparing our taxes, as well as transform our political system by ending the complexity that gives government bureaucrats so much power. Indeed, a flat tax would encourage transparency because politicians would no longer be able to broker tax breaks that favor special interests. Everyone would pay less in taxes and in terms of compliance. Further, studies show that a flat tax would grow the tax base and increase revenue for government. This system would allow hard-working individuals to keep more of their money, underscoring a robust work ethic in society. By eliminating loopholes and requiring everyone to pay their fair share, a flat tax offers a model of fairness and productivity.

Congressional leaders need to lead

I’m a 72-year-old independent voter who can no longer watch our political leaders in Washington act like children and get so little done. I make no party distinctions; they are all equally at fault. While I could go back much further, let me just go back 16 years. We are still talking about immigration — this inaction can be traced back at least 50 years — and we refuse to confront national debt. The date on which we run out of funds for Medicare and Medicaid approaches while Washington does nothing. I have no idea if President Trump can fix things. My issue is mainly with our Congress. “We the people” have elected 535 “leaders” that have been pretty much ineffective. It’s our fault for electing them, and it’s their fault for not performing. Consider this: The top four congressional leaders — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump Senate confirms Pruitt to lead EPA MORE (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers Democrats declare victory after Puzder bows out MORE (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — have been in Congress for about 116 combined years. We have a Congress led by senior members who cannot lead, deliberate, solve problems or act in a civil manner. However, I would give them a perfect score for being childish. Along that line, I’m asking Americans to consider March 10, 2017, as our first — and, hopefully, last — “Pacifier Day.” If interested, citizens would send pacifiers to the four leaders named above. They would be a reminder to them that we the people are not paying children.

The committee is investigating Russian interference in the U.S. election, including probing any contact between campaign officials and Russia. Trump’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, resigned Monday following revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about the contents of a pre-inauguration phone call with the Russian ambassador.

Trump has repeatedly denied any contact between his campaign and Russia in the course of the election. The New York Times reported earlier in the week that campaign associates had repeated contact with senior Russian officials in the year before the election.

Both Senate and House leadership have insisted that any investigation into Russian involvement in the election is the purview of the respective Intelligence Committees — a decision Democrats have argued is an attempt to sweep the issue under the rug.

Both committees are notoriously secretive.

This story was updated at 4:18 p.m.The United States has slipped to its lowest level in world rankings of economic freedom, according an annual index released Wednesday by the conservative Heritage Foundation.

In the latest report, the U.S. ranks 17th out of 180 countries with an economic freedom score of 75.1 out of 100. Last year, the U.S. ranked number 11.

Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand topped the list, with respective scores of 89.8, 88.6 and 83.7. Other countries that placed ahead of the U.S. included Canada, Taiwan and Britain, among others.

The Heritage report said countries with scores between 80-100 are considered economically “free,” while countries scores between 70-79.9 are considered “mostly free.”

Individuals in those countries saw incomes at more than double the average levels in other countries and more than five times higher than the incomes of people living in countries with “repressed” economies.

The conservative political think tank’s report claims the substantial expansion in the size and scope of the U.S. government, increased regulatory and tax burdens in many sectors, and the loss of trust and confidence that has accompanied a growing perception of "cronyism" has severely undermined America’s global competitiveness.

Heritage said a low score could mean less take home pay for Americans, more difficulties for entrepreneurs and greater uncertainty for businesses.

Still, the 2017 index found that 103 countries – the majority of which are less developed or emerging economies – showed advancements in economic freedom over the past year, with 49 countries achieving their highest economic freedom scores ever, including China and Russia.

But the report said 4.5 billion people – 65 percent of the world’s population – are still suffering from lack of economic freedom.

“More than half of these people live in just two countries, China and India, where advancement toward greater economic freedom has been both limited and uneven,” the report says.

In the two most populous economies, structural reforms in a few key sectors have sometimes boosted growth, but the governments have failed to institutionalize open environments that promote broad-based and sustainable improvements in the economic well-being of the population as a whole.”Democratic strategist David Axelrod on Friday panned President Trump for calling the press "the enemy of the American people" in a tweet.

Axelrod is a former senior adviser to President Obama and served as the chief strategist for both of his election campaigns.

"Every president is irritated by the news media. No other president would have described the media as 'the enemy of the people,'" Axelrod tweeted.

He followed the tweet up with a correction saying, "Ok, maybe Nixon did, tho not PUBLICLY. Not the role model you want-unless subversion of elections & democratic institutions is your thing!" Attached to the tweet was an excerpt from Nixon tapes recorded in the '70s that included Nixon saying "the press is the enemy."

"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" Trump wrote on Twitter Friday evening.

He had posted and then quickly deleted a slightly different version of the tweet just a few minutes earlier, which omitted ABC and CBS. He also included the word "SICK!" at the end of the original post.

Trump's post came a day after his first full-length press conference as president, during which he sparred with reporters and blasted "fake news."A clear majority of voters expect President Obama and Congress will fail to reach a deal to prevent spending cuts and tax hikes on millions of households next year, according to a new poll for The Hill.

The survey found 58 percent of people have little or no confidence political leaders can negotiate a compromise before Jan. 1, reflecting deep pessimism among voters about Washington’s ability to solve major problems facing the country.

ADVERTISEMENT

Only 39 percent believe the two sides will reach an agreement that stops the looming combination of $500 billion in tax increases and $109 billion in automatic spending cuts, which economists say would trigger a recession.

Voters are eager to see the two sides come together on a long-term debt pact.

Fifty percent want Obama and congressional Republicans to strike a comprehensive deal before the end of the year, according to the poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research. Only 36 percent believe it would be better to reach a short-term agreement that buys time for negotiators to reach a so-called “grand bargain” to slash the deficit.

Strong majorities, however, oppose proposals that have been part of early talks — particularly Obama’s request for unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling.

According to the poll, 59 percent reject the president’s demand that Congress give up power to set the country’s borrowing limit. Thirty-nine percent said the president should be the sole decision maker.

There is similar resistance to potential entitlement reforms that would see the age of eligibility for Medicare benefits rise from age 65 to 67, with 53 percent of likely voters saying they either somewhat or strongly oppose the idea.

The poll found 50 percent of voters believe Obama and Democrats are being “more reasonable” than Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerFormer House leader Bob Michel, a person and politician for the ages Former House GOP leader Bob Michel dies at 93 Keystone pipeline builder signs lobbyist MORE (R-Ohio) and the GOP in the ongoing talks. Thirty-eight percent of people said Boehner John BoehnerFormer House leader Bob Michel, a person and politician for the ages Former House GOP leader Bob Michel dies at 93 Keystone pipeline builder signs lobbyist MORE and the GOP were being more reasonable.

That finding furthers the perception Obama holds the upper hand in negotiations and that Republicans have more to lose if talks fail.

A Pew poll released last week, but conducted before Boehner made his latest offer in the talks, found 53 percent of people would blame Republicans if there is no deficit deal, while 27 percent would blame Obama.

Boehner last week asked that he and Obama be allowed to negotiate on their own without Senate leaders and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).

Obama seeks a deal that includes $1.6 trillion in new tax revenue over 10 years and would allow rates to increase for families earning more than $250,000 a year.

Boehner has countered with an offer that includes $800 billion in new revenue through tax reform.

His proposal reportedly includes $600 billion in healthcare savings that could come, in part, from increasing the age of eligibility for Medicare coverage to 67.

On Friday, Boehner accused Obama of trying to “slow walk” the negotiations and said, “nothing is going to be possible” if the president continues to insist on tax rate increases for the wealthy.

Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said last week the White House was “absolutely” prepared to go over the fiscal cliff if Republicans don’t go along on tax increases for the wealthy.

The Hill Poll, however, suggests that attitude carries significant political risk for the president.

Just 10 percent of voters said it would be OK if no deal is reached.

The survey found far greater pessimism among Republicans about the prospects of a deficit deal, with 75 percent saying they had little or no confidence an agreement would be reached.

By contrast, 59 percent of Democrats expressed the belief a deal would be struck compared to 35 percent who had strong doubts about the chances for success.

Republicans are also adamantly opposed to giving Obama veto power over the debt-ceiling level with 81 percent against the demand set out by the president in his initial offer to Republicans.

Sixty-two percent of Democrats back the president’s request.

The country came to the brink of a debt default in the summer of 2011 — setting the stage for the current showdown — and is likely to reach its existing $16.4 trillion borrowing limit in February.

The partisan differences are less pronounced on Medicare’s future. Fifty-seven percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans strongly or somewhat oppose a deficit deal that raises the age of eligibility to 67.

A majority of Republicans (51 percent) and Democrats (55 percent) say they’d prefer to see a long-term deficit deal struck now, rather than see Obama and Republicans agree to a temporary fix.

The top senators on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel are urging the Department of Justice to scrutinize the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger for the possibility that it leads to anticompetitive practices.

"The proposed transaction raises complex questions that will require a fact-intensive investigation that has yet to be completed, as well as a deep understanding of the economics of the digital content creation and distribution markets," reads the letter.

The senators point to the fact that Time Warner owns popular networks like CNN, HBO, TBS and TNT, and would be in a position to charge more for content from those channels and suppress content from their competitors.

"As a result, AT&T would be both a distributor of and competitor to many content providers (HBO, for example, competes with premium channels such as STARZ and Showtime; CNN competes with MSNBC; and small independent content providers compete with Time Warner’s content)," the letter adds. "AT&T could conclude that it’s beneficial to limit competing content providers’ access to AT&T’s distribution services."

In another letter first reported by The Hill on Friday, AT&T and Time Warner sought to reassure a group of Democratic senators about the merits of the proposed $85 billion deal.

“The merger will allow us to offer customers more attractive bundles of broadband and video services, prodding cable companies and other competitors to respond by improving their own services,” it reads. “And the merger will further incentivize AT&T and other wireless carriers to deploy lightning-fast 5G wireless technology faster and deeper in their networks.”

President Trump took a hard line against the proposal when it was first revealed during the presidential race, but since then he has indicated a willingness to reconsider his stance.Mitt Romney holds thin advantages over President Obama on leadership, personal values and honesty, according to a new poll for The Hill.

The poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, suggests voters see little difference between the candidates on character issues that Democrats have cited as key to Obama’s appeal.

ADVERTISEMENT

It found 48 percent of voters consider Romney the stronger leader, compared to 44 percent who favored Obama.

Similarly, 47 percent of likely voters also said Romney most shares their values while 44 percent picked Obama.

When asked which candidate voters considered more honest and trustworthy, 46 percent said Romney and 44 percent said Obama — a result within the poll’s 3 percentage point margin of error.

The results may prompt new questions about the effectiveness of the Obama campaign’s effort to characterize Romney as a calculating former corporate executive who has little in common with ordinary voters.

The findings could also raise a red flag for Obama, who analysts say needs to maintain a strong personal connection with voters to balance off his chief political weakness — the economy.

“I think in a very close election — which this one promises to be — those intangibles do make a difference and it could be a decisive difference for some people,” Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University, told The Hill.

“Even before Romney was the [de facto Republican] nominee, Obama’s character and personality always polled better than his policies and better than his performance,” Jillson said. “If he were being evaluated purely on performance, he would be in great difficulty.”

The poll found 93 percent of voters consider “policies and competence” more important than “likability” when choosing who to support for president.

Jillson said the result shows voters “care about” the candidates’ policies, but he believes “those personal characteristics actually [count] for far more than 3 percent in voter decision making.”

Obama has generally fared better than Romney throughout the campaign in polls assessing the candidates’ personal qualities.

In June, a USA Today/Gallup poll found 60 percent of voters considered Obama honest and trustworthy, compared to 50 percent for Romney. The Gallup survey also showed more people believed Obama shared their values (53 percent) than Romney (45 percent).

Obama’s biggest personal strength has been likability. Obama led Romney 81 percent to 64 percent in the Gallup survey.

The Hill poll’s questions and methodology were different than Gallup’s and can’t be compared directly. But Obama can ill afford to lose any lead he’s had over Romney on personal qualities and perceived leadership skills, Jillson said.

“I think of this as a race where Obama has very small advantages that he will have to struggle to maintain,” he said.

“If [Romney] were able to tighten up that personal connection [with voters] it would certainly do him good. I think a challenger for president needs to be seen as competent, as right on some policies, and a guy I want in my living room for the next four years.”

While The Hill Poll found Romney matches Obama overall, it showed centrist voters — who may well decide the election — still favor the Democratic incumbent.

Forty-eight percent of centrist voters believe Obama is more honest and trustworthy, compared to 42 percent who cited Romney.

Fifty percent of centrists said Obama most shares their values while 36 percent said Romney. The poll also found 48 percent of centrists consider Obama the stronger leader, compared to 43 percent for Romney.

The Hill poll was conducted July 26 among 1,000 likely voters and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.

John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) would repeal Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, which established the CFPB.

Republicans have long sought to eliminate or drastically reform the CFPB, but Cruz and Ratcliffe’s approach goes further than current GOP proposals to reshape the bureau.

Cruz said in a statement his bill “gives Congress the opportunity to free consumers and small businesses from the CFPB’s regulatory blockades and financial activism, which stunt economic growth.”

“While there’s much more to do to scale back the harmful regulatory impositions of Dodd-Frank, this legislation takes a critical step in the right direction,” said Cruz.

Ratcliffe said “President Trump has made it clear he’ll join us in our fight to dismantle Dodd-Frank,” possibly referring to the president’s pledge to deconstruct the law without providing details on how the White House would like to do so.

“I’m optimistic at our renewed chances of advancing this effort with a willing partner in the White House,” said Ratcliffe.

Republicans have consistently opposed the CFPB since the agency opened in 2011. They say the bureau — controlled by an independent director with regulatory and punitive power — is unaccountable and too powerful.

House Republicans have proposed replacing the director with a bipartisan commission and letting Congress control the CFPB budget, currently funded by the Federal Reserve.

But a recent memo from House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) contained an idea to keep the CFPB’s director while eliminating much of the bureau’s punitive and regulatory powers. It would still be subject to congressional funding under the new proposal.

Democrats are staunch defenders of the CFPB. They cite the more than $11 billion in restitution the agency won for defrauded Americans, and high-profile enforcement and regulatory actions taken against Wells Fargo, payday lenders and other financial services providers

President Obama pauses as he talks about the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and about his efforts to increase federal gun control in the East Room of the White House Jan. 5.The House passed a resolution Thursday to repeal an Obama-era rule that allowed states to drug test only certain people applying for unemployment benefits.

Members voted 236-189 under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the labor rule finalized in August. Under the rule, states can only drug test individuals applying for unemployment benefits if the work they are suitable for is a job for which workers are regularly drug tested.

The White House supported GOP action to remove the rule, claiming it imposed an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a state's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system.

Supporters, however, claim repealing the rule gives states the ability to randomly drug test workers who through no fault of their own are unemployed, poor or in need of public assistance.

Some in the GOP are shrugging off the barrage of negative headlines, chalking it up to an unorthodox president and growing pains for a new administration still staffing up.

Other key voices in the party say the Trump controversies are adding up and preventing Republicans from devoting their full attention to their top legislative priorities: repealing and replacing ObamaCare and overhauling the Tax Code.

“It is a distraction,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker Bob CorkerGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Trump makes nuclear mistake on arms control treaty with Russia The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (R-Tenn.) said this week after Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and news outlets reported close ties between Trump campaign aides and Russia. “I mean every day you guys, you're not focused on tax reform right now... nor [are] the American people. It's taking away from other efforts.”

The health and tax issues are extremely complex and leaders and committee chairmen are operating on tight timelines; any major delays could jeopardize the agenda Republicans hope to fulfill in Trump’s first 200 days.

Communication also has been a challenge. The White House’s decision to keep Congress in the dark about Trump’s controversial travel ban infuriated GOP leadership and rank-and-file members, who argued they could have helped shape and defend the order if they had been briefed beforehand. Trump officials pledged to improve communication with the Hill, and there’s been some evidence of that.

Speaker Paul Ryan Paul RyanGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump GOP's ObamaCare talking points leave many questions unanswered MORE (R-Wis.) told reporters Thursday that he speaks with Trump, Pence, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and other top White House officials almost daily. And the Speaker said the GOP’s ObamaCare efforts will begin to pick up now that former Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) has been confirmed as Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary. Price met separately with House and Senate Republicans this week.

“Our House and Senate teams are in consultation with the White House constantly,” Ryan said at a news conference after a Hill reporter asked whether communication could be better. There’s “fantastic communication, better than I’ve ever seen before.”

Ryan’s remarks came shortly after Trump huddled with a dozen House Republicans who had been early supporters during the campaign. During the White House meeting, Trump, far from a policy wonk, gave some clarity on at least one policy issue: He voiced support for renewing the Export-Import Bank.

“He was very positive on that. He kinda had a conversion on that,” said one participant, who explained to Trump how Ex-Im benefits his congressional district.

But the past week has felt like Trump’s White House is careening from one crisis to the next, reacting to the controversy du jour, and unable to string together positive news cycles. Some GOP allies worry that, under attack, the White House will make the mistake of recoiling rather than reaching out to friends on Capitol Hill.

“The danger is they become hunkered down over there in a bunker mentality, and you get more problems like the roll out of the immigration executive order,” said one House GOP lawmaker who backs Trump. “They are not reaching out to their allies here in the House and the Senate. The danger is they become more insular and it creates more problems.

“The solution,” the lawmaker continued, “is they need to be communicating to us more, reaching out more, coordinating more. There couldn’t be too much of that.”

Such complaints were raised by Democratic lawmakers during the Obama presidency, when the White House was frequently criticized for being too distance with its allies on Capitol Hill.

Another huge problem is staffing. Trump still has not nominated many of the deputy secretary, ambassador and other key posts requiring Senate confirmation. The White House continues to lack a full-time communications director, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer pulling double duty. And many offices in the sprawling Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House still remain vacant.

There are still a lot of empty seats. Once they get fully staffed, it will get better, but it can’t happen soon enough.”

Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who chairs a House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Energy Department and water infrastructure, agreed, said it's been challenging to proceed with regular oversight work without key Trump officials in place.

“We’re sitting here going, 'OK, we gotta do hearings and so forth, who do I call up do have a hearing at Energy and Water?’” Simpson said.

Simpson also echoed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellGOP Congress unnerved by Trump bumps Top Dem: GOP is terrified of Trump Senate confirms Pruitt to lead EPA MORE (R-Ky.) in criticizing Trump for going off message.

Mainstream Republicans who voted for Trump “are saying, 'What the hell is going on? And why are we talking about Ivanka’s clothing line and whether there were 3 to 5 million illegals, he would have won the popular vote?’” Simpson said. “Why are we talking about all this stuff?”

“I’m just hoping that we will get to where he focuses on those things that are important ... Most Republicans agree with his agenda and what he wants to do.”

Ryan and his leadership team say all is going to plan. Republicans will overhaul both the healthcare and tax systems, even if the Speaker has to will it to happen.

“We are doing tax reform. Tax reform is going to happen. Do you know why tax reform is going to happen? Because it has to happen,” Ryan said.

The GOP plans to roll out their much-anticipated ObamaCare repeal and replace bill after the President’s Day recess, though divisions remain in the conference over how to do it.

The rollout could correspond with Trump’s first joint address to Congress set for Feb. 28 — a speech many Hill Republicans hope is less of a campaign speech and heavier on policy prescriptions that could fill in the blanks on issues like the border wall, infrastructure and taxes.

In interviews with The Hill, a number of Republicans insisted that the key committees working on Obamacare and tax reform — Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce — are making progress and have been unaffected by recent White House distractions.

But they said it would help enormously if Trump sent an Obamacare bill to Capitol Hill.

“I’d love for somebody to come out and say, ‘Here’s the plan with specificity,’ or ‘Here’s the bill,’ but it’s unrealistic to expect this administration to, new as they are and with all the problems they’ve had in the Senate getting their key personnel confirmed,” Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) told The Hill.

“I think it’s unrealistic for us to get this, but would I like to have it? Certainly I would.”

Cristina Marcos and Jordain Carney contributed.White House chief of staff Reince Priebus is denying that President Trump’s pick to replace Michael Flynn as national security adviser turned down the job because he wouldn't be allowed to install his own staff.

Retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward told Trump he could not accept the position Thursday, citing “financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position.”

“The conversations were happening based on a contingency that his family would sign off on him going further. The family didn’t sign off. That’s all it is,” Priebus said Friday on “Fox & Friends."

“We kept in constant contact with him and he called us and said, ‘Guess what? I’ve got some support in the family but others are not that excited about it,’” he added.

“He told us that it’s something that his family couldn’t go for. But he was honored to be talked to. It wasn’t going to happen and it’s a reasonable thing.”

Harward said Thursday he believed being Trump’s national security adviser required “24 hours a day, 7 days a week focus and commitment to do it right.”

“I currently could not make that commitment,” the former Navy SEAL said in a statement reported by CNN.

The Financial Times reported Thursday that a source familiar with Harward’s decision said he was concerned with whether top administration officials would let him install his own staff.

Flynn’s deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland, told The Hill Tuesday Trump had “asked that I stay on” following the retired Army lieutenant general’s departure Monday.

Flynn resigned Monday amid reports he misled senior White House officials about his discussions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December.

THE BIG STORY

Republicans successfully used the Congressional Review Act to repeal a regulation for the first time in 16 years Tuesday.

As The Hill's Tim Cama reports, President Trump signed legislation to repeal a controversial rule that would have required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments.

The Securities and Exchange Commission rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, forced energy companies on the United States stock exchanges to disclose the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas, coal and mineral companies make to governments in an effort to fight corruption in resource-rich countries.

Republicans have been working to roll back a series of Obama-era rules. Earlier this month, a resolution to kill Obama's coal mining rule passed both the House and Senate. That rule required coal miners to clean up the waste from mountaintop removal mining and prevent it from going into local waterways.

The administration and congressional allies reportedly claim the SEC rule repealed Tuesday imposes massive, unnecessary costs on United States oil, natural gas and mining companies, putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that do not have to comply.

Supporters, however, say it was needed to protect investors.

TOMORROW'S REGS TODAY

Wednesday's edition of the Federal Register delays a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule published just before President Trump's inauguration.

What to watch:

Communicable diseases: The HHS is delaying its rule to improve the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ability to protect against the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus.

The rule, finalized on Jan. 19, sets a 72-hour limit for how long a person can be held without a federal order for isolation or quarantine. It also provides due process protections for people who are subject to public health orders, including a right to counsel for indigent individuals.

The rule set to take effect on Feb. 21 is now delayed until March 21. HHS said it's following the Trump administration's regulatory moratorium.

Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus issued a memo after the inauguration telling federal agencies not to issue any more regulations.

Agency heads were advised to delay the effective date of rules that had already been published for at least another 60 days.

Click here to sign up for the newsletter: http://bit.ly/1Vygy0FThe reported use of encrypted messaging apps by government workers is raising questions about whether the services evade scrutiny from their superiors and the public — or are even legal.

Trump administration staffers are reportedly communicating via an encrypted messaging app called Confide, the main feature of which is self-destructing messages.

Axios originally reported last week that top GOP operatives and aides in the administration have been using the app to communicate out of fear that they might be hacked and have their correspondence made public.

And The Washington Post reported this week that, amid the fallout of national security adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation, White House staffers are using Confide out of fear that President Trump is planning to crack down on leaks to the media.

House Republicans are also seizing on reports that federal workers are using encrypted messaging apps to avoid being monitored by their supervisors.

House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), the panel’s oversight chair, wrote a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general calling for an investigation into the use of messaging apps like Signal, which Politico reported earlier this month was being used among a group of agency employees.

“Reportedly, this group of career officials at the EPA are aiming to spread their goals covertly to avoid federal records requirements, while also aiming to circumvent the government’s ability to monitor their communications,” the letter reads.

“Over the past few years, we have seen several examples of federal officials’ circumventing Federal Records Act requirements and transparency generally. In this instance, the Committee is concerned that these encrypted and off-the-record communication practices, if true, run afoul of federal record-keeping requirements, leaving information that could be responsive to future Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and congressional requests unattainable.”

Government accountability watchdog groups are raising similar concerns about the use of Confide in the White House, saying it violates the Presidential Records Act. The 39-year-old law requires the president, vice president and their immediate staff members to preserve all correspondence so that official records can be archived.

“The reason we have to have an archived record is so there's accountability for the actions and decisions that get made and historically we can review the activities of an administration,” said Sean Moulton, who oversees the open government program at the Project on Government Oversight.

“If you don't want that kind of paper trail then it raises serious questions about the discussions and the decisions that are being made,” Moulton added.

Conservatives have expressed alarm over the reports that new technologies might be used to evade records.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that if the reports turned out to be true, he believes that White House staff using Confide to cover up leaks would be illegal and “wildly irresponsible.”

“You can't on the fly delete records because you don't think they're government records,” Fitton said. “And in the end, the president is responsible for this and he needs to make sure the rules are being followed.”

The Presidential Records Act does allow for the White House to dispose of correspondence that does not qualify as official business, but only after consulting with the Archivist of the United States to determine whether the materials have historical value.

In the case of the EPA, career officials were using the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss their concerns about the direction of the department under the new administration.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who also sits on the House Science panel with Smith and LaHood, said that the Politico report did not show that the EPA employees were trying to evade federal records laws.

“I think there is a lot of fear in government right now,” he said.

Unlike Confide, Signal does not by default automatically erase messages after they have been received.

Because of that, the use of Signal is not in itself a violation of the Federal Records Act, a law that is similar to the Presidential Records Act and governs executive branch agencies.

Employees are allowed to have private messaging accounts for use in personal matters, but if they conduct official business in a medium other than their official email account, they are required to forward or copy those messages to their work account.

“The law is pretty clear that, no matter how you are creating records, it’s not the medium that matters,” said Adam Marshall, the Knight Foundation Litigation Attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

“How else would a [Freedom of Information Act] officer know they are looking at all of the information?”

Beyer suggested that there is a double standard with the two cases.

“The federal law should be obeyed — whether the EPA, the executive branch or anyone else,” he said. “But at a minimum, the executive branch should be held to the standard of the EPA.”President Trump’s regulatory freeze is in full effect.

Federal agencies are following orders to delay the rules that Obama administration officials finalized before leaving office but that have not yet taken effect.

This week alone, the Department of Health and Human Services delayed two rules: one to protect the privacy of alcohol and drug abusers who seek treatment, and a second to help the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protect against the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission delayed a rule it finalized two days before the inauguration requiring federal agencies to enact hiring policies that favor individuals with disabilities.

Last week, the Federal Railroad Administration delayed new safety rules for commuter trains, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture delayed news standards for how animals should be treated if the farmer wishes to sell the meat as certified organic.

Trump’s regulatory freeze began with a government-wide memo that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sent on Jan. 20. The memo advised agency heads to delay rules that had already been published for at least 60 days, pushing most rules back until March 21.

The effect of Trump’s orders has been noticeable in the Federal Register, the daily docket where new and proposed regulations from government agencies are published.

Before Trump took office, the register would often include dozens of regulations at various stages of completion.

Now the docket is short and mostly includes notices about public meetings.

Though Priebus’s memo told agencies not to issue any new rules, the order did not apply to every agency.

Sophie Miller, a senior policy analyst at George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center, noted that agencies independent of the White House — like the Federal Communications Commission — are still churning out rules.

“Executive orders are not thought to apply to independent agencies,” she said.

Final rules from agencies under Trump’s purview, however, still face the threat of being overturned under the Congressional Review Act, which gives lawmakers 60 legislative days to repeal a regulation after it’s finalized.

The House has already passed over a dozen resolutions to repeal rules; three have made it through the Senate and two have been signed by the president.

Going forward, the Trump administration could ultimately decide to make changes to the rules that have been delayed, but to do so, the agency would have to go through the rulemaking process all over again, Miller said.

While a regulatory freeze is common for new administrations, public health and safety advocates fear the Trump administration is gearing up for a broader attack on the rulemaking process.

“It’s part of a pattern of taking on the rulemaking process in any way they can,” said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch Division.

Public Citizen is one of three groups suing to block Trump’s so-called one-in-two-out rule. That executive order, signed Jan. 30, requires agencies to revoke two regulations for every new rule they want to issue.

Gilbert pointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision earlier this month to take a fresh look at its CEO pay ratio disclosure rule as proof the administration is using every avenue to walk back regulations.

The controversial mandate, finalized in August of 2015 but starting this year, requires companies to publicly disclose how much more money CEOs make than their employees. Democrats required that rule in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in an attempt to shed light on income inequality.

In a statement, SEC acting Chairman Michael Piwowar said some companies “have begun to encounter unanticipated compliance difficulties that may hinder them in meeting the reporting deadline.”

Republicans and businesses hotly contested the rule, arguing that it was too costly and forced companies to disclose information that’s useless to investors.

Piwowar is now giving the public 45 days to submit comments on the rule to better understand the difficulties companies are having.

“To see it reopened yet again for no reason is very troubling,” Gilbert said.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 fax

“This is destructive,” Rove said Monday on Fox News . "This first of all suggests that Donald Trump is weak. When his inner circle, his closest advisers are publicly telling people, ‘This is the advice I gave my chief and he isn’t listening to me,’ it makes him look weak.”

Reports emerged earlier Monday that Trump is meeting with Romney a second time, despite turmoil within his inner circle over the latter’s fitness to lead the State Department. Rove said Conway’s criticism of Romney has put Trump in a tough spot regarding the 2012 GOP presidential nominee.

“If he settles on Romney, his closest advisers told him not to do it. If he settles on somebody else, it’s going to be there was anger about Romney and he couldn’t stand up to that anger. Better to have given that advice in private and let him make his decision one way or the other.

“This is going to inhibit the free flow of private, confidential advice to the president, which is one of the most important commodities inside the White House.”

Romney was a fierce critic of the billionaire during the 2016 race, and Conway on Sunday blasted his potential role in the Trump administration, questioning his loyalty to the president-elect.

“I’m all for party unity, but I’m not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of State position,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union." "I think there are concerns that those of us that are loyal have, and we want a secretary of State who’s loyal to the president.”

MSNBC reported earlier Monday that Trump’s top aides are “baffled” by Conway’s public actions, which have left the president-elect “furious."Two Republican lawmakers introduced Tuesday companion bills to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the controversial watchdog agency long targeted by the GOP.

John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) would repeal Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, which established the CFPB.

Republicans have long sought to eliminate or drastically reform the CFPB, but Cruz and Ratcliffe’s approach goes further than current GOP proposals to reshape the bureau.

Cruz said in a statement his bill “gives Congress the opportunity to free consumers and small businesses from the CFPB’s regulatory blockades and financial activism, which stunt economic growth.”

“While there’s much more to do to scale back the harmful regulatory impositions of Dodd-Frank, this legislation takes a critical step in the right direction,” said Cruz.

Ratcliffe said “President Trump has made it clear he’ll join us in our fight to dismantle Dodd-Frank,” possibly referring to the president’s pledge to deconstruct the law without providing details on how the White House would like to do so.

“I’m optimistic at our renewed chances of advancing this effort with a willing partner in the White House,” said Ratcliffe.

Republicans have consistently opposed the CFPB since the agency opened in 2011. They say the bureau — controlled by an independent director with regulatory and punitive power — is unaccountable and too powerful.

House Republicans have proposed replacing the director with a bipartisan commission and letting Congress control the CFPB budget, currently funded by the Federal Reserve.

But a recent memo from House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) contained an idea to keep the CFPB’s director while eliminating much of the bureau’s punitive and regulatory powers. It would still be subject to congressional funding under the new proposal.

Democrats are staunch defenders of the CFPB. They cite the more than $11 billion in restitution the agency won for defrauded Americans, and high-profile enforcement and regulatory actions taken against Wells Fargo, payday lenders and other financial services providers

John McCain John McCainTrump budget could ax arts, public broadcasting, anti-drug office: report Dem senator: 'This is not the presidency we were promised' Budget chief prepares to become Trump's 'bad cop' MORE (R-Ariz.) on Friday warned about trends toward intolerance and authoritarianism, seeming to rebuke President Trump without mentioning him by name.

“What would von Kleist’s generation say if they saw our world today?” he asked at the Munich Security Conference, referencing Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist, a member of a failed 1944 plot to assassinate Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

"They would be alarmed by an increasing turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood, and race, and sectarianism," McCain said. "They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see toward immigrants, and refugees, and minority groups, especially Muslims.

"They would be alarmed by the growing inability, and even unwillingness, to separate truth from lies. They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent.”

McCain then challenged listeners to recall that “we stand for truth against falsehood, freedom against tyranny, right against injustice, [and] hope against despair.”

“I am proud, unapologetic believer in the West, and I believe we must always, always stand up for it — for if we do not, who will?” the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee asked.

McCain praised Defense Secretary James Mattis, but said the controversy surrounding ousted National Security Advisor Michael Flynn shows a White House in "disarray."

“I think that the Flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do,” McCain said. “The president, I think, makes statements [and] on other occasions contradicts himself. So we’ve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says."

A December call reportedly addressed U.S. sanctions.

McCain’s remarks follow a Thursday press conference where President Trump hammered the media.

“Many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat you with the respect you deserve,” he said at the White House.

“The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. The press is out of control, the dishonesty is out of control.”

Trump has repeatedly labeled reports critical of him as “fake news,” prompting critics to warn the president that he is attempting to delegitimize the free press.

The president, who has sparred with McCain, also signed an executive order indefinitely suspending the acceptance of refugees from Syria, temporarily halting the entire refugee program and temporarily blocking citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. A judge put the order on hold while a lawsuit against it proceeds, and Trump has said he would issue a new order next week.An immigrant from Mexico who has obtained a work permit since being brought into the country illegally as a child was arrested by authorities in Seattle, Reuters reported Tuesday.

The Department of Agriculture on Friday reposted some of the animal welfare records it had removed from its website, after outcry from animal rights groups when the material was taken down.

The documents that were removed earlier this month included records of animal welfare violations at zoos, commercial breeders and research labs.

USDA claimed it removed the records as part of a comprehensive review to balance the need for transparency with rules that protect individual privacy.

In a statement Friday, the agency said it reposted the first batch of annual reports of research institutions and inspection reports for certain federal research facilities.

“The reports posted are part of a comprehensive review of the documents the agency removed from its website in early February and are in the same redacted form as before,” the statement read.

“As announced on Feb. 7, 2017, the agency will continue to review records and determine which information is appropriate for reposting.”

PETA and five other animal rights advocates and groups filed a lawsuit earlier this week claiming USDA violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in removing the records. The law requires federal agencies to provide certain records to the public as a whole and disclose any other records to individuals in response to FOIA requests

The groups argues that the records are needed to keep the public informed about the agency’s implementation and enforcement — or lack thereof — for the 1966 Animal Welfare Act (AWA).

The Humane Society of the United States called the USDA action on Friday a step in the right direction, but noted that years of material are still missing from the website.

“This is an important turnaround and a good start, but the USDA has a lot more to do here,” Wayne Pacelle, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

“Lawmakers, the press, animal advocates, and even the regulated community want transparency and accessible records.”

Rep. Vern Buchanan Vern (R-Fla.), co-chair of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, said the partial restoration of the website was “not good enough.”

“There’s no reason to hold back this vital information,” he said in a statement. “This website protects animals and the database should be fully restored. At the end of the day, putting a few documents back online is not good enough.”



Buchanan, along with 100 other members of Congress, sent a letter to President Trump on Tuesday asking for the database to be restored immediately.As national leaders move forward with plans to revitalize the U.S. economy, no single issue has more promise to unleash America's potential than comprehensive tax reform.

Our tax code is significantly dated. Taxes, especially on the business side, are too high and unnecessarily complicated. The cumbersome tax system stifles economic growth and restricts our ability to create jobs.

That is why the American Council for Capital Formation has developed a broad set of policy recommendations to streamline the tax code to make it simpler, fairer and more oriented toward the formation of capital.

President Trump and the leaders of the 115th Congress have both expressed a commitment to making tax reform a reality, using the momentum of the November elections to galvanize bipartisan support for pro-growth tax policies.

ADVERTISEMENT

During his inaugural address, Trump restated his support for ensuring that tax policy works to the benefit of American businesses and families. Speaker(R-Wis.) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman(R-Texas) have laid out their own blueprint for reforming the tax code.

Trump's call for action mirrors many of the features of the House GOP blueprint. These initial proposals are a strong first step toward the meaningful reform Americans deserve.

Today's tax code is a significant drag on capital formation for American businesses. At almost 39 percent, the combined federal and state corporate tax rate is one of the world's most burdensome.

Major multinational corporations, which employ tens of thousands of American workers, are forced to pay higher U.S. taxes than their international competitors. Some corporations simply leave the United States altogether, taking valuable capital and jobs with them.

What's more, many American businesses have to spend valuable time and capital to comply with complicated tax laws instead of devoting those resources to hiring and training new employees and expanding their operations.

With U.S. economic growth still sluggish, the need for meaningful tax reform is long overdue. Our federal tax code has not been updated in more than three decades. At the same time, other nations have reduced their taxes on businesses to make themselves more competitive in the global marketplace.

The United States has simply not kept pace.

The Ryan-Brady blueprint seeks to remedy the misalignment of U.S. tax policy by lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and reducing the tax rate on small businesses to 25 percent, which would be the lowest tax rate on small businesses since World War II.

The plan also includes a border adjustment provision to recalibrate American tax policy regarding imports and exports. It is an important feature of the blueprint in terms of raising revenue to pay for lower rates and full expensing for new investment.

Brady has pointed out that many of our competitors use border adjustments in their value added tax (VAT) systems, creating a level playing field for goods leaving versus goods entering a nation.

The United States does not supplement its tax revenue with a national sales or consumption tax. As a result, it doesn't adjust its taxes at the border.

The blueprint proposes to fix this lopsidedness by providing equal treatment for goods produced and sold domestically and internationally. But questions regarding how the overall economy will respond or how our competitors will tweak their policies in response still need to be answered.

Various analyses show that tax reform that moves closer to a consumption tax with full expensing will have a positive impact on economic growth. The Tax Foundation estimates the Ryan-Brady blueprint would create as many as 1.7 million jobs and boost gross domestic product by more than 9 percent.

No matter the details of the final plan, the United States needs tax reform that is simple, pro-growth and fair. Tax reform also needs to be comprehensive and avoid a patchwork approach.

To be truly lasting, tax reform needs to be transparent and bipartisan.

Tax reform has momentum. The time is right for Congress and the new administration to deliver tax reform that will improve America's economic future.

Conway told CNN that her tweets reflect the private discussions she’s had with Trump and Vice President-elect

“I am struck by the intensity and volume of resistance [to Romney] from the grassroots; words like 'betrayal,'” Conway said. “I communicate with PEOTUS and VPEOTUS privately and regularly so this is not an attempt to do so publicly as some (who missed the election completely) are suggesting.”

She said she respects “completely” that these “weighty decisions” rest with Trump, "a man whose political instincts and unconventional campaign defied the critics and made history."

Some Trump supporters and allies have tried to steer the President-elect from nominating Romney as the U.S.'s chief diplomat.

Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, was highly critical of Trump during the campaign and called him a "phony," and a "fraud" and dedicated an entire speech in March to denouncing his candidacy.

"He attacked [Trump] on a personal level about his character, his integrity, his honor," Trump supporter Mike Huckabee said on "Fox & Friends" Wednesday.

The former Arkansas governor added that it would be a "real insult" to Trump voters if Romney was nominated to be secretary of State.

Other Trump supporters, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich, have said they favor former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the job.

“I think that, if you want someone who is going to go out and be a very tough negotiator for America and represent American interest in the way that Trump campaigned, I think that probably Rudy is the better pick and has the right temperament."
