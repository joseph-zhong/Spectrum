Rep. Jason Chaffetz is asking the White House for information about security protocols at Mar-a-Lago after Trump pored over documents related to North Korea at a table on the club’s outdoor terrace.

The request is significant as it marks the first time the House Oversight Committee — led by Chaffetz (R-Utah) — has requested information from the Trump White House.

Trump conferred with aides, spoke on the phone and looked over documents on the club’s terrace Saturday night after North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile, its first such test since Trump took office. The flurry of activity took place a few steps from where club members were dining, and some guests posted photos of the scene on social media.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who Trump was entertaining for the weekend, was present and also took part in the conversations.

“Discussions with foreign leaders regarding international missile tests, and documents used to support those discussions, are presumptively [sic] sensitive,” Chaffetz wrote in a letter to Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.

“While the President is always on duty, and cannot dictate the timing of when he needs to receive sensitive information about urgent matters, we hope the White House will cooperate in providing the Committee with additional information.”

Chaffetz has come under increasing pressure to investigate Trump — particularly his potential conflicts of interest and ties to Russia — as scandals mount during the president’s first month in office. The lawmaker’s letter to the White House came on the same day he drew criticism for saying he would not launch a probe related to Michael Flynn, Trump’s ex-national security adviser, because the situation is “taking care of itself.”

Flynn resigned Monday night after The Washington Post reported he spoke with Russia’s ambassador about U.S. sanctions before Trump’s inauguration and allowed Vice President Pence to publicly deny the conversation had taken place.

The North Korea incident took place as several questions about Mar-a-Lago’s security remained unanswered. The property in Palm Beach, Fla., is a regular weekend retreat for Trump, but it was not clear until Tuesday that it had a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, for receiving classified information.

The White House has denied Trump handled sensitive information on the Mar-a-Lago terrace. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Tuesday that Trump was briefed about the missile test in a SCIF before his dinner on the terrace.

The president and Abe were “only talking about the logistics” of a news conference planned for later that evening in view of guests, Spicer said at a news conference Tuesday.

Chaffetz asked Priebus to describe security protocols at Mar-a-Lago, including whether guests and staff are vetted “to ensure they are not foreign agents or spies,” and the classification level of the documents Trump reviewed on the terrace.

He also asked to know whether classified information was discussed within earshot of guests or possible recording devices.Photo by wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock

You, too, can protect your computers and online accounts like an expert! But you probably don’t, according to a study from researchers at Google presented at the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security last week. The researchers conducted online surveys of 231 security “experts” (defined as people with at least five years of experience working in the field) and 294 non-experts, recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, to find out how the two groups’ security practices differed. The results showed several discrepancies in how the expert and non-expert groups protected themselves online. More strikingly, the study also suggested that protecting yourself like an expert actually requires very little expertise at all.

In an attempt to winnow down the massive amount of computer security advice out there, the survey asked respondents the open-ended question “What are the 3 most important things you do to protect your security online?” The top five responses in the expert group were: installing software updates (35 percent), using unique passwords (25 percent), using two-factor authentication (20 percent), using strong passwords (19 percent), and using a password manager (12 percent). For non-experts, the top five responses were: using anti-virus software (42 percent), using strong passwords (31 percent), changing passwords frequently (21 percent), visiting only known websites (21 percent), and not sharing personal information (17 percent). (Strong passwords are those that are difficult to guess because of their length or complexity; unique passwords are those that are used for only one account and not repeated across multiple sites.)

Let’s set aside the question of how it’s possible that one-fifth of the non-expert computer-using population is visiting only known websites. One of the most interesting things about these findings is the implication that expert-level protection requires very little technical know-how. The practices that experts are most likely to endorse—and implement themselves—do not require an intimate knowledge of computer networking, or traffic monitoring, or malicious code. You don’t need any training in computer science or security to figure out how to install software updates or choose unique passwords. Even the slightly more sophisticated practices—two-factor authentication (i.e., using a one-time code texted to your cellphone or other credential in addition to a password to login to an account) and password managers—are fairly straightforward and easily available even to users with relatively little tech savvy.

To protect yourself online like an expert, in other words, you don’t need to understand the Internet’s architecture or inner workings—you just need to branch out from anti-virus software. The survey suggests non-expert users are wary about programs like password managers or new software updates. But they lean heavily on anti-virus software, which 85 percent of non-experts said they used on their personal computers, compared with only 63 percent of expert respondents. Only 7 percent of experts said they considered anti-virus to be one of the top three things they do to stay safe online, compared with 42 percent of non-experts.

Get Future Tense in your inbox.

But when it came to installing software updates and using password managers, non-experts were much more hesitant than experts. For instance, 73 percent of experts said they used a password manager program to store their credentials for at least some of their accounts, compared with 24 percent of non-experts. And some of the non-experts said in the survey that they did not think password managers were safe and might result in their passwords being leaked. “I wouldn’t use a password manager even if it helps because I don’t trust it,” one wrote. Those fears aren’t entirely unfounded—password manager LastPass announced it had been hacked earlier this summer—but dedicated password managers are still probably more trustworthy and reliable than the alternatives (or so many of the surveyed experts seemed to feel).

Other non-experts expressed concern about downloading software updates, with one writing, “I don’t know if updating software is always safe. What if you download malicious software?” Another noted that “there are often bugs in these updates initially, that must be worked out by the software vendor.” This suspicion of new updates may be part of the reason that 25 percent of experts said they installed updates “immediately,” compared with 9 percent of non-expert respondents.

People who work in computer security (and security more generally) tend to have a reputation for being paranoid about every possible risk, so it’s striking that the non-expert population actually seems to exhibit greater paranoia around some issues—being more suspicious about the trustworthiness of a password manager, or the reliability or a new update, or the threats presented by an unknown website.

It’s possible, of course, that the expert population is less fearful of new programs and updates and websites because they have greater faith in their own ability to identify threats. For instance, though the researchers found that the advice experts offered to less tech-savvy users mostly mirrored their own practices, there were some exceptions. For instance, many experts considered it to be good security advice to not click on links or open emails from unknown people. Yet 38 percent of expert respondents said they often clicked on links from unknown senders, compared with only 12 percent of non-experts. (One expert admitted: “I do all the time … but I tell my mother not to.”)

Paranoid or not, the computer security experts seem, in some ways, to live in less fear of the dangers of the Internet than the non-expert population. In some cases this may just be an indication of how experts and non-experts fear different threats—perhaps the group of non-experts is more concerned about their old passwords being guessed or stolen and therefore change their passwords regularly, while the experts are worrying about having their passwords phished, and therefore are more likely to activate two-factor authentication.

Of course, non-expert opinions about security are probably shaped to a large extent by expert ones—someone probably told them that anti-virus software and regularly changing passwords and staying away from unknown websites are important safety measures. If anything, the most popular non-expert safety measures seem to reflect the messages that the security community has most effectively communicated (whether intentionally or otherwise) to the rest of the world. That may be partly a function of how long those messages have been around—after all, we’ve been hearing about anti-virus for much longer than we have two-factor authentication—as well as the inundation of security advice in recent years, as a growing number of breaches have made headlines, which has made it harder to know which measures to adopt.

Actually, it’s still hard to know which measures to adopt. The Google study largely sidesteps the question of which of these myriad suggestions actually lead to the best outcomes, or correlate with fewer malware infections or account compromises.Know the laws in your state that protect LBGT people and people living with HIV.If you don’t think that a photo of an empty toy box is enough to send Star Wars fans into a tizzy, then you really don’t know Star Wars fans.

The big reveal here is the new hairstyle being worn by Rey, who has traded in her triple-bun ’do for what looks like a half-up, half-down hairstyle. Why is this such a big deal? Because back in July, Rey actress Daisy Ridley posted a video of herself working out—and wearing a pillowcase on her head, “to protect my REY HAIRSTYLE from Instagram’s gaze,” she wrote at the time, following up with the hashtags #topemployee and #secrecyqueen, for good measure.

That suggested that Rey’s new look has some kind of spoiler-y significance, too important to the plot or the character’s development to let fans have a peek. So now that the style is out in the open, we took our best guesses at what it might mean.

Rey’s hair is hiding a Padawan braid.

The mystery of Episode XIII’s title is who, exactly, is (or are) The Last Jedi? The Force Awakens leaves off with Rey offering a lightsaber to Luke Skywalker. Was she once one of his pupils, before she was abandoned on Jakku as a child? Will Luke train her in the ways of the Force?

A lightsaber alone does not a Jedi make, so a good indicator of whether or not Rey is one of the last Jedi in question would be the presence of a Padawan braid, which indicates that the wearer is a Jedi-in-training. Rey’s new longer, flowing hairdo might be concealing one.

Her hair is hiding no Padawan braid.

Then again, not every Jedi-in-training has a Padawan braid—Luke, who trained while the Jedi were nearly extinct, never wore one. But the absence of a Padawan braid could also be a spoiler in and of itself. Will Luke refuse to train Rey, even though she is Force-sensitive?

Rey is a Skywalker, and her hair reflects her heritage.

You know who else had any number of prominent hairstyle changes? Princess Leia, who switched between her famous cinnamon roll buns, crown braids, loose waves, and more. And Leia’s mother, Padme Amidala, was the queen of the salon, changing hairstyles about as often as she changed outfits. Might Rey’s new look be a nod to her ancestry?

Ridley is just messing with us.

Controlled leak culture has run amok, with studios shrouding even the tiniest nuggets of information in secrecy and fans pouring over any insignificant detail. Ridley is making a statement by creating a mystery where none exists, sending culture bloggers into furious fits of analysis over a toy box. And hey, look, it worked!

Rey is somehow related to Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).Three weeks after President Donald Trump issued an executive order temporarily stopping refugees from entering the country, a major evangelical refugee resettlement agency announced plans to shut down 5 of its 27 locations nationwide and lay off more than 100 staff members working there.

World Relief announced Wednesday evening that it would close offices in Boise, Idaho; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Glen Burnie, Maryland. These five locations had resettled 25,000 refugees.

“The unfortunate truth is that given the unprecedented nature of the global refugee crisis, there are simply more people than ever that need our support and our compassion,” said Tim Breene, CEO of World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals and one of nine agencies partnering with the government to resettle refugees.

Last year, World Relief took on its biggest caseload since 1999, only to go from settling about 45 refugees a day in the fall to drop to a halt under the temporary ban. As a result, the agency will cut 140 employees.

“How do we sustain our network?” World Relief president Scott Arbeiter asked in an interview with CT days before the executive order became official. “When you turn off the refugee flow completely for four months, that means you’re trying to carry all the infrastructure that you’ve developed over decades—great people with expertise and experience with these areas—how could we keep them on the payroll?”

Vickie Reddy, cofounder of We Welcome Refugees, shared similar concerns:

I can’t see how refugee resettlement offices will be able to survive any period of time where there is a moratorium on refugees being resettled. If offices around the country have to close their doors, that will be a tragedy. How will they then be ready again once the program restarts—if the program restarts?

Last week, more than 500 evangelical leaders signed an open letter decrying the ban and emphasizing how “compassion and security can coexist, as they have for decades.”

Supporters of the executive order on refugees believe the review of the refugee program would prevent admitting individuals with “hostile attitudes” toward America. Parts of the order are being challenged in court.

“This is has been a very sad day. A very sad several weeks,” tweeted Matthew Soerens, World Relief’s director of church mobilization. “Please be praying for my colleagues & those they have served who will be impacted.”

Soerens and three other Christian leaders recently shared their views with CT on whether the country’s refugee policy should prioritize persucted Christians, as Trump has suggested.

Advocates are urging New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to try to dissolve the Trump Organization over its business practices and the president’s continued ownership of it while in office. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)

A liberal advocacy group is urging New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, already a foe of President Trump, to investigate and consider revoking Trump’s business charter in New York for business practices that it argues have run afoul of state law.

Free Speech for People, one of the backers of a nascent campaign to try to impeach Trump, planned to deliver a 24-page letter Wednesday calling on Schneiderman to “investigate whether to bring proceeding to dissolve and revoke the charter of Trump Organization Inc.,” the New York-based company overseeing the president’s real estate, golf, hotel and other businesses that Trump founded and continues to own.

The group did not unearth any new information about Trump’s company. Instead, it dug up the company’s past legal infractions, such settlements over housing discrimination charges in the 1970s and fraud allegations at Trump University last year, and argued that Schneiderman ought to take action against the company now that Trump has become president and declined to sell his interests.

“By continuing to operate under Trump family ownership and control with President Trump in the White House, the Trump Organization flagrantly abuses its state-granted powers, contrary to the public policies of New York against corruption and conflicts of interest, and contrary to the U.S. Constitution,” the letter reads.

Ron Fein, legal director for the group, said that the combination of past legal abuses and current conflicts of interests constituted such a pattern of corporate misbehavior that the attorney general ought to revoke the company’s charter. Among Free Speech for People’s other efforts is a push to overturn the landmark Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.

“This action is identifying the ability of the attorney general of New York State, without needing permission from the U.S. Justice Department, without needing permission from the president, to use existing legal authority to investigate and possibly dissolve the Trump Organization,” Fein said.

A representative for Schneiderman issued a brief statement late Tuesday: “We will review the letter.” The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The letter marks the start of what could become a second legal attack on Trump generated from his continued ownership of a vast business empire while in office, following a suit filed last month by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. It alleges that because Trump-owned buildings take in rent, room rentals and other payments from foreign governments, the president has breached the emoluments clause of the Constitution.

Trump said before taking office that he would avoid conflicts of interest and potential violations of the emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting presents or payments from foreign governments, by putting his sons Don Jr. and Eric in charge of the companies and vowing to donate and profits from foreign clients to the U.S. Treasury.

But in Schneiderman, Free Speech for People identified a very public Democratic foe of Trump who has not backed down from previous opportunities to confront the president in court over his business dealings.

Despite accepting a campaign donation from Trump in his run for attorney general, Schneiderman was among the plaintiffs in the Trump University case in which Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement to end fraud cases against his defunct real estate seminar program.

Schneiderman also announced two weeks ago that he would join the lawsuit against the president’s executive order on immigration restrictions. He has also spoken out against proposed rolling back of consumer and investor protection laws by the Trump transition team.

Trump has repeatedly taken public shots at Schneiderman as well, calling him “failing” and a “lightweight” on Twitter who was “trying to extort me with a civil law suit.”

Unlike the foreign emoluments clause, which has never been used in court, Free Speech for People suggests Schneiderman employ a section of New York law that has been previously used to dissolve state corporations, including a fraudulent educational services company in 1994.

Two law firms, Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, as well as Clements & Pineault, led by former federal prosecutor Ben T. Clements, joined the group in writing the letter. Also joining is Fordham Law Professor and author Jed Shugerman.

Fein said Trump had been given ample opportunity to divest from his businesses and was advised by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to do so. When Trump declined, Fein said it was a sign that more aggressive action was needed.

“This was baked in the cake from his decision to ignore the best ethics advice that he was getting,” Fein said. “And we decided to bring this campaign to the attorney general’s attention precisely because we think it is important for the people of the State of New York, through their laws, to enforce those laws where the president is using his company to violate the fundamental principles of the republic.”

An earlier version of this mischaracterized the Citizens United case. This version has been corrected.Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships.

“I reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt’s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them — and shame on us if we didn’t,” said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee.

“Mr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a president-elect and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E.P.A.,” Mr. Carper said. “Like many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, ‘Did he mean it?’ With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it’s clear he did.”

For many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt’s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president’s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E.P.A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell’s coal-rich state.

Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about human-caused global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules.

“Pruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E.P.A.,” Mr. McConnell said. “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the real-world consequences of E.P.A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the long-term.”

Mr. McConnell added: “We should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years.”

Within days of Mr. Pruitt’s swearing-in, Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House’s plans said.

While it will be impossible to undo the rules immediately, the presidential signatures would give Mr. Pruitt his marching orders to commence the one- to two-year legal process of withdrawing the Obama-era climate rules and replacing them with looser, more industry-friendly rules. It is also possible that under Mr. Pruitt, the Trump administration could pursue the bold legal strategy of challenging the underlying legal requirement that the federal government regulate planet-warming greenhouse gases in the first place.

Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress’s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter

Flynn's departure raises more questions than it answers

The bombshell news from last night, which marked President Trump's 25th day in office: "Michael Flynn abruptly quit as President Donald Trump's national security adviser Monday night, hours after it emerged that the Justice Department informed the White House that it believed he could be subject to blackmail," per NBC News. "The resignation also came after previous disclosures that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other senior officials about his communications with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States. Pence repeated the misinformation in television appearances." NBC's Andrea Mitchell has more: "A senior official tells NBC News the president and top advisers have been "agonizing" over what to do about Flynn for days. The official, who was involved in the discussions, says the situation became unsustainable -- not because of any issue of being compromised by Russia — but because he had lied to the president and the vice president." All of this news raises more questions than answers.

When exactly did Team Trump first learn that Flynn misled them about the nature of his conversations with Russia's government?

The Washington Post says it was last month. "The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail, current and former U.S. officials said."

Did anyone else on Trump's team discuss sanctions on Russia? And did Trump authorize Flynn's discussions with Russia's ambassador?

Remember, the day after the Obama administration slapped extra sanctions on Russia's government for interfering in the 2016 election, Trump praised Russia's delay in responding to them. "Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!" he tweeted.

What does this say about the president's judgment?

Flynn — who we now have learned was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail — was Trump's pick to be this country's national security adviser. And this story wasn't the first strike against him and his management of the National Security Council. "Three weeks into the Trump administration, council staff members get up in the morning, read President Trump's Twitter posts and struggle to make policy to fit them. Most are kept in the dark about what Mr. Trump tells foreign leaders in his phone calls," the New York Times wrote over the weekend.

How much credibility does this administration have left?

At 4:00 pm ET yesterday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC's Steve Kornacki that the president had full confidence in Flynn, yet he resigned just hours later. (When NBC's Matt Lauer asked Conway on "Today" this morning if she was out of the loop, she replied that Trump "is a very loyal person," and that Flynn himself made the decision to resign.) On Friday, Trump denied that he had read the Washington Post's scoop that Flynn had indeed discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" (Does anyone believe that now?) And despite the administration's previous denials that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russians, we now know Team Trump was notified A MONTH AGO that Flynn was possibly misleading them.

A question for every member of Congress: Are you going to support a full investigation into arguably the biggest scandal involving a foreign government since Iran-Contra?

Considering everything we now know about this story — an incoming administration was having conversations with a foreign adversary, and not telling the truth about them — you have to go back 30 years to Iran-Contra to think of a comparable scandal. And folks, we're today on Day 26 of the Trump administration. Here's the question that should be posed to every lawmaker, Republican or Democrat: Are you going to support a full investigation into arguably the biggest political scandal involving a foreign government since Iran-Contra?

What were other new presidents doing on February 14?The Senate will use the procedural process known as budget reconciliation, which only requires 51 votes to pass in the Senate, to undertake the tax overhaul. While Republicans will use the first budget resolution in January to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the second will be used in the spring to cut taxes.

"We will do one later in the spring, which will largely be dedicated to tax reform." McConnell told reporters. "So they'll be two, and they will set up reconciliation follow on vehicles for us to address two very important issues the President-elect talked about and we all care about. "

McConnell said that the single biggest reasons jobs move overseas is that the U.S. tax structure "makes it very difficult in many instances to stay here."

McConnell's comments give a strong indication of where the GOP's priorities are at the moment with President-elect Trump. While House Republicans like HHS nominee Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) had hinted earlier this fall that a second budget reconciliation might include plans to overhaul Medicare. McConnell's message appears to be that a tax overhaul will come before Medicare changes.

In the Senate, there has been far more appetite to take on a tax overhaul rather than change Medicare. Senate Republicans have tried to play down any interest in changing the elderly health care program.

McConnell also voiced skepticism that a multi-trillion dollar infrastructure bill was a good idea or use of the GOP's time and resources, which could be a departure from Trump who has said infrastructure is a top priority.Stephanie Keith/Getty Images

The United States government is certain that Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi does not pose a security threat to the country. That’s why it granted Alshawi, an Iraqi, a visa to come to America and join his wife and children, who had already fled and resettled in Texas. (In Iraq, Alshawi’s family members were victims of an attempted kidnapping and a car bombing because Alshawi’s wife worked for a U.S. contractor.) On Friday, Alshawi boarded a flight to New York’s JFK International Airport. While he was in the air, Donald Trump signed an executive order prohibiting Iraqi refugees from entering the country. When Alshawi’s plane landed, reports the New York Times, agents from Customs and Border Protection boarded it and took him into custody. They prohibited Alshawi from contacting his attorneys, who were waiting for him at the airport. The attorneys asked a CBP agent who they should speak to in order to help their client.

“Mr. President,” a CBP agent responded. “Call Mr. Trump.”

As of Saturday afternoon, Alshawi is still being detained at JFK. He is one of multiple refugees—the government won’t say how many there are—with valid documents who is nevertheless being held at an airport. (Update, Jan. 29, 2017: Alshawi was released Saturday night.) Trump’s expansive executive order prevents refugees, migrants, and even green-card holders from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. (Reuters reports that green-card holders may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.) The government’s interpretation of the order has led to the immediate and indefinite detention of people who, until Friday, had every right to come into the country.

There are serious constitutional problems with Trump’s executive order as a whole, including its preference for one particular religion (Christianity) and its denigration of another (Islam). The courts will debate these questions over the coming months. But for Alshawi and others like him, there is a more immediate concern: a complete and total lack of due process. As a chilling American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit filed Saturday demonstrates, Trump’s executive order has led to the flagrantly unconstitutional detention of perfectly legal immigrants whose lone crime is their national origin and religion. It is not just morally wrong. It is illegal.

The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides basic procedural guarantees to individuals detained in the U.S., prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of liberty without “due process of law.” Alshawi arrived in the country lawfully carrying the requisite documentation. Pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, he now has a right to apply for asylum and have his claims processed by federal authorities. But the government did not do that. Instead, it instantly placed him in detention, without a hearing or any kind of judicial oversight, and barred him from speaking with his attorneys.

That is an unconstitutional deprivation of Alshawi’s liberty without due process of law. The federal government cannot indefinitely detain a lawful visitor without a hearing or any semblance of reasonable suspicion because the president signed an executive order. Nor, under the equal protection component of the amendment’s Due Process Clause, may the government discriminate against Alshawi because of his national origin or religion. Yet federal officers are currently ignoring these fundamental constitutional principles. And the entire illegal system is the handiwork of one man—Trump—acting far beyond the bounds of his executive authority. His is a government of men, not of laws, and it apparently has no compunction about locking up perceived enemies based solely on their identity. The very concept of due process emerged from a desire to limit the king’s ability to order unlawful arrests. It appears we are returning to the days when the head of state can detain purported threats without a whiff of evidence that they have broken a law.Illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker.

At some point during the murk of the 2016 presidential campaign, somewhere after the Judge Gonzalo Curiel affair but before the Hunger Games–themed Republican National Convention, I sat down to write an essay about rereading The Plot Against America in the age of Trump.

Alas, a quick Google search told me that the territory had already been covered. I shouldn’t have been surprised. The plot of Plot, in which the fascist sympathizer Charles Lindbergh ascends to the presidency on tailwinds of celebrity and America First populism, speaks with vivid and distressing clarity to the present moment. Philip Roth is not a science-fiction writer, but his novel is part of a long and sturdy tradition within sci-fi: the “alternate history.” Take some crucial moment in history and undo it or do it differently. The South wins; the Allies lose; the Black Death wipes out Europe and European influence. In Nisi Shawl’s sweeping Everfair, the history of the Belgian Congo is rewritten by the early discovery of steam technology; in Michael Chabon’s The Yiddish Policeman’s Union the Jews are given not Palestine, but a slice of Alaska.

For many of us, X happened on Nov. 8 of last year. Somehow, while we were refreshing Nate Silver and wondering how Biden was going to do at the State Department, we fell through a trapdoor into an alternate dimension. Some fiction writer, cackling at her keyboard, invented the “Comey Letter” and unwound the real true history of the Clinton administration.

Even as it begins, the Trump presidency feels like an absurd and highly unlikely counterfactual. “Yes, this is really happening, I’m becoming president,” said Alec Baldwin as SNL’s sour-faced POTUS, while a Scottish newspaper listed the upcoming inauguration as the first episode in a reboot of the Twilight Zone. But as long ago as last March, the Boston Globe editorialists offered a mock-up front page from “Trump’s America.” A warning message from a bad future.

Well, the future is here. We are about to find out—we are already finding out—what the world would look and feel like if Donald Trump became the president.

Since the election we’ve all read 100 thinkpieces about what the next four years might hold, but fiction has a special power to clarify, galvanize, prophesy, and warn. I asked some of my favorite writers to offer visions from the alternate history we are now entering, and over the coming days Slate will publish the resulting pieces: ten short stories, all set at some point during the Trump administration, beginning with “The Daylight Underground” by Héctor Tobar.Listen to Represent:

Both retired lieutenant generals have mixed records in the military, with years of success shadowed by dark episodes.

Serving the Obama administration after a decorated career, Flynn was ousted from a top intelligence role in 2014 and turned towards angry criticism of his former colleagues, sometimes on the Russian propaganda network RT.

Kellogg, 72, was born in Ohio and served 36 years in the military: in the army in Vietnam, as a special forces officer in Cambodia, and during the first Iraq war as chief of staff for the 82nd Airborne Division. Kellogg rose to command the airborne division from 1997 to 1998 and later came to national prominence when he served as chief operating officer for Baghdad’s provisional government through 2004 – a year of mistakes by the transitional administration that haunted Iraq through the next decade of war.

After his retirement, Kellogg joined a series of contracting firms including tech giant Oracle – the company gave him a leave of absence to help the Bush administration in Iraq. “I was given the opportunity to establish a homeland security business unit at Oracle,” he told the Washington Post in 2005, “based on the skills I developed in the military and on the value that information technology can bring to homeland security.”

Kellogg later joined another tech contractor, CACI, in 2005, and then left for a defense contractor, Cubic Defense, in 2009, where he was responsible for the firm’s “ground combat training business”. In March, after Kellogg joined Trump’s campaign as an adviser, the New York Times reported that the last defense contractor to employ the retired general “had no information on his whereabouts”.

The retired general has kept a low profile in the White House compared with his predecessor. He was granted a formal role in Trump’s transition team and later named chief of staff and executive secretary of the National Security Council, making him one military counterweight to an unusually prominent civilian on the council, Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon.

Although Trump may yet formalize Kellogg as his permanent adviser, rumors quickly began to spread on Monday night that another candidate was en route to the White House: retired general David Petraeus, the former CIA director who resigned in disgrace having admitted to giving classified information to his lover.Ta-Nehisi Coates; Toni Morrison

Ta-Nehisi Coates, the national correspondent for the Atlantic, is becoming the go-to guy on race relations for television bookers.

He has been getting near-unanimous praise for his new book "Between the World and Me," and Benjamin Wallace-Wells of New York magazine recalled on Sunday that he also won the endorsement that meant more than any other.

"Late this spring, the publisher Spiegel & Grau sent out advance copies of a new book by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a slim volume of 176 pages called Between the World and Me," Wallace-Wells wrote.

Advertisement

" 'Here is what I would like for you to know,' Coates writes in the book, addressed to his 14-year-old son. 'In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body — it is heritage.'

"The only endorsement he had wanted was the novelist Toni Morrison's. Neither he nor his editor, Christopher Jackson, knew Morrison, but they managed to get the galleys into her hands. Weeks later, Morrison's assistant sent Jackson an email with her reaction: 'I've been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died,' Morrison had written. 'Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates.' Baldwin died 28 years ago. Jackson forwarded the note to Coates, who sent back a one-word email: 'Man.' "

Wallace-Wells continued, "Morrison’s words were an anointing. They were also a weight. On the subject of black America, Baldwin had once been a compass — 'Jimmy's spirit,' the poet Amiri Baraka had said, eulogizing him, 'is the only truth which keeps us sane.'

Sponsored

"On the last Friday in June, the day after Morrison's endorsement was made public and then washed over Twitter, Coates sat down with me at a Morningside Heights bar and after some consideration ordered an IPA [India pale ale]. At six-foot-four, he towers over nearly everyone he meets, and to close the physical distance he tends to turtle his neck down, making himself smaller: 'A public persona but not a public person,' explained his father, Paul Coates.

"Ta-Nehisi said he thought Morrison's praise was essentially literary, about the echo of Baldwin's direct and exhortative prose in his own. The week before, The New Yorker's David Remnick had called the forthcoming book 'extraordinary,' and A. O. Scott of the New York Times would soon go further, calling it 'essential, like water or air.' The figure of the lonely radical writer is a common one. A writer who radicalizes the Establishment is more rare. 'When people who are not black are interested in what I do, frankly, I'm always surprised,' Coates said. 'I don't know if it’s my low expectations for white people or what.' . . ."

Wallace-Wells also describes an exchange at the White House between Coates and President Obama, and reports, "Coates is leaving the country. In a few weeks, he'll move to Paris with his wife and son for a year. Part of the attraction is simple pleasure.

"Part of it is the intellectual project of viewing state supremacy and race in another place, to discern whether America is truly exceptional or not. Part of it is the welcome exchange of one social mask for another: Because his French is not so smooth yet, he says, he is seen first as American in Paris rather than as black, and this is a relief. . . ."

"Time's Been Up for All These Slurs"

Native Journalists Confident That the R-Word Will Fall

Advertisement

Advertisement

When Tristan Ahtone was working in Arizona for Fronteras: The Changing America Desk, a multimedia collaboration among public radio stations, he came across the name of the Washington NFL football team. It made him uncomfortable. Actually, more than uncomfortable.

"For me, it makes me feel a little violated," he told the Native American Journalists Association conference on Saturday. "I don't want to work with newspapers that use that word."

Ahtone, a freelance reporter and treasurer of the association, complained to an editor that the news organization should not be using the R-word. The editors agreed, and Fronteras changed its policy, Ahtone said. He told the group, "When you get more Native people working in your newsroom, it's a lot harder to call them a racial slur."

Employing enough Native people to affect newsroom policy might be easier said than done. In newspapers and online newsrooms, the American Society of News Editors reported last year, only four-tenths of 1 percent of journalists are Native American. In the United States as a whole, just 1.7 percent identified as American Indian and Alaska Native in 2010, either alone or in combination with one or more other races, the Census Bureau reported [PDF].

Clearly, they will need allies. U.S. District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee is one. His ruling on Wednesday that the name of the Washington NFL team was not worthy of trademark protection helped to make for an unusually upbeat National Native Media Conference, which concluded Sunday in Arlington, Va. The air was filled with a feeling that this time, history was on their side.

"It's just a matter of time. Five-10-20 years down the road, what happened the other day will be seen as a steppingstone," said Christine Brennan, USA Today sports columnist. She joined Ahtone in the discussion of "Race, Journalism and Sports: The Dilemma of the Washington NFL Team Name."

Brennan is another ally. She does not use the word in her column and said that unlike "Blackhawks" or "Indians," the R-word is a slur. Brennan doubted that if a team name similarly included the N-word, newspapers would plead that they felt obligated to use whatever name the team chose.

"Time's been up for all these slurs," added Suzan Shown Harjo, longtime Native activist on mascot and other issues, and a former NAJA board member.

The ascendancy of millennials, with their more inclusive outlook; the accelerated moves to retire the Confederate battle flag; and the Supreme Court's ruling upholding same-sex marriage have contributed to a climate that, for "Change the Mascot" advocates, means vindication is at hand.

Amanda Blackhorse, a plaintiff in the trademark case, was a keynote speaker; Julian Castro, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a late addition to the program, added his support; and the awards ceremony heard from Jackson Haines and Tara Huber, the student managing editor and adviser, respectively, at the Playwickian of Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, Pa.

They won a prolonged battle with administrators — and also NAJA's Elias Boudinot Free Press Award — for their efforts to ban the name of their school mascot, the R-word, from the pages of their newspaper.

Yet the tide isn't turning without challenges, even such small ones as whether dropping the word means stories without it won't win attention from search engines. That's one reason that Vincent Schilling, a writer for the Indian Country Today Media Network, said from the audience that he still uses the word, even though he is "extremely offended" by it. "I use it so it's on Google," Schilling said of his stories. Moreover, he added, its deployment means that those searching for the term will find something negative about it.

Trademark lawyer Stephen R. Baird, another panelist, agreed that SEO (search engine optimization) is an important concern. When reporters wrote about a major development about use of the term, the story failed to trend on social media "because they were all using different names." Columnist Leonard Pitts Jr., for example, refers to "the Washington Slurs." Another columnist cites "the RG3s," after star quarterback Robert Griffin III.

(Perhaps there is a way to work the offensive term into the URL, suggested panelist Mark Memmott, NPR's supervising senior editor, standards and practices. That would register the story with the search engines without using the word in the text or headline.)

Last fall, Memmott issued an advisory to NPR staffers that use of the name of the NFL team will be "strictly limited to situations where it is absolutely integral to the meaning and spirit of the story being told.' . . . "

Advertisement

A turn in the discussion had Memmott exclaiming, "Somebody do that story!"

It was about delivering the final blow, despite team owner Dan Snyder's declaration that he will "never" change the name.

Mark Trahant, a past NAJA president and current board chairman of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, noted from the audience that corporate pressure helped to change South Carolina's stance toward display of the Confederate battle flag on the state Capitol grounds. Trahant asked why there hadn't been more pressure on the Washington team's corporate sponsors, such as Federal Express and Nike.

"It's a good business story and a good consumer story," Memmott said.

Harjo suggested that reporters investigate how many rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission were violated by the team's creation of an Original Americans Foundation to give financial and other support to Native American organizations. Harjo called it "bribery." Blackhorse said, "They are using our oppression against us."

On June 25, the Central Council Tlingit Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska said it was boycotting FedEx.

"The Juneau-based tribal organization announced Thursday that it has sent notice to all employees to stop using FedEx services, citing the national delivery company's sponsorship of the Washington Redskins football team," Leila Kheiry of KRBD-FM in Ketchikan, Alaska, reported then.

Kheiry added, "According to the Central Council, other tribes and tribal groups also are boycotting FedEx, including the Native American Rights Fund and National Congress of American Indians. . . ."

For obvious reasons, this is not a topic that FedEx is eager to discuss. "A message sent to FedEx public relations resulted in a written email statement," Kheiry wrote. "It says 'FedEx has closely followed the dialogue and difference of opinion regarding the Washington Redskins team name, but we continue to direct questions about the name to the franchise owner.' "

Still, in September, "Investors presented a shareholder floor proposal at FedEx Corporation's . . . annual meeting asking the company to 'take the steps necessary to drop or distance ties to the team, logos and/or stadium sponsorship until the Washington D.C. Football Team franchise abandons its degrading name,' " Trillium Asset Management reported at the time. "FedEx possesses the naming rights to the team's stadium, [FedEx Field], in Landover, MD through 2026.

"Speaking directly to senior leadership and the board, Susan White, Trust Director of the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin explained 'The Washington D.C. franchise's name, "Redskins," is a dehumanizing word with hateful connotations for Native American peoples and others concerned about human rights.

Advertisement

" 'We consider the Washington team name a racial slur, tracing back to colonial times when bounties were paid on a sliding scale for the skins of Native men, women and children, and traded like animal hides. The term did not describe actions that honored Indian peoples then and it still represents racism and genocide today for Native peoples.' . . ."

As he wrapped up the session on Saturday, Keith Woods, NPR's vice president for diversity in news and operations, made an observation that could almost be applied to this column. "We've been here for 90 minutes and have used the R-word only twice," Woods said. "But everybody knew what we were talking about."

Jason Begay Elected to Lead Native Journalists Association

Jason Begay, an assistant professor at the University of Montana School of Journalism in Missoula and director of Native American Journalism Projects there, was elected president of the Native American Journalists Association on Sunday.

Begay, Navajo, who was NAJA's treasurer, was elected without opposition by the NAJA board to succeed Mary Hudetz, editor of Native Peoples magazine.

"Mary has done such a good job," Begay, 39, told Journal-isms as the association concluded its annual convention in Arlington, Va., outside Washington. "Finances are a huge issue. Now we're on solid ground. We've got good momentum right now. Membership is higher than it has been in 10 years. I want to keep that going."

In a briefing at the Sunday morning membership meeting, Rebecca Landsberry, interim executive director, said membership had grown steadily from 232 in 2012 to 484 in 2015. Intel was the conference's major sponsor; attendance reached a record 372 attendees, including recruiters and speakers; the awards contest drew more than 530 entries, up from 275 in 2013; and the 10 student winners of Native American Journalism Fellowships produced Native Voice, the convention newspaper and online news source.

Native Voice will continue throughout the year, providing students with the opportunity for clips and focusing on "how Native Americans fit into the national discussion" during the 2016 presidential year, Begay said.

Native Americans remain at the bottom of many social indicators and have a keen interest in federal policies because they are heavily dependent on federal programs, he added.

At the association's awards banquet, Suzette Brewer of the Indian Country Today Media Network, who has written extensively on the Indian Child Welfare Act, became emotional as she accepted the NAJA Richard LaCourse/Gannett Foundation Al Neuharth Investigative Journalism Award.

The Indian Child Welfare Act, designed to end decades of unnecessary removals of Indian children from their homes and communities, is under assault.

Brewer's thank yous included "people who have lost their child. That is the hardest thing as a reporter, to maintain your objectivity with someone who has lost their child or grandchild who may never see them again." Brewer also thanked the "hundreds of adult adoptees" who cooperated for her stories.

Half of Indian Country is under 18, the reporter noted, one reason why it's important to preserve tribal sovereignty. Brewer wrote only last week of efforts by the adoption industry to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act.

"Every one is a target for Social Services. This really has to do with where we are going to be [as a people] in 10 years," Brewer said.

Elected to the board were Bryan Pollard, 46, Cherokee; Darren Brown, 49, Cochiti Pueblo and Choctaw; and Rob Capriccioso, 35, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. Board members selected Pollard as board vice president; Shannon Shaw-Duty, Osage, for another term as secretary; and Tristan Ahtone, Kiowa, who was vice president, as treasurer.

Pollard, who returns to the board, is executive editor of the Cherokee Phoenix in Tahlequah, Okla. Brown is a producer for Cheyenne and Arapaho Television (CATV 47) in Concho, Okla. Capriccioso is Washington bureau chief for Indian Country Today Media Network.

Brazil Paper's Use of Lynching Photo Stirs Debate

"The recent lynching of a 29-year-old black man by residents of São Luís on the northern coast of Brazil and the killing’s treatment in the country's news outlets has ignited a debate on how media cover and sensationalize extreme violence," Teresa Mioli reported Friday for the Knight Center for Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin.

Advertisement

"More broadly it launched a debate about race, crime, extrajudicial killings and impunity in the South American country.

"On July 6, residents of São Luis, the capital city of the state of Maranhão, tore off Cleidenilson Pereira da Silva's clothes, tied him to a post and beat him to death while also throwing stones and bottles, according to news reports. He and a teenager had been accused of attempting to rob a bar. The teenager was also beaten.

"Accompanying some news reports on the killing are close-up photos of Pereira da Silva still tied to the pole with spatterings of blood surrounding him. The image has been blurred over the area of his naked body. Close by, the handcuffed teenager is laying face-down, fully clothed.

"Much of the conversation has centered around the July 8 cover of the Rio de Janeiro newspaper Extra, which is part of Globo Group, Brazil’s largest media conglomerate.

"The cover features two images stacked on top of each other.

"The first is an image of the painting 'L’exécution de la Punition du Fouet' ('Execution of the Punishment of the Whip'), by Jean-Baptiste Debret, which shows a slave tied to a trunk being flogged while other men look on in a town square in the 1800s. It is one of many paintings Debret made during his visit to Brazil.

"The second image is a photo of Cleidenilsen Pereira da Silva, broken down and tied to a pole by rope. The photo is taken from behind the pole, so Cleindenilson’s face and body are mostly obscured.

"In both images, crowds stare at the men. . . ."

Former Memphis Anchor Still Outspoken as Council Chair

"Amid a growing national outcry against what many see as public symbols of white supremacy, the state of Tennessee on Monday honored one of its most controversial and infamous native sons: Nathan Bedford Forrest," Jessica Glenza reported for Britain's Guardian.

"As per a 1971 state law, Tennessee's Republican governor proclaimed 13 July Nathan Bedford Forrest Day. But a debate over how or whether to honor Forrest, a civil war cavalry general and slave trader and key figure in the founding of the Ku Klux Klan, has grown increasingly heated following the apparently racially motivated massacre of nine black Americans at Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, last month.

" 'Today means nothing to me, it means nothing to the people in this city,' said Myron Lowery, city council chairman in Memphis, where 63% of the city’s 653,000 residents are black. . . ."

Advertisement

Lowery, a councilman since 1991, might be familiar to those who know the history of black journalists.

In a 2009 profile of Lowery for the Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Marc Perrusquia wrote, "Lowery was prepared for a long career in education when a twist of fate brought him back to Memphis.

"In 1971, Dr. Hollis Price, the former president at LeMoyne who was working as urban affairs director for WMC-TV Channel 5, called Lowery and asked if he'd like to change careers. Lowery studied broadcasting that summer through a diversity program at Columbia University [a forerunner of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education] and that fall returned to Memphis as WMC's first full-time African-American reporter.

"Two years later he became weekend anchor and in 1976 began producing 'Minority Report,' an urban issues program on which he interviewed celebrities such as author Alex Haley, entertainers Eartha Kitt, Prince, Rick James and the Jackson 5, as well as numbers of local newsmakers.

"Despite his success, Lowery sued the station in 1981 alleging he was paid less than white employees and that he was bypassed for promotions.

"In 1987, U.S. District Judge Odell Horton called WMC's actions 'reprehensible,' and awarded Lowery $274,120. WMC planned to appeal but then settled to terms that included improved affirmative action programs at Channel 5 and 13 other radio and TV stations owned by then-parent company Scripps Howard Broadcasting.

Advertisement

"The six-year case included a public trial in which colleagues testified that Lowery didn't measure up and tended to stray from news department rules. Still, Lowery has no regrets.

" 'That settlement was beneficial to this entire community,' Lowery said, holding a law book that cites the case as a legal precedent. 'They're reading about me in law schools all over the country. It's a classic case about how not to discriminate in broadcast journalism.' . . .''

The now-City Council chair served briefly as interim mayor. While he has mellowed some over the years, he told Perrusquia in 2009, "I am intense. I fight for that which I believe in. Yes, I am mild-mannered and meek. But if you hit me on the wrong button, I will react the way I see best fits the situation.''

Glenza continued her report Monday for the Guardian, "The council voted unanimously to begin a legal process to exhume Forrest's remains from a city park, which until two years ago was named after the general. The city is also attempting to remove a statue of Forrest.

" 'It is a symbol of racism, of bigotry, and hatred — there's no need to honor a man that massacred people at Fort Pillow, there's no need to honor a man who received his millions of dollars and fame from being a slave-trader,' said Lowery, speaking passionately about the need to move the general's remains to Elmwood cemetery, where he was originally buried. . . ."

Smiley, on "Face the Nation," Blasts Trump Coverage

Was Donald Trump's June 16 comment that Mexican immigrants are "bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists" accorded more respect from the news media than a comparable comment from a black presidential candidate would be?

Activist and broadcast figure Tavis Smiley, host of the "Tavis Smiley Show" on PBS, said "yes" Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation."

"It's not just about pushing Trump back because he's wrong on the issue, again this is about moral conviction," Smiley said.

"Here is a question I want to just put out here, if a black presidential candidate had used the unrepentant Dylann Roof in Charleston, South Carolina, to bash every white male in the country the way this rich white elitist Donald Trump has used a murder in San Francisco to bash the entire undocumented worker community, would the media have [covered the] story the way they did?

"Would it have the legs that it's had? I'm telling you that it's the worst day I think — it's bad example, rather, of our profession in the way we've covered this Donald Trump story this week.

Advertisement

"This would not have happened if anybody else had been bashing an entire community the way that Donald Trump has. The media wouldn't have jumped on the story that way, they would have killed it."

Smiley went on to tell Jeffrey Goldberg, national correspondent for the Atlantic, "What we're talking about now, Jeffrey, though, is the politics of the way that Donald has done what he's done this week.

"What I'm talking about is the lack of moral consciousness on the part of those who cover this story for letting someone get away with pushing — hold on — pushing a narrative where the facts are incontrovertible. There is no link between undocumented workers and a spike in crime.

"And the fact that we've [covered] this story like it's a real issue is asinine. . . ."

Local Papers Heralded Internment Camps as Job Providers

"The way media portrays a story can often be a story in itself, especially with the way recent racial controversies have been covered, like police shootings of [African] Americans or the treatment of Muslims after September 11," Drexel University said in an announcement July 6.

"But how did media cover the incarceration of about 120,000 people of Japanese descent, two-thirds of them American citizens, who were forced to live in internment camps during World War Two — specifically, local community newspapers?

Advertisement

"It’s a question Ron Bishop, PhD, a professor and head of the Department of Communication at Drexel, answers in his new book, 'Community Newspapers and the Japanese-American Incarceration Camps: Community, Not Controversy,' published June 15.

"With coauthors and recent Drexel graduates Morgan Dudkewitz, Renee Daggett and Alissa Falcone, Bishop found that the rhetoric and journalistic approach of these local papers heralded the incarceration camps as part of the war effort and a potential economic boon, mainly because of the job opportunities to construct the camp and the work output of the evacuees.

" 'The equivalent today would be officials in a city or town talking about how great it would be for a major manufacturer or big box store to set up shop there,' Bishop said. 'It's a completely different narrative than we saw in coverage of the camps by the big West Coast dailies. They briefly — very briefly — gave Japanese-Americans the chance in articles to discuss their patriotism, but then, when the government fabricated news of spying, coverage turned ugly. . . ."

Short Takes

A new survey of more than 90 "born on the web" local news sites shows that "Two-thirds (66 percent) make $100,000 a year or less in annual revenue and more than half (53 percent) make $50,000 or less. About a quarter (24 percent) make between $100,000 and $500,000. Nine percent make more than $500,000," Michele McLellan reported Monday for the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

Bill Hutchinson has left the Daily News in New York after 17 years on the tabloid's dwindling rewrite desk, Mark Mooney reported Friday for CNNMoney.com. ". . . Hutchinson, 53, is joining the staff of the San Francisco Chronicle." Among other distinctions, Hutchinson is the author of "Sushi and Black-eyed Peas." The title "is a playful reference to his mixed heritage,"Laura Booth wrote for the News in 2012. "Hutchinson's father, William Sr., the cattle-truck-driving son of two Holy Rollers, 'insists he is nearly full-blooded Cherokee, [says] there was an Irishman in the woodpile and sometimes masquerades as Mexican.'

One area we’ve been investigating is the correlation between endpoint protection and infection rates. Back in version 14 of the Security Intelligence Report (SIRv14), we first published data on infection rates for PCs protected with fully up-to-date antimalware software in comparison to those that either had no antimalware software or software that was not on or fully current. We discovered that PCs are 5.5 times more likely to be infected if they aren’t protected with a fully up-to-date antimalware product.

This data drove the MMPC to a new tenet – get everyone protected – and led to some changes in Windows 8 to help ensure that as many people as possible are running real-time, up-to-date, antimalware software. Alas, we know that customers, even on Windows 8, are in an unprotected state, leaving their computers prone to infection. So, over the past six months we’ve been digging deeper in the data to learn more about unprotected PCs. We published our findings in version 17 of the Security Intelligence Report released today (SIRv17).

Here’s what we found. On Windows 8, it appears that the number one reason why people are unprotected is because their antimalware has gone into an expired state. Stated another way, more than one half of all unprotected Windows 8 PCs are in an unprotected state because they are running expired security software. An expired state happens when a trial version of an antimalware product has reached the end of the trial. The product may continue to inform you that you need to pay for the software to continue receiving updates, but it stops downloading updates that protect your PC. This often happens when you buy a PC from an online or local store and that PC is preloaded with lots of software.

People may believe that an antimalware product is still protecting them even if it hasn’t downloaded updates in a while. The data says otherwise. When we compared the infection rates on PCs with expired antimalware, we found that infection rates were nearly the same as PCs with no protection. The following chart shows the infection rate of PCs with expired antimalware products and other unprotected states, in comparison to a protected PC.

A PC with expired antimalware protection was nearly four times more likely to be infected with malware in comparison to a fully protected PC.

So we have more work ahead of us. First, we’ve been working with security software vendors in our MVI program to help them understand their impact on people that are left in an expired state. Since March, we have been providing monthly reports that show their percentage of unprotected customers, their infection rates and other information to help them keep their customers safer. We also made some updates in Windows 8.1 to help close the time gap on how long a person will be left in an expired state.

Lastly, we hope that the data in SIRv17 will demonstrate that people running expired software should not be lulled into thinking that an outdated security product will provide adequate protection. We urge people to upgrade to the paid version of their antimalware product, or download a free antimalware product, such as Microsoft Security Essentials or Windows Defender (which comes pre-installed on Windows 8.1 and Windows 8).

But at least for now, that is a price Republicans seem willing to pay. In effect, congressional Republicans have sought to compartmentalize Mr. Trump’s presidency, adopting a cafeteria-style approach. They reach for the more appealing offerings, such as the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, and avert their gaze from less appetizing or, to some, downright indefensible elements (America is not so different from Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia), which would have surely drawn relentless rebukes if uttered by President Barack Obama.

Some lawmakers take comfort knowing that the president’s behavior last year didn’t hurt their campaigns, and they have used the electoral result as a justification unto itself, suggesting — as Mr. Trump has constantly — that his campaign success validates his approach.

“He’s a unique personality, to be sure,” acknowledged Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip. “But he’s gotten this far the way he is, and I think that probably leads him to think, well, it’s working for him so far, so why change?”

And Republican lawmakers do not mind?

“As long as we’re able to get things done,” Mr. Cornyn said.

Individual Republican senators have criticized the president in mostly isolated cases, none more vocally than Senator John McCain of Arizona, who blasted the president’s comparison between Mr. Putin’s extrajudicial killings and American conduct, and recently expressed concerns about a military raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of an American commando and multiple civilians.

Often, the president has taken note — in brushback pitches that serve as warnings, if not to Mr. McCain, then to lawmakers who might emulate him.

“He’s been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore,” Mr. Trump wrote of Mr. McCain on Twitter on Thursday morning, calling to mind Mr. Trump’s suggestion during the campaign that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he had been captured in combat.

Hours later, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, went to the Senate floor and lamented the attacks on Mr. McCain and other Republicans.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, then followed — and seemed far less bothered.

“I personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully,” Mr. Hatch said of the president. “On the other hand, I kind of find him refreshing, that he doesn’t take any guff from anybody.”

Privately, lawmakers and members of their staffs have pleaded with Mr. Trump’s inner circle for more discipline from the president and his White House.

“We might talk to the vice president, but certainly not for public attribution,” Mr. Cornyn said of Vice President Mike Pence, who joins Senate Republicans once a week at their regular luncheons in the Capitol.

By and large, though, Republicans in Congress are treating Mr. Trump as an individual to be worked around in his own administration.

“I think we can get a lot done with the people around him,” Mr. McCain said, dismissing policy pronouncements from Mr. Trump that often differ from “the day before.”

Practically patting Mr. Trump on the head, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said, “If he pays attention to people like General Kelly when he’s doing a travel restriction and if he appoints people like Neil Gorsuch when he’s making appointments, he’ll be rewarded for that by all the praise, and maybe he’ll do more of it.” (Former Gen. John F. Kelly is the Homeland Security secretary.)

In hopes of repairing their relationship with Congress after the botched rollout of the travel ban, Mr. Trump’s aides have aggressively courted congressional Republicans. In addition to Mr. Pence with his weekly visits, Marc Short, Mr. Trump’s chief legislative liaison, has already become ubiquitous in the Capitol.

And powerful senators are enjoying significant attention: Mr. McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, said he had already had three conversations with Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, and a breakfast with Jim Mattis, the defense secretary. Mr. Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, had a 90-minute meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House. And Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the health and education panel, was invited to the White House last Thursday for lunch with Mr. Trump.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said there was “a high level of satisfaction” with the new White House, insisting that members cared little about “the daily tweets.”

The deflection is bicameral. When a reporter recently noted that the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, had often declined to weigh in on the “tweet of the day,” Mr. Ryan lit up.

“You got my talking points down already!” he said, before gently fielding a question about Mr. Trump’s attacks on the federal judge who halted his travel ban.

“Look, he’s not the first president to get frustrated with a ruling from a court,” Mr. Ryan said with a shrug.

While the détente between an anti-establishment president and its establishment-aligned leaders on Capitol Hill may seem wholly transactional, some Republicans say the fury on the left toward Mr. Trump along with the denunciations from many news outlets has helped forge his bond with the voters that he and congressional Republicans share, particularly in the conservative-dominated House.

When the president addressed congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia last month, Mr. Trump’s aside about news coverage — “nothing fair about the media,” he said with a sneer — earned perhaps the most enthusiastic applause.

“While it may upset The New York Times, Hollywood, the cast of ‘Hamilton’ and the groups marching in the streets, it is not upsetting to the constituents that elected these members and senators,” Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist, said of Mr. Trump’s behavior. “There is a feeling that if those groups are against you, you’re doing the right thing.”

More skeptical Republicans believe that lawmakers are deluding themselves if they treat Mr. Trump as a normal president — quirky but tolerable, like a colorful uncle at Thanksgiving dinner.

“They’re mostly ignoring him, humoring him occasionally while the rest of the family gets along fine, enjoys the turkey and watches the game,” said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard. “But he’s not just a bit player or a guest. He’s the president.”

And in the Capitol, he can never be ignored for long.

Strolling to a meeting last week, Mr. Corker was asked about the latest Trump controversy: The president had just attacked the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer denied a report by the Associated Press that President Donald Trump was considering using the National Guard to round up undocumented immigrants.

“That is 100 percent not true. It is false,” Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One, calling the AP’s report that Trump may call up as many as 100,000 troops “irresponsible.”

Spicer said he had no information about the origin of the report. The Associated Press cited an 11-page draft memo it said was written by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and said that the White House and Kelly’s agency did not respond to requests for comment.

“The Department is not considering mobilizing the National Guard,” Gillian Christensen, Department of Homeland Security acting press secretary, said in an email.

The National Guard says it hasn’t seen any proposal or where it came from.

“The National Guard Bureau is aware of the reports in the media regarding a proposal to activate 100,000 troops to support immigration missions,” Defense Department spokesman Major Jamie Davis said in an email. “However, we have received no official notification to execute any activations at this time.”

The AP said the memo was dated Jan. 25, addressed to the heads of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and was intended to supplement an executive order on immigration and border security that Trump issued the same day.

The memo envisions mobilizing Guard troops in the four states on the Mexican border and the seven states contiguous to them, as far north as Oregon and east to Arkansas, the AP said. Governors would be able to opt out of the mobilization, the AP said, citing the memo.

A Homeland Security Department official who insisted on anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the memo was an early idea that was never seriously considered.Story highlights Trump did not name a reason or offer any evidence about why the agencies that vet refugees

A Pew study found 99% of the nearly 12,600 Syrians granted refugee status last year were Muslims

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said in a new interview Friday that persecuted Christians will be given priority over other refugees seeking to enter the United States, saying they have been "horribly treated."

Speaking with the Christian Broadcasting Network , Trump said that it had been "impossible, or at least very tough" for Syrian Christians to enter the United States.

"If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair -- everybody was persecuted, in all fairness -- but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them."

Trump did not name a reason or offer any evidence about why the agencies that vet refugees, including the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, would have prioritized Muslim refugees over Christians.

According to a report by the non-partisan Pew Research Center, however, 99% of the nearly 12,600 Syrians granted refugee status last year were Muslims. Less than 1% were Christian. Syria's population is 87% Muslim and 10% Christian, according to the CIA World Fact Book.Photo by Sam Breach

Q. Should I stay or should I go?: I’ve been married to a wonderful woman and mother of our three kids for 25 years. Our kids are all adults now and have moved away. I’ve come to realize over the last five years that I don’t love my wife. I don’t hate her—she’s my best friend. But I have zero feelings for her. She’s put on 50 pounds over the last 10 years, which is a major turnoff. We haven’t had sex in five years due to this. I want to be happy, and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I just feel like I’m on the treadmill of life going nowhere real fast. What to do?

A: Wait, do you not love her anymore, or did she put on 50 pounds? Because those are two different things! I’m also a little unclear on how you can have “zero feelings” for someone you consider your best friend.

Subscribe to Prudie!

Let’s put aside the weight gain for the moment, which I think is a bit of a red herring, because you don’t say that if it weren’t for that, you’d be happily married. You think she’s wonderful, but the strongest feeling you can muster for her is “I don’t object to your continued existence.” You haven’t slept together in five years, you feel like you’re going nowhere, but you don’t want to hurt her feelings.

I think you are going to have to hurt them, unfortunately. You do not love your wife, you do not want to sleep with her, and you do not want to be married to her any longer. It’s a painful truth, and you should try to tell her as kindly and as sensitively as you can, but you’re not doing her any favors by pretending to have romantic feelings you no longer possess. I don’t see a lot of hope for this marriage to turn around, but maybe a jolt of honesty will help the two of you figure out if there’s any way for the two of you to work things out, or whether it’s time to part.

Q. Insensitive Christmas faux pas: I don’t like holidays, but there’s somewhat of a custom in my office of buying group presents for our boss. This year, I decided to send an email to the group asking who wants to participate. Then I did something strange last week. A man in our office was hanging stockings on everyone’s cubicle. He bothered one woman, and when he got to my cubicle I brusquely said, “I don’t want a stocking on my cube because I’m Jewish,” which is totally untrue. I have no idea why that came out of my mouth, but this isn’t the first time a pointless lie has emerged without passing through my brain. I remembered afterward that my cube-neighbor is an Orthodox Jew and knows that I’m not Jewish in any way, and she’s also in my group. I’m realizing my position on Christmas is so logically inconsistent and indefensible that I just come off looking so bad and insensitive and now I feel bad about everything. Should I apologize to my cube-neighbor?

A: This is a first for me! I’ve never been in your exact situation, but I’ve certainly told a strange, unhelpful lie just to get out of being taken by surprise before, so I feel your embarrassment keenly. I am genuinely not sure what you should do, so I’m going to open this up to the readers and see if anyone else has some helpful suggestions. How do you tell someone you lied about being Jewish? Should you say anything at all? What if no one else heard you? What say you, readers?

Q. We can’t even talk about talking about issues: My boyfriend of two years is smart, successful, attractive, and fun to be around when things are good. My problem is that every conversation I try to have about something that is bothering me in our relationship ends the same way—with him spiraling into a pattern of negative thoughts and me trying to convince him he is not a horrible person. The original issue is never resolved. No matter how nicely I try to phrase things, he sees the smallest suggestions of ways he can support me better as criticism worthy of a day’s worth of moping. Our last conversation like this was literally about trying to find a way to talk through issues without his shutting down. Is this hopeless?

A: I think so. It may be that he’s in deep emotional distress and needs help; it may be that he is emotionally manipulative and has found a way to make you feel guilty for ever criticizing him. It sounds like he might benefit enormously from therapy and possibly additional treatment from this anxiety of his, and I hope you can encourage him to seek it out. But if he’s not taking any steps to address these emotional crises and is incapable of listening to the mildest of criticism about your relationship, I don’t see much of a romantic future for the two of you.

Q. Oh, brother!: My brother recently divorced his wife of 30 years. They have two adult children who are very close to their mother. I have continued my friendship with my niece and nephew’s mother while supporting my brother and his reasons for the divorce. My brother is upset with me and says that by continuing to be friends with his ex-wife I am not supporting him. He doesn’t want to have anything to do with me. I feel I did not divorce her, and I know my niece and nephew would be very hurt if I were to ignore their mother. My brother has remarried and moved three hours away while his ex-wife lives nearby. How do I explain to him why he is wrong to expect me to turn my back on his ex-wife? If he is happily married shouldn’t he “let it go”? Why can’t I love both him and his ex-wife?

A: I think telling him what you’ve just told me—”I did not divorce your ex-wife, and I cannot ignore the mother of my niece and nephew; I love and support you, but I am not going to cut your ex out of my life just because you’ve gotten remarried” is an honest, loving response.

Q. Re: Insensitive Christmas faux pas: How hard is it to say, “I was finding him obnoxious, I said ‘I’m Jewish’ to scare him off because I get stupid under stress. I really meant no disrespect.”

A: Option the first!

Advertisement



Q. Re: Insensitive Christmas faux pas: I think you should just explain your intentions in person to the Orthodox friend, and in an email follow-up if you already sent one. It seems like your intention was to do something nice for the boss in the holiday season, but also make it clear that there are good reasons not to force Christian traditions on others. Your lie seems actually well-intended: You made a point without passing the blame to someone else (you didn’t say “No, because so-and-so is Jewish”), which might have made that specific person uncomfortable.

A: Option the second!

Q. Re: Insensitive Christmas faux pas: Your cubemate probably doesn’t even remember what you said. If they are upset about it, they can come to you. The bigger issue is your self-admitted lying, maybe work to get a handle on that and let this one go? It was probably pretty obvious you were making an excuse not to have something hung in your cube.

A: Option the third!

Q. Love him but hate her: My husband’s best friend got his girlfriend pregnant. I adore him and despise her. It is a mutual consensus that she manipulated and lied and cheated her way into his life, a single mother who got herself kicked out of her home and moved in with him just months after they started dating. She had no car and lost her job. She began having her daughter call him daddy within a year and bragged about all the stuff “they’re” doing on his dime. She’s a leech, and I don’t agree with her decision-making as a woman or a mother. Just a few weeks ago he was planning on breaking up with her but is now looking at marriage because she’s pregnant. Socially, I can’t stand to even face her direction. How do I support my friend when all I can think about is how awful this may turn out?

A: I’m not sure if this woman is as bad as you say; if I tilt my head and look at your description from a slightly different angle, she sounds like a single mother who lost her job and home in quick succession, found a boyfriend who makes her young daughter feel so comfortable she thinks of him as a father, and enjoys spending time together as a family. It’s certainly possible that she’s manipulative, but it sounds as if you think that her being a single mother is a character flaw on par with being a liar.

If you want to support your friend, let him know that you’re here for him no matter what he decides to do, and find a way to face her direction at social events without falling to pieces. You don’t have to like her, and you don’t have to befriend her, but you do owe her the bare minimum of a polite “Hello, how’s it going?” when you run into her at a party.

Q. Re: Christmas faux pas: Next time you find yourself in this and any other situation, know that it is OK to say “no” and not feel the need to explain. When asked why after I say no to someone, I say, “My no is a complete sentence.” Funny how rare it is we get asked, “But, why?” when we say yes.

A: Yes.

Q. Ask for a check?: When my (now second-grade) daughter was in kindergarten, a classmate of hers tragically passed away after a sudden illness. This girl’s mother has remained heavily involved with the school community, coming to all the kids’ performances and presentations and hanging out with the moms at parent events. We love having her, but there’s currently a debate over whether or not it would be appropriate to ask her to give to the school’s parent fund. Generally we ask all current parents to pledge some small amount to support school extracurriculars. This mother doesn’t have other children attending the school (her other kids are younger), but is a part of the parent community. What do you think?

A: Don’t ask her to give money.

Q. Joining the family for Christmas: I had a stroke two years ago and can no longer drive or walk well, and I have a service dog to help me now. Since my sister hosts all the holidays at her home, a three-hour drive from me, I have not attend a family gathering in a while. And sad to say, no one comes out here to see me. My sister has decided that I will take the train halfway there, get picked up by my brother and brought to her house. But no service dog. I don’t want to go, but I do want to go. I just don’t want to be on the train without my SD. Help me find the words to say no without insulting her?

A: I’m so sorry that your family’s response to your stroke has been largely to ignore and dismiss you. I can’t imagine asking a relative to leave their medically necessary service dog at home. It doesn’t sound like anyone has life-threatening allergies, and I think you’re right not to want to attend if your dog isn’t welcome. “I’m sorry, but I can’t get around without my service dog. I’d love to spend the holidays with you, but it’s not safe for me to travel without him/her.” Here’s hoping your sister has a change of heart.

Q. Re: Should I stay or should I go?: I was the same position as the letter writer. Married to my wife 25 years, three kids (slightly younger than his). I recall being in a similar situation a few years ago (no romantic feelings, lack of interest in her sexually, etc.). I contributed to this situation; I was at least 50 percent of the problem. My recommendation would be some counseling with a focus on what you can do. I realized that I wasn’t the same young/strapping person from my late 20s. I realized that discarding a 25-year relationship (in the hopes of trading that in for something new) was risky for me and would hurt all the members of my family. I focused on rebuilding the relationship, and I’m very grateful I did. Running away is the easy way out (and very short-term focused).Saul Loeb/Getty Images

The Trump administration is in chaos. The resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser hasn’t put an end to questions about Trumpworld’s ties to Russian intelligence. If anything, it’s spurred calls for further investigation, and not just among Democrats. Hawkish Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are pressing for more details on what exactly Flynn discussed with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and a few of their GOP colleagues, including Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, are tentatively joining in. Most Republicans, though, have yet to back an independent investigation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan seem to be hoping that Russia questions will go away of their own accord. And that’s just not going to happen. As saturation coverage of Russia-related leaks continues, it seems likely that more and more congressional Republicans will either distance themselves from Trump himself or work with the Trump White House to find scapegoats.

Amidst the chaos, some of Trump’s populist allies are turning on Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, whom they see as an ineffectual weakling. Other Republicans are hoping that the president will get rid of Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Kellyanne Conway, whom they see as enablers who egg Trump on when they should be giving him sound advice. According to this line of thinking, a complete reset would give President Trump a fighting chance of making it through a wave of Russia allegations, which he could blame on the incompetence of his initial wave of advisers.

What might a complete reset look like? The first and most important step would be for Trump to choose his battles. Right now, the administration is fighting on every front: against a bipartisan national security establishment that resents Trump’s recklessness and his Russophilia, a press corps that smells scandal, and a Democratic Party that’s united in opposition to pretty much all of his policies. On top of that, Trump has to placate elite Republicans who see him as a loose cannon who can’t be relied upon to deliver a pro-business agenda. Even if Trump were surrounded by an army of experienced geniuses, dealing with these various challenges would be daunting. And Trump is not surrounded by an army of experienced geniuses.

One course of action would be for Trump to double down on his war against America’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the hopes of plugging leaks. The trouble is that going this route would consume Trump’s entire presidency, and it would almost certainly backfire, leading to even more leaking to the press, which would in turn strengthen the hand of Trump’s enemies. The alternative is for the president to appoint a more conventional figure as national security adviser, as he seems ready to do, defer to widely respected figures like Defense Secretary James Mattis, and stop tweeting about foreign and defense policy altogether. Trump’s main foreign policy pitch was that he’d keep the United States out of major wars and that he’d demand that U.S. allies do more to share in the burden of paying for their defense. All of that is perfectly compatible with taking a more cautious, measured approach that doesn’t alienate the intelligence community. Are there downsides to this approach? Of course. It may well be the case that the intelligence community needs to be shaken up. It just so happens that Trump is not the right man for the job.

If President Trump became more deferential on foreign and defense policy, he could focus on domestic policy, where his best bet is to govern as a Mr. Fix-It who can get things done. In October, Luke Thompson made the case in National Review that Trump was less a populist than a centrist who believed that all problems could be solved if only you put the right technocrats in charge:

In substance, Trump could not be farther from a true populist such as William Jennings Bryan. Trump never promises to crush disposable elites. Quite to the contrary, Trump’s brief has always been that the particular set of elites running America today have failed to do their job as elites. They are weak, stupid, and ineffective. Trump promises to be a better, tougher, more successful elite. He’s “a negotiator,” after all. This is why Jon Huntsman Jr. rushed to endorse Trump but a vanishingly small share of Bernie Sanders’s supporters has done likewise. Trump preaches a changing of the guard, not a political revolution.

That analysis helps explain why the first weeks of his presidency have been such a political disaster: Trump has been coming across as a revolutionary, not as a smart businessman who could, say, fix the Oroville Dam.

If Trump were indeed to go this route, he could do worse than installing Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council, as his new chief of staff. Though the president hasn’t known Cohn for long, the former Goldman Sachs executive has already amassed a great deal of influence. Among other things, Cohn has been leading the charge on tax reform and overhauling the Affordable Care Act. Strikingly, he’s suggested that in crafting the Trump administration’s tax reform road map, he and his colleagues were not particularly interested in cutting taxes on high-income households. That would put the Trump White House at odds not only with the Trump campaign’s somewhat fanciful tax reform proposal but also with Republicans in Congress.The disorder deepened in the Trump White House on Thursday, as the president’s pick to succeed retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser turned down the job. Trump had selected Vice Adm. Robert Harward to fill the national security role vacated by Flynn, but, CBS News reports , a clash over how the National Security Council would be staffed led to Harward withdrawing his name from consideration.

The Financial Times reports, however, that Trump is not done trying to coax Harward to join the administration and is trying “to change his mind after the retired admiral tapped for the role told the US president that he could not accept the White House position, according to two people familiar with the situation.”5482899

The New York Times published a story Tuesday night claiming that there was contact between associates of Donald Trump and Russian intelligence officials during the presidential race. While the story states that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has found no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and essentially is a rehash of a previous story, journalists have gone bonkers over it.

The Times story, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence,” cites four current and former American officials saying that phone records and intercepted calls show contact between Trump campaign officials and associates of the president with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.

Despite the bombshell headline, the story includes several caveats. The Times reporters wrote that intelligence officials have found no evidence of cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, and that “it is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself.”

The article identifies former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and longtime Trump associate Roger Stone as being looked at by the FBI. Manafort denied the validity of the story. He told The Times, “This is absurd. I have no idea what this is referring to. I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.”

Stone did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller request for comment. White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied Tuesday that there was any contact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the election.

A Times story which two of the same writers, Michael Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo, are credited for from January includes most of the same claims as the piece Tuesday night. The January story titled “Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry Into Trump Associates,” also said that law enforcement and intelligence agencies are looking at intercepted communications between associates of Trump and Russian officials.

The story similarly identifies Manafort, Stone, and Page as being under scrutiny and includes similar caveats. “It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself,” the January article states. It later adds, “The investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing, the officials said.”

Despite these facts, below is how journalists have responded to the newly published story.

‘Holy moly,” Los Angeles Times national reporter Matt Pearce tweeted.

Dan Rather, who was brought down by false reporting about George W. Bush’s military record, wrote on Facebook, “Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now.”

Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin tweeted, “Shoes keep dropping…how bad does this get?”

Ashley Feinberg, a writer for Gizmodo, tweeted, “It is fucking insane that Trump is not being impeached.”

Daily Beast senior editor Michael Weiss wrote, “Shortest. Presidency. Ever.”

David Rothkopf, who is the CEO and editor of the company which publishes Foreign Policy magazine, tweeted, “We are at turning point in Kremlingate story, ladies & gentlemen. Trump admin compromised for as long as it remains.”Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

Michael Flynn resigned this week as President Trump’s national security adviser after it became apparent that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about a conversation he had with a Russian diplomat about U.S. sanctions. Since such communication came before Trump was sworn in—and therefore before Flynn was officially on the job—it appeared to violate an obscure, centuries-old statue known as the Logan Act that bars private citizens from interfering in diplomatic matters. What seems to have cost Flynn his job, however, was not the communication itself but the embarrassment his attempted cover-up caused the White House.

It now appears Flynn may have lied to more than the White House about what he discussed with Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak in a conversation that was captured on a routine wiretap of diplomats’ calls. The Washington Post reports:

Former national security adviser Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U.S. officials said.

Flynn never appeared to be in any real jeopardy of being punished under the Logan Act, and congressional Republicans have to date shown no interest in pursuing the matter any further. But lying to the FBI is a felony, and doing that is a bigger deal than violating a little-known statute from 1799. Theoretically, Flynn’s lie to the feds could open him up to criminal charges—which would be more than a touch ironic given Flynn’s penchant for leading “lock her up” chants directed at Hillary Clinton during the campaign.

Still, prosecution seems unlikely. The power to prosecute Flynn ultimately lies with the Justice Department, which is headed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in turn reports to Trump. During his press conference on Thursday—during which he said a number of other crazed, baffling, and outrageous things—the president offered a strong, albeit not logically sound, defense of Flynn. “I don’t think he did anything wrong,” Trump said. “If anything, he did something right.”Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt appeared before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for his confirmation hearing Jan. 18 to lead the EPA. Reuters

Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has sued the Environmental Protection Agency in defense of fossil fuel interests more than a dozen times, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate on Friday to lead the EPA, despite a state court order Friday demanding he turn over some 2,600 emails withheld from an open records request.

Democrats have fiercely opposed Pruitt's nomination – at one point boycotting a committee vote on the nominee – but Republicans hold a firm 52-48 majority in the Senate, and Pruitt easily cleared a procedural vote on his confirmation Thursday.

Only one Republican, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, has said she would vote against Pruitt's nomination, citing the attorney general's opposition to federal environmental regulations that set limits of greenhouse gases or mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.

However, Democrats Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, whose states of West Virginia and North Dakota heavily rely on fossil fuels, have said they would support Pruitt, stating that his lawsuits have pushed against federal overreach by the EPA.

The vote is set to come hours after Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons, of the District Court in Oklahoma County, ordered the state attorney general's office to turn over thousands of emails to comply with multiple public records requests dating to January 2015.

Those requests, filed by the Center for Media and Democracy, a left-leaning media watchdog, sought correspondence between Pruitt's office and fossil fuel titans such as Devon Energy and Peabody Energy, as well as industry groups like Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute and conservative organizations like the Republican Attorneys General Association.

A Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by the New York Times in 2014 – which relied in part on Pruitt's email correspondence – found that fracking rules, as well as many of the letters Pruitt sent to the EPA, Interior Department and White House in opposition to environmental regulations, had in fact been drafted by energy industry lobbyists and simply passed off by Pruitt as his own.

The investigation also detailed how Pruitt – who has questioned the extent of human's role fueling climate change – became a key player in what the Times described as a "secretive alliance" of energy firms and attorneys general, drawing close to oil baron Harold Hamm, chief executive of one of the biggest oil and gas drilling companies in Oklahoma and a confidante of President Donald Trump.

Pruitt's office initially provided about 400 emails, but withheld another 2,600. The Center for Media and Democracy, represented by the ACLU, filed a lawsuit last week alleging that the attorney general's office was not complying with the requests.

Judge Timmons, in her ruling, concluded that there was "no reasonable explanation" why the emails were not turned over, adding "there was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested."

Senate Democrats who oppose Pruitt's nomination and often cited both the Times investigation and the withheld emails argued that the court's decision presented yet another reason to delay if not stand against the confirmation vote.

"Despite my repeated warnings, the majority insists on forcing Mr. Pruitt through the Senate without complete information. It is regrettable that they refuse to wait for the release of these documents before voting on Mr. Pruitt's nomination," Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. "A judge in Oklahoma has seen enough to determine that the public should have access to these documents. It would be wholly irresponsible to vote on this nominee this week knowing that we don't have the full picture."

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, pointing to the judge's ruling, also called for Friday's expected vote to be postponed.The F.B.I. declined to comment. The White House also declined to comment Tuesday night, but earlier in the day, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump’s previous comments that nobody from his campaign had contact with Russian officials before the election.

“There’s nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period,” Mr. Spicer said in response to a question.

Two days after the election in November, Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy Russian foreign minister, said “there were contacts” during the campaign between Russian officials and Mr. Trump’s team.

“Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,” Mr. Ryabkov told Russia’s Interfax news agency.

The Trump transition team denied Mr. Ryabkov’s statement. “This is not accurate,” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said at the time.

The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed.

The F.B.I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative; and Mr. Flynn.

All of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials.

As part of the inquiry, the F.B.I. is also trying to assess the credibility of the information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative. The dossier contained a raft of allegations of a broad conspiracy between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government. It also included unsubstantiated claims that the Russians had embarrassing videos that could be used to blackmail Mr. Trump.

The F.B.I. has spent several months investigating the leads in the dossier, but has yet to confirm any of its most explosive claims.

Senior F.B.I. officials believe that the former British intelligence officer who compiled the dossier, Christopher Steele, has a credible track record, and he briefed investigators last year about how he obtained the information. One American law enforcement official said that F.B.I. agents had made contact with some of Mr. Steele’s sources.

The agency’s investigation of Mr. Manafort began last spring as an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country’s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has focused on why he was in such close contact with Russian and Ukrainian intelligence officials.

The bureau did not have enough evidence to obtain a warrant for a wiretap of Mr. Manafort’s communications, but it had the N.S.A. scrutinize the communications of Ukrainian officials he had met.

The F.B.I. investigation is proceeding at the same time that separate investigations into Russian interference in the election are gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. Those investigations, by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, are examining not only the Russian hacking but also any contacts that Mr. Trump’s team had with Russian officials during the campaign.

On Tuesday, top Republican lawmakers said that Mr. Flynn should be one focus of the investigation, and that he should be called to testify before Congress. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the news about Mr. Flynn underscored “how many questions still remain unanswered to the American people more than three months after Election Day, including who was aware of what, and when.”

Mr. Warner said Mr. Flynn’s resignation would not stop the committee “from continuing to investigate General Flynn, or any other campaign official who may have had inappropriate and improper contacts with Russian officials prior to the election.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

“Deep state” officials are withholding intelligence from President Donald Trump, despite the fact that he is the nation’s commander-in-chief, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal published Wednesday evening.

Journal reporters Shane Harris and Carol E. Lee cite “current and former officials” who say that “U.S. intelligence officials have withheld sensitive intelligence from President Donald Trump because they are concerned it could be leaked or compromised.”

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The intelligence officials who are withholding the information are doing so because they fear that Trump could leak secrets to Russia, or because of political battles with the president, according to the anonymous sources cited in the Journal report.

While the White House told the Journal that it does not believe agencies are withholding information, theoretically there would be no way for White House officials to know. The Office of Director of National Intelligence also disputed the claims.

But if the report is true, it would compound growing suspicions that intelligence agencies are leaking classified information illegally to media outlets to damage and confuse the Trump administration.

On Wednesday, former CIA officer and 2016 presidential candidate Evan McMullin declared on CNN and Twitter that it was right for intelligence officials to leak illegally, because they had sworn an oath to protect the Constitution and the country. He described the president as a “security threat.”

The unfolding crisis is the most serious challenge to the Trump administration, still in its infancy. But it is also quickly enveloping the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central Intelligence Agency as well, calling their public credibility into question.

CANCEL OKBack when I wrote the original essay, it seemed to resonate with people from a wide range of backgrounds. The most common positive response came from young people who felt alienated among their peers, unsatisfied by the hopeless swirl of pop culture references and cleverly sarcastic chatter that surrounded them. There were also quite a few hard-core leftists who wrote in support, lamenting the lack of serious engagement in political life in contemporary America. They understood that forwarding a jeering meme to people who agreed with you did not constitute political action. The final major cohort consisted of moderate conservatives and what we might call “conservative hippies” — people interested in the preservation of the past, of traditions, of manners and of family, but who also advocate peace, equality, compassion, humility and environmental stewardship. The fact that my thesis seemed to have appeal across party lines reassured me that a new post-ironic age might be on the horizon.

I wrote back in 2012, “Fundamentalists are never ironists; dictators are never ironists; people who move things in the political landscape, regardless of the sides they choose, are never ironists.” Some readers, looking at only the first two clauses, took this to mean that being an ironist is a good thing; it means you will never be a fundamentalist or a dictator. However, the second half of the sentence gets to the core of the proposition: A certain kind of seriousness is the precondition for the ascent to power. It is hard to imagine someone who has taken on the veil of irony holding a powerful role in any government. While Salena Zito’s oft-quoted article in The Atlantic, “Taking Trump Seriously, Not Literally,” suggested that the Republican nominee should not be taken at his word, he is hardly an ironist. Preferable terms might be a reality-show actor, a salesman or simply a liar.

In our smugness and self-assuredness, many of us laughed off Trump and his supporters throughout the campaign, refusing to take them seriously. We lampooned their mobilization of what we saw as a hopeless, hate-filled movement. But the fact that we have just elected an American Berlusconi has wiped the smirks off our faces. What will we do with our newfound sobriety? At the very least, we are called to approach our circumstances with a renewed — and, I believe, ultimately beneficial — seriousness.

There are at least two types of seriousness with which our current circumstances might be answered, two ways of facing the world without the slightest trace of sarcasm or playful duplicity. The first — represented by our president-elect, who seems incapable of laughter, and some of his apologists — is the bad kind, embodied by the thirst for profit or by apocalypse fetishism, joyless ideology, and even cruelty. It is a punitive seriousness, a burn-it-all-down ethics that favors revenge over reconciliation. This is the reigning type of seriousness.

There is, however, another kind, a seriousness that is calm, diligent, and — dare I say — joyful in its efforts to defend principles like justice, solidarity, and peace. We might even describe it as monastic in nature. Incorrigibly optimistic, I think this could be a cause that we, the lost children of the Enlightenment, were lacking: to recover that kind of seriousness.

The postmodern era left us despondent and skeptical, prone to toy idly with old forms and make fun of the idiocy of some of our forebears. If religion and other foundational institutions that have lost their symbolic capital over the centuries left a seemingly unfillable void, it might come as a relief for us to realize that there actually are values that deserve to be defended, values that have become glaringly clear in the wake of the election. Young people, and the more hopeful among us, see that convictions are still possible. There is a reason to unnumb oneself from the stupor of dumb media and listicle listlessness. Life has a new, much-needed urgency that it lacked before for too many.

In “Under Western Eyes,” Joseph Conrad describes the good kind of seriousness in his own terms: “[W]omen, children, and revolutionists hate irony, which is the negation of all saving instincts, of all faith, of all devotion, of all action.” The “saving instincts” Conrad describes will be essential for those just waking up from the ironic dream.

It has been inspiring to watch Generation Z and young millennials whose political consciousness seems to tend toward the good kind of seriousness. The election results have injected several important movements — Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, the environmental movement, feminism, L.G.B.T. action, worker and graduate student unions, and certain strands of populism — with a new binding seriousness, which will hopefully last into the midterm elections, into 2020, and beyond. We should acknowledge that these micromovements are iterations of one larger movement whose momentum our newfound seriousness could strengthen.

It is essential, however, to make sure that the good kind of seriousness — steady, good-hearted, good-willed — does not slide back into moral smugness or certainty, and that the fascistic thinking and dogmatism against which we retaliated with irony does not become our own signature. If we do, and trust our “saving instincts,” we could potentially avoid lapsing into the dangerous cynicism that characterized our most recent Age of Irony.Detained Dreamer's Lawyers Say Government Doctored Document to Justify False Gang Affiliation

Daniel Ramirez Medina's lawyers say the government doctored his request to be removed from the Northwest Detention Center's gang unit.



Lawyers for Daniel Ramirez Medina, the 23-year-old, twice-authorized Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) recipient who was scooped up by immigration enforcement near Seattle last week, say that government officials doctored a legal document at the Northwest Detention Center in an attempt to prove that Ramirez Medina belonged to a gang.

The allegation of government misconduct is outlined in a brief filed by Ramirez Medina's lawyers in US District Court in Seattle. The lawyers say that when Ramirez Medina—who has been detained inside the Tacoma's Northwest Detention Center's gang unit for a week—tried to petition to be removed from the gang unit, part of his written petition was erased.

The brief states Ramirez Medina originally wrote: “I came in and the officers said I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform. I do not have a criminal history and I’m not affiliated with any gangs.”

But according to an additional declaration filed to the court, the statement returned to Medina by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials five days later says: "I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform. I do not have a criminal history and I’m not affiliated with any gangs.”

The document filed to the court bears clear signs of erased words. (See the image above.)

"What began, I thought, as a mistake in bringing Daniel in has turned into a bogus operation that is attempting to railroad him and violate the sacred program that the DACA represents," lawyer Mark Rosenbaum told reporters on a conference call this evening. "It is one of the most serious examples of governmental misconduct that I have come across in my 40 years of practice."

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After Ramirez Medina's arrest during an immigration raid targeting a family member last week, ICE put out a statement claiming that Ramirez Medina was a "self-admitted gang member." Ramirez Medina's lawyers denied that their client ever said he was affiliated with a gang; they added that he had been pressured to say he was (but resisted) while in detention.

On Wednesday, the Seattle Times reported that the accusation of gang affiliation may have stemmed from a tattoo on Ramirez Medina's forearm with a nautical star and the name of his hometown.

According to e-mails obtained by The Stranger from a source at the city, ICE has declined to meet with Seattle Mayor Ed Murray to discuss the situation and share more information about Ramirez Medina's arrest. Tomorrow morning, a federal judge in Seattle will hear Ramirez Medina's lawyers and the government argue over ICE officials' justification in detaining Ramirez Medina in the first place.

Update: "I’m not familiar with the lawyer’s allegation," ICE public information officer Rose Richeson said. "We stand by all statements previously released related to this case."

Forget what you’ve heard: Donald Trump is not anti-Semitic or racist. This was made clear in an astonishing press conference on Thursday, which delivered irrefutable evidence obliterating all ideas to the contrary. What was the irrefutable evidence? Donald Trump said so.

The president made his point plainly: “Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” he said. “Number two, racism, the least racist person.”

No matter that he made this statement while cutting off a question from Jake Turx, an Orthodox reporter for the Brooklyn-based Jewish magazine Ami, and no matter that the question Turx was asking had nothing to do with Trump’s own beliefs. Called on by Trump toward the end of the press conference—“Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is,” Trump warned the press corps—Turx emphasized that no one in his community had accused Trump of anti-Semitism. Instead, he said that they wanted his response on something else:

… what we haven’t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There’s been a report that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or planning to—

That was as far as he got. Apparently convinced he was being accused of the grave sin of anti-Semitism, Trump pushed back. Turx continued to try to get a word in, but Trump talked over him: “Quiet, quiet, quiet,” he said. He cited his support from Benjamin Netanyahu as supporting evidence, and called the question “very insulting.” He also refused to actually answer it. Next.

A couple questions later, Trump called on April Ryan, White House correspondent for the American Urban Radio Networks, who is black. “Oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s OK,” Trump muttered audibly. When Ryan asked about what he was going to do to fix the inner cities, as he had promised, Trump seemed surprised and relieved. “That was very professional and very good,” he said.

But her follow-up—would he include the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus, in that conversation?—drew perhaps Trump’s least inhibited response of the day. First, he evidently was unfamiliar with the CBC. “Am I going to include who?” he asked. When Ryan clarified, he made the journalist an offer: “Do you want to set up the meeting?”

No, Ryan stammered, taken aback. Trump pressed it. “Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours?”

It was late. The press conference—apparently impulsively scheduled that morning to announce the new labor-secretary pick—had gone on for well over an hour, including such bizarre turns as Trump testifying to the unique terribleness of a nuclear holocaust. Trump seemed weary, his self-control even more frayed than usual. Ryan’s question would end up being the next to last.

But consider for one moment what their improvisational little exchange implied. First, the president made a casual assumption that a black journalist could not possibly ask a “good” or “professional” question. Then he insinuated that in her spare time, a White House correspondent would set up a meeting for him with members of Congress whose January letter he had ignored. Finally, he perpetuated the classically blinkered belief that America’s huge and enormously diverse black population all somehow know each other.The Obama administration is making it virtually impossible for Arlington County, the District and other jurisdictions to refuse to participate in a controversial immigration enforcement program that uses fingerprints gathered by local law enforcement agencies to identify illegal immigrants.

Participation in the program, called Secure Communities, was widely believed to be voluntary - a perception reinforced by a Sept 7 letter sent to Congress by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. This week, Arlington joined the District, San Francisco and Santa Clara County, Calif., in voting to opt out of the program.

But the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency now says that opting out of the program is not a realistic possibility - and never was.

Secure Communities, which operates in 32 states and will soon be running nationwide, relies on the fingerprints collected by local authorities when a person is charged with anything from a traffic violation to murder. The fingerprints are sent to state police, and then to the FBI, for criminal background checks.

Under the two-year-old program, ICE is able to access the information sent to the FBI. If the fingerprint matches that of someone known to be in the country illegally, ICE orders the immigrant detained as a first step toward deportation.

Tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants have been removed from the United States under the program, which the administration has made a centerpiece of its effort to focus immigration enforcement on criminals. But those deportees include many thousands who have committed minor offenses or no crimes at all, which has made the program a source of increasing concern to immigrant rights groups.

A senior ICE official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about the involuntary nature of the program, said: "Secure Communities is not based on state or local cooperation in federal law enforcement. The program's foundation is information sharing between FBI and ICE. State and local law enforcement agencies are going to continue to fingerprint people and those fingerprints are forwarded to FBI for criminal checks. ICE will take immigration action appropriately."

The only way a local jurisdiction could opt out of the program is if a state refused to send fingerprints to the FBI. Since police and prosecutors need to know the criminal histories of people they arrest, it is not realistic for states to withhold fingerprints from the FBI - which means it is impossible to withhold them from ICE.

The revelation that the program is not really optional stunned Arlington County Board member J. Walter Tejada (D), who spearheaded a months-long effort to evaluate Secure Communities with residents, lawyers and county officials. "It is most frustrating," he said. "Communities were researching this. Attorneys looked at it pro bono. All of that could have been avoided. People spent all summer thinking about this."

Tejada pointed to Napolitano's recent letter to Congress, in which she wrote, "A local law enforcement agency that does not wish to participate in the Secure Communities deployment plan must formally notify the Assistant Director for the Secure Communities program, David Venturella." In a briefing paper, ICE also said that if a city or county did not want to participate, the agency was amenable to "removing the jurisdiction from the deployment plan."

The senior ICE official said local authorities could opt out of learning the specific reason why immigration authorities wanted someone detained. But they would still have to detain the individual.

"If what you say is true, it is extremely disappointing because it means the District of Columbia now has a blurred rather than a bright line between what the Metropolitan Police Department is doing and what immigration officers are doing," said D.C. Council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), who recently voted with the rest of the council to opt out of the program. "We had a bright line, and that has increased trust and confidence in our police among immigrant communities. That will now vanish."Alex Wong/Getty Images

In the latest in a series of deranged moves against the press, the White House denied on Friday that the administration was contemplating mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants around the country. The denial was launched in response to an Associated Press report published earlier on Friday that stated this had been considered—and cited a leaked draft of a White House memo as evidence. While the White House had declined to comment for the AP story, once it was released, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer fired back: “There is no effort at all to ... utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants,” he said. “This is 100 percent not true.”

Weird. So why wouldn’t the White House have just told the AP that on Thursday or Friday and put the whole story to rest?

Well, likely because Spicer’s denial isn’t as comprehensive as it sounds. Understanding what he actually means seems to require parsing the definition of the word “is.” In this case, it sounds like Spicer probably meant is in the traditional Bill Clinton sense of that word. As in maybe this action was being considered before, but currently it is not. But also it might be again. Or not. Answering the question this way allows Spicer to deny a negative true story while also technically not lying about it. This seems to be the likeliest scenario at this point but until he answers a question about whether or not the memo was ever really in play, we just won’t know.

The best evidence for this theory is in a report by Bloomberg: “A Homeland Security Department official who insisted on anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the memo was an early idea that was never seriously considered.” So it was an idea, but now it is not. Spicer wasn’t lying as long as you use the right is.

Whether the National Guard will be used to enforce Trump’s deportation plans is beside the point right now. What matters is how the White House responded to this story: It refused to answer when it was being reported and then trashed the ultimate report as “100 percent not true” after it came out. The purpose of that reaction is simple. It pushes the White House’s main narrative: that the press are peddling “fake news;” that the administration is rife with treacherous leakers; that everyone in the media and in government is conspiring to make Donald Trump look bad; and that the only person who can be trusted to tell the truth is the president himself.

If the White House had actually wanted to offer clarity on its plans or make people aware that it wasn’t planning to create a terrifying mass deportation force, the solution would have been simple: They could have simply denied the report on Thursday when the AP sought comment or explained that the proposal was never seriously considered. But the benefits of further delegitimizing the media and any dissenters inside the administration far outweigh any potential upsides of clear communication. Instead, this method builds on what Trump’s press conference and “media survey” qua fundraiser accomplished on Thursday: Attack the group Trump sees as his principal adversary.

Here’s what else the White House gains from this informational vacuum: The leaked story further terrorizes immigrant communities that are already reeling from reports of sweeps and roundups. It also further emboldens Immigration and Customs Enforcement (and Customs and Border Patrol) agents who are being told that they answer to nobody but the president. It assures Trump’s base, albeit through a proposal the administration denies is being considered, that “illegals” are going to be dealt with brutally. And it sets up a convenient potential fight with the judicial branch down the road.

We are long past the point where we can impute logic or cunning to such moves. Better to suspect that this story, like the disastrous implementation of the executive order travel ban, has as much (or more) to do with incompetence and interagency miscommunication as it does with a master plan. And whichever it was, the result is the same: These actions continue to serve the single uber-agenda Trump loves—declaring loudly that the press is the enemy and that leakers are going down.

We are long past the point where we can impute logic or cunning to such moves.

That it also distracts from the ongoing war against the environment, women’s rights, workers, and baby bears now taking place on Capitol Hill is just a cherry on top. Emoluments violations are piling up like beer cans on a frat house lawn. The media is made to attempt to chase down what may or may not be fake news because it may or may not be true. It is chaos.

But whether it is intentional or incompetence does not matter: We all need to stop berating the media for being endlessly distracted. Instead, we should be aware of the effects the chaos has. One real effect of Spicer’s failure to reply to the AP is that immigrants may now be more afraid. That matters. Another is that it emboldens ICE to continue its harsh treatment of immigrants.Playboy

Playboy’s attempt to quit nude photo spreads didn’t last long. The magazine published the first non-nude issue in its 63-year history in March 2016, and just one year later, it’s reversing course. Cooper Hefner, founder Hugh Hefner’s son and the company’s new chief creative officer, tweeted on Monday that nudity will return to Playboy in its March/April 2017 issue.

“I’ll be the first to admit the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but removing it entirely was a mistake,” Hefner’s tweet said alongside a photo of his smirking face. “Nudity was never the problem, because nudity isn’t a problem. Today, we’re taking our identity back and rediscovering who we are.”

Hefner took his spot at the top of the magazine’s creative team in October, after half a year of issues that still showed women’s naked bodies, but with their genitals and areolae covered with strategically placed benign body parts and objects. The new back-to-nude Playboy will bring back nipples but keep vulvas out of the picture, a departure from the publication’s pre-2016 policy.

When Playboy announced its intent to go never-nude in October 2015, then-CEO Scott Flanders blamed the shift on the internet. “You’re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free,” he told the New York Times. “And so it’s just passé at this juncture.” Removing exposed genitals from the magazine allowed the product to be placed more prominently on newsstands and find readers in countries and military bases that don’t permit pornography sales. The decision could also be taken as the natural progression of an outlet that began back when a woman’s exposed breasts could be a nose-thumbing act of sexual liberation. Now, in an era of consent-based sex positivity and a rising population of queer-identified young people, the uncomplicated sexual objectification of women has a limited target audience.

The new version of naked Playboy is trying to market itself as a pseudo-enlightened, classy enterprise that views nudity as a beautiful, natural part of human existence instead of just a masturbatory aid. This month’s cover model, Elizabeth Elam, is photographed with natural-looking makeup, bedhead, and a subdued pose that doesn’t immediately call to mind a sex act. A video interview with Elam asks whether she’s turned on by a slew of random things, including Jonah Hill, tube socks, and pepperoni pizza. Planned Parenthood and “self-proclaimed male feminists” get the thumbs up.

Playboy

This appears to be a slight deviation from the Playboy of yore, whose covers were reliably inhabited by big, shiny hair, fake breasts, fishnet fingerless gloves, and pantsless women grinding on one another’s hips. Models bit things that weren’t meant to be bitten and straddled anything their legs could encircle. The August 2010 issue promised a tribute to Mad Men in the form of “an eight-page homage to cold martinis and naked secretaries,” which is sort of like celebrating Requiem for a Dream with a spread of women sniffing blow and having anal sex. Nude Playboy 2.0 seems a bit better attuned to subtlety and irony, its aesthetic of sexiness shifted slightly from a middle-America working-class ideal to the less-altered “natural” beauty favored by, shall we say, coastal elites. Nowhere is this clearer than in the inside shot of Elam in a folded-up T-shirt. The lighting and weathered fence say Instagram filter, but the underboobs say Playboy Mansion.A new study shows that China's Communist Party is winning an “ideological battle” against public opinion leaders on social media and other commentary platforms in China.

At the recent China Internet Media Forum, People’s Daily Public Opinion Monitoring Unit director Zhu Huaxin (祝華新）presented data illustrating the initial impact of an online offensive launched by the Chinese Communist Party in August of this year. The results show a marked drop in political commentary and conversation on social networks and other platforms over the past two months.

The offensive began on August 10, when the State Internet Information Office convened a group of major online opinion leaders and Internet celebrities and compelled them to adopt and promote a set of seven “self-censorship guidelines.”

Later that month, at a meeting of Party propaganda chiefs, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Party leaders that ideological control needed to become the Party's number one priority. Xi ordered the CCP propaganda machine to build “a strong Internet army” of government censors who would focus on eliminating online “rumors”. For many, this signaled a new, even tougher era for Internet users in China, where any piece of information that does not come from official government channels can be considered a rumor.

The report shows that the CCP has successfully maintained a dominant position in the online public sphere since the battle began. Zhu explained in his presentation that over the past two months, on leading social media platforms, the total number of messages posted by state-controlled media outlets and government branches have well out numbered messages posted by “public opinion leaders” or those who use online platforms simply to share their own personal views.

Government and Party suddenly dominate online spaces

The study drew from four months’ worth of observations of a set group of public opinion leaders’ micro-blogging accounts on Sina Weibo. Two months before August 10, these account holder had posted a total of 72,481 messages on Sina Weibo. In the two months following the launch of the censorship campaign, the accumulated number of messages fell to 65,126, yielding a 10.2% drop. Between September 11 to October 10, the number fell by 24.9%.

The chart below presents data from Zhu's report, showing the total number of messages in three major sectors according to a his research samples.

Zhu considered the result a victory of the Party's ideological battle and suggested that the Party further the effort by encouraging academics and writers to shape Chinese internet culture and inviting people with professional backgrounds to comment on issues that relate to their expertise. He also emphasized the need to maintain continuous efforts to crack down on Internet Water Armies (paid online commenters working for private companies) and to let state-run media take the lead in channelling public opinion.

Critical comments have vanished

Zhu's findings on Sina Weibo posting trends are troubling, but they are purely quantitative. From my own observations, I would argue that the total number of original posts made by prominent commenters and Internet celebrities has seen a far more tremendous drop.

Apart from social media, online forums and communities also have been affected by the party's ideological battle. Zhu Huaxin took “the society and people” section of a popular portal, Tianya Forum, as an example. In September, the total number of posts had fallen by 60% — the site saw 34% fewer “positive and constructive” posts and 63% fewer “negative and critical” posts. The number of posts related to individual rights and corruption had fallen by 70%.

Between January to August 2013, an average of two corruption cases were exposed online each month. But in September 2013, not a single citizen-initiated anti-corruption case was exposed online.

There also appears to be a drop in reporting on natural disasters, an issue that has been sensitive for the Chinese government in the past. While rainstorms and flooding in Beijing last July generated a flurry of online reports and commentary, some of which criticized government relief efforts, floods in Yuyao in October generated far fewer reports. While 60% of citizen posts on the Beijing rainstorms contained some amount of subjective commentary, only 15% of posts on Yuyao floods included subjective remarks. But “objective description” increased from 10% in July to 56% in September. The proportion of re-posts from state news agency reports, however, remained the same.

It is clear that netizens are not expressing their opinions on the Yuyao Flooding even though the incident is highly controversial–thousands of local residents protested in front of the government offices and some even attacked local police out of frustration with the government's flood relief efforts. The lack of online conversation about this is worrying. Citizen reporting on disasters can be critical to helping improve relief efforts and in emergencies, to get aid to those in need quickly.

Instead of reporting on people's grievances, state media outlets praised government relief efforts in Yuyao. In the past, netizens would have openly criticized the official media and government officials for this kind of behavior. But perhaps due to the party's new ideological offensive, many netizens just uploaded photos with objective descriptions and avoided making any subjective comment or judgement.

On top of this, most of the photos showing the confrontations between local residents and police officers have vanished from Sina Weibo. The very few surviving photos of Yuyao protests have either been posted by users whose accounts have not been verified (who do not fall into the category of “opinion leaders”) and have very few followers, or by users who have not used terms like “protest” or “confrontation” to describe their photos.

Meanwhile, overseas news outlets have collected the online photos and published them on their own platforms. NTDTV has a full collection of online photos and they explained the background of the confrontation. But this has little direct impact in China, where most overseas Chinese news websites are blocked.

The CCP may have won a battle in blocking critical opinions from spreading online. However, when people cannot find a way to release their anger towards injustice, they will find another outlet. The recent bombing incidents in Beijing and Shanxi may indicate the emerging of another battlefield, one in which everyone will lose.Lucas Jackson/Reuters

One of the worst winter tornado outbreaks in U.S. history ravaged parts of the South last month, leveling homes and buildings and killing at least 20 people across Mississippi and Georgia. In total, 79 tornadoes ripped through seven states. Last week, seven tornadoes touched down in southern Louisiana, injuring 41 people. As officials and residents dug through the rubble, affected states began requesting aid from the federal government, standard practice in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Reconstruction is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. But if an influential conservative think tank gets its way, federal funding for future disasters may be cut sharply—even as disasters themselves become more frequent.

The proposal to cut disaster aid was part of a lengthy report released last year by the Heritage Foundation. Dubbed “Blueprint for Balance,” the document argued that the federal government can save $10.5 trillion over the next decade by slashing funds for some programs and eliminating others. The blueprint calls for a funding cut for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, the primary mechanism through which states receive federal aid after natural disasters. It would shift the majority of the costs to state and local governments.

The Heritage Foundation is extremely influential in the world of conservative politics, and the Trump administration appears ready to lean on the think tank for policy ideas. Donald Trump’s transition team was stacked with advisers from Heritage, and the organization helped the president compile a list of potential Supreme Court picks. The Hill reported in January that a series of massive budget cuts being considered by the Trump administration “hew closely” to the Heritage budget blueprint.

Currently, federal disaster aid is governed by the Stafford Act. Passed in 1988, the law authorizes the president to issue emergency or major disaster declarations at the request of a governor, before and after a catastrophe occurs. Those declarations then trigger aid to rebuild infrastructure and protect public health. FEMA incurs 75 percent of the disaster relief costs, and states pick up the rest of the tab. In recent years, when a disaster depleted FEMA’s budget—after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, for example—Congress passed supplemental appropriations to cover the costs.

But if the Heritage budget is implemented, state and local governments would have to pony up 75 percent of the costs, up to $5 billion. If the cost of an individual disaster tops $5 billion, the federal government’s share would gradually increase, reaching 75 percent only if the damage exceeds $20 billion. The proposal would also completely eliminate FEMA’s fire grants, which subsidize local fire departments.

States have charged ahead with development in high-risk areas, even as climate change makes devastating floods and fires more likely.

Critics of the current arrangement often point to the rising number of disasters and claim that the threshold for declaring a disaster is too low. Between 1990 and 1999, there were an average of 46 major disaster declarations each year. The following decade, that number jumped to 56. In 2011 alone, there were 99 major disaster declarations. Last October, Hurricane Matthew shattered rainfall records in North Carolina and cost the state more than $1.5 billion in damages. The federal government is still sending funds to help with recovery efforts. A few months earlier, in August, Louisiana was inundated with flooding from torrential rains that caused $8.7 billion in damage.

Part of the problem, some experts say, is that states have charged ahead with development in high-risk areas, even as climate change makes devastating floods and fires more likely. (Scientists are still unsure about how global warming will affect tornadoes, but there’s some evidence that it will have an impact.) With the feds shelling out big bucks each time disaster strikes, these critics argue that local governments have little incentive to pursue more sustainable building plans.

“The states have allowed disaster-prone development to occur,” says Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami and a biology professor at Florida International University. “The building codes allow people to build structures in flood plains.” He believes the federal government will eventually be unable to fund disaster relief. “It may be better—at least in coastal areas—if you get it situated sooner rather than later,” says Stoddard.

Stoddard acknowledges that the unpredictable nature of some types of disasters, such as earthquakes, might create a need for certain exceptions. In general, however, he supports a gradual transition away from FEMA responsibility. “I would advocate a plan with a deadline, so people have time to get to work rather than being cut off completely,” he says.

Not everyone agrees that the feds should pay less. Part of the logic behind the Heritage proposal is that states should incur more of the costs of smaller disasters, allowing FEMA to save its resources for major catastrophes. But it doesn’t take a massive hurricane like Sandy or Katrina to put state and local governments in a bind. Covering the majority of the costs for disasters could wreak havoc on their budgets, which have been slow to recover from the Great Recession.

“It would require that every state plan for a worst-case scenario all the time,” says Margaret Becker, director of disaster recovery and community development at Legal Services NYC. In Becker’s view, federal assistance lifts a massive burden off of local governments. “It’s the same idea as pooling your savings with somebody,” says Becker. After a disaster, “you need quick access to a big pot of money.”

As the recent tornado outbreak shows, many localities simply don’t have the resources to cope with extreme weather. In Georgia, officials estimate at least $100 million of damage so far from last month’s tornadoes. The same part of the state was hit with tornadoes earlier in January, so local resources are all but exhausted. In Mississippi, officials predict insurers could be on the hook for $200 million in the city of Hattiesburg alone. As with most natural disasters, one of the most pressing needs was emergency housing. In Forrest County, Mississippi, more than 1,000 homes were damaged, and 239 were destroyed completely.Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Getty Images,Flickr CC.

Given the amount of attention one particular Donald has commanded, the past year or so has been a tough time for anyone else who shares a first name with the president. This is not to say it’s been a picnic for Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, women, veterans, journalists, the judicial branch, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, or any Americans who care about civil liberties and spelling. But let’s think, just for a moment, of the Donalds.

Take it from Donald Bell, a 38-year-old in Alameda, California, one of several Donalds I recently spoke with after requesting that my friends and colleagues connect me with anyone they know named Donald and then also searching Twitter. These days, he said, “I’m more sensitive about my name when I say it out loud to people. You can tell that people will flinch almost, not even meaning to, but just hearing the name, it produces such an emotional reaction in people. I’m just going to Starbucks for a cup of coffee, they ask me for my name, I have to say my name and then kind of apologize for it.”

In sum, “It’s a bit of an embarrassing time to be a Donald right now.”

Bell, an early adopter, happens to be the owner of the handle @Donald on our president’s favorite microblogging platform, and for the past few years his mentions have been full of words for that other Donald. “No matter what, it’s bad news,” he said. “It’s either I’m looking at people who are supporting Donald Trump or are violently against Donald Trump. It’s kind of like a depressing view of the world.”

Donald Burke, a 29-year-old in Washington, D.C. who goes by “Don,” can relate. “I absolutely hate to be called ‘the Donald,’ ” he said. “You can call me literally anything else, but that’s just one thing I never liked, and now even more so, it’s kind of, ‘Please, just don’t put a the in front of my name because someone already ruined that for us.’ ” While he allowed that “it’s not like we’re all part of some secret society of Donalds or anything like that,” that doesn’t mean he can’t assume the the is annoying for all Donalds.

Maybe Burke should get out of his bubble. In the course of my hunt for Donalds, I happened to connect with Donald Luskin, a Chicago-based economic strategist who supported Trump in the election. His firm, TrendMacro, was by his estimation one of the earliest predictors of a Trump win.* So does Luskin love all the attention he’s getting just because of his first name? “I can’t think of a single case where anyone’s ever raised it,” he said. Still, he’s worked it into a few jokes, sure. “Part of my work is to talk about political developments, so I’ll say something like, ‘I just want to make it perfectly clear that I am only a Donald, I’m not the Donald.’ ” And that’s really it. “Donald’s just not all that unusual. I think it’s less weird than if my name happened to be Barack.”

While Luskin is right that “Donald” is not exactly Pilot Inspektor, experts say the name has long been in serious decline. According to Social Security data, Donald peaked in popularity in America in 1934, the year Donald Duck was introduced, and it’s been downhill ever since. “Even Donald Trump was born on the down slope of Donald,” said Laura Wattenberg, the name expert behind BabyNameWizard.com. Other than Don Draper—“the Mad Men Don Draper years were the heyday of being a Donald,” Donald Bell lamented—most of the Donalds in popular culture are elderly, and any lingering Donalds—Glover, for example—tend to be named after older family members. (I reached out to Donald Sutherland and Donald Glover for this piece, but they both declined to comment through representatives. Whether that’s because they too did not want to be associated with Trump, we’ll never know.)

“To modern ears, the full name Donald, all those consonants weigh it down,” Wattenberg said. “The style today is very much about vowels. The equivalent of Donald, Ronald, Gerald, Harold today would be Aiden, Hayden, Jayden, Kayden. We have a lot of long vowel sounds, not a lot of voiced consonants together like that -ld.”

According to both name experts and Donalds themselves, most Donalds don’t use the full name. They’re usually Dons, maybe Donnies—not Trump, however, a fact the Donalds I spoke to found notable. As Bell put it, “I feel like all the best-looking, most famous versions of Donald out in the world usually go by Don.”

According to Wattenberg, “The full name Donald and the nickname Don are far apart in the impression they give, kind of like Rodney to Rod, just a very different image.”

“I think he probably prefers the most impressive-sounding version of his name, which is Donald J. Trump, as opposed to Don John Drumpf, which sounds I think a little less imperious,” mused another Donald—Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

“The meaning of the word Donald in certain name meaning books is ruler of the world,” Burke was quick to note, “which terrifies me!” A brand strategist by profession, Burke also sees the lack of nickname as a calculated move. “It’s always Donald Trump, first and last name, or it’s just Trump. ‘Trump did this, Trump did that.’ ” This may have at least helped minimize any negative impact on the name Donald, he surmised. “Thank God.”

Still, there is something about Donald. “The one noteworthy feature of the president’s name is that both nickname and given name score extremely high on my dimension of success,” Albert Mehrabian, a professor emeritus of psychology who has studied names, told me in an email. According to his research and surveys, Don scored an 88 and Donald a 95 out of 100 in terms of “impressions generated by the name in the general population.”

I was interested to hear the opinions of one more Don, the one who happens to be my dad, on the matter, so I called him up. He wasn’t wild about the comparison. “I’m not a crook. I don’t deceive people,” he said, summarizing some key differences between himself and his name twin. At this point I tried to clarify the lifelong mystery of why his name is actually not Donald, just Don. But before I could request his long-form birth certificate, he handed off the phone to his press secretary, aka my mom. “I don’t think it sullies his name,” my mom offered. “Rational people know that everybody is their own individual.”

No one is moreso his own individual than Donald Trump. And the sui generis nature of our president may have actually kept Donald-smearing to a minimum. “It’s remarkable that no one in my social circle has ever explicitly made that association,” Moynihan said of sharing a first name with the president. “It’s an incredibly obvious thing to say, but there are so many other things to say about this president that people tend to default to that first.” Burke agreed. “Most of the people at least in my particular circles don’t want to make any reference to him. It’s like Voldemort.” That hasn’t stopped Burke from giving a little thought to the possibility that things get so bad that he has to abandon his given name: “In that case, I’ll just start going by my initials, or I don’t know, I’ll figure it out when that happens.”

Moynihan isn’t quite ready to give up. “I think I can say this for the collective of Don or Donalds across the world, which is: We hope our name does not go down in infamy.”

For his part, Bell also hasn’t let the Donald problem ruin his good name. Would he ever considering selling his coveted @Donald handle to Trump? “It’s a firm ‘never,’ ” Bell told me. “I still have my own affection for my name. It’s not gotten so bad yet. There’s probably a group of people named Adolf somewhere who are in worse shape than I am.”

Speaking of things that have fallen off, do baby name experts expect any spike in the name Donald given his “unpresidented” victory?

Wattenberg thinks it’s unlikely. Normally, “Even a deadly hurricane can make the name of the hurricane spike up in popularity.” But Wattenberg thinks the presidency is unlikely to revive the flagging Donald. “Donald is likely to be a nonstarter on style grounds.”

“The traditional baby name dictionary lets you look up the linguistic origins in Old High German or tells you what proto-Celtic root was behind Donald, but that’s not what we hear when we hear names,” Wattenberg went on. “We’re all constructing the meaning of names every day as we live, and there’s no question the meaning of Donald has changed dramatically over the last year.”

Mike Campbell, who runs Behindthename.com, agrees that the name Donald is unlikely to see much of a resurgence, but he did mention another possibility. Citing the vogue for presidential last names becoming first names—Reagan, Kennedy, and the like—he said, “I’d be curious to see whether Trump as a first name ever made it onto the top-1,000 list.” Imagine that—a bunch of little Trumps running around your local playground. Now there’s a branding opportunity.Click the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like.

He is one of more than 750,000 people to receive work permits and permission to stay under a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, since the program began in 2012. To be eligible, recipients have to prove that they have been in the country since they were children and that they have no serious criminal record.

Mr. Trump has given mixed messages about whether he intends to renew the program. During the campaign, he criticized it as an illegal amnesty program, but more recently he said he would “work something out” for the recipients.

Mr. Ramirez, who came to the United States from Mexico when he was about 7 years old, had not been charged with any crime that would jeopardize his DACA status. Lawyers and advocates said on Tuesday that before Mr. Ramirez’s case, they had not heard of any DACA permit holder in good standing who had been held in detention.

A spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Seattle said on Tuesday afternoon that the government was still reviewing the case.

A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement late Tuesday night that Mr. Ramirez is a “self-admitted gang member” who is a “risk to public safety” and has been placed in removal proceedings in immigration court.

Mr. Rosenbaum said Mr. Ramirez was “repeatedly pressured” by immigration agents to falsely admit a gang affiliation, a charge he “unequivocally denies.”

Immigration officers appeared to target Mr. Ramirez’s father because he had already been ordered deported, his lawyers said. After the officers arrested Mr. Ramirez’s father, he asked to go back into his home so that he could tell his sons about the arrest.

The officers then asked Daniel Ramirez, “Are you legally here?” according to the lawsuit. “Yes, I have a work permit,” Mr. Ramirez told them.

His older brother, who is also a DACA recipient, then told him not to answer any additional questions, the lawsuit said.

Immigration officials then took Mr. Ramirez to a facility in Seattle, where he handed over his wallet, which held his work permit that identified him as a recipient of DACA, according to the lawsuit. After seeing the permit, an officer told him, “It doesn’t matter because you weren’t born in this country,” according to the lawsuit. Mr. Ramirez was then fingerprinted, booked and taken to a detention center in Tacoma, where he has remained. His brother was not detained.

At the time the DACA program began, there was considerable worry among immigrants that people would be giving the government too much information about their whereabouts, leaving them vulnerable to deportation later. But they were assured that their information would not be used against them.

The government went so far as to set up a 24-hour legal hotline for DACA recipients to call if they are taken in for deportation. Despite calls to that number, immigration officials did not make any attempt to have Mr. Ramirez released.

The lawsuit argues that DACA sets a clear expectation of protection from deportation for recipients and that Mr. Ramirez clearly poses no threat. Mr. Ramirez recently moved to Seattle from California so that he could find a job with better pay to support his 3-year-old son, his lawyers said. The boy lives with his mother.

“Our hope and expectation is that Daniel is going to be released quickly and that the government will recognize this is a mistake,” Mr. Rosenbaum said, adding that a few other DACA recipients had been arrested in the past several years, but that all were released almost immediately.Win McNamee/Getty Images

A daily roundup of the biggest stories in right-wing media.

On Tuesday evening, the New York Times published an article titled, “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence.” While conservative media outlets extensively covered the story, they were largely dismissive of its implications.

Town Hall emphasized the Times’ own admission that those contacts presented “no evidence of collusion.” It likewise dismissed the contention that Russia had “hacked” the election.

Most other outlets followed suit, suggesting that there was little of note in the Times article, and nothing truly new. Sean Hannity’s site pointed to earlier reporting, reminding readers, “The FBI had concluded in January that nothing illicit had taken place in [Michael] Flynn’s conversation with [Russian ambassador Sergey] Kislyak.” Breitbart implied that we were witnessing a case of selective outrage, writing, “it may be instrumental to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign were accused of meeting with Hamas and Iran.”

Many outlets made light of the left’s enthusiasm for the story. The Daily Caller post “Journalists Go Nuts Over Rehashed New York Times Story” rounded up reactions from a handful of media personalities, including Dan Rather, “who was brought down by false reporting about George W. Bush’s military record.” Similarly, LifeZette wrote, “The Russian fear-mongering is a narrative that journalists just can’t quit,” before going on to suggest that the real goal was to protect the Iran deal.

Conservative publications also turned a critical eye to the intelligence community. Breitbart ran an article titled, “EXCLUSIVE – NSA Whistleblower: Agency ‘Absolutely’ Tapping Trump’s Calls.” The whistleblower in question was William Binney, who left the National Security Agency in 2001, and the article does not indicate that he has current insider information to substantiate his assertions. Many outlets suggested that the intelligence community’s actions should have consequences. Breitbart cited Rep. Devin Nunes, who claimed that those who had given information to journalists should be jailed. And LifeZette extensively quoted Joseph diGenova to support the assertion that federal employees “are committing felonies in leaking classified materials to outlets such as The Washington Post.”

On his show, Sean Hannity attributed Flynn’s demise to “a liberal witch hunt.” “The Washington D.C. swamp is rising up,” he said, while alluding to a “master plan to damage and destroy … President Donald Trump” engineered by the “alt-radical left.”

Abstract Studies relating the selectivity of colleges to the earnings of their graduates report inconsistent findings. Some find no effects; most report statistically significant but quite small earnings benefits from attending a more selective college; and a few studies report large effects. Analyzing two recent national longitudinal studies of college graduates, with models sensitive to selection bias, we find large earnings payoffs from attending a highly selective college both four and ten years after graduation. However, those returns are uneven: full-time working women graduates earn a lot less than their male counterparts from equivalent colleges, college majors pay differently, and family background also affects earnings over and above one’s college’s selectivity. Nevertheless, earnings differences attributable to college selectivity are striking.

1. Introduction

Stratification researchers who work within the Weberian tradition emphasize the centrality of educational institutions in generating and maintaining social stratification in the US and other economically developed countries. As Randall Collins (1988: 174) put it: “the most obvious form of stratification in the industrialized societies of the late twentieth century is by education.” Because educational credentials serve as gatekeepers into many occupations, many families seek to advantage their children's occupational chances by enrolling them in schools with superior reputations, by paying for tutoring and test preparation services, and by encouraging their offspring to attend the most prestigious colleges possible.

Rather than viewing this struggle for educational advantage as a purely individual or family issue, Weberians characterize it as a competition between status groups, some of which already have access to a prestigious education and high-paying jobs and therefore seek to maintain their advantages. Tilly (1999) terms this process ‘opportunity hoarding’. Families in less elite status groups try to enhance their children's prospects by encouraging them to excel in education, and gain access to top universities, in the hope this will admit them to those prestigious and well-paying jobs. This produces a kind of ‘arms race ’or ‘credential inflation’ in education. As Hout (2004: 12) explains: “Educational stratification works like a queue. The initial phases of educational expansion – first of some schooling, and, for the last fifty years, post-secondary schooling – benefit the privileged families at the front of the queue. Then the benefits pass down the hierarchy.” This theory is known as ‘Maximally Maintained Inequality’ or MMI (Raftery and Hout, 1993; Shavit and Blossfeld, 1993 ; Shavit et al., 2007), or a modified version as ‘Efficiently Maintained Inequality’ (Lucas, 2001).

More recently, scholars have added differentiation of educational institutions to this picture, suggesting a historical sequence: first exclusion of lower SES individuals from a given level of education, then saturation of that educational level as more students gain entry, then expanded access via institutional differentiation and the inclusion of less advantaged strata via diversion into lower status institutions at that level, and finally movement of the elite to yet higher levels of qualification (Shavit et al., 2007 ; Teichler, 2007).

Although there is considerable empirical evidence for MMI, evidence for the broader theory of opportunity hoarding via educational prestige is more mixed. Certainly, American universities can be characterized in terms of a prestige hierarchy, and students from lower SES families are disproportionately found at lower ranked colleges, while students from higher SES families dominate at the top colleges and universities (Espenshade and Radford, 2009). Social scientists have also noted that applications to more selective colleges have grown in recent decades, despite the increasing cost (Hoxby, 2009).

However, researchers have not found clear earnings advantages from attending a more selective college, compared to a less selective institution. On the contrary, some scholars have reported zero income advantages for graduates of more selective colleges (Dale and Krueger, 2002 ; Dale and Krueger, 2014) while others have found statistically significant but quite small earnings differentials associated with attendance of elite colleges (Zhang, 2005) or flagship state universities (Hoekstra, 2009). Few if any have found the substantial differences in post-college earnings that are implied by theories of opportunity hoarding that link educational stratification to income inequality. There is therefore an empirical anomaly in the Weberian perspective on stratification.

Answering the question of whether degrees from more selective colleges pay off through higher earnings in the years after graduation is not straightforward for several reasons. Students who attend selective colleges typically differ on important dimensions from those who enroll in less selective colleges; the former tend to have stronger academic skills (indicated by higher test scores, high school GPA, and course preparation) and are drawn disproportionately from more affluent and higher-educated families. This association between college selectivity and student background characteristics implies what statisticians call ‘selection bias’: students with certain background characteristics are more likely to be ‘selected into treatment.’ Any estimate of the returns to a selective college should therefore address selection bias, otherwise the estimated effect of attending a selective college will be conflated with these differences in students' family and academic backgrounds.

In this paper we focus on the issue of college selectivity and post-college earnings to address the earlier findings in conflict with Weberian theory. We analyze data from two nationally-representative surveys of BA graduates that collected information on graduates’ earnings: the 1993/2003 and 2008/2012 cohorts of the Baccalaureate & Beyond Longitudinal Studies (B&B). These data allow us to examine both short- and long-term effects of college selectivity. We use advanced statistical methods to address selection bias through augmented inverse-probability weighted regressions (AIPW), while also attending to heterogeneity in earnings: college major, gender, and race. In contrast to earlier studies, we do find a substantial earnings premium to attending a more selective four-year college, just as Weberian stratification theory would predict. These effects of college selectivity on earnings are apparent across the college selectivity spectrum, so that graduates from the most selective colleges on average earn more than graduates from slightly less selective colleges, and so on down the selectivity hierarchy.

2. Previous research

2.1. College selectivity and payoff mechanisms

A large literature relates college characteristics to future earnings of higher education graduates. Within this field, the impact of “college quality” on labor market outcomes has been widely documented. This multi-dimensional construct often encompasses a range of college characteristics, such as the mean scholastic aptitude test (SAT) scores of entering undergraduates, expenditures per full-time student, costs of attendance, and ratio of students per faculty member (Zhang, 2005 ; Borgen, 2014). Hence, college quality often implicitly assumes the economic gains in the labor market are attributable to something related to institutional investments, including the quality of teaching or facilities (Broecke, 2012). Using this measure few studies have reported a substantial earnings premium associated with higher college quality (Brewer et al., 1999; Thomas and Zhang, 2005 ; Zhang, 2005). However, as a review of 24 studies summarized: “most studies suggested that college quality had a statistically significant though generally very small effect on earnings” (Zhang, 2005: 20).1

Alongside the study of labor market returns of college quality, a much smaller literature focuses on college selectivity. Although some researchers use these terms interchangeably, there is a sharp difference between the two measures of college characteristics. College selectivity is a narrower concept that emphasizes the academic composition of the student body, usually measured by mean test scores of admitted freshmen. It therefore acts as a powerful signal of the intelligence and ambition of a college's student body as a whole, rather than a measure specifying the quality of the education that a particular graduate has received ( Pascarella et al., 2006). Hence, college selectivity is also a more precise measure of prestige and its related signaling mechanisms, which we seek to isolate in this study. In the United States, the Barron's Index is widely used as a measure of selectivity; it emphasizes college mean SAT scores along with the ratio of applicants to admitted students for that college.2

What are the likely driving forces behind the earnings payoff of a highly selective college degree? Higher education credentials may be viewed as ‘positional goods’ (Hirsch, 1977 ; Frank, 1985) whose value is largely determined by exclusiveness: not everyone has a college degree, therefore it becomes valuable. Also rooted in Weberian social theory, the concept of ‘signaling’ provides a related perspective on educational status markers. The Nobel laureate, Michael Spence (1974), argued that degrees function as educational signals that are valued by prospective employers who are making hiring decisions. The value of educational credentials is not because they denote some skill set or fund of knowledge, but simply because degrees are difficult to obtain. Spence argued that educational signals function well as selection devices even when the content of a college education is completely irrelevant to the employment. Employers will hire someone with a more extensive or more selective education because on average individuals of low ability will not be able to earn those degrees and can be filtered out by requiring education.

However, signaling theory does not specify whether signaling matters only at the point of first being hired, or whether it continues to have relevance later in an occupational career. Given the theory's emphasis on asymmetric information between job applicants and employers, one might anticipate that educational signaling would lose its importance once employers gain an up-close and sustained understanding of their employees' strengths and weaknesses, something that would emerge over the longer run. In the longer run a job applicant's suitability might be signaled more effectively by their occupational history and employment accomplishments rather than by their undergraduate credentials.Author Philip Pullman Announces A Follow-Up Trilogy To 'His Dark Materials'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Max Nash/Associated Press Max Nash/Associated Press

The hugely successful fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials will be getting a "companion" trilogy, author Philip Pullman announced this evening.

The first book of the new series, which will collectively be called The Book of Dust, is set for publication on October 19.

The original His Dark Materials trilogy consists of three volumes (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) published between 1995 and 2000. The series has sold over 17.5 million copies and been translated into 40 languages.

The events of the first trilogy took place across several parallel worlds — including our own — and touched on disparate ideas related to theology, particle physics, and the loss of childhood innocence. Characters included a headstrong and fiercely intelligent young girl named Lyra Belacqua, and an armored, talking polar bear.

The Book of Dust will return to the world(s) and characters of His Dark Materials, Pullman said, and Lyra will be integral to the new story — but not in the way she was before. The first volume will take place a decade before the events of His Dark Materials, when Lyra is an infant. The second and third volumes will be set ten years after the original trilogy's conclusion, and will follow Lyra as a young woman.

But that doesn't mean what you might expect, Pullman told NPR editor Glen Weldon. He wants readers to consider the new work not as a simple extension of the original trilogy, but as a "companion" to it.

"The [new] story begins before His Dark Materials and continues after it," he said, "... you don't have to read it before you read [the original trilogy] ... this is another story that comes after it, so it's not a sequel, and it's not a prequel, it's an equal."

The title, The Book of Dust, refers to an invisible substance that figures largely in the earlier books — a fictional elementary particle that harbors a mysterious affinity with human consciousness.

"That's what I really wanted to explore in this new work," he said. "More about the nature of Dust, and consciousness, and what it means to be a human being."

Pullman has already followed up the original trilogy with two novellas and an audiobook. He said he was motivated to revisit the world of Lyra and her companions with a full trilogy because "I sensed a big story. I sensed the presence, in the way that you do, of another story that hadn't been told, and I went closer and ... thought about it and lived with it for a while and discovered that yes, it was a big story, and it did deserve to be told, it deserves its own books."

Interview Highlights

His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman Paperback | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

On where The Book of Dust will fall in the saga

Well, the first book is set roughly ten years before the action of His Dark Materials. And the second book and subsequent books ... are set ten years after it. So in the first one, Lyra is only a baby of about six months. So she's not able to do very much, but she's certainly the focus of intense activity on the part of the main protagonists. In the second book she will be twenty years old, she'll be an adult....

It's a sort of companion book, if you like. It doesn't stand before [His Dark Materials], it doesn't stand after it, it stands beside it.

On why he's calling it The Book of Dust

Dust is something which terrifies the religious authorities in His Dark Materials. It seems to have something to do with human consciousness, it seems to have something to do with experience, or as they call it, "sin." But they don't know what it is, or why it's important, and they're terrified of it. Now, in the course of the story, Lyra and her companions discover something about Dust, something important: that it's not a bad thing, it's a good thing.

On whether the overwhelming worldwide reaction to the original trilogy colors his writing of the new one

When I wrote the first series, starting in 1993, I didn't expect more than a readership of about two or three thousand. That's sort of based on previous experience and thinking what sort of book it was, I didn't think it would have very wide audience but maybe a few people would enjoy it. The fact that it was received with such interest all over the world in 40 different languages really did amaze me.

It didn't change what I was doing, though, because I was already in my late 40s when I was starting that, I wasn't a very young writer bowled over by all the response and attention and so on. I was pretty clear and determined about what I was doing and how I was doing it. The only difference it made was that I had a lot more letters to write back. To answer. Nowadays I communicate by Twitter, but back in those days there were a lot of letters to write back, which I duly did.

On his impatient readership

Well, I have a standard answer. When people say "How's The Book of Dust getting along? When's it going to be finished?" I say, with perfect truth, "It is three pages longer today than it was yesterday."

On the criticism his books have received

I've been greatly criticized for the attention to religion that I give in the books, but I've been criticized, on the whole, by people who haven't read the books. My attitude to religion is that religion is a most interesting and extraordinary human phenomenon. I'm fascinated by it, interested in it, and at some points critical of it. And the points when I become critical are the points when politics come into it, and religion acquires political power — political with a small "p," for example, within the confines of a single family, or Political with a large "P," on a national or international scale.

When religion gets the power to tell people how to dress, who to fall in love with, how to behave, what they must not read, what they must not wear, all those things, then religion goes bad. ... Religion is private thing, and a fine thing and a good thing, as long as it remains private. As soon as it becomes public and political, it's dangerous. That's the position I've taken up in the first series and the position this current one takes up as well.Definition

The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program counts one arrest for each separate instance in which a person is arrested, cited, or summoned for an offense. The UCR Program collects arrest data on 28 offenses, as described in Offense Definitions. (Please note that, as of 2010, the UCR Program no longer collects data on runaways.) Because a person may be arrested multiple times during a year, the UCR arrest figures do not reflect the number of individuals who have been arrested; rather, the arrest data show the number of times that persons are arrested, as reported by law enforcement agencies to the UCR Program.

Important note about rape data

In 2013, the UCR Program initiated the collection of rape data under a revised definition and removed the term “forcible” from the offense name. The UCR Program now defines rape as follows:

Rape (revised definition): Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. (This includes the offenses of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object as converted from data submitted via the National Incident-Based Reporting System.)

Rape (legacy definition): The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.

For tables within this publication that present data for 2015 only or provide a 2-year trend, the rape figures are an aggregate total of the data submitted based on both the legacy and revised UCR definitions. For 5- and 10-year trend tables, the rape figures for the previous year (2011 or 2006) are based on the legacy definition and the 2015 rape figures are an aggregate total based on both the legacy and revised definitions. For this reason, a percent change is not provided.

Data collection-juveniles

The UCR Program considers a juvenile to be an individual under 18 years of age regardless of state definition. The program does not collect data regarding police contact with a juvenile who has not committed an offense, nor does it collect data on situations in which police take a juvenile into custody for his or her protection, e.g., neglect cases.

Overview

Nationwide, law enforcement made an estimated 10,797,088 arrests in 2015. Of these arrests, 505,681 were for violent crimes, and 1,463,213 were for property crimes. (Note: the UCR Program does not collect data on citations for traffic violations.) (See Table 29.)

The highest number of arrests were for drug abuse violations (estimated at 1,488,707 arrests), larceny-theft (estimated at 1,160,390), and driving under the influence (estimated at 1,089,171). (See Table 29 .)

The estimated arrest rate for the United States in 2015 was 3,363.0 arrests per 100,000 inhabitants. The arrest rate for violent crime (including murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) was 157.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, and the arrest rate for property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson) was 458.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. (See Table 30 .)

Two-year arrest trends show violent crime arrests increased 1.5 percent in 2015 when compared with 2014 arrests, and property crime arrests decreased 5.6 percent when compared with 2014 arrests. (See Table 36 .)

Arrests of juveniles for all offenses decreased 8.4 percent in 2015 when compared with the 2014 number; arrests of adults decreased 3.0 percent. (See Table 36 .)

More than 73 percent (73.1) of the persons arrested in the nation during 2015 were males. They accounted for 79.7 percent of persons arrested for violent crime and 61.7 percent of persons arrested for property crime. (See Table 42 .)

In 2015, 69.7 percent of all persons arrested were white, 26.6 percent were black, and the remaining 3.6 percent were of other races. (See Table 43 .)

1. North Korean tyrant heir Kim Jong-un had a half-brother named Kim Jong-nam who was considered the likely successor to their father Kim Jong-il until an embarrassing 2001 incident in which he (Kim Jong-nam) was arrested for using a forged Dominican Republic passport to try to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

2. Kim Jong-nam subsequently left North Korea and lived in exile in various locations throughout Asia, making public comments critical of his half-brother once Kim Jong-un ascended to power.

3. Kim Jong-nam died on Monday after he was apparently sprayed with poison at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by two women.

4. One of the women detained in connection with his death was carrying Vietnamese papers and can be seen on airport security footage wearing a shirt with LOL written on it in large letters. (As CNN explains, "the acronym, popular with social media and smartphone users, stands for 'laugh out loud.' ")

5. The other woman, apparently, is from Indonesia, and now a top Indonesian law enforcement official is claiming she was tricked into participating in the assassination by being told she was participating in a TV prank show. From the AP:

Tito Karnavian told reporters in Indonesia's Aceh province that Siti Aisyah, 25, was paid to be involved in "Just For Laughs" style pranks, a reference to a popular hidden camera show.

He said she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," Karnavian said.Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images

China gave Donald Trump something this week that he’s been seeking for more than a decade: the rights to own his name in that country. The Chinese government announced Tuesday that it has awarded Trump a 10-year trademark on his last name for construction services, a development that the Associated Press described as a “surprise win” for our businessman-president. Previous attempts to wrest control of his naming rights from a Chinese man who had beat Trump to the punch in registering the name by two weeks repeatedly failed.

Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.

Trump’s reversal of fortunes raises a number of important questions, chief among them: Is China attempting to curry favor with Trump because he’s president? Would Trump have received his coveted trademark even if he weren’t president? Would we need to be asking these questions if the president had followed ethics experts’ advice and divested himself of his financial interests in his business empire? In short order: most likely, probably, and certainly not.

First, the backstory: Trump had spent years trying to get this particular trademark with no avail. According to the Washington Post, Trump’s last setback in the matter came in May 2015, when a court denied his then-newest challenge to the existing trademark held by a man named Dong Wei. Nearly one year later, in April 2016, Trump’s lawyers asked Chinese officials to reconsider their decision, which they did, ultimately voiding Dong’s trademark on Sept. 6. The bureau then formally announced Trump’s competing claim to the trademark on Nov. 13, which began a three-month–long bureaucratic process that was completed on Valentine’s Day with the formal awarding of Trump’s trademark for real-estate construction.

It’s important to note that China isn’t giving Trump something that he didn’t already have some claim to, or that he wasn’t likely to get before he became president. Dong only managed to snag the Trump name in the first place thanks to China’s first-come-first-serve trademark policy. In recent years, though, Beijing has taken steps to tighten its trademark laws and intellectual-property rights to bring them closer to those in the West. In December, for instance, the Supreme People’s Court ruled in favor of Michael Jordan in a dispute over a trademark for the Chinese word Qiaodan, which sounds like Jordan in Mandarin. The following month the high court issued guidelines for trademark cases that specifically bar the use of the names of public figures in areas including politics, economy, culture, and religion. It’s reasonable to believe, then, that Trump would have been granted this particular trademark even if he had never been elected president. But, of course, Trump was elected president.

If you overlay the timeline of Trump’s quest for the trademark with that of his political career, all those dots start to look like a straight line. Trump’s complaints fell on deaf ears for years before he launched his presidential campaign; China agreed to revisit the matter after he jumped in the race; trademark officials sided with him for the first time shortly before he was elected and then again days after he won the presidency; and finally, China officially awarded Trump’s trademark less than a month after he took the oath of office. None that proves causation, of course, but it creates the appearance of possible favor trading, something that could have been avoided altogether if Trump had left his business behind when he headed to Washington.

This trademark decision isn’t a one-off event either.

The trademark case also raises the related issue of the U.S. Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bars Trump from accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever” from a foreign state. The aim of that language wasn’t to prevent bribery—which is, after all, explicitly barred elsewhere in the Constitution—but instead to prevent public officials from being influenced in more subtle ways. As conservative legal scholar David Post has put it, “accepting an emolument introduces an improper element—personal gain—into the decision-maker’s calculus, less obviously and overtly than in cases of actual bribery, but no less serious for that.”

It’s easy to spot areas where Trump’s worldview could have been shaped by his business in China. ThinkProgress editor Judd Legum pointed out Wednesday night, for example, that Trump went from questioning the United States’ “One China” policy to affirming it in the days before his trademark was finalized. To my eye, Legum may be oversimplifying the timeline a bit. Trump’s original comments on the matter came after he was already well on his way to getting his trademark, though it is conceivable China was willing to use the trademark as leverage by threatening to derail the process at the last second if Trump didn’t reverse himself. Regardless, Legum’s larger point about the appearance of conflict is a crucial one. As long as Trump is both businessman and president, his own financial interests will unavoidably hang over his presidential decisions.

This trademark decision isn’t a one-off event either. Donald Trump has 49 other trademark applications still pending in China, along with scores of current ones that will come up for renewal during the next four years. Regardless of whether Trump deserves those trademarks, China is now in a position to use each of them as bargaining chips in matters of state. The president, then, is negotiating with a foreign power that has the ability to directly help or harm his own personal financial fortunes. Both Trump and China know that—and they also know that Trump is already on record that he believes his naming rights rise to the level of geopolitical importance. Back in 2011, Trump wrote then–Commerce Secretary Gary Locke asking him to intervene on his behalf in his quest for an exclusive trademark in China. “My appeals lawyer said that while we should win the case 100%,” Trump wrote, “we won’t because the cards are stacked against Trump.” Now that he’s president, it’s clear they no longer are.Zach Gibson/Getty Images

When the Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump stated in December 2015 that the United States should close its borders to all Muslims, the reaction from American Christian leaders was admirably swift. Mainline Protestant clergy, prominent evangelicals, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops all lambasted it. “Anyone who cares an iota about religious liberty should denounce this reckless, demagogic rhetoric,” Southern Baptist Convention policy head Russell Moore wrote soon afterward. “A government that can shut down mosques simply because they are mosques can shut down Bible studies because they are Bible studies.” The day after Trump proposed his policy, the governor of Indiana, one evangelical Catholic named Mike Pence, tweeted that “Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.”

Thirteen months later, Trump is president, and his calls to ban Muslims are making their way into law. Trump signed an executive order Friday that suspends immigration for at least 90 day from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—all predominantly Muslim countries. The order also bans all refugees for at least 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely. When the ban ends, the order allows the U.S. government to prioritize applications based on the refugees’ religion. As my colleague Jim Newell explains:

Once refugee admissions resume, the government will “prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.” In other words, Trump has instructed the government to use religion as a means of prioritizing the processing of refugee applications. This, by Trump’s own admission, prioritizes Christians over Muslims coming from countries like Iraq or Yemen or Syria—if any Syrians are ever allowed—or other horrific lands from which someone might seek refuge. It effectively discriminates against Muslims on the basis of their religion.

The fallout has been heartbreaking and chaotic—and most immediately felt by refugees of all religious backgrounds from the countries listed. Refugee families already en route to new homes in the United States were detained at airports for hours, and those waiting overseas saw their hopes crushed. One Syrian Christian family of six was turned back at the Philadelphia airport on Sunday, visas in hand; confused by their options, they returned to Lebanon.

Once again, the response from religious leaders, including Christians, has been emphatic. More than 2,000 faith leaders, many of them Christian, have signed a letter first drafted last year to urge Congress not to ban refugees according to religion or nationality; signatories include representatives of the humanitarian relief group Church World Service, whose leader called Friday, coincidentally also Holocaust Remembrance Day, a “shameful day.” Some of the outcry took the shape of general support for refugees—as opposed to opposition to Trump's singling out of Muslims—but it has still been notable. Moore sent out a tweet against the policy on Saturday morning. Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism, pleaded with fellow evangelicals—who voted for Trump overwhelmingly—to not let “alternative facts” drive refugee policy. The president of World Relief, a humanitarian organization affiliated with the National Association of Evangelicals, said, “Any limitation against any vulnerable population is to fly in the face of human dignity, of people made in the image of God.” World Relief says it has assembled 12,000 signatures from evangelical Christians opposing Trump’s order. As Emma Green wrote in the Atlantic, “From religious leaders’ perspectives, backlash against Trump’s immigration policy may be the most ecumenical issue in America right now.”

This moral consistency is refreshing, especially in contrast to the shameful silence and kowtowing of many Republican lawmakers. But it shouldn’t be surprising. The majority of refugee resettlement agencies are religious. Refugee issues in particular have been a longtime focus of many Christian ministries. In explaining their concern for asylum-seekers, many cite the words of Jesus when he condemned those who failed to treat “the least of these” with the same respect they would give him:

I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.

As the Syrian crisis has escalated, the issue has taken on new prominence in many churches and Christian organizations. We Welcome Refugees, a coalition that includes the Illinois evangelical megachurch Willow Creek Community Church, has earned more than 16,000 signatories to its petition calling on elected officials to help refugees in “tangible and practical ways.” (The hashtag #wewelcomerefugees currently offers a snapshot of Christian opposition to Trump’s policy.) A poll of 1,000 Protestant pastors taken a year ago by the evangelical research firm LifeWay found that 86 percent consider it a privilege to care for refugees. Last summer, the Southern Baptist Convention adopted a resolution urging members to welcome refugees in their homes and churches—though it also said the government should adopt “the strictest security measures possible” in the screening process. (The U.S. screening process for refugees is currently more extensive than its screening for any other group.)

Meanwhile, even conservative Christian leaders and institutions traditionally allied with Republican causes have largely declined to defend Trump’s policy. Focus on the Family President Jim Daly told the Atlantic that he believes the U.S. should welcome refugees: “Yazidis and Christians and even Muslims who are persecuted—if we can verify their sincerity, and their story, as we’ve done for centuries, I think it would be wise to be open to a healthy immigration policy that allows people to flee.”

The exceptions have been predictably ugly. Evangelist Franklin Graham, professional loathsome evangelical stereotype and somehow also head of a global humanitarian organization, told the Huffington Post last week that he saw no problem with Trump’s plan. “It’s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that’s not a Bible issue,” he said. Graham first called for a total cessation of Muslim immigration in the summer of 2015, months before Trump picked up on the theme.

The president has gone out of his way to reassure Christians that the new policy doesn’t apply to their fellow believers. He gave an exclusive interview Friday to the conservative Christian Broadcasting Network in which he said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status. While hosting his rallies on the campaign trail, Trump liked to claim that the Obama administration gave preference to Muslim refugees, denying needy Christians entry to the country.

That claim is false.

On Thursday, a panel of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously denied the government’s request to lift a nationwide injunction that had been placed on Donald Trump’s immigration executive order by a lower court. The ruling is about as broad and thorough as opponents of Trump’s de facto Muslim ban could’ve hoped for. It is a considerable triumph for the two states challenging the ban, Washington and Minnesota, and a massive setback for the Trump administration. Given this ruling, it is difficult to see how the executive order could be lawfully reinstated in the near future.

The 9th Circuit panel found that Washington and Minnesota have standing to sue, because they were harmed by the executive order. Specifically, both states’ public universities will suffer under the ban: Prospective students may be barred from entering the country and from attending these schools; faculty members will be unable to engage with the international academic community; and both students and faculty of foreign origin will be “prevented from performing research,” because “some will not be permitted to return if they leave.” Because public universities are organs of the state, an injury to these schools constitutes an injury to the states, conferring standing upon both Washington and Minnesota.

The court also rejected the government’s argument that the executive order is “unreviewable” because it involves “national security concerns.” There is “no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability,” the court held, “which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy. Within our system, it is the role of the judiciary to interpret the law, a duty that will sometimes require the resolution of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches.” The court elaborated:

Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly and explicitly rejected the notion that the political branches have unreviewable authority over immigration or are not subject to the Constitution when policymaking in that context.

The court then explained that the government “has not shown that it is likely to succeed on appeal.” It focused on two specific claims: that the executive order violates due process, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and that it discriminates against Muslims, in violation of both equal protection and the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.

“The Government has not shown that the Executive Order provides what due process requires,” the court noted, “such as notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual’s ability to travel.” Instead, the government argued that “most or all of the individuals affected by the Executive Order have no rights under the Due Process Clause.” But the court found that this assertion is incorrect under established precedent, as well as under the plain language of the clause, which speaks of “person[s],” not citizens. The court then held that the ban presents serious due process concerns and that “the Government has failed to establish that it will likely succeed on its due process argument in this appeal.”

Next, the court considered the religious discrimination claim. Critically, the court found that it could look “beyond the face of the challenged law … in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims.” It noted that “the States have offered evidence of numerous statements by the President about his intent to implement a ‘Muslim ban’ as well as evidence they claim suggests that the Executive Order was intended to be that ban.”

“The States’ claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions,” the court concluded. But it “reserve[d] consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed,” holding that the due process issue was sufficient to justify maintaining the injunction.

Citing the 5th Circuit’s affirmation of a nationwide injunction against President Obama’s deferred deportation program, the court declined to reverse the nationwide injunction issued against Trump’s executive order. “Such a fragmented immigration policy,” it wrote, quoting the 5th Circuit, “would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory requirement for uniform immigration law and policy.” The court then held that the balance of hardships weighed in favor of the states, which would be substantially injured if the ban were reinstated, while no clear harm will come of maintaining the injunction. The executive order, after all, does not really seem to respond to an urgent national security threat:

Although the Government points to the fact that Congress and the Executive identified the seven countries named in the Executive Order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the Government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the Executive Order to be immediately reinstated.

The court also held that consideration of the public interest weighed in favor of maintaining the injunction. “The public,” the court wrote, “has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.”Facebook used to repeat its mission statement so often that most tech reporters could recite it from memory: “To give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” And it’s still the mission you see when you visit the company’s Facebook page. But in a remarkable letter published today, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the severe shortcomings and blind spots that his company’s mission created. Going forward, he said, the company will consider what happens after it connects people — and try to manage those effects for the better. “In times like these,” Zuckerberg wrote, “the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.”

Over 5,800 words, Zuckerberg mentions “social infrastructure” 14 times — without ever quite describing what it is. But at a high level, he writes, he has five goals: to help users build communities that are supportive, that are safe, that are informed, that are civically engaged, and that are inclusive. “For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families,” Zuckerberg writes. “With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community.”

“Our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community.”

Safe, supportive, and inclusive communities should be table stakes for any social networking app, and Facebook has arguably done better on those fronts than many of its peers. It still has plenty of work to do: Zuckerberg described plans to invest more heavily in its Groups product, offer resources to users considering self-harm, and provide more granular content settings to reflect local attitudes.

It’s the piece about making users more informed and civically engaged where Facebook promises to break new ground. The company has been battered in the press since last year’s presidential election, when hoaxes and misinformation spread virally on the platform and likely contributed to Donald Trump’s surprise victory. Zuckerberg was initially dismissive of the idea that Facebook played a role in the election, calling the idea “crazy.”

He has clearly done a lot of thinking since then. In his letter, Zuckerberg repeats previous statements saying the company should do more to combat misinformation. But he then shifts to discussing the way social platforms lead to polarized user bases. It’s worth quoting in full:

Social media is a short-form medium where resonant messages get amplified many times. This rewards simplicity and discourages nuance. At its best, this focuses messages and exposes people to different ideas. At its worst, it oversimplifies important topics and pushes us towards extremes. Polarization exists in all areas of discourse, not just social media. It occurs in all groups and communities, including companies, classrooms and juries, and it's usually unrelated to politics. In the tech community, for example, discussion around AI has been oversimplified to existential fear-mongering. The harm is that sensationalism moves people away from balanced nuanced opinions towards polarized extremes. If this continues and we lose common understanding, then even if we eliminated all misinformation, people would just emphasize different sets of facts to fit their polarized opinions. That's why I'm so worried about sensationalism in media.

Here Zuckerberg is finally reckoning with the most uncomfortable truth about the world’s largest social network. As it has grown to 1.86 billion users, Facebook has pushed us to more extreme political viewpoints. It is not alone in this: talk radio, cable television, newspapers, and Twitter have all played their part. But because of its scale, Facebook’s contribution to the problem is exponentially greater. And Zuckerberg, to his credit, seems determined now to address it.

Finally reckoning with the uncomfortable truth

He talks about providing users with a range of perspectives, rather than presenting “both sides” — a tactic that generally increases polarization. He talks about identifying user behaviors that signal an article shared on Facebook is sensational, and then using those signals to dampen the article’s viral spread. And he writes about ensuring that the users he hopes to inform will then participate in democracy, starting with voting and continuing into experiments around community governance.

In 2015, when Facebook’s status as the most important media distributor in the world was already clear, I called on Facebook to edit its mission statement to reflect its responsibility to make users more informed. “Zuckerberg has spent years talking about Facebook as the next evolution of the newspaper,” I wrote. “But to really be the heir to the newspaper, your mission can’t stop at ‘making the world more open and connected.’ You have to make the world smarter, too.”

In 2016, a world that Facebook made no smarter brought itself to the brink of catastrophe. Today, in a press conference, the president raised the possibility of nuclear Holocaust. Brexit, Trump, and a global assault on democracy were propelled forward by polarization, sensationalism, and misinformation — all of which found a welcome home on Facebook. I’m glad Facebook will now assume some responsibility for the effects its platform is having on the world. But I will never stop asking what might have been had it taken responsibility sooner.John Moore/Getty Images

The Associated Press reported Friday morning that the Trump administration has considered deploying as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to, in the AP's words, "round up" undocumented immigrants, according to an obtained draft memo:

The 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana.

Four states that border on Mexico are included in the proposal—California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas—but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four—Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.

The memo, drafted by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, says that troops in the National Guard force, if authorized for deployment by their respective state governors, would "perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States." As is the case now, deportation orders would be required to send undocumented immigrants back to their home countries, making an immediate mass deportation campaign difficult. The AP says that nearly half of the country's estimated 11.1 million undocumented immigrants are thought to reside in the 11 states covered by the proposal. Spokespeople for the governors of eight of those states told the AP they had no knowledge of the plan and declined to say if they would approve the use of their Guards. The memo was drafted on Jan. 25, before Trump's signing of the Muslim ban.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has denied the AP's report.

Update 11:43 AM, Feb. 17, 2017: White House press secretary Sean Spicer did not deny to reporters Friday morning that the proposal reported by the AP had been discussed in the administration. "I don't know what could potentially be out there," he said, "but I know that there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested. It is not a White House document."

Update 12:04 PM, Feb. 17, 2017: Vox has obtained and released what appears to be the draft memo in the AP's story. Vox's immigration reporter Dara Lind says that the National Guard proposal highlighted by the AP was ultimately rejected by the Department of Homeland Security. The memo does not specify the 100,000 troop number in the AP's report, but Lind writes that the National Guard forces of 11 states would indeed have been asked to enforce immigration laws in the way the AP described. This, as Lind and others have noted, could run afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military forces from being used for law enforcement.

Anything is possible in life and in love, and according to Us Weekly, the most publicized couple of the 21st century has broken up after three glorious months together. Yes, the tabloid reports that Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston have “called it quits.” (!!!!!!!)

Us Weekly claims that “multiple sources” have confirmed the breakup, including one who says it was Swift’s doing. “She was the one to put the brakes on the relationship,” the source said. “Tom wanted the relationship to be more public than she was comfortable with. Taylor knew the backlash that comes with public displays of affection but Tom didn’t listen to her concerns when she brought them up.”

Swift may be uncomfortable with the “backlash” now, but never forget that those first Rhode Island paparazzi photos of the new couple came out at an extremely convenient time for her.

Earlier this week, The Sun — the tabloid that published those Rhode Island photos — reported that Swift was “becoming increasingly worried that Tom…[was] using the relationship to boost his own profile.” Radar, meanwhile, claimed that Hiddleston was the one who wanted out. “It’s become a total charade and Tom is sick of being treated like a glorified escort,” a source told the website.

On Friday, the AP reported that the Trump administration is considering plans to mobilize 100,000 National Guard troops in 11 states to round up, detain, and deport undocumented immigrants. The memo, allegedly written by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and addressed to both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, would militarize immigration enforcement in four states on the Mexican border and seven states contiguous to those four. Governors would be allowed to decide whether the National Guard in their state participated. The memo purports to serve as guidance for implementing the “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements” executive order Trump issued in January. It has reportedly circulated among DHS staff for two weeks.

If implemented, this plan would clearly constitute a deportation force—the kind that Trump boasted about during his campaign. The establishment Republicans who were brought in to sand down Trump’s rougher edges, however, routinely denied that Trump said … exactly what he indisputably said about his “deportation force.” Most notoriously, at the vice presidential debate, Tim Kaine described Trump’s plan for a deportation force, and Mike Pence called his claim “nonsense.” Paul Ryan also told a DACA beneficiary that there would be no deportation force.

The National Security Agency has a secret backdoor into its vast databases under a legal authority enabling it to search for US citizens' email and phone calls without a warrant, according to a top-secret document passed to the Guardian by Edward Snowden.

The previously undisclosed rule change allows NSA operatives to hunt for individual Americans' communications using their name or other identifying information. Senator Ron Wyden told the Guardian that the law provides the NSA with a loophole potentially allowing "warrantless searches for the phone calls or emails of law-abiding Americans".

The authority, approved in 2011, appears to contrast with repeated assurances from Barack Obama and senior intelligence officials to both Congress and the American public that the privacy of US citizens is protected from the NSA's dragnet surveillance programs.

The intelligence data is being gathered under Section 702 of the of the Fisa Amendments Act (FAA), which gives the NSA authority to target without warrant the communications of foreign targets, who must be non-US citizens and outside the US at the point of collection.

The communications of Americans in direct contact with foreign targets can also be collected without a warrant, and the intelligence agencies acknowledge that purely domestic communications can also be inadvertently swept into its databases. That process is known as "incidental collection" in surveillance parlance.

But this is the first evidence that the NSA has permission to search those databases for specific US individuals' communications.

A secret glossary document provided to operatives in the NSA's Special Source Operations division – which runs the Prism program and large-scale cable intercepts through corporate partnerships with technology companies – details an update to the "minimization" procedures that govern how the agency must handle the communications of US persons. That group is defined as both American citizens and foreigners located in the US.

"While the FAA 702 minimization procedures approved on 3 October 2011 now allow for use of certain United States person names and identifiers as query terms when reviewing collected FAA 702 data," the glossary states, "analysts may NOT/NOT [not repeat not] implement any USP [US persons] queries until an effective oversight process has been developed by NSA and agreed to by DOJ/ODNI [Office of the Director of National Intelligence]."

The term "identifiers" is NSA jargon for information relating to an individual, such as telephone number, email address, IP address and username as well as their name.

The document – which is undated, though metadata suggests this version was last updated in June 2012 – does not say whether the oversight process it mentions has been established or whether any searches against US person names have taken place.

Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, has obliquely warned for months that the NSA's retention of Americans' communications incidentally collected and its ability to search through it has been far more extensive than intelligence officials have stated publicly. Speaking this week, Wyden told the Guardian it amounts to a "backdoor search" through Americans' communications data.

"Section 702 was intended to give the government new authorities to collect the communications of individuals believed to be foreigners outside the US, but the intelligence community has been unable to tell Congress how many Americans have had their communications swept up in that collection," he said.

"Once Americans' communications are collected, a gap in the law that I call the 'back-door searches loophole' allows the government to potentially go through these communications and conduct warrantless searches for the phone calls or emails of law-abiding Americans."

Wyden, along with his intelligence committee colleague Mark Udall, have attempted repeatedly to warn publicly about the ability of the intelligence community to look at the communications of US citizens, but are limited by their obligation not to reveal highly classified information.

But in a letter they recently wrote to the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, the two senators warned that a fact sheet released by the NSA in the wake of the initial Prism revelations to reassure the American public about domestic surveillance was misleading.

In the letter, they warned that Americans' communications might be inadvertently collected and stored under Section 702, despite rules stating only data on foreigners should be collected and retained.

"[W]e note that this same fact sheet states that under Section 702, 'Any inadvertently acquired communication of or concerning a US person must be promptly destroyed if it is neither relevant to the authorised purpose nor evidence of a crime,'" they said.

"We believe that this statement is somewhat misleading, in that it implied the NSA has the ability to determine how many American communications it has collected under Section 702, or that the law does not allow the NSA to deliberately search for the records of particular Americans."

The foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court issues approvals annually authorizing such operations, with specific rules on who can be targeted and what measures must be taken to minimize any details "inadvertently" collected on US persons.

Secret minimization procedures dating from 2009, published in June by the Guardian, revealed that the NSA could make use of any "inadvertently acquired" information on US persons under a defined range of circumstances, including if they held usable intelligence, information on criminal activity, threat of harm to people or property, are encrypted or are believed to contain any information relevant to cybersecurity.

At that stage, however, the rules did not appear to allow for searches of collected data relating to specific US persons.

Assurances from Obama and senior administration officials to the American public about the privacy of their communications have relied on the strict definition of what constitutes "targeting" while making no mention of the permission to search for US data within material that has already been collected.

The day after the Guardian revealed details of the NSA's Prism program, President Obama said: "Now, with respect to the internet and emails, this doesn't apply to US citizens and it doesn't apply to people living in the United States."

Speaking at a House hearing on 18 June this year, deputy attorney general James Cole told legislators "[T]here's a great deal of minimization procedures that are involved here, particularly concerning any of the acquisition of information that deals or comes from US persons.

"As I said, only targeting people outside the United States who are not US persons. But if we do acquire any information that relates to a US person, under limited criteria only can we keep it."

Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, said in June 2012 that she believed the intelligence agencies and the Justice Department were sufficiently mindful of Americans' privacy.

"The intelligence community is strictly prohibited from using Section 702 to target a US person, which must at all times be carried out pursuant to an individualized court order based upon probable cause," Feinstein stated in a report provided to the Senate record.

While there are several congressional proposals to constrain the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records, there has to date been much less legislative appetite to abridge its powers under Section 702 – as lawmakers are satisfied it doesn't sufficiently violate Americans' privacy.

"702 is focused outside the United States at non-citizens," said Adam Schiff, a member of the House intelligence committee. "The evidence of the effectiveness of 702 is much more substantial than 215 [the bulk phone records collection]. So I think there are fewer fourth amendment concerns and more evidence of the saliency of the program."

Wyden and Udall – both of whom say foreign surveillance conducted under Section 702 has legitimate value for US national security – have tried and failed to restrict the NSA's ability to collect and store Americans' communications that it accidentally acquires.

Wyden told the Guardian that he raised concerns about the loophole with President Obama during an August 1 meeting with legislators about the NSA's surveillance powers.

"I believe that Congress should reform Section 702 to provide better protections for Americans' privacy, and that this could be done without losing the value that this collection provides," he said.

The Guardian put the latest revelations to the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence but no response had been received by the time of publication.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked in a letter to acting GSA Administrator Timothy Horne what actions the agency planned to take in response to a clause of the president’s lease on the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., that prevents the lease holder from holding elected office. Chaffetz also requested the guidelines and policies GSA uses in administering its outlease program.

The oversight chairman’s letter follows his request that GSA send him the full, unredacted copy of Trump’s 60-year lease to operate a hotel at the government-owned building. GSA has said it is examining the issues, and the agency’s inspector general recently added the office is “closely monitoring the matter.”

Earlier this month, Trump made his son, Donald Trump Jr., president of the company that operates the hotel. Critics quickly noted the move changed management control, but not ownership.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the oversight committee’s ranking member, also wrote a letter to GSA this week with seven other Democrats, asking for more information on GSA’s review and data on the company operating the lease. The lawmakers requested the business’ financial information and correspondences with GSA and the Trump transition team. In response to a previous letter, GSA told Cummings officials are assessing new information to determine if the leaseholder is in compliance with the agreement's terms and conditions.

“Once GSA has a full and complete understanding of the tenant’s structure, GSA will determined whether the tenant remains in compliance with the contract,” acting GSA Associate Administrator Saul Japson said.Photos: World War II in pictures German troops march through occupied Warsaw, Poland, after invading the nation on September 1, 1939, and igniting World War II.

At last, Disney has put the galaxy’s largest “singular or plural?” question to rest. In January, the studio revealed that the title of Star Wars: Episode VIII would be The Last Jedi, sparking a debate (à la The Last Samurai) about whether the word Jedi is meant to be singular or plural in this instance.

On Friday we got our answer, thanks to the official French Star Wars Twitter account, which divulged the French title of the film:

Les Derniers Jedi uses the plural form of “Last,” making it indisputable: The Last Jedi definitely refers to multiple Jedi. Other offical foreign accounts soon also posted titles in their languages, all using plural pronouns, in case there was any remaining doubt.

Here's what you need to know. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that the most significant question posed by the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn is why intelligence officials eavesdropped on his calls with the Russian ambassador and later leaked information on those calls to the press.

“I expect for the FBI to tell me what is going on, and they better have a good answer,” said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which is conducting a review of Russian activities to influence the election. “The big problem I see here is that you have an American citizen who had his phone calls recorded.”

Flynn resigned Monday night, days after The Washington Post reported that intelligence officials had recorded Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. before Trump took office. Those recordings, The Post reported, appeared to contradict Flynn’s own claims that he had not discussed easing U.S. sanctions on Russia.

Although it remains unclear whether Flynn himself was being monitored for any reason, his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were intercepted because the Russians’ calls are routinely monitored.

The president also criticized the leaks in a tweet early Tuesday morning.

Separately Tuesday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said he had no plans to further probe links between Flynn and Russia. “It’s taken care of itself at this point,” he said.

Facing reporters, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) brushed off questions about whether Congress needs to further investigate the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia, saying he was “not going to prejudge the circumstances” of Flynn’s calls. Ryan suggested he was most troubled that Flynn may have misled Vice President Pence about the substance of the calls.

“I think the president made the right decision,” he said. “You cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters, Feb. 14, on the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, "As soon as this person lost the president's trust, the president asked for his resignation." (Reuters)

Nunes said he was dismayed that those recordings had leaked, citing a complex process for tapping communications involving U.S. citizens and then “unmasking” it for intelligence use.

The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), said late Monday that Flynn resignation “does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians.”

“These alleged contacts and any others the Trump campaign may have had with the Kremlin are the subject of the House Intelligence Committee’s ongoing investigation,” he said in a statement. “Moreover, the Trump Administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn’s conversations with the Ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the President or any other officials, or with their knowledge.”

Nunes said it was “very hard to believe” that Flynn was acting as “some sort of secret Russian agent.”

He also said he saw some hypocrisy in the response of Democrats to the Flynn recording.

“Where are all the privacy groups screaming now?” he asked.If humans are going to go to Mars, or mine asteroids, then recycling is going to matter. And that means recycling everything — including human waste.

NASA has put some effort into solving the problem, because recycling is such an essential part of building a spaceship that can get people to Mars or anywhere else. Interplanetary missions won’t be able to get supplies from Earth. Resources will be limited, and that means "closing the loop" — you can’t afford to throw away anything, not even human poop. Any spacecraft design has to take that into account.

"You have to start with a life support system and build a spacecraft around it," says Marc Cohen, president of Astrotecture, a consulting firm that specializes in space architecture.

The Story So Far

First a few facts about human poop. A healthy person produces about 128 grams of feces per day, or about 46.7 kilograms (102 pounds) in a year, according to the medical literature. For a mission to Mars that might last two to three years, a crew of six (as posited in The Martian) would generate 300 pounds of feces each.

In the Apollo era, the toilet was a plastic bag attached to the astronaut's butt

In the Apollo era, the toilet was a plastic bag attached to the astronauts’ butts with an adhesive. Urine was collected with a condom-like device and vented to space. Famously — or infamously — the last Mercury flight in 1963 actually suffered system failures because the urine collection bag leaked. Clearly, the bags didn’t work. Floating human waste is also a health hazard, since one can inhale tiny bits of urine or feces as they float around.



Don Rethke, also known as Doctor Flush (Image provided by Rethke)

Enter Don "Doctor Flush" Rethke, a retired engineer from Hamilton Standard, now UTC Aerospace Systems. Rethke goes way back with NASA; he worked on life support for the Apollo 13 mission. He designed a commode that takes in urine and feces separately. It used suction — essential because in zero-g, liquids turn to spheres and float around, and solid waste won’t just fall into the bowl. Urine was collected in a cup-like contraption, while the solid stuff was sucked into a container and exposed to the vacuum — effectively freeze-dried and compressed. "We called them fecal patties," Rethke says.

A variation of his design is on the International Space Station, with two big differences: one is that the urine is now treated so that the water can be removed and reused, and the other is that the new system doesn’t freeze-dry the feces. (The ISS recycling system also takes in moisture from the air, which is largely astronauts’ sweat and exhalations.) As for the solid waste, during the shuttle era it was just brought back. On the ISS, it’s stored in plastic or metal containers. When those fill up, astronauts load them onto a used Russian Progress vehicle, unlock it from the ISS, and let it fall to Earth to burn in the atmosphere, along with the rest of the ISS’s garbage. (Think of that the next time you see a meteor shower.)



The Space Shuttle's waste collection system (Thomas J. Stapleton et al.)

Throwing feces out an airlock is not an option, for a couple of reasons. One is that anything jettisoned from the spacecraft won’t go very far away without a substantial push. So if you throw something outside, it will simply follow your trajectory — any waste thrown "away" would follow you all the way to Mars. Pushing it away would mean something like opening an air lock with some air still in it, to provide a kind of explosive decompression. That would waste air.

Then there’s that trajectory problem — even if the waste moves some distance away, blocks of it might drift to various points around the ship, entering unpredictable orbits. (During the shuttle and Apollo eras, it wasn’t unusual for the spacecraft to meet clouds of urine-ice crystals that had been vented previously.) Dumping out a container behind the spacecraft is, as a result, quite dangerous. "When you near your objective you’re going to make a sudden stop," says John W. Fisher, of NASA’s Ames Research Center, who has written several papers on recycling waste in space. "If you slam on the brakes, it’s going to hit you in the rear end." A pound bag of anything hitting a decelerating spacecraft can pack a lot of force.

The second problem is that some human feces — now freeze-dried in space — would probably settle back on the ship; absent a substantial push, the turds will just hang around. The poop, now in a powdery, crystalline form, would get on the windows, says Fisher. It would foul optical sensors as well. Unlike bird droppings on a windshield, there’s no way to squeegee it off.

So you have to store it, Rethke says. In the early days of the shuttle commode, they thought of refrigeration to keep the bacteria from growing. "That takes energy, and you have to back it up with a redundant system," he says.

Besides, throwing feces away is actually the last thing space crews want to do — there’s too much useful stuff in it. About 75 percent of it is water, along with bacteria from our guts and human cells. Some 80 percent of the solid mass is organic molecules, which means compounds containing carbon. About a quarter of that is bacterial biomass, another quarter is protein, another is undigested plant matter (mostly the fiber), and a smaller percentage is fat. Organic chemicals and water are like gold in space.

On Mars, human poop, at the very least, would make a good fertilizer to grow food, Rethke says. "I would put it into a mushroom patch — let Mars take care of it."

Reuse, Recycle

Human feces aren’t the only thing you need to recycle. People produce a lot of garbage. All this adds complexity to the problem of recycling and reuse. Any machines for doing that have to be light, because launching anything into orbit is pricey, thousands of dollars per pound. Those machines also have to be small, because there’s only so much room in a space module. And they have to work reliably and be easy to fix, because there’s no calling for help between Earth and Mars.



Waste collection system on the ISS (Stapleton et al.)

Jay Perry, lead aerospace engineer for environmental control and life support systems at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, says designing such systems is complicated. Take urine, for example: separating water from urine is relatively straightforward on Earth, but in a zero-gravity environment, the situation changes.

For example, weightless astronauts’ bones lose mass and density, since there’s no loading on them. This is why current astronauts on the ISS have a strict exercise regimen. The bone mass gets excreted as calcium in then gets into the urine. That places a limit on how much water can be pulled out, because eventually the remaining stuff is a concentrated brine, "unpleasant stuff to deal with." A 2013 study by United Technologies Aerospace Systems noted that the calcium forms small kidney stones, which can clog up the valves on toilets.

Human feces pose similar challenges, both because of zero gravity and figuring out which chemicals you want to save. In addition there’s the question of the necessary energy and the complexity of the system you want to build. The United Technologies study, for example, noted that current space toilets use machines to compress the poop. That adds complexity — instead, the study proposes a manual lever, which requires no power (except that provided by the crew member’s arm).

While there are a lot of useful chemicals in poop, separating every one of them isn’t easy. Chemical toilets and septic tanks would be useless. Chemical toilets don’t really work because the very compounds used to break down waste would still need to be sent up with the astronauts. You’d also need hundreds to thousands of gallons of that blue-dyed stuff for a years-long journey, and most of it is water — effectively you’d be adding tons of water that would only be used in toilets, which isn’t very efficient. Septic tanks depend on gravity to work — and you still have to store the feces somewhere.

Rethke says he favored using natural biodegradation; simply allowing the fecal material (and whatever else — "menstrual waste, vomitus, it’s all in there") from the commode to ferment in a metal container with some activated charcoal to stop the odors. The container could release gas — almost all would be carbon dioxide — which the spacecraft’s scrubbers could handle well enough. He even built such a device. "I put it on my desk for several months," he says. "Nobody noticed." Once astronauts get to Mars, the stuff in the containers could be fertilizer. The down side is the storage — the volumes would start to add up.

weird as it may sound, poop may make for good radiation shielding

Weird as it may sound, poop may provide good radiation shielding. In space, there are two sources of ionizing radiation that could harm astronauts. One is the background of galactic cosmic rays (or GCR). The other is a solar storm, known as a "solar particle event" or SPE. Both consist of charged particles, mostly protons.

These sources of radiation are less of a problem for ISS astronauts because they are still inside the Earth’s protective magnetic field. But once astronauts leave that field, the SPE could cause acute radiation sickness, while cosmic rays increase the risk of cancer.



Soyuz waste collection system (Stapleton et al.)

The most efficient shielding is solid hydrogen because the element more easily deflects flying particles. But solid hydrogen isn’t available outside of a gas giant, and liquid hydrogen is difficult to handle, needing high pressures, cryogenic temperatures, or both. The next best thing is water, which has lots of hydrogen in it, or polyethylene. Metal shielding like lead, which provides good protection against gamma and X-rays, is actually worse than no shielding at all, because the protons hit the atoms in the metal and create cascades of other particles, creating even more harmful radiation.

Jack Miller, a nuclear physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, along with Michael Flynn and Marc Cohen of NASA’s Ames Research Center, conducted an experiment funded by a grant from NASA to see how well human waste would work as radiation shielding. He and his colleagues couldn’t use real feces; instead they used a simulated poo made out of miso, peanut oil, propylene glycol, psyllium husks, salt, urea, and yeast. The goal was not to exactly duplicate the actual chemicals in feces; they wanted something roughly like it that held water and absorbed radiation and particles similarly.

They put it in a particle beam to see how well it absorbed the energy of flying protons. The beam was about as energetic as particles typically found in space. The fecal simulator absorbed a measurable amount of the energy, and the team found that the thickness matters. Too thin and the problem gets worse for the same reason that metals are bad shielding — the spaceborne particles make cascades. However, they were able to calculate that a fecal shield about 8 to 11 inches thick would cut down the radiation dose a lot. That was a good result, though Miller noted that the situation is more complex.

Remember, there are two kinds of radiation in outer space: the SPEs and the background radiation from cosmic rays. Cosmic rays carry five times as much energy as SPE particles do, and they’re the ones that can increase the risk of cancer. (NASA rules say the increased risk to astronauts shouldn’t be more than 3 percent above the general population.) The fecal simulator wasn’t as good at stopping those, but that was expected. "The energy of GCR is so high it will punch through just about anything," Miller says. "So you try to balance getting the risk as low as reasonably achievable."

You can't simply put the feces in sealed bags or metal containers

Another issue is that you can’t simply put the feces in sealed bags or metal containers because the CO2 and other gases they generate could make them explode, absent some "breathing" mechanism as in Rethke’s vision of making fertilizer. So sterilizing the waste might be a good idea.

To do that, some proposed systems effectively burn the waste, without oxygen present, a process called pyrolysis. This also allows for more immediate use of the water. Advanced Fuel Research, a company in East Hartford, Connecticut, is exploring a variation called torrefaction (which takes less energy to do than straight-up pyrolysis). The waste gets heated to around 550 degrees Fahrenheit, (300 degrees Celsius). What’s left is something compact and dry, mostly carbon. At the same time it retains a lot of hydrogen.

Rethke notes one trade-off with pyrolysis or torrefaction is what to do with the leftover carbon. "If it’s a brick that’s one thing," he says. "But powder is harder." Remember there’s no gravity, so any particles are going to float around and could foul air intakes. So you’d need some way of compacting the carbon to store it.



Russian toilet module on ISS (Stapleton et al.)

Torrefaction has other challenges too, says Michael Serio, the president of Advanced Fuel Research. (He’s authored two papers on the subject, and has more work — involving bird and dog manure — forthcoming.) While some materials will reduce to ash, others won’t. Cotton, for example, contains hemicellulose, which doesn’t break down as well. "A cotton T-shirt would just look like a burned T-shirt," he says.

One could just make all the waste into bricks, Serio says. You take all the garbage — food wrappers, human waste, everything — and heat it up enough to melt it into a brick. This reduces volume and detoxifies the waste. That’s good for making partial radiation shields or even, Serio says, bricks for a Martian (or Lunar) habitat. Serio is working with other companies to see if there’s a way to build some kind of heated recycling into a commode itself. The big challenge would be making it compact and fast enough so that it doesn’t put the toilet out of commission for extended periods.

These recycling technologies are all promising enough. Cohen, though, expressed some frustration at the way NASA has approached funding. Cohen, a co-investigator with Miller and Ray Flynn of Ames on the radiation shielding experiments, says there has been little development beyond simple demonstrators. NASA isn’t planning a Mars mission explicitly — the closest they’ve come is a road map. "There’s been such deep cutbacks it’s difficult to get anything funded," he says.

Even so, NASA will have to come up with something if the agency is serious about going out of Earth orbit — even if only to return to the Moon. "What NASA would like is you drop a bag of poop into a canister — maybe process it right below the commode," says Serio.

Rethke added that whatever system is in place also has to have built-in redundancy and some way to fix it. Natural bacteria, he notes, do a fine job of breaking stuff down, don’t need complex machinery to operate, use no electricity, and produce some very useful chemicals in the process. (Carbon dioxide, for instance, can be "burned" with hydrogen to make methane and water.) That’s one reason he likes natural biodegradation. "It’s all about how much power to use for reclamation, versus storage, versus the weight," Rethke says. "I like to keep things simple."

We regret the error.National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”

On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

Flynn’s contacts with the ambassador attracted attention within the Obama administration because of the timing. U.S. intelligence agencies were then concluding that Russia had waged a cyber campaign designed in part to help elect Trump; his senior adviser on national security matters was discussing the potential consequences for Moscow, officials said.

[FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit]

The talks were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said. In a recent interview, Kislyak confirmed that he had communicated with Flynn by text message, by phone and in person, but declined to say whether they had discussed sanctions.

The emerging details contradict public statements by incoming senior administration officials including Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. They acknowledged only a handful of text messages and calls exchanged between Flynn and Kislyak late last year and denied that either ever raised the subject of sanctions.

“They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence said in an interview with CBS News last month, noting that he had spoken with Flynn about the matter. Pence also made a more sweeping assertion, saying there had been no contact between members of Trump’s team and Russia during the campaign. To suggest otherwise, he said, “is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”

Neither of those assertions is consistent with the fuller account of Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak provided by officials who had access to reports from U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies that routinely monitor the communications of Russian diplomats. Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.

“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.

A third official put it more bluntly, saying that either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke. An administration official stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn. The sanctions in question have so far remained in place.

The nature of Flynn’s pre-inauguration message to Kislyak triggered debate among officials in the Obama administration and intelligence agencies over whether Flynn had violated a law against unauthorized citizens interfering in U.S. disputes with foreign governments, according to officials familiar with that debate. Those officials were already alarmed by what they saw as a Russian assault on the U.S. election.

U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.

Officials also cited political sensitivities. Prominent Americans in and out of government are so frequently in communication with foreign officials that singling out one individual — particularly one poised for a top White House job — would invite charges of political persecution.

Former U.S. officials also said aggressive enforcement would probably discourage appropriate contact. Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that he was in Moscow meeting with officials in the weeks leading up to Obama’s 2008 election win.

“As a former diplomat and U.S. government official, one needs to be able to have contact with foreigners to do one’s job,” McFaul said. McFaul, a Russia scholar, said he was careful never to signal pending policy changes before Obama took office.

On Wednesday, Flynn said that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. Kislyak helped coordinate that trip, Flynn said.

Flynn said that he spoke to Kislyak on a range of subjects in late December, including arranging a call between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Trump after the inauguration and expressing his condolences after Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated. “I called to say I couldn’t believe the murder of their ambassador,” Flynn said. Asked whether there was any mention of sanctions in his communications with Kislyak, Flynn said, “No.”

Kislyak characterized his conversations with Flynn as benign during a brief interview at a conference this month. “It’s something all diplomats do,” he said.

Kislyak said that he had been in contact with Flynn since before the election, but declined to answer questions about the subjects they discussed. Kislyak is known for his assiduous cultivation of high-level officials in Washington and was seated in the front row of then-GOP candidate Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April of last year. The ambassador would not discuss the origin of his relationship with Flynn.

In his CBS interview, Pence said that Flynn had “been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That’s exactly what the incoming national security adviser should do.”

Official concern about Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak was heightened when Putin declared on Dec. 30 that Moscow would not retaliate after the Obama administration announced a day earlier the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and the forced closure of Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York.

Instead, Putin said he would focus on “the restoration of ­Russia-United States relations” after Obama left office, and put off considering any retaliatory measures until Moscow had a chance to evaluate Trump’s policies.

Trump responded with effusive praise for Putin. “Great move on the delay,” he said in a posting to his Twitter account. “I always knew he was very smart.”

Putin’s reaction cut against a long practice of reciprocation on diplomatic expulsions, and came after his foreign minister had vowed that there would be reprisals against the United States.

Putin’s muted response — which took White House officials by surprise — raised some officials’ suspicions that Moscow may have been promised a reprieve, and triggered a search by U.S. spy agencies for clues.

“Something happened in those 24 hours” between Obama’s announcement and Putin’s response, a former senior U.S. official said. Officials began poring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications and diplomatic cables, and saw evidence that Flynn and Kislyak had communicated by text and telephone around the time of the announcement.

Trump transition officials acknowledged those contacts weeks later after they were reported in The Washington Post but denied that sanctions were discussed. Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said Jan. 13 that Flynn had “reached out to” the Russian ambassador on Christmas Day to extend holiday greetings. On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

Other officials were categorical. “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever,” a senior transition official told The Post at the time. When Pence faced questions on television that weekend, he said “those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.”

Current and former U.S. officials said that assertion was not true.

Like Trump, Flynn has shown an affinity for Russia that is at odds with the views of most of his military and intelligence peers. Flynn raised eyebrows in 2015 when he appeared in photographs seated next to Putin at a lavish party in Moscow for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network.

In an earlier interview with The Post, Flynn acknowledged that he had been paid through his speakers bureau to give a speech at the event and defended his attendance by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels, including CNN.

[Trump adviser Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and why Russia Today is just like CNN]

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn served multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — tours in which he held a series of high-level intelligence assignments working with U.S. Special Operations forces hunting al-Qaeda operatives and Islamist militants.

Former colleagues said that narrow focus led Flynn to see the threat posed by Islamist groups as overwhelming other security concerns, including Russia’s renewed aggression. Instead, Flynn came to see America’s long-standing adversary as a potential ally against terrorist groups, and himself as being in a unique position to forge closer ties after traveling to Moscow in 2013 while serving as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Flynn has frequently boasted that he was the first DIA director to be invited into the headquarters of Russia’s military intelligence directorate, known as the GRU, although at least one of his predecessors was granted similar access. “Flynn thought he developed some rapport with the GRU chief,” a former senior U.S. military official said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say they have tied the GRU to Russia’s theft of troves of email messages from Democratic Party computer networks and accuse Moscow of then delivering those materials to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published them in phases during the campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival.

Flynn was pushed out of the DIA job in 2014 amid concerns about his management of the sprawling agency. He became a fierce critic of the Obama administration before joining the Trump campaign last year.

More Coverage Las Vegas Outlaws fold, replaced by Portland in arena football playoffs

The decision by Arena Football League officials to deny the Las Vegas Outlaws taking part in the playoffs has outraged fans, TV commentators, Outlaws coach Aaron Garcia, players and team owner hometown rocker Vince Neil of Motley Crue. A storm of sports media reports supports Vince’s position.

ESPN co-anchor Steve Levy said: “Not letting a pro team go to the playoffs when they earned their spot is unprecedented in any sport.”

Aaron told the team early today: “The AFL is a single entity. The league employs the players and coaches. That is the reason that in the past, teams not in good standing have still played in the playoffs, and there had never been a canceled game due to finances. We have been singled out.”

The furor began after the Outlaws made the playoffs, all the more an amazing feat since it was the team’s first season.

AFL guru Adam Markowitz wrote on the fan website ArenaFan.com: “For the first time in Arena Football League history, a team which has qualified for the post season won’t get the opportunity to play in it.

“The Las Vegas Outlaws were officially shut down by the AFL on Sunday, creating a massive storm in the National Conference playoff picture. Las Vegas, which rightfully qualified for the second season by finishing 5-12-1, now cedes its position to the Portland Thunder, who finished at 5-13.”

A recent game by the Outlaws against the New Orleans VooDoo, who also officially ceased operations Sunday, was canceled, which led to the Outlaws getting a tie, which landed them in the playoffs. Then came Sunday night’s decision to end the Outlaws because it didn’t have proper ownership.

Vince told me while taking a day off in Detroit after seven consecutive Motley Crue farewell tour concerts: “This goes against everything the league stands for. The thought of it is mind-boggling. If you deserve to go, you go. There’s always the possibility we could have won the playoffs if we’d been allowed to play in them since we qualified.

“I’d like to clear the air over the current situation. All I ever wanted to do was to bring football to Las Vegas. I love football and Las Vegas. Bob Hewko and I formed a group and found an investor, and the league awarded us the franchise, with us having a contract for a percentage of the team.

“The investor was the managing partner who paid the bills and ran the team, business dealings, sponsorships and finances. That wasn’t our responsibility. Bob and I had nothing to do with any finances. The investor did all that. I brought in Dollar Loan Center as our main sponsor.

The managing partner of the team was California businessman Sohrob Farudi. He has said that he paid his investment not only in full, but also more dollar funding than was required under the terms of the agreement.

Vince continued: “We discovered that bills weren’t getting paid. We didn’t know they’d stopped being paid. I tried to keep it going by putting out fires, paying a bill here and there myself.

“Sports teams survive on sponsorships. It’s the sponsors who keep all sports alive, and unfortunately Las Vegas did not step up as much as we envisioned with sufficient sponsorships.

“Bob and I tried to find another investor even though the season was ending. The league did pay some of the bills, but then pulled the rug right out from under us. We have investors interested for next season, but not right at the end of our first go round. We were only two games away.

“They dropped the bomb on us yesterday (Sunday). We would have paid for the team to have gone to the playoffs. They should have said we deserved to play. It simply isn’t fair not to let us play. To make it into the playoffs for a first-year team is amazing. They should do it for our players who’ve played their hearts out all year and also Las Vegas.”

Adam reported: “I understand that there are more fans in Portland who are going to be happy to see their team play in the second season than there are upset fans in Las Vegas that their team is finished. It’s the third time since 2010 that the city of Las Vegas, which is the league’s headquarters, has had its team either move or fold.

“Even when the 2013 Chicago Rush were homeless and ownerless, they were granted a chance to play for a championship in the playoffs. Las Vegas won’t get that opportunity.”

Said Vince: “I’m hoping that there will be enough of a furor kicked up by the media and fans over this decision that the league will overturn it and let the Outlaws play. I know that I can get the costs covered. There should be a team in Las Vegas, and it will start up again, and we’ll continue to be a part of it.

“The Outlaws will be back for next season. It would be great, though, if we get to play in the playoffs first, especially since the team had earned its berth.”

Q. Christmas presents or Planned Parenthood?: My family and I don’t see eye to eye on most political topics. They are very religious and they have very strong negative opinions about homosexuality. I support marriage equality, have many gay friends, and am not religious. We often fight about religion and politics because I cannot understand how they can call themselves Christians and still condemn people for who they are and whom they love. I also am pro-choice and stand firmly with Planned Parenthood. I don’t know what my family’s stand on choice and PP is, but considering their other political views, I could imagine their being against Planned Parenthood. I have already donated money to PP and would like to donate even more. I also want to make clear to my family that I stand with my political views. Can I donate money to Planned Parenthood in the name of my family members instead of buying them presents? Or would that be a mean thing to do if this is a cause they would not support?

Advertisement



A: It would be rude! Give all the money you want to Planned Parenthood—it’s a wonderful organization that does great work—but do it under your own name. It sounds like you and your family members are already very clear on each other’s political views; making a donation to an organization they don’t support instead of buying them Christmas presents would be unnecessarily antagonistic.

Q. My parents “politely” open my mail for me: I go to college in another state, but I still live at home with my parents over breaks. Whenever I come home, there is a pile of opened mail on my desk waiting for me. I’ve asked my parents not to read my mail, but they say they are only opening it for me and leaving it there. I have my doubts about that. My mail tends to be innocuous (like bills from my university), but I’m worried someday something sensitive will come in the mail that I won’t want them to see. Am I wrong to distrust my parents? How should I approach this?

Subscribe to Prudie!

A: It’s not wrong to ask someone not to open your mail. It is, in fact, a federal offense to open mail that has not been addressed to you, even if you’re related to the person. Since you’ve already asked them to stop opening your letters and they’ve kept on doing it, I doubt they’ll respond well to “Technically, I could report you to the U.S. Postal Service.” Have your mail forwarded to your school address (you can also rent a P.O. box quite cheaply) through the USPS website. If they can’t be trusted to leave your mail alone, remove the temptation.

Q. Dating for two months, now I’m pregnant: I’ve been seeing my current boyfriend for a little over two months, and everything is going really well. However, I have been irregularly taking my birth control pills and had fully believed that I was unable to get pregnant (which I realize now was foolish). I’m about seven weeks pregnant. I intend to get an abortion. My concern is whether or not I need to tell him. I have more or less decided not to. I think it would upset him or make him worry about me. He doesn’t want kids (yet), so I’m sure this would be his choice as well. But this is my consequence to deal with entirely because I was irresponsible. And yet I don’t want to keep a secret from someone I could have a future with. I don’t think, given the circumstances, this is a big deal, but he might. My friends say, “Your body, your choice” and to keep it to myself. But everything I’ve ever read in this column makes me think honesty is the most important thing.

Advertisement



A: You may not need to tell him, but you may also decide that you want to tell him, which are two very different things. Part of the point of being in a relationship with someone is that you support one another emotionally. Inviting someone you’re seeing to worry with you is how you build intimacy. It sounds like you believe he would agree with your decision to get an abortion, so it’s not as if you’re trying to keep this from him for fear of how he might react; rather, you’ve decided to handle this alone because you want to punish yourself for not taking your birth control consistently.

Whether you decide to tell him you’re having an abortion or not, I think the two of you should have a serious conversation about contraception; you should introduce a second level of protection like condoms so that the burden of not getting pregnant doesn’t fall solely on you.

You can keep this to yourself. You do not have to keep this to yourself. I hope you can see that distinction and realize that while it’s important to take birth control regularly (it sounds like you’re planning on doing so in the future), you do not “deserve” a solitary, shameful, self-flagellating abortion experience as punishment.

Q. Free law: I am a lawyer at a practice dealing primarily with family law. I’m very close with my own family, which is huge, full of cousins, and especially full of ex-spouses. At almost every family event, I’m accosted by two or three relatives who want some free legal advice on how to deal with Ex-Wife No. 1, or how to write To-Be-Ex-Husband No. 2 out of the will, etc. I’m happy to talk to my relatives about their family situations, but dispensing free legal advice feels unethical and weird. How do I shut down these conversations without offending my family?

Advertisement



A: When will people learn not to ask for free legal and medical advice from friends and relatives? A smile and a “Sorry, I can’t give legal advice to anyone who’s not a client” should hopefully put them off. Any other lawyers out there want to share their strategies for kindly deflecting requests for free legal aid?

Q. Strange dating world: A friend and I are mutually interested in each other, but her girlfriend doesn’t want her to get involved with me. They’re in an open relationship, and the only reasoning she gave was that we were “close friends.” I don’t want to cause trouble for my friend and her girlfriend, but it seems like a weird double standard. I maybe am just confused by the whole poly queer dating scene altogether. Maybe I should just adopt more cats.

A: Being in an open relationship doesn’t necessarily mean either partner can date any person without checking in at any time. Some couples are comfortable with their partners dating someone they’re already friends with, some aren’t. Two people in an open relationship might have a lot of rules they’ve agreed upon about what they are and aren’t willing to do with other people. They might not seem fair or sensible to someone else, but these are the rules that work for them. If this woman’s girlfriend is uncomfortable at the prospect of you two dating because of your pre-existing friendship, then that’s a good enough reason not to do it.

All dating can be confusing! Throwing queer polyamory into the mix can be an added complication, certainly, and it may or may not be the scene for you. But just because things didn’t work out in this particular instance doesn’t mean you have to give up entirely; you have more options than just this one woman or a life of solitary cat-tending. There will be, I hope, many queer couples in your future just bursting at the seams to date and/or approve of you. Sail on in the direction of those gay open waters!

Q. Re: Parents opening mail: I think they are reading your mail. I would open my adult children’s mail if I’m paying for their schooling, have any sort of joint financial accounts (student checking, auto insurance), or still supporting them in general. Especially if they aren’t going to be around to open it themselves for several weeks. Maybe this is wrong? If it’s obviously some kind of personal card or letter, I would leave it for them.

A: One vote for “they’re definitely reading your mail.”

Q. Re: Free law: I’ve been in the same boat. You should look into whether your law firm’s policies permit you to dispense legal advice outside of firm business. (A number of firms/policies do not permit employees to do so due to malpractice concerns.) If the policy doesn’t permit it, it seems like an easy out: ”I wish I could give you more concrete advice, but I can’t because of my practice’s policies!”

A: I do love an easy out.

Advertisement



Q. Re: Free law: Shut down the conversation by saying that you aren’t permitted to provide legal advice to family members. Generally, providing legal advice to a relative—even if by marriage—is a violation of the Professional Responsibility Code in many jurisdictions. You’re right if you sense it to be unethical—it could subject you to sanctions if someone complained about your advice to the bar.

A: Even better!

Q. I’ve made a huge mistake: I foolishly moved across the country for a boy. I got a job in the city where he lived, which I hate, and moved in with him about 10 months ago. This was also in spite of my mother, who insisted I was making a mistake, and I’ve been desperate to prove her wrong. I’ve been in denial for a while, but I’m really struggling. I’m unsatisfied with my job, haven’t been able to create a support system here, and, if I’m being honest with myself, I’m deeply unhappy in my relationship. First, how do I swallow my pride and get out of this? Second, logistically speaking, how do I break a lease, and break it off with my boyfriend? He’s sweet and kind, and I don’t want to hurt him, but I’m ready to move on. Have I picked the worst time? Should I stick it out until my lease is up?

A: Logistics first: Most leases are for a year, so I’m guessing you have another two months to go before yours is up (this depends, I suppose, on whether your name is also on the lease agreement, or if it’s just his). Check with your local tenants’ union, as laws vary from state to state; you’ll also want to reread your lease agreement to see if it mentions an early termination fee. It may be cheaper to pay the last two months’ rent up front rather than try to get out of your lease early. You’re going to have to hurt your boyfriend, unfortunately; hurting him can’t be helped, but you can be as conscientious as possible in the moving-out process. Be kind, be honest, and give him as much advance notice as you can so he can arrange a new living situation.

As for pride-swallowing, isn’t it the absolute worst? Wouldn’t it be so much better to never be wrong? Isn’t the smugness of an “I told you so” almost impossible to bear? But it would be so much worse to stay in a relationship and a city where you’re clearly miserable because of the sunk-cost fallacy.

Q. Re: Dating for two months, now I’m pregnant: Prudie, you missed a great opportunity to spread the word on the value of LARCs (long-acting reversible contraception) in preventing pregnancy. Current versions of the IUDs are extremely safe, much more effective than the pill, and are even recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for precisely the reason the writer got pregnant. Once you have the device, there is no compliance issue. I have used an IUD for over 10 years and absolutely love it.

A: Oh, thank you for this (and shame on me for forgetting to recommend some additional forms of birth control)! Lots of people find taking a daily birth control pill difficult for a variety of reasons. An IUD may be a great alternative.

Q. Mother’s love: My fiancé (who is almost 30) still gives his mom a peck on the lips whenever they see each other. Normal?

A: My verdict: odd (I don’t kiss any of my family members on the lips and don’t know anyone else who does) but not a deal-breaker. A peck on the lips is a little strange, but it’s not as if this is a new habit; it’s just how they express affection in that family. Pay it no mind!SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Karl Rove acolyte Michael Dubke has worked his way into President Donald Trump’s White House according to reports surfacing late Thursday.

Dubke, who CNN’s Jim Acosta reported on Thursday night would be the new White House communications director, has a storied history of working with Karl Rove—the former George W. Bush White House aide and anti-Trump Republican whom the president made clear over the course of the 2016 campaign he does not like.

GOP operative and Crossroads Media founder Mike Dubke expected to be named new WH comms director, I'm told. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 17, 2017

Dubke will work along with Sean Spicer who remains press secretary according to two administration officials. https://t.co/MjG64U1JxH — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 17, 2017

Breitbart News has independently confirmed that Dubke is set to be named communications director, though an announcement has not yet been made. He was spotted at the White House on Thursday.

Am told Mike Dubke will be comms director, which @Acosta just reported. Here he is hiding in plain sight at Trump presser 2 over from Spicer pic.twitter.com/Mc7Bfd67kw — Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) February 17, 2017

The decision to bring in Dubke is puzzling, as he is not just any Rove confidante. In 2001, he actually founded one of Rove’s main firms, Crossroads Media, LLC—a media firm that provides services to Rove’s American Crossroads. He is still listed on the Rove firm’s website as a founder of the outfit.

President Trump is very suspicious of Rove and his acolytes and has made that point clear for years now. In an interview with Breitbart News back in April 2016, the now-President of the United States said that Rove is a “is such a dishonorable guy” that he “shouldn’t be allowed to write for the Wall Street Journal.”

In that interview, Trump was responding to a Rove column in the Wall Street Journal that was headlined “Vanity Will Be The Donald’s Undoing.”

“Karl Rove writes articles and he quotes me with things I never said,” Trump said in the phone interview with Breitbart News back then. “He actually makes up quotes, and it is so disgraceful that he’s allowed to do it, and he writes in the Wall Street Journal, which is a newspaper that totally misrepresents so much. Karl Rove—I’m just reading this—and he’s quoting me on things I’ve never said. He’s literally making up quotes.”

Of course, Rove’s piece ended up being completely untrue. Trump went on to win the Republican nomination for president just a few weeks later, and would go on to beat Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton in the general election on Nov. 8.

Trump has also called Rove a “totally incompetent jerk,” a “proven loser,” and said that if he were now former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes he would have pulled him off the air.

CNN’s Acosta correctly noted that Trump allies are bewildered as to why, after all of that, a Rove ally would find his way into the White House.

Dubke's work with Crossroads Media is rankling some longtime Trump loyalists who would rather see a veteran from campaign in Comms job. https://t.co/2aZq0132ZC — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 17, 2017

This isn’t the world I wanted.

Let’s be honest; this isn’t the world anyone wanted. Except for maybe about a thousand sociopaths with the grift sense to be making a killing, and a few tens of thousands of disaster preppers who get to say I told you so.

It’s not even the future the people who voted for it wanted: They got sold what my grandfather would have called a bill of goods. The fact that some of the rest of us have figured out how to make a living off the carnage, in a small way, doesn’t mean we’re happy about it. It just means we’re keeping our heads above water in hard times.

Which was why I was staring at the brief for the alticle I was supposed to be writing, frowning, while the timer on my screen ticked down from 30 minutes. I’d accepted the brief: an easy one, not much research required to sell it.

Then I’d started thinking about it.

Advertisement



Now I had under 26 minutes left to bang it out, or I not only wasn’t going to get paid; I was going to get docked for delaying the queue.

Most of the employees at Spin, the boutique news agency I worked for, kept earbuds in. We didn’t need to communicate with each other. The office was basically an old-school boiler-room operation, except instead of dozens of us on phones—shouting, whispering, cajoling—there were dozens of us at rows of linoleum desks, Googling quickly and then typing away.

I can do 120 words per minute, if I get rolling. And I can craft a convincing argument out of hairballs and fake statistics. Hell, I’ve got four-fifths of a journalism degree. Keep your wrist braces on and you can make a pretty good living doing what I do. Especially since Spin gives me a cut of the ad money once an alticle goes above 10,000 impressions.

I must have grunted or sighed, because Carl who sat across from me hit his TRANSMIT key, then glanced at me over our monitors, glasses slipping down his broad nose. He was like me—didn’t like earbuds. Too easy for people to sneak up on you. “Stuck, Winston?”

“Horrified.”

He looked back down. I could see from the colors reflected in his lenses that he was scrolling through briefs, looking for his next newsgig. Flick. Flick. “How bad is it?”

“We can’t keep them out.”

Furrows plowed his face around the frown. “Can’t keep who out?”

Advertisement



“Climate refugees.”

Flick. Flick. “They voted for it.”

Not much I could say to that. Yes but. They were duped into thinking it wasn’t real. Yes and. They decided to ignore the evidence, when plenty of other people didn’t.

I sat there with my mouth half-open so long that he looked up again. “What’s the brief?”

Advertisement



“Climate-change denial arguing the refugees from the Gulf States coming to New England are economic migrants who don’t really need to move and who will take jobs away from hard-working Yankees. They want something militant, in support of the border patrols and the New Minutemen.”

Carl sucked his teeth softly. “I’ve got some sympathy for the Minutemen, honestly. Not like we’re going to get any money from the feds to help feed and house a bunch of refugees.”

“The feds are broke.”

“The feds gave all our money to their cronies to pay for what used to be considered public services. And honestly, I don’t see that it’s really our problem that Florida is underwater, you know what I’m saying? We tried to tell them. We prepared.”

“Kind of a brutal irony that it was the bits of the U.S. least economically able to deal with climate change that were the most desperate to deny it.”

“People are real good at not seeing things that mean work or inconvenience until they can’t be avoided.” He shrugged. “ ‘Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed.’ This—” The mocking sweep of his hand took in the whole bullpen “—this isn’t journalism. You can write this in your sleep.”

Which was the problem, when it came right down to it.

He half-stood to lean over and shoulder-surf my monitor. “Better get on it, too. You got 19 minutes left.”

“Trade you?” I asked, as his hand moved to accept his next brief.

“Thanks,” he said. “Think I’ll stick with this here Idaho militia guerrilla-war apologia. Though I don’t know why we’re bothering to litigate this in the press. It’s not like the Feds have any money to do anything about them either.”

“They have private contractors for that. Anyway, they were going to save a mint by privatizing Medicare, Carl.”

“Give a mint to their friends. While you’re cataloging bitter ironies, write down the one where, when the libertarian militias finally went to war with the federal government, it was over losing their disability income and senior citizen benefits.” He started typing before he finished speaking.

* * *

There used to be a lot of talk about “right livelihood,” back in the ’90s and early 21st century. Making a living and making the world better, or at least not worse, while you earned your way.

Yes but. Yes and.

I wasn’t proud of my job. But I also wasn’t in debt peonage, which given 11 percent unemployment and the rollback of the federal minimum wage, put me in a better position than a lot of people. Especially in the wake of what happened to the National Labor Relations Board back in 2018.

So, I wrote the climate-change alticle.

My colleague would have to content herself with another tissue of lies about George Soros engaging in human trafficking and white slavery.

I sourced invented quotes with two made-up representatives of the Florida state government—such as remained of it—and one real one. I filed with five minutes to spare, and got up to use the bathroom. Carl winked at me as I went.

When I got back, I found a brief for an alticle on how alligator attacks were down because the global temperature was dropping, even as tourism was up in the Florida Keys. None of these things were true, but it looked like an entertaining 15 minutes of fiction, so I clicked on it. A second later, I heard somebody off to my right mutter in disappointment.

I smiled. Mine, all mine. My colleague would just have to content herself with yet another tissue of lies about George Soros engaging in human trafficking and white slavery in order to bus illegal voters across the Canadian border. Or the puff piece on who made Putin’s shirts.

I finished with 15 of my 30 minutes to spare, just as I’d anticipated. It was nearly lunchtime. Carl refilled his mug with black tea, brewed strong in a thermal carafe. The man has a bladder of steel. I didn’t have time to pull another brief out of the queue, so I used a tunneling program to conceal my identity and used that spare 15 minutes to flick through some underground and pirate news sites that imported real journalism, so I’d have some grounding in what used to be called the mainstream news cycle before I went back into the queue. I figured out early on that if I didn’t do something like it, I started believing my own conspiracy theories. The human brain is great at making up patterns out of nothing but a few inconsistencies.

In the wake of stories about terrorist threats against polling sites, the government was recommending that states postpone voting in the federal election. Unless it was real, which I supposed was possible, the terrorism angle had propagated from a story I had written, so I forwarded it to HR for my bonus. A sheriff’s department in Mississippi had ordered water cannons turned on a line of people attempting to register to vote. The governors of Connecticut, California, and New York had vowed to call out the National Guard to defend polling places. They probably even had the budget to do it.

Al-Jazeera, in several reports about U.S. troops fighting amongst themselves in Nevada, claimed the conflict was over a vice-presidential order to seize genome-sequencing data from private firms so Homeland Security could use it to identify citizens of Middle Eastern descent and those carrying the “gay gene.” That one really sounded like it had to be an alticle, except it came with a video interview, either an Air Force colonel or a very convincing actor saying, “I have a duty to refuse an illegal order.”

It had been picked up by Reuters, but a few of my stories have been too, so you never know. A little Googling didn’t clear it up, but led me to some interesting stuff on officials in the IRS blocking administration attempts to use the tax code to harass private citizens, and an underground railroad for Muslims supposedly running through Minnesota into Canada.

The president was on another rally tour, and he had fired half his staff again. He was holding a call-in runoff for replacement Cabinet secretaries, and I set an alarm on my phone so I’d remember to ring the number and vote for Ted Nugent for Homeland Security after I ate my lunch.

Why not, right? None of them are going to last six months anyway.

I pushed my keyboard aside and pulled the food out of my insulated bag while I scanned the queue. If I found a good brief now, I could think about it while I ate, and that would be like having extra time, as long as nobody else snagged it out from under me. The good ones tended to go fast ... but everybody slowed down a little after lunch.

I swallowed the first bite of my sandwich and washed it down with a swig of seltzer. Carl submitted another alticle and grinned at me while he popped tupperware. Leftover spaghetti; his lunch looked better than mine.

I poked at the matted sprouts on top of the soft white cheese and oily sun-dried tomatoes. “It’s time we admitted to ourselves that marinated mozzarella is just mozzarella in a coat of canola oil and stopped paying extra for it. It doesn’t actually taste any different.”

Carl shook his head. “Just because you have no tastebuds, man. You still eat sprouts?”

“I like sprouts.”

“Those things are a Petri dish, unless you grow your own. Not like the FDA is doing inspections anymore.” He twined spaghetti around his fork with his left hand, scrolled briefs with his right. Flick. Flick.

I was flicking too.

“Spending all their money prosecuting sedition.”

Flick. Those climate refugees were still nagging me. “How do you live with it, Carl?” Flick. Flick.

He huffed, a choked up laugh, and didn’t need to ask what I meant. “You gotta have a secret.” If he was about to tell me one, he corked it with a mouthful of pasta and chewed. The rich smells of garlic and oregano filled me anew with regret for my sandwich.

“Like a mistress?”

He swallowed before he grinned, thank God. “The truth is a mistress, I guess, when you’re married to a job like this.”

I winced.

He waved his fork in the air. “It may not be literally true. But it’s thematically true.”

“Whatever the hell that means,” I grumped. “Sounds like Newspeak.”

And because it was still sitting there unloved, I picked up that damned George Soros story. I’d rather fake a Hillary sex tape any day.

* * *

The next morning, the Department of Homeland Security—or their privatized mercenaries, who I think were operated by some relative of a Cabinet member—arrested my friend Carl. The feds didn’t have much power anymore: The states were Balkanized and two-thirds of federal law-enforcement personnel had quit or been downsized or fired. But there was always money for cronies and the family members of cronies, and their private-sector paramilitary could field three guys in black tactical gear, toting semi-automatic weapons, in a getup that looked more calculated to intimidate than to provide protection.

I noticed the Slackwater guys as soon as they came into the bullpen, about a minute and a half before they located Carl. At first, I had no idea they were headed our way. I was wary, but wary the way a rabbit is when a hawk passes along the treeline, not as if it were circling overhead.

Carl glanced over that them. His skin went greenish and his lips tightened, but his expression stayed calm. I think now he must have spent weeks rehearsing in his head what he would do if they came for him.

“I left you something in your desk,” he said conversationally. “The password is Joseph McCarthy.”

He stood, and was facing them when they reached him. The smallest one stepped forward and through the glass of his riot helmet said, “Carl Woods, you are under arrest for fomenting rebellion, sedition, and giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States of America.”

I had jumped up too, and as I took a step forward the mercenaries rattled their tactical gear. Like snakes.

Carl glanced over. “No, you should stand back. If anything happens to me because I was stupid, I prefer you’re around to lecture my corpse.”

“And call the ACLU,” I said.

The son of a bitch actually winked at me.

It was the last time I ever saw his face, though his name turned up on a list of detained terrorist sympathizers. In alphabetical order. Down near the bottom.

You think you’ll be brave, stand up. I just stood there staring after him while my timer counted down 200 seconds as they led him away in handcuffs.

My tax dollars at work.

It took me 20 minutes of poking around between alticles to find the thing in my desk, which was pushed into the back of the top drawer among the ink-stained rubber bands and rusty paper clips. It was a flash drive. I almost slotted it into my work machine, but at the last second I realized how stupid that would have been. I took it to a public library in a very small town out on State Route 9. Just drove until I found one you could see from the road, an OPEN flag flapping beside the door. It was a Victorian brownstone with gargoyles on the downspouts, no doubt built by some guilt-stricken local industrialist during the Gilded Age. We used to get a better class of robber baron.

Librarians are fiercer in defense of the First Amendment than anybody else I’ve ever heard of. I asked if there was a public computer and she smiled sunnily and said, “Over there. Half an hour limit, but that’s only if somebody else wants to use it.” She gestured around the empty hall.

I sat down in the chair and put the flash drive in, entered the password Carl had whispered. It took two tries before I got the spaces and capitalization right. The drive contained a folder with a couple of word-processor files. One file was just a 10-digit number. The other was a note from Carl.

If you can call something a note when it’s unsigned and undated and there is no greeting, just a bullet list of facts. It didn’t look anything like a letter. It looked like research notes for a story.

But I knew what it was and who it was meant for.

Here is what it said:

The International Military Tribunal opened in Nuremburg on 20 November 1945.

Among the twenty-four Nazis tried on a variety of charges were Julius Streicher and Hans Fritzsche, the Nazi propagandists, who were charged as war criminals.

Streicher was editor of Die Stürmer, a newspaper that printed a number of articles calling for the “Final Solution” in regard to the Jews.

Fritzsche was the head of the radio division of the Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda, the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, a relatively minor official under Goebbels.

Fritzsche was acquitted, but later found guilty in a West German court. He was likely brought to trial largely because Goebbels was dead, and therefore unavailable to answer for his crimes.

The Tribunal found Streicher guilty of crimes against humanity. This was in large part because they found a direct link between his articles calling for the elimination of the Jewish people, and the effectiveness of the extermination camps.

They sentenced him to be hanged by the neck until dead, which sentence was carried out on October 16th, 1946.

Those 10 digits just about have to be a phone number, don’t they?

I bought a burner phone today.

I know how Carl lived with it, now. And I know what I can do to help the climate refugees.

It’s true. They voted for it. They could have done the research. They could have thought past somebody who made them feel good about themselves, told them there were simple solutions that didn’t involve learning new things and facing change.

But in the final analysis, what it comes down to for me is that they were duped. And maybe they allowed themselves to be duped. Con artists rely heavily on the willing participation and self-delusion of the people they con.

But they were duped, in part, by people like me.

This isn’t the world I wanted. I wish I had not been born into this time.

Yes but. Yes and.

Somebody must do something. Say something.Investment banker, science patron, self-made billionaire, philanthropist and former math teacher Jeffrey Epstein can add a new title to his impressive resume – convicted sex offender.

The Manhattan moneyman appeared in a Florida courthouse today where he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute, and immediately began serving an 18-month jail term, which will be followed by one year of “community confinement,” which is essentially house arrest.

As a result of the plea deal, Epstein, 55, will be placed on the national sex offender registry.

“They will be tracking you for the rest of your life,” Circuit Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo said.

For the period of his home confinement, Epstein “cannot view or possess” any pornography “relevant to his deviant behavior patterns,” Pucillo said, before deciding to bar him from looking at any porn at all.

Epstein, dressed in south Florida formal wear – jeans, white sneakers, a button down shirt and blue blazer – refused to talk to reporters on his way into the courthouse, and made no statement in court.

His spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said, “Mr. Epstein accepted responsibility for the charges relating to conduct that occurred several years ago” and “fully resolved his case.”

Under the terms of the plea deal, Epstein will have to undergo an HIV test by Wednesday, with the results being handed over to his victim, identified in court papers as “Jane Doe.”

Doe was a 14-year-old high school student when Epstein paid her $200 for a massage at his Palm Beach mansion in early 2005. In court papers, she said he used a vibrator on her while he masturbated.

The guilty plea came after protracted negotiations and a lengthy investigation by Palm Beach police, who were investigating the virtual conga line of young women that Epstein had going in and out of his 13,000 square fooBt mansion.

Epstein, who’s rubbed elbows with the likes of Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump over the years, could have faced up to five years in prison if convicted at trial.

The judge was critical of two of the deal’s conditions, indicating she thought he was getting special treatment by being allowed private counseling for his sex offender treatment and to serve his time in county jail instead of state prison.

“You feel his fancy-pantsy private psychiatrist is a adequate in lieu of a sex offender treatment program?,” she asked prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek.

“Yes, your Honor,” Belohlavek said.

As for sending him to jail, Pucillo said, “There’s significant budget cuts in the county already, and sending him to the county jail and not the Dept. of Corrections is a significant cost to the taxpayer and the county – are you sure that’s what you want to do?”

Both Belohlavek and Epstein lawyer Jeffrey Goldenberg said yes, and the judge rolled her eyes as she granted the request.

Pucillo barred Epstein or anyone on his behalf from trying to reach out to the victim, and ordered that he stay away from schools and playgrounds after his release. He’ll also have to submit to warrantless searches of his home, car, body and computer.

On his way into court, Epstein was served with a copy of a big-buck lawsuit by Doe, who’s since moved to another state.

The sex assault suit was filed months ago, but Epstein “had been evading service,” said Doe’s lawyer, Theodore Leopold.

He said his client “respects what the prosecutor’s office has done,” and is “doing the best she can under the circumstances.”

Epstein’s legal team had tried to paint the girl as an untrustworthy and troubled scam artist from a troubled family, but “doesn’t today sort of say it all?” Leopold said. “He’s going to be deemed a sex offender and pedophile for the rest of his life, and that speaks volumes about what really happened here.”

While the plea deal brought an end to a federal investigation into Epstein, he’s still facing a string of civil suits from Doe and other young women who claim he took advantage of what they thought would innocent massages.

Jeffrey Herman, who’s representing two other alleged victims, said, “The guilty plea is a very positive development for the civil cases,” and “is some measure of justice for these girls.”

Epstein maintains he thought all the girls who were brought over to his house were 18 or over, and that they knew the massages would be “erotic.”

A newly released inmate from the Stockade – the jail where Epstein will live for the next 18 months – said he’s very lucky not to be going to state prison.

“He’s probably better off here,” the man said. “If there’s someone who did something with kids or any sex crimes, they get f–ed up there. He probably would get killed over there for messing with a little girl.”Library of Congress

This nickname map, printed as a promotional item by the livestock supply company H.W. Hill & Co. in 1884, is a wildly haphazard representation of the variety of American state nicknames in the late 19th century.

Some of the sobriquets illustrated here are still very familiar: Ohio's buckeye, New York State's knickerbocker, North Carolina's tar heel. Others are now baffling: Maine's fox (a term referring to the number of Mainers who then lived in the woods, according to etymologist Barry Popik); Florida's fly up the creek (a nod to the green heron native to the state).

Many of the obsolete nicknames commemorated here through illustrations of cartoon pigs are not affectionate. The Kentuckian pig—the corn cracker, a derogatory nickname that eventually devolved into cracker—reclines lazily with a bottle of liquor. The Utah pig, who goes without a nickname, appears to be a pig husband surrounded by four pig wives. And Missouri's pig, vomiting over a fence, illustrates the nickname puke, bestowed on a particular subset of the state's working class by Illinoisians resentful of their own unfortunate epithet: sucker.***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***

World Relief Announces the Layoff of 140+ Staff and Closure of Five Local Offices Due to the Trump Administration’s Reduction in Refugee Resettlements in the U.S.



“America is now less able to help those around the world who need our help the most.”

- Tim Breene, CEO of World Relief



BALTIMORE, MD — As a direct result of the recent decision by the Trump Administration to dramatically reduce the number of refugees resettled in the U.S. throughout fiscal year 2017, World Relief has been forced to make the difficult decision to layoff 140+ staff members across its U.S. Ministry and close local offices in Boise, Idaho; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Glen Burnie, Maryland. Collectively, these five offices have resettled more than 25,000 refugees over the past four decades.

“It has been our great privilege to serve both local churches and resilient refugee and immigrant families in each of these communities,” says World Relief President Scott Arbeiter. “Our staff at each of these locations have served diligently and sacrificially—some of them for many years—and we are deeply saddened to have to make this difficult decision. These staff members are also experts whose vast experience has brought an effectiveness and professionalism to their work. This represents a loss of more than 140 jobs—which by itself is deeply troubling—but also decades of organizational expertise and invaluable capacity to serve the world’s most vulnerable people.”

Tim Breene, CEO of World Relief, is making it clear that World Relief’s organizational mandate and ministry will continue on. “We fully intend to continue the critical work of resettling refugees and serving other immigrants in the communities where we serve throughout the United States,” says Breene. “The unfortunate truth is that given the unprecedented nature of the global refugee crisis, there are simply more people than ever that need our support and our compassion. We are redoubling our efforts to find solutions to serve displaced peoples in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere around the globe. We urge the Trump Administration to renew and reinvigorate efforts to work together with the global humanitarian community to meet this urgent crisis head on.”

President Trump defended his performance during his first four weeks in office and criticized the “out of control” media during a hastily assembled press briefing at the White House on Thursday.

Here’s how his first briefing as president measured up to Barack Obama’s on Feb. 9, 2009.

Trump’s opening statement was nearly three times as long as Obama’s.

Trump: 3,547 words. Obama: 1,196 words.

And that was before they took questions from the press.

Trump’s lasted almost 90 minutes. Obama’s was right at an hour.

WATCH:



Trump lambasted the media and denied ties to Russia.

“Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system,” Trump said. “The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.”

“I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia,” Trump said. “I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that’s the extent.”

“Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.”

Obama made the case for his massive stimulus plan, and ripped Republicans for “playing political games.”

Obama pushed his $800 billion in economic stimulus on Americans and accused Republicans of “playing politics.”

“I can’t afford to see Congress play the usual political games,” Obama said in 2009. “What we have to do right now is deliver for the American people.”

“The single most important part of this economic recovery and reinvestment plan is the fact that it will save or create up to 4 million jobs, because that’s what America needs most right now.”

Obama was very serious.

He rarely smiled during the 60 minutes that he spoke on Feb. 9, 2009.

Trump lightened things up.

The president joked with CNN’s Jim Acosta that he had “checked his family tree” before selecting Alexander Acosta as his labor secretary pick.

“I looked — you know, I looked at that name,” Trump told Acosta as he asked a question. “I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. I said, ‘Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.'”

Both leaders said they inherited problems from their predecessor.

“To be honest, I inherited a mess, a mess, at home and abroad, a mess,” Trump said Thursday.

“What I won’t do is return to the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place because those theories have been tested, and they have failed,” Obama said in 2009.

“My administration inherited a deficit of over $1 trillion, but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergency since the Great Depression, doing little or nothing at all will result in ever — even greater deficits, even greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of confidence.”

And the headlines…

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, is not particularly concerned by the fact that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn discussed sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Nor is Nunes worried about evidence that Paul Manafort and other Trump aides were in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officials during the presidential campaign. But he is shocked—shocked—that the communications of Trumps’ confidantes were obtained by U.S. intelligence agencies. “The big problem I see here,” he huffed, “is that you have an American citizen who had his phone calls recorded.”

Either Nunes is being disingenuous, or he is suffering from catastrophic memory loss. On multiple occasions in the past decade, Nunes, along with the other Republican lawmakers now complaining about the surveillance, has enthusiastically backed the law that allows the warrantless domestic collection of millions of Americans’ calls and emails each year.

For decades, such surveillance was prohibited under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. After the Church Committee revealed a sordid three-decade history of intelligence abuses, Congress enacted FISA to protect Americans from warrantless surveillance masquerading as “foreign intelligence” collection. The law required the government, when acting inside the United States, to obtain permission from a secret court before intercepting communications between foreigners and Americans. The FISA Court could approve the surveillance only if the government showed probable cause that the target was a foreign power or its agent—such as a foreign government official, or an American conducting espionage for another nation.

After Sept. 11, the law underwent a sea change. In Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008—legislation supported by Nunes, along with 187 other House Republicans and 105 Democrats—Congress gutted FISA’s key protections in order to legalize the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping program. Congress reauthorized the law in 2012, again with Nunes’ support.

Section 702 allows the government to spy on calls and emails between Americans and foreign targets without any individualized court order. The target need not be a foreign power or its agent, and no suspicion of wrongdoing is required. The government just has to submit a yearly certification that at least one of its purposes is to collect “foreign intelligence,” broadly defined to include almost anything relating to foreign affairs. And it must certify that its interest lies in the foreign targets, not the Americans with whom they communicate.

Under this permissive scheme, the National Security Agency collects at least 250 million internet communications flowing into and out of the United States each year. If only 10 percent of these communications involved Americans—almost surely a conservative estimate—the NSA would still be collecting tens of millions of Americans’ emails.

Nunes has fought hard to enable the very surveillance that so offends him now.

As the Wall Street Journal pointed out Tuesday, Section 702 requires the government to “minimize” the retention and sharing of information about Americans that gets caught up in the net of warrantless surveillance. But Congress left a good deal of wiggle room in that requirement, suggesting vaguely that it should be balanced against foreign intelligence and law enforcement needs. Agencies have aggressively exploited that license, developing minimization procedures so riddled with exceptions that the rule itself seems like an afterthought.

Nonetheless, until recently, the government could still maintain (however implausibly) that the surveillance of Americans’ communications was merely “incidental.” The exceptions to minimization, while capacious, would kick in only if the government stumbled across certain types of information in the course of investigating foreign targets. In 2011, the government dropped the fig leaf. Agencies revised their minimization procedures to allow agencies to comb through warrantlessly collected data in search of particular Americans’ communications.

This practice is known as back-door searches, for obvious reasons. The Fourth Amendment requires the government to obtain a warrant in order to conduct surveillance of an American target. The constitutionality of Section 702 thus depends on the target being a foreigner overseas—which is why the government cannot collect the communications unless it certifies that it has no interest in any particular, known American.

To acquire the data on that premise, and then to search it for the communications of particular, known Americans, is a bait-and-switch that creates a potentially massive end run around the Fourth Amendment. According to an independent oversight board that reviewed the operation of Section 702 in 2014, the FBI routinely searches Section 702 data for evidence in ordinary domestic criminal cases even when agents lack sufficient evidence to open a full investigation, let alone obtain a warrant.

So where does the surveillance of Flynn and other Trump aides fit in? Is this the kind of surveillance that civil liberties activists have been protesting since long before the Snowden leaks?

Although the FISA regime has morphed into an everyday law enforcement tool, what took place here was—at least in the beginning—core foreign intelligence surveillance. The targets were an ambassador and intelligence officials of a hostile nation, and the government sought information about that nation’s covert attempt to influence the American election. Had the government applied to the FISA Court for a surveillance order under the 1978 version of FISA, the court would have granted the order without pausing to blink.

Nor is there any plausible argument that the government violated minimization procedures by not redacting the Trump aides’ identities or their portion of the communications. There are too many exceptions in agencies’ minimization procedures, and some are overly broad. But it is difficult to quarrel with the exception for information about Americans that is “necessary to understand the foreign intelligence information.” Without question, the Russian officials’ communications could not properly be understood absent the identities of the recipients.

At some point, however, it is clear that Trump aides themselves became targets of FBI interest—and that’s where the law’s effective license to spy on Americans comes in. According to the New York Times, after the NSA captured the communications between Russian officials and Trump associates “as part of routine foreign surveillance,” the FBI asked the NSA to step up its surveillance of the Russian operatives and began rummaging through troves of already-collected data. It seems a fair bet that agents exploited the “back-door search” loophole to look for communications to and from the Trump camp—the kind of surveillance that would have required a warrant before 2011.

Moreover, the Washington Post reports that the FBI “did not have enough evidence to obtain a warrant for a wiretap of Mr. Manafort’s communications, but it had the N.S.A. scrutinize the communications of Ukrainian officials he had met.” This begins to sound a lot like “reverse targeting”—i.e., collecting communications between an American and a nominal foreign “target” when the true target is the American. On paper, the law prohibits reverse targeting; in practice, there is little to stop it.

Some lawmakers have tried to rein in Section 702 and restore FISA’s original focus on foreign threats. In 2016, Reps. Thomas Massie and Zoe Lofgren introduced an amendment that would have prohibited warrantless back-door searches. Nunes wrote a letter to his colleagues, imploring them to oppose it. “When the Intelligence Community acquires the communications of [foreign] targets abroad, among the most critical issues is to determine if they are communicating with persons in the United States,” he wrote. The same amendment had passed the House twice before, but after Nunes sent his letter, it narrowly failed.1 / 11

To broadcast dissent or not to broadcast dissent? That is the question facing style insiders during the first New York Fashion Week of the Trump administration. Those buzzing with activist pride since the Women’s March have plenty of fresh material to chew on: President Trump attacked Nordstrom for dropping daughter Ivanka’s brand, which Kellyanne Conway then perhaps illegally endorsed on national television; Elizabeth Warren was shut down by Mitch McConnell while reading Coretta Scott King’s anti–Jeff Sessions letter on the Senate floor, sparking the T-shirt-ready #ShePersisted hashtag. (That’s just a sampling from the last few days; never mind everything else that’s happened during the last couple of weeks.) Now, with street style camera lenses from around the world trained on Manhattan’s sidewalks, the next week offers a particularly rich opportunity to broadcast political opinions beyond an IRL audience. Yet one could also argue that we’ve had this platform all along, and why haven’t we used it? Or that to do so would be to pull focus away from the designers showing their work—and that actions (calling your congressperson, breaking up with your big bank) speak louder than screen-printed words. So is wearing a slogan tee or symbolic garment this week its own form of action—or is it mere distraction?

The industry itself—which, for the most part, openly supported Hillary Clinton’s campaign—is leaning toward the former approach. The CFDA has partnered with Planned Parenthood, whose funding is under threat, to create soon-to-be-ubiquitous pink pins reading “Fashion Stands With Planned Parenthood.” And the publication Business of Fashion has launched a campaign to get everybody wearing white bandanas under the hashtag #TiedTogether, with the goal of promoting “unity and inclusiveness amidst growing uncertainty and a dangerous political narrative peddling division on both sides of the Atlantic,” according to a statement.

Among Vogue.com editors girding themselves for another monthlong show circuit, the issue is a bit more complicated. After all, fashion folk have been defying #DressLikeAWoman norms since Trumps were Drumpfs ; that’s what fashion is . Or as Vogue Contributing Editor Lynn Yaeger puts it, “I feel like the crazy way I have dressed for years is its own form of resistance.” There’s also the matter of shyness, or simply wanting to stick to one’s own style. “I’m not the type to literally wear my politics on my sleeve with a slogan tee, or to go braless or anything like that,” says Vogue.com Fashion Writer Brooke Bobb. “I will, however, try to channel strength, resistance, and positive energy through my Fashion Week dress by wearing offbeat bright colors, bold prints, and my grandmother’s gold necklace.”

This week offers plenty of other ways for quieter types to make statements, too, such as a call by model and activist Kyleigh Kühn for showgoers to sport suffragette-inspired all-white looks on February 14 as a gesture of support for Muslim immigrants. “The idea of wearing white in solidarity for a cause feels more natural for me—something more symbolic and subtle than in-your-face,” says Vogue.com Fashion News Director Chioma Nnadi, who says she’s likely to join in. Others will limit their statements to accessories: Vogue Runway Director Nicole Phelps will be sporting a circa-1968 vintage pin reading “Give a Damn,” which she says will serve as “a reminder to leave oppositional comments on Mitch McConnell and co.’s Instagram accounts in my free moments.” Contributor Maya Singer plans to stick to a classic strategy: “Beret with buttons, all the way.” And Yaeger, though she’ll let her tailoring do the talking, speaks for the entire Vogue.com staff when she says, “I would love an 18-karat gold and rose-cut diamond brooch that reads, ‘Nevertheless, She Persisted.’ ”

That uplifting, poetic meme would indeed make for a lovely fine-jewelry heirloom—you listening, Irene Neuwirth?—but in the meantime, lower-brow alternatives may have to suffice. “I need to get my hands on a Black Lives Matter T-shirt,” says Senior Fashion Writer Marjon Carlos. “I don’t normally believe that a button or tote can be the catalyst of change that we need to see in our world today—consuming product doesn’t often lead to social justice, ya know?—but the stakes are far too high these days.”

That about sums up my own sentiment. I’m a soft-spoken minimalist whose disinclination toward being photographed borders on the phobic; I’ve long scoffed at mega-brand charity tees, which seem less useful for wiping away the AIDS crisis than the grime in one’s bathtub. Yet, dismayed by a recent chat at Copenhagen Fashion Week during which a couple of fellow attendees brushed off the subject of politics altogether (“so over it”), I’ve resolved to provoke as many conversations, however uncomfortable, as possible—albeit via what-is-that ? symbols and acronyms rather than loud-and-proud sloganeering. And so I’ve spent the last two weeks trawling eBay for vintage Gil Scott-Heron T-shirts and ordering knit “DSA” hats from the Democratic Socialists of America’s online swag shop (socialism, readers, is nothing to be spooked by, as a quick bike ride around Copenhagen will make clear). To integrate these items into my wardrobe will be a tad tricky, but what could be more fun—at a moment when fun seems to be in short supply—than a good old-fashioned fashion challenge? Call it #NewYorkFashionWoke, and let the above looks be your guide. Who’s in?BananaStock

Like so many other things, the revolving-door process in Washington has been spoiled by Donald Trump. You know the revolving door—the trick where lifers in government, those pasty drones with sunken chests and droopy clothes, leave their cubicles after a few decades for sunshine and high(er)-paying jobs in industry. At long last, they trade up their insider expertise to help companies that need to learn how to tiptoe at the edges of some laws. They sell out, sort of, and up their annual income by $20,000 or $30,000 a year. Plus benefits.

It is an accepted if sleazy part of the American dream, the grand seduction that keeps so many crawling forward day after day and year after commuter year. It’s also the kind of stuff that compels our new president to berate the entire city of D.C. as a swamp of people just wanting to get paid—a typically unbelievable angle for a wealth-obsessed billionaire, but there you have it. (Unless one considers his “drain the swamp” mantra as step one in a real estate move—witness the Jersey swamplands where now sit a football stadium; a fake ski hill; shopping; and of course hotels, many, many hotels.)

The old, timid lifer mousing through the revolving door has served so many in government for so long that surely the trick will never die. It is too neat a fit, too satisfying a final act. But is Trump right? Does this sort of shape-shifting make D.C. an irredeemable swamp town?

Recently, I joined the ranks of government-to-industry employees, spinning through the same revolving door. Once an honorable government adviser, I became a grubby merchant of avarice. This is my story.

Get Slate in your inbox.

From 2008 to 2011, I was a formally appointed member to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee. In the role, I was an unpaid volunteer who used my professional expertise gained from 20-plus years as an infectious disease specialist to sit with a dozen or so of my peers and a sprinkling of FDA staff in judgment of new antibiotics. We were asked to recommend to the FDA leadership whether the new product was safe and effective enough for the American consumer.

To make these assessments, we listened to many presentations from pharmaceutical companies, analyses of the data, and citizens who had personal stories about infections or drug allergies. And then we would vote. We stood as the last chance to just say no to new drugs, a final check and balance against the forward thrust of a half-trillion–dollar industry.

I was quite sad when my term ended—I had been proud of the work and intoxicated by the bracing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington sensation of working for the public good. Plus, I liked the rigor of poring over binders full of raw data and drawing consequential conclusions.

As I learned quickly, this is the way American bare-knuckled business is conducted.

But as my term ended, the ride was just beginning. Immediately after I got my handshake and government plaque, I started to receive emails from my pharma bros asking me to participate in “mock FDA” meetings. Given my perceived insider-trading potential, I had become a quick meal for the ever-looming vultures of industry. Their theory was that, if seated correctly with the correct slides, correct coffee, correct Danish, and correct tension in the air, I would provide the drug company with some magic insight that could move its new drug from “Maybe” to “You betcha!”

I should note that the invites contained no wink, no heh heh heh, not a whiff of self-aware “Um, I know this is weird since you just finished serving your country for no pay and without much thanks, but we were wondering if you would like to spill your beans to us for a handful of cash?” Nope, as I learned quickly, this is the way American bare-knuckled business is conducted. Das Kapital in real time. Of course they would look for any edge they could. Of course they would try to hire up anyone who knew anything about anything. After millions of bucks to get the product out of preclinical then early clinical trials, what were a few thousand more dollars handed off to some polite hang-dog specialist to twitch and mumble for a few hours? If this could push the process forward a little bit, surely it would be worth it.

Initially I deleted the emails within moments of receipt. I was disgusted that they, the pharmocrats, thought I could be bought. Shocked, in fact! Me?! I am an honest man with no desire to be a swamp creature! And after a couple of years, the offers stopped. Word apparently got around that I was a dead-ender, either too confused or too busy or maybe too hoity-toity to deal with.

But then inexplicably, a few years after the last nibble, I became hot again: The offers returned. I’m not entirely sure why. Though I once danced with industry, I don’t seem to be on any lists cataloging easy targets, though you can see how the companies report out who has sticky palms (here are the lists for Pfizer and for Glaxo). Perhaps pharma was having trouble scraping together people given new industry requirements that doctors must disclose the dollars they made doing this.

Another factor in my slew of offers was likely that the vexing trend toward FDA-pharma miscegenation had entered the minds of those worried about such things as the public interest and fairness and democracy. The New York Times published a scalding editorial entitled “Conflicts of Interest at the FDA” detailing a way too cozy back-and-forth between the FDA and industry experts in the field of dietary supplements—an area already rife with sleaze-onomics. The fox, it suggested, was now guarding the henhouse. In the hubbub around this controversy, likely many doctors felt too embarrassed to grab the pharma handout—ergo my reborn popularity.

At any rate, I decided to go for it. What better way to sort all this out than to go inside the belly of the beast and see what was what, then let Slate readers know just how slimy the slime actually is.

So I said yes to two offers, and off I went, flight crisply arranged by a travel agency, seat selected, limo driver awaiting me with the correct spelling of my name, (faintly) swank hotel at the ready. For an entire two days, I was a mock adviser for two actual products and paid many thousands of dollars for my trouble (since donated to Planned Parenthood).

My mornings on the sellout circuit included a bounteous breakfast complete with hot food, juice selection, and cloth napkins; a comfy chair at a U-shaped table; and one of those familiar 300-page notebooks full of data. I sat with a handful of my swampy academic colleagues and a retired FDA vet or two listening to presentations by the drug company pushing the product. We then pored over its clinical trial results—slowly, painfully, thoroughly. Then lunch. Then more presentations and more clawing and scratching through tables and figures. Then discussion.

By the end of the all-day exercise, I came to appreciate that though the premise, the surroundings, and the means of arrival surely were problematic, the actual work was anything but. No one gave spin suggestions or posited clever ways to hide warts. We were not the predebate prep team.

Rather we the sellouts were as nasty, peeved, dismissive, frowning, and impatient as we had been when we hadn’t been paid to be present. We spit back empty claims and harrumphed at half-assed “maybes.” In other words, we treated the data from the mock review with the same hard-boiled cynicism that we had treated data presented during the real FDA meetings. Sure, having a handful of embarrassed-for-their-greed academics together might have made each too ashamed to really shill, but I doubt it—we liked being tough and mean and fair.

And once I finished, I was done—no calls or emails or baskets of fruit; no visits from ex-cheerleaders. Perhaps my compadres were hustled up, but I doubt it. There was a clear distancing between the talent (us) and the dollars (them) that seemed to hold.

So I completed my stint as an underground man with even more certainty that it is (or was—we shall see just how Trump tries to twist this venerable agency) just about impossible to sneak a lousy medicine through the FDA approval process (unless the company lies). This is not to say all is rosy in the world of drug development in the United States. We have numerous pressing problems: the absurd cost for new agents (pricing, however, sits outside FDA purview); too many me-too drugs that help no one but investors; medication shortages; and the ethically complex problem of what to do about understudied, possibly dangerous drugs that represent a patient’s last hope.

But witnessing the system from inside and out and inside again, I felt that odd uplift you feel from serving on jury duty—initial doubt and dread, soon replaced by a throb of patriotism and respect for the clumsy process. It was nice to know that even in the phony hothouse of a mock survey, the bedrock power of accurate information will prevail.

If Washington is a swamp, it is not because of this particular revolving door. Yet Trump will continue to demonize these little-guy losers all after proudly nominating zillionaires to run his Cabinet. His will be a government defined not by officials getting rich after the fact by using information they learned serving, but by officials who will use their time in government to clear the tangle of regulatory nonsense to allow themselves—once this dang government service thing is over in a few years, or even during it, because why not—to go out and really make some bucks.

And they have the power to do that. The government committee I served on originally, the FDA advisory committee, is only that: advisory. Trump’s to-be-named FDA commissioner has the right of all FDA commissioners: to ignore the advice and decide about drug approval by himself or herself, as has happened now and again through the years. The Trump people recognize no moral imperative greater than the inalienable right to make a profit, a concept that, when applied to medicines, has the following tragic logic: No one has to take medications—it is a decision, not a decree. By swallowing a pill, you make a decision to accept risk.A former acting chief of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division considered political affiliations in hiring and personnel actions — which is illegal — and lied in congressional testimony to conceal his misconduct, internal investigators say in a report that was made public Tuesday.Photo by Sam Breach

I’d like to start with some responses I’ve gotten after counseling a concerned dog-lover who’d repeatedly found the neighbor’s unfixed, flea-ridden dog wandering the streets and wanted to know if it was kosher to give it away to a good home. A lot of you have pointed out that there are a few steps the letter writer should take to protect himself or herself legally, which is all to the good. I don’t want any of you going to court for dognapping, no matter how noble your intentions. A sampling:

Subscribe to Prudie!

I must tell you that in the state I am in, pets are considered property. I am an administrator for a local pet advocacy group. There can be serious repercussions to just taking someone’s dog, even if it’s being mistreated. But our county animal control does animal welfare checks, and if they find an unlicensed, intact, wandering dog, they will intervene.

While his or her (and your) intentions are laudable, your advice to the letter writer could land him in court if he actually steals this poor animal in order to place it in a better environment. What he needs to do is contact the ASPCA in his community. It has the legal authority to deal with this unfortunate situation. The dog is saved, and the letter writer’s hands are clean.

I would advise him or her to take the dog to animal control and let him do his three days there, and adopt him out—that would make it all legal. As the other owner hasn’t gone looking for him, he isn’t likely to pay the pull fee. While as an owner of two rescues, I applaud his or her desire to provide the dog with a good home, your advice does leave him or her vulnerable to a charge of theft or at least harassment by the old owner.

Dear Prudence,

My brother-in-law is a great guy, and I’m happy to have him visit. Unfortunately, he always leaves puddles of pee on the floor when he uses the bathroom. This has happened many times, and I make my husband bleach the floor when he leaves. I can’t stand seeing puddles of pee on the floor in our shared bathroom for days on end! Should my husband say something to him before he visits? How does he even start that conversation?

–Pissed Off

Yes, your husband should talk to him. When someone pisses on your floor, it is perfectly appropriate to say, “Don’t piss on my floor” and ask him to clean it up. The time for coyness ends when you slip on a puddle of someone else’s urine in your own home. You’re not doing him—or the other bathrooms in the world—any favors by letting this slide.

Dear Prudence,

I’ve been dating a wonderful man, “Paul,” for more than a year. His parents are gone, but he has included me and my young daughter in all his family get-togethers, and his relatives have embraced us warmly. I recently introduced Paul to my sweet, kind father, and they have a great rapport already. But it’s time he met my whole family. Unlike me and my father, my mother and sister are adversarial, negative harpies. They frequently throw loud tantrums at holidays and social occasions. I only see them when I absolutely have to. I have avoided situations where Paul might meet them, but now introducing him to them is overdue. I love this man deeply and want to marry him, but I don’t want my relatives to scare him off. I am terrified that they’ll make a scene and that he might, understandably, run away.

This is probably the closest we’re going to get to a real-life Pride and Prejudice scenario here at the Dear Prudence offices. You’re embarrassed by your mother and sister’s constant bad behavior, and as a result you limit your time with them. Surely Paul won’t judge you for being related to some deeply unpleasant people. Tell him what you’ve told me: that you’re not close with either of them and don’t expect him to be either, that they will likely try to cause a scene while meeting him, and that you will cut the interaction short if they do.

Dear Prudence,

I have a terrific husband, and our marriage is a happy and fulfilling one. But there’s one thing that over the years has continued to drive me nuts. When I’ve finished dinner and I call my husband to the table, he stalls. Sometimes it takes him 15 minutes to finally come to the table. I put a lot of effort into making tasty meals, and it irritates me that he tells me he’s hungry before I cook, but when it’s ready, he takes his good old time getting to the table. I’ve expressed my frustration several times in past, but ultimately he doesn’t adjust his behavior. I know this is a fairly minor annoyance and he’s the one who suffers the cold dinner, but I also think it’s an easy thing to change. Should I just accept that he’s always going to be slow to the table? (For the record, he does like my cooking, so he’s not dragging feet out of dread.)

–Annoyed Chef

It is possible that your husband is more than unusually absent-minded and truly doesn’t realize how much this bothers you. If that’s the case, telling him how his behavior makes you feel—not just frustrated, but as if he doesn’t care about the time you spend cooking for him—might be helpful. “I put so much effort into making dinner for us, and I value the time we spend together sharing a meal, and it makes me feel devalued and disrespected when you drag your feet every night to have dinner with me” might help jolt him into awareness.

You could also simply stop making him dinner. Putting “a lot of effort” into a daily ritual that brings you unending frustration has got to be awfully tiring. Why can’t he cook for himself? Why, for that matter, can’t he cook for the two of you? I have no doubt that you would show him the courtesy of being on time to the table.

Dear Prudence,

I was badly injured in a car accident 18 months ago, and I am still in pain, unemployed, in foreclosure, and in danger of having my car repossessed, all while attempting to take care of my dying father. I now live in a trailer with no heat and am having trouble getting on food stamps. My friend, “Shelly,” is a stay-at-home wife whose husband earns a six-figure income. She is a really nice person, but she calls me every day to complain about being “broke” because she has to wait until her husband’s next paycheck to go shopping. She knows my financial situation, but she still shows off the expensive presents he buys her every time I visit. She gives me coupons to stores I can’t even afford to shop in. Talking to her drops me into a deep depression. She’s the only person who actually calls to check on me, but at the same time, she’s so insensitive about my situation that my heart rate shoots up when I see her number on my phone. What would you suggest that I do or say to stop this vicious cycle of being treated like a charity case?

–No More Coupons

Shelly is not a nice person, and Shelly is not your friend. Shelly knows exactly what she is doing when she hands you Bloomingdale’s coupons or shows you her latest expensive plaything. I’m so sorry that in the middle of all this trauma the only person who regularly calls you is getting a sick thrill out of reminding you just how well-off she is in comparison. She is not your friend. She is the kind of person who will slowly squeeze you until you can’t breathe and call it a friendly hug. Make Shelly one less burden you have to bear and block her number.

Dear Prudence,

I have an elderly mother who is very sick and spends weeks at a time in the hospital. I have one sister who is too far away to help and one who is unwilling to help, so I have become my mother’s sole caregiver. I’ve recently been offered the chance to move abroad to a city I love for work. I feel awful for even thinking about leaving my mom, especially in the middle of the chemotherapy. On the other hand, it seems unwise to pass up a life-changing opportunity. I’m afraid if I stay here, I’ll be at the mercy of my city’s struggling economy and my unimpressive liberal arts degree. My mom tells me to move but also says that she doesn’t know what she’ll do without me. I know I should probably leave, but how can I do so without guilt? Am I going to regret not helping my mom in her twilight years?

–Should I Stay or Should I Go

What a painful choice. I don’t know if you will be able to make a decision without guilt, as a certain degree of regret is built in to both of your options. It’s possible that if you stay, your career may suffer; it’s equally possible that if you go, you may regret not being with your mother longer. To start with, I think you have to enlist your sisters, even the unwilling one, into a conversation about Mom’s failing health. The job of caring for her should not fall solely on you.

In the meantime, there are, I think, options in between leaving the country and resigning yourself to career stagnation for the rest of your mother’s life. Is it possible to parlay this offer into a promotion at your current job? Can you explain your extenuating circumstances to your would-be employer and ask for additional time to make arrangements for your mother’s care?

There are numerous elements at play here that I can’t speak to, but I think the most important thing to ask yourself is: What choices can you bear to live with? I don’t know how close your mother is to the end of her life, but she will only die once. There may be other dream jobs in the future, or there may not, but once your mother is gone, she’s gone for good.

Dear Prudence,

I work for a small nonprofit. Our office doesn’t have a kitchen, so we have an informal series of coffee runs throughout the day. Anyone stepping out will often ask around if anybody else would like a coffee. My boss often says yes but never offers to give money for his cup of coffee. Over time, those few bucks here and there add up. How can I ask for him to pony up for his next cup? Is an offer to pick up a coffee also an offer to pay for it? Or should I just stop offering to pick up a coffee for everyone altogether and risk looking selfish?

–Steamed

“If anyone wants coffee, I’m happy to pick it up while I’m out. Just give me your order and a few bucks.” If your boss has simply been absent-minded until now, he’ll open his wallet. If he’s been intentionally squeezing his employees for free coffee, he’ll make excuses about not having cash on him at the moment, coupled with a vague promise to pay you back in the future (he will not pay you back). If it’s the former, your problem is solved. If it’s the latter, you can stop offering to pick up coffee for the rest of the office with a clear conscience.

Dear Prudence,

My wife and I recently invited our extended family for an open house cocktail hour. We received a call from my uncle informing us that they would be bringing their pets (four dogs, including a puppy), but not to worry because they are all “house-broken.” Our family has no pets, and my 4-year-old son is nervous around dogs. I reminded my cousin that the invitation did not include animals, but if they had to bring their dogs along, we were happy to have the dogs stay in our fenced backyard. This did not go over well, and my uncle told me not to expect any guests that day from the family. Was I wrong? I feel terrible and actually love dogs (just not inside my house when I am hosting dozens of people).

–Really Dog-Friendly

I have an old dog named Murphy I would gladly bring with me everywhere if I could, but I understand the entire world does not have the same enthusiasm for elderly spaniels at all times. Dogs are great, but they don’t have to be everywhere. You offered your uncle a reasonable compromise (assuming your backyard isn’t a desolate, windswept moor), and he declined to take it. Your hands are clean.

But the gender wage gap is wide enough to put women who graduated from even the country’s best colleges behind men who graduated from the least selective ones.

Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.



In a recent study published in Social Science Research, researchers at the City University of New York analyzed National Center for Education Statistics data on two cohorts of full-time employed graduates from four-year colleges and universities. One group of 3,840 people graduated with bachelor’s degrees in 1992 and 1993, and reported their salaries a decade later. The other group of 4,670 people got their degrees in 2007 and 2008, and revealed their salaries four years after graduation.

The authors report that, using a conservative model, graduates of the lowest-ranking schools in Barron’s Profile of American Colleges—an annual assessment of schools’ selectivity and competitiveness—earned an average of 21 percent less than those in the top tier. The impact of attending a top college on salary is so great, even graduates of second-tier schools earned about 11 percent less than their peers from the most selective group.

But the researchers found the salary gap between male and female graduates “striking,” even when adjusting for field of study. In both cohorts, women earned about 16 percent less than male graduates of schools from the same selectivity tier. And women who got into the best schools still made less than men who attended “non-selective” institutions. Women who graduated from the most competitive schools in 1992 and 1993 made an average of $62,210 a decade later. Men who graduated from the least competitive ones made $63,923. Among the classes of 2007 and 2008, women from the top two tiers of colleges made an average of $52,293 four years after graduation. Men from the lowest tier made $55,346.

Women are vastly underrepresented in some of the highest-paying fields, like computer science and engineering, so it wouldn’t be surprising if an elementary-school teacher from Princeton made less than a programmer from Truman State. But a great deal of previous research has revealed gender wage gaps within specific industries and specialties. A JAMA study published in July 2016 analyzed the salaries of 10,241 academic physicians at 24 public medical schools in the U.S. and found that the gender wage gap averaged $51,315 a year. Even after taking into account mitigating factors like age, experience, specialty, faculty ranking, and how much research a doctor publishes, the authors found that women made an average of $19,878 less per year than their male counterparts, and evidence suggests that the gap is widening. In certain medical specialties, female doctors make even less than men of comparable education and experience: $38,000 for oncologists, $41,000 for orthopedic surgeons, and $44,000 for neurosurgeons and cardiothoracic surgeons. Male obstetrician-gynecologists, who see almost all female patients, make an average of $36,000 more each year than their female peers after adjusting for mitigating factors. And in those oft-lauded computer and engineering jobs, which are always held up as lucrative male-dominated careers that should explain away the country’s gender wage gap, women are routinely underpaid. A 2015 analysis from AAUW found that women in computer and math fields got paid 87 percent of what their male counterparts made. Female engineers and architects made 82 percent of the average male salary in their respective fields.This is a transcript of Episode 58 from Amicus, Slate’s podcast about the Supreme Court.

Hi, and welcome to Amicus, Slate’s podcast about the Supreme Court and the law. I’m Dahlia Lithwick. I cover the courts for Slate.

This will be the first Amicus podcast that takes place post-inauguration, which means that you, me, and everyone else now live in the President Donald Trump era. Among the many things that that implicates are Jeff Sessions and his bid to be the U.S. attorney general, a nomination that is now pending in the Senate. For those of you who weren’t in the room for his testimony, let me just note that Sessions, among other things, said that in his view, lawyers who are secular or not religious are going to have a harder time grasping what he calls “truth.” Let’s sit with that for a minute, and let’s think about the fact that Donald Trump has said he’ll announce his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming days.

Dahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.



In addition to all of that, this week, the court heard several fascinating cases, and we’re going to discuss them on the show today. One of them had to do with the government’s searches and arrests and detentions of immigrants, including many Muslims in the days after 9/11. Then Attorney General John Ashcroft and other officials from the Bush administration are still trying to shut down a lawsuit over the way these men were treated. I should note that that treatment included strip searches, beatings, and other brutal abuses, some of which lasted months and months.

First, we turn to another case argued Wednesday at the high court posing this question: “What’s in a name?” Or “What’s in a band’s name?” Or maybe more aptly, “What’s not in a band’s name?” This is a case that pits a group called the Slants. This is the self-described, first and only all Asian American dance-rock band against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The PTO refused in this case to issue the band a trademark for their band name, on the theory that the word slants actually disparages Asians. This dispute has been bouncing around for five years. It was argued before the high court this week.

Eagerly watching, and in fact participating in this dispute, by way of an amicus brief, is in fact the Washington football team. They’re involved in their own trademark dispute questioning whether the word redskins is disparaging. Joining us in the manner of all rock stars, from his car in Portland, Oregon, is Simon Tam, who is the bassist and founder of the Slants. Simon was at the court Wednesday, which I think is not one of his usual concert gig venues. Simon, welcome to the show.

Simon Tam: Hi, thanks so much for having me.

Lithwick: Simon, I wonder if you could just start by telling listeners about the genesis of your band, the Slants, and what you were thinking about when you picked this name?

Tam: I started the band. … The band idea, I should say, came to me about 2004. It was a very specific moment when I watching the film Kill Bill. There’s a scene where this woman named O-Ren Ishii walks into a restaurant with her gang of Crazy 88s, the Yakuza mafia that she led. For most people, it’s just another trademark Quentin Tarantino scene, like his main character is walking in, in a kind of a dramatic entrance. At the time, kind of like an epiphany for me, because I realized at that moment, it was the first time that I had ever seen Asian Americans depicted as cool, confident, and sexy onscreen by an American-produced film.

I started thinking about the lack of representation in other areas, especially in my own area of music, and how despite having over 17 million Asian Americans in this country, we had almost no representation in the entertainment industry. We never see them on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Our music videos weren’t being played on MTV back when they used to play music videos. I realized there was this absence and I wanted to create something that would celebrate our culture and kind of provide that representation. At the same time, I wanted to take down a lot of the false stereotypes about us.

I started asking friends, my white friends around, I said, “What’s something that you think all Asians have in common?” They almost always immediately said, “Slanted eyes.” I thought that’s really interesting. No. 1, it simply isn’t true. Not all Asian Americans have slanted eyes, and of course, Asians aren’t the only ethnic identities to have them. No. 2, we could talk about our slant on life and what it’s like to be people of color, while at the same time, using this outdated and obscure racial slur, and turning it on its head.

As a rock musician I thought, “Wow, this is something that Debbie Harry could front, a band called ‘the Slants.’ ” That ’80s new wave band name.

Lithwick: Simon, I think one of the cultural arguments undergirding this whole dispute—you’re having a very, very wonky trademark dispute—but one of the cultural arguments underneath it is this question about whether this kind of cultural reappropriation really works. Whether it’s rappers appropriating or reappropriating the N-word, or groups like Dykes on Bikes, or the magazine Heeb. This idea that this actually doesn’t achieve then end you’re seeking to achieve. All it does is make it OK to say something that is in fact disparaging.

Tam: Sure, and I completely understand that kind of concern. In the end, it’s simply just speculative. There’s no actual evidence of that. On the other side of things is every single sociological and psychological study ever done on the claiming of stigmatizing labels and words, and in every single study, you actually find that power shifts from the dominant group to the oppressed group and that it actually increases self-confidence and empowers that group. Even in a way where they get treated differently by the dominant group.

We can see how it has an effect if you go far enough back because this is a practice that’s actually been done for thousands of years. It’s not just only in recent history. The term Christian used to be a pejorative. Back in the day, Christians were persecuted; however, over time, it became one of the word’s biggest religions. Same thing with the term Mormons in the religious area. Mormons didn’t want to be called that. They wanted to be called Latter-day Saints. It’s only been in recent decades that they kind of shifted that position and took ownership of it.

You could see that again and again with other identities whether it be the term queer or kind of older phrases like guido. There have been numerous studies that have been done on it. What we see is that oftentimes it’s not necessarily accepted because it’s not a clean, easy to understand system. For me, that’s why it is so effective. It’s effective because it’s complex. Complex things oftentimes disrupt social norms.

Lithwick: Simon—I think this is the other sort of table-setting move I’m going to ask you to make—the administration, even the Obama administration, has actually had no problem with the band the Slants, and presumably the name of the band the Slants, in other contexts. This is, in some sense, a weird push me/pull you, where you’re in a fight with the Patent and Trademark Office on the one hand, but on the other hand, your message has actually been embraced in other parts of this administration, right?

Tam: That’s correct. Everyone from the Department of Defense to federal penitentiary systems to the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have called us champions of the Asian American community and worked with us to put out an album, actually. In regards to the Trademark Office, I think they are genuinely concerned that registering trademarks that could be seen as disparaging, or revoking this kind of outdated law, will lead to this Pandora’s box of hate speech upon the world. Of course, they fear that those trademarks will be associated with the federal government.

Lithwick: Let’s use that to segway into the case itself. Let me see if I’ve got the facts straight. In 2011, the Patent and Trade Office, the PTO, rejected your trademark application because of a pretty obscure provision in the Lanham Act that prohibits the government from approving a trademark that contains “matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.” This all begins when they do exactly what you just said. They said, “Listen, we don’t want to put the government’s imprimatur on something that disparages Asians.” Can you take us from there now?

Tam: Sure. Actually, the case begins a couple years before that. We’ve actually had two applications before the Patent and Trademark Office. For the government, they don’t actually take rejections lightly. It tends to be kind of this rubber stamp process where almost every registration gets approved, provided that they meet the basic kind of government criteria.

For the government, they say, “In order for us to reject it on these grounds, it has to be disparaging to a substantial composite of Asian Americans.” The problem is, they don’t actually define what “substantial composite” means. When we first began, we appealed using legal declarations or testimonies from members of the Asian American community. For example, executive directors from numerous social justice organizations. We had a couple of independent national surveys conducted, which showed that 92 to 98 percent of our community supported us, and dictionary experts, including one of the editors that the new American Oxford Dictionary, who did a extensive report showing how “slant” was pretty obscure to begin with as a racial slur, but over time had been used to create social change to the point where it’s now embraced as a term of self-empowerment.

All that lost. The Trademark Office instead supported their claim by using online dictionaries like urbandictionary.com, Wiki sites, and photographs of Miley Cyrus pulling her eyes back in a slant-eyed gesture, saying that those were evidence that social norms had not changed enough. Even though they had not found a single Asian American who would claim that it was disparaging, they believe that that was enough evidence to trump all the evidence provided from our community.

In 2011, when we went back again, our attorney suggested we actually change tactics. He said, “Well, you know, as long as you try and appeal saying, ‘We’re not offensive,’ you’re never going to win because no one who’s ever appealed has ever won in the 71 years that this law has been on the books.” Instead, we submitted what he called “an ethnic neutral application.” There was no imagery on there that could indicate we were Asian American. We didn’t say it was an Asian American band, it was just a band. The only thing kind of Asian about it was my Chinese name.

The thinking was, “slant” is not an inherent racial slur, unlike other things that are out there. It’s actually a neutral word with many different definitions. The government came back and rejected it again, copying and pasting all their previous responses. That’s when we asked them, “Well, hold on. If ‘slant’ is an inherent racial slur like you say it is, why have you registered it hundreds of times? This is the only case that’s been ever denied in trademark history, on the grounds of being disparaging to Asians. Why did you label ‘slant’ as a racial slur in this case, but not in other cases?”

The Trademark Office replied, “It is incontestable that the applicant is of Asian descent and part of an Asian band.” In other words, they said, “If this was a non-Asian band, this would not have been an issue,” or, more explicitly, anyone can register a trademark for “the Slants” as long as they’re not Asian. They said you have to look at the mark and its context and our racial identities as a live-music band provide the context for the word. In their opinion, having Asians use the term “the Slants” would make people automatically assume a racial slur and not any other definition that’s out there. That’s when we really revved it up and decided to fight.

Lithwick: Simon, let’s listen just for one second to Justice Anthony Kennedy asking your attorney in this case, John Connell, exactly the question you’ve just raised, what would be different if the band had been comprised of non-Asian members. Let’s have a listen.

Justice Kennedy: Suppose he had this hypothetical case. The facts are largely parallel to these, other than the band are non-Asians, they use makeup to exaggerate slanted eyes, and they make fun of Asians. Could the government under a properly drawn statute, decline to register that as a trademark in your view?

John Connell: They could not. First Amendment protects absolutely outrageous speech insofar as trademarks are concerned.

Kennedy: That is correct.

Lithwick: In addition to that, Simon, it seems to me that you had, I think, much of the court agreeing with the proposition that this is pretty classic viewpoint discrimination. Right? That this is simply saying that the government can disfavor some types of words when spoken by some people. Here’s Ruth Bader Ginsburg thinking about this question of the word Hebe and what happened when the Trademark Office both granted and didn’t grant trademarks around that.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg: The questions have concentrated on viewpoint discrimination, but there’s also a large concern with vagueness here, and the list that we have of things that were trademarked and things that weren’t. Take, for example, one had the word “Hebe,” and that was OK in one application, and it was not OK in another?

Lithwick: What’s the answer to this question of, you know, sometimes slant is OK, sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes Hebe is OK, sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes queer is OK, sometimes it isn’t. What’s the answer to that? Is the answer that there’s just no line here?

Tam: I don’t think the moral line in the sand, so to speak, should be drawn at trademark registrations. Obviously, I don’t support hate speech. I don’t want to support a racist football team or bands that are offensive. However, we have to understand that inconsistent law isn’t practical. Your kind of elephant in the room and the biggest criticism that people have about my case is that if we win, then pro football is going to have their trademark registration come back.

My reply is that we sometimes become so obsessed with punishing villainous characters, that we forget the collateral damage is actually experienced by marginalized groups, and we shouldn’t punish them for that. Dan Snyder made it explicitly clear that whether he has a trademark registration or not, he’s not going to change the name.

There are certainly other avenues to pursue changing the name, and I definitely agree with them. We should not support that team, however, we have different opinions of how to go about that change.

If we write our laws and design them around the most privileged members of society, i.e., billionaire football team owner, then we forget about the people who don’t have the same resources to make an appeal, to fight a wrongful accusation. Those tend to be members of the LGBT community and people of color because those are the people who tend to engage in the work of reappropriation to subvert discrimination. And yet those are the same ones being denied, based on their own identities.

Lithwick: Simon, the big argument on the other side, and I think we heard this, that argument from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who’s incredibly sensitive to the sensibilities of minorities. She really said, “Look, call yourself whatever you want, but why does the government have to put its imprimatur, its blessing, on this name?” In other words, “We’re not keeping you from calling the band the Slants, we’re just saying the government doesn’t bless this.” Let’s listen to her for a moment.

Sonia Sotomayor: This is a bit different than most cases. No one’s stopping your client from calling itself “The Slants.” No one’s stopping them from advertising themselves that way or signing contracts that way or engaging in any activity, except that of stopping someone else from using the same trademark, but even that they could do because you don’t need a registered trademark to sue under the Lanham Acts entitlement for the confusion of a public in the use of any kind of registered or unregistered mark. If another band called themselves “Slants,” they would be subject to deceptive advertisement because they wouldn’t be this “Slants.”

There is a big difference. You are asking the government to endorse your name to the extent of protecting it in a way that it chooses not to.

Lithwick: Simon, what’s your response to that? What’s your response to, “Look, the government has a moral role to play in not blessing terms that may be derogatory?”

Tam: I would argue that it isn’t a blessing because if it truly is a blessing, then the government—if the government truly cared about fighting racism through the trademark regime, then they should have begun with cancelling trademark registrations for white supremacist groups. Not necessarily denying one for an anti-racist band. If the government truly cared about that, then there’s all manner of things that could be extrapolated from there. For example, does the government bless all the offensive pornographic companies that are out there? Do they truly embrace the other sports teams that depict human beings, Native Americans, as mascots? I wouldn’t believe so.

I understand it’s a concern, but when you compare it with things like the copyright regime, the copyrights receive government protection as well, and a blessing of sorts, but nobody truly believes that they are conveying some kind of government message.

Finally, the other thing I would argue is that not only does it burden a person to have this rejection, but it chills speech. We’ve had numerous business owners have to give up on their dreams and close up shop. I get contacted by bands all the time and small business owners who are accused of violating Section 2A of the Lanham Act, who have to either give up on their dreams or sometimes declare bankruptcy for investing so much money into their business because the government thinks it may disparage. Not that it actually disparages, but it may be disparaging.

An example would be a Japanese restaurant owner who contacted me because he had his trademark registration denied for the word Fuku, which is f-u-k-u, a Japanese word for joy. They said, “Well, it may look too much like an obscenity.” Of course, they had no qualms about approving the trademark registration for French Connection U.K., who always goes by “F-C-U-K.” Something that looks like the exact same obscenity.

Again, you have people who try to embody their own cultural heritage and being denied for doing so. That’s a really important thing to consider when we think about how we create laws. Laws shouldn’t just be about the quality. They should also be about equity and if they’re placing a social burden on marginalized groups, then those laws need to be reconsidered.

Lithwick: My last question to you, Simon, and I know you’re not an attorney, but there has been criticism of what you’re trying to do, especially from some other Asian American groups who say, “Look. Yes, what you’re doing in your case is really honorable, but you are flinging open the gates for the Washington Redskins and other groups and that in an attempt to do good for yourself and your band, you’re ignoring what it means to inject into the conversation—especially at a moment where there’s been a huge uptick in racially motivated hate crimes—injecting language into the conversation that are going to net out to be bad for minority groups.”

What’s your response?

Tam: I think that’s a false assumption. When I went about going about this trademark battle, I traveled to 34 different states to speak to over 140 social justice organizations, confederated tribes and tribal leaders, activists, and others, to really get their opinion and their advice about approaching this particular case and I had overwhelming support from almost all of them. In fact, the same group that opposes me, NAPABA, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, for five years supported my band and at their national convention told me that they had many fans there and that they planned on supporting me in my fight. Only to turn around a few months later to reverse that decision.

Again, those groups are afraid of the larger context of opening the can of worms because they’re afraid of the trademark registration thing regained by the football team. I would also argue the same thing that they often tell me. Whether or not I have a trademark registration, those hate groups are free to continue using hate speech. Nothing is going to change that but if we use trademark registration as a way to try and deter it, which we, number one, know it doesn’t work in doing so, then what ends up happening is, we’re chilling the speech in the social justice efforts of those trying to make a positive change for our society. To me, we should be more concerned about supporting those groups than we should be about punishing others for disagreeable speech.

Lithwick: Simon Tam is the bassist and founder of the Slants. He’s also, I believe, the first rock star we’ve had on the show. Simon, thank you for joining us on Amicus this week.

Tam: Thank you so much.

Lithwick: We’re now going to turn to a second case argued at the high court this week on the same day, in fact, as the Tam case we just talked about. This case dates back to the days after 9/11 and even though more than 15 years have elapsed since that time, the case itself actually raises questions that may become salient again if Donald Trump’s talk of establishing a national registry or database based on religion or country of origin really is in the cards.

Ziglar v. Abbasi is an appeal by a group of mostly Muslin men, charging that former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, and former INS Commissioner James Ziglar, along with two wardens at the Federal Detention Center where some detainees were held, can be sued by these detainees for their treatment in the months after 9/11.

Now, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the case could proceed, but the government appealed, and it’s that appeal that the court considered this week. One slight oddity in this case is that two of the eight justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, recused themselves from the case presumably because they were involved in the earlier proceedings in their former jobs as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in Sotomayor’s case, and the U.S. solicitor general in Kagan’s. This means there were only six judges hearing arguments this week.

Joining us now is Rachel Meeropol. She’s a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, where she works on prisoners’ rights, national security, and First Amendment issues. She argued this case on Wednesday. It was her first at the high court and she argued on behalf of her client Ahmer Abbasi.

In a twist, I should note that Rachel is the granddaughter of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Welcome to the show, Rachel.

Rachel Meeropol: Thanks. It’s great to be here.

Lithwick: I’m sure you have been asked that a million times, but, wow, you’re really the granddaughter of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg?

Meeropol: I am. No stranger to injustice.

Lithwick: OK, well said. Can you just tell us first and foremost about your client Ahmer Abbasi and what happened to him in the weeks and months after 9/11?

Meeropol: Yeah. Basically, right after 9/11, the FBI set up a tip line, and people were calling in from all over the country with tips like, “My neighbor’s Arab and he keeps strange hours. It think he might be a terrorist.” On that sort of information, hundreds of men were swept up, including Ahmer Abbasi, who came to the attention of the FBI after a postal worker at the New Jersey DMV reported that an Arab man had left a false Social Security card there. This led to an apartment where Ahmer was staying as a houseguest.

He was arrested and designated as “of interest” to the terrorism investigation, not based on any reason to suspect that he actually had any involvement in terrorism, but because he fit the profile of the 9/11 hijackers. Muslim Arab men who had violated the immigration law.

He was held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Placed in a solitary confinement unit there. Beaten by guards, harassed, kept from practicing his religion, deprived of sleep, deprived of exercise for months, until he was cleared from any connection to terrorism and then deported.

Lithwick: This is not a fact that’s in dispute in this case, right? The DOJ itself has conceded that detainees were treated horrifically in complete violation of whatever protocols we would use, so what is their argument about why they are not on the hook for this?

Meeropol: The issue is really whether individuals who were abused and discriminated in this way, can even get into court. We have the solicitor general under the Obama administration defending Bush-era officials in, just before the Trump presidency begins, saying that, federal officials, even when they violate clearly established law, like denying the right to equal protection and allowing for the abuse of prisoners, that even when that happens, individuals should not be able to sue those federal officials for damages when their rights are violated.

Lithwick: This brings us, I’m afraid, dear listeners, to Bivens because there were three big issues in the case but I think the one that the court was most focused on this week is whether this fits into the confines of the doctrine established in a case called Bivens. Rachel, can you, just for listeners who are not necessarily completely conversant with what that means, explain to us, first of all, what that law is and then, whether you are asking for a radical extension of that doctrine?

Meeropol: Sure. Bivens is a doctrine that allows individuals to sue federal officials when they violate the Constitution. I think most people would assume that we have that right. We can certainly sue state officials when they violate the Constitution, but what’s strange about the system that’s set up, is that a federal law allows you to sue state officials. There is no federal law that allows you to sue federal officials.

Rather, the court ruled, in a case called Bivens, that it could imply the right to sue federal officials under the Constitution itself. That ruling came in a Fourth Amendment case. Ever since the first ruling, the court expanded the doctrine into some other areas, allowing, for example, federal prisoners to sue their jailers when they are abused in detention and allowing individuals to sue over equal protection violations.

The question is, how far does that doctrine extend? There’s only been three cases in which the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that an individual could bring a lawsuit for damages against federal officials but the lower courts have allowed many other lawsuits to go forward based on the assumption that those kind of actions are allowed.

In the last 30 years, however, the courts have been slowly pulling back from the doctrine, especially the Supreme Court, and recently, the Supreme Court, anytime it sees what it thinks is an extension of Bivens, it has rejected that extension. Really one of the essential questions in the case is, is this an extension of Bivens? Are we asking for something new here? We say that we’re not.

This is a case about individuals who are detained in federal custody, in a federal prison in New York City. It’s not a case about mistreatment. In a military context, it’s not about something that happened overseas. This is about what you can do to individuals present in this country, in a federal prison.

Of course, even if it is an extension of Bivens, the second question that the court will have to grapple with is if it’s an extension, should the right be extended? Should my clients be allowed to sue for what happened to them? I can address that question if you’d like, as well.

Lithwick: Well, before you do, I feel like I want you to clarify one thing for listeners who are not clear on the distinction between what rights you have as a U.S. citizen or someone who is here in some legal capacity and someone like your client, who I think admittedly, had violated his green card and was here illegally. Does that matter and what rights do you have as a noncitizen in this country who has, let’s say in this instance, completely violated the conditions of your visa?

Meeropol: Yeah. It does and it doesn’t, in a really strange way. Nobody is arguing that my clients have different rights to be free from abuse in prison. It’s clear that noncitizens, even when they are here unlawfully, have the right not to be abused in detention. This is a proposition that’s been established for many years.

Now, that said, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they have the same right to sue if that right is violated. One of the arguments that the government is making in this case is that because what happened after 9/11 was national security policy that relates to immigration and because Congress has power over immigration, that the courts really shouldn’t get involved, that it’s not proper for the courts to imply the ability for noncitizens to sue over immigration policy especially when that policy encroaches on national security concerns.

Now, our response to that is that this actually isn’t about immigration at all. It’s not about whether people should be allowed in or out of the country. It’s about how you treat them when they are here and if the Constitution cannot be a way for noncitizens to deter abuse in detention, to deter law enforcement excesses, then what protects them? What keeps law enforcement from doing the worst thing that we can imagine to millions of individuals who are here and vulnerable?

Lithwick: That raises the question, and I think that they roughed you up a little bit about this at oral argument, Rachel, why can’t we just give them other protections? Why is this the remedy, to be able to sue? In his personal capacity, John Ashcroft seems like a pretty excessive remedy. I think the chief justice was like, “Why cannot you just bring a habeas corpus action?” So what’s your response to that?

Meeropol: Yeah. There are two different responses there. First of all, in this actual situation, one of the policies that was being implemented by the government against my clients was that they were kept from accessing the outside world, including lawyers, while they were in detention, so they were initially subjected to a complete communications blackout. No access to phones. No access to visits. No access to anybody. That blackout was lifted after a matter of weeks, but their access to the outside world was still extremely restricted. It was very difficult for them to get lawyers to try to bring any sort of cases to challenge what was happening to them while it was happening. When a few were able to bring some challenges to their treatment and their detention in the courts, the response was to clear those individuals more quickly and deport them, to keep the federal courts from examining what was going on.

That means, not only that it’s difficult for an individual to actually get relief but perhaps more fundamentally, because the court cannot get involved, there’s no way to rule on the legality of what is happening. There’s no way to deter future officials from doing the same. Now, one of the core purposes of the Bivens doctrine, as the Supreme Court has recognized it, has always been that it is a way to deter future illegality. That if you want to keep individual federal officers from violating people’s rights, an individual lawsuit that puts them on the hook for damages, is really the only way to do it.

If that action is not available today, as we move into uncertain times, I fear that there will be nothing to restrain the worst of executive abuses.

Lithwick: Now, I want to play for you—this is the hard part of this show, Rachel. We’re now going to play for you audio just casting you back into your breakdown from Wednesday, but I want to play for you John Roberts questioning you on a principle, I think, you just actually flicked at. Let’s listen to it more explicitly because I think what he’s saying is, we certainly want to deter future illegality, but we don’t want to terrorize people out of doing their jobs and creating good policy, particularly in difficult times. Let’s listen to him.

John Roberts: When you have the attorney general, the director of the FBI, the director of INS sitting down and making, “What are we going to do to respond to this crisis?” and people in the … old enough, 9/11 sort of have a better sense of what that crisis was like and if you imply a Bivens actions, one of the things they’re going to enter into their, what is best, what is appropriate, and presumably also what’s constitutional. They’re going to say, “Well, gosh. If I’m wrong, I’m going to be sued, not because I’m the attorney general but as an individual.” Part of the policy that we’ve announced is that we don’t want people forming policy to have to worry about, they’re going to have to pay if the policy is found infirm.

Lithwick: Rachel, what’s your response? What do we do about the fact that people say, “I’m just working in good faith. I’m just a warden in a prison. I’m just executing policy someone else gave me.” That if you, in fact, get the remedy you’re seeking here, all you’re going to do is chill future government workers from trying to do the best job they can do.

Meeropol: Well, even if my clients get into court, there they will have to face another hurdle, which is called “qualified immunity.” Qualified immunity protects government officials, federal and state officials, who are sued for individual liability. What it means is that, even if a federal official or state official violates the Constitution, they cannot be held accountable unless they violate clearly established law that any reasonable officer would have known of. Basically, what the court’s concern there, is that officials might pause before violating clearly established law.

I don’t think that should be a concern. I’m more concerned that federal officials won’t pause before they violate clearly established rights and to the extent that we want to be sure that we protect people who serve the government in good faith and are just trying to do a good job in difficult times. Qualified immunity already provides that protection and it is substantial protection.

Lithwick: You had two, I think, robust supporters on the array of six justices that you faced this week. This is Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioning the government’s lawyer on the length of the incarceration and detention. Let’s listen.

Ruth Ginsburg: It’s one thing, as Justice Pryor pointed out, to say you initially hold these people, but you know from day one that many of them have nothing to do with terrorists and yet, you allow that system, that might have been justified in October, to persist for months and months when these people are being held in the worst possible conditions of confinement.

Speaker 9: Your Honor, they are being held in restrictive conditions of confinement, but those conditions are lawful as …

Lithwick: Rachel, how much of a difference, if any, does it make that, as you claimed, not only did this persist for a very long time, but that, in fact, after the fact, not one of the people who were detained in these sweeps was ever determined to be a threat? Do those two things make a difference for this hindsight look at what the government should have done differently?

Meeropol: I think they do and I think they’ll come into play later on in the case if we’re allowed to go forward. The government will have the opportunity, if it wishes, to actually defend its use of race and religion here. They could try to prove that what they did after 9/11 was really necessary to protect national security.

Now, I can’t imagine how that argument could prevail but they will have the opportunity to make it and there they will be faced with some very difficult facts, including that there was no reason to suspect the 9/11 detainees of ties to terrorism when they were arrested and that at the end of the day, none of the detainees were found to have any ties to 9/11. This investigation proved completely unsuccessful.

Lithwick: Rachel, can you talk a little bit about the distinction between some of the named officials in this case because it seems to me that the claims against someone like John Ashcroft or Robert Mueller are really, really different from the claims against the prison warden, some of the lower level officials who, I don’t think, could be said to have been formulating policy. In a sense, we’re talking about apples and oranges, no?

Meeropol: That’s right and really the wardens are defending the case by saying, “We were just following orders. We were just doing what the FBI told us we had to do.” Now, we have problems with that defense as a factual matter but even more importantly, there is no “following orders” defense to the Constitution. If you violate clearly established constitutional rights, whether or not someone tells you to do so, federal officials can be held accountable.

Actually, every single judge so far who has considered one of our claims against the former warden, Dennis Hasty, who’s alleged to have allowed physical and verbal abuse of my clients for months and months at the Metropolitan Detention Center, every judge who has heard those claims, has agreed that they should go forward, and we very much hope that the Supreme Court agrees.

Lithwick: In a sense, isn’t there a weird space between these high-level folks who are saying, “Hey, we were just establishing the outlines of policy,” and the low-level folks who are, first of all, I think in some instances now saying, “I didn’t even know this was going on.” There’s a space in the middle where it almost feels like nobody’s accountable, right?

Meeropol: Well, right, and if we allow people who are sued to point fingers at each other before the client has even had an opportunity to get to discovery, so these are unsworn statements by defense attorneys saying, “No. He’s more responsible. No. He is,” without even filing an answer to our allegations. That can’t be the way that serious lawsuits are resolved.

Lithwick: I want to listen to one last voice from the court this week and this is Steven Breyer. As I said, one of the two liberal justices on the court who seemed, I think, to be in your camp this week. Here he is talking about blank checks and we know that the language of blank checks hearkens back to the earliest detainee cases. Let’s have a listen.

Stephen Breyer: I mean, I think it is an enormously important and very open question and we can say, on the one hand, just what was said, I think, everything the chief justice said is true. There is a problem in this time of real national emergency to overdeter people from doing what they reasonably think is necessary. They have the authority for security. Not the judges.

At the same time, the law of this court correctly, I think, is, but there is no blank check even for the president and if there’s no blank check, that means sometimes they can go too far and if they have gone too far, it is our job to say that.

Lithwick: I want to give you a chance, not just to respond to the notion that the government is being given a blank check retroactively in terms of what was done to your client and other detainees swept up after 9/11, but also to talk a little bit about prospectively. We’re heading into a new administration that has talked pretty radically and dramatically about the rights of Muslims, the rights of immigrants. Going forward, is there a sense in your mind that the actions post-9/11 and what may come down the pike, are connected if the government is to get the blank check that you feel they’re seeking here?

Meeropol: Well, absolutely. What happens in this case is not just about whether individuals who were harmed will get compensation. It’s also what, going forward, federal officials will understand they’re facing if they violate the Constitution, right? There is a difference, I think, a really serious difference between understanding that one of your policies might be stopped, might be enjoined, in legal terms, because it violates the law, versus an idea that you could actually be held personally accountable for violating somebody’s constitutional rights.

I fear that one doesn’t provide adequate deterrence. That just the sense that a court could rule, that something can’t go forward, doesn’t deter future officials from taking incredibly aggressive stances that they know may not be constitutional but that they’re going to do anyway.

In a time when torture, when Muslim registries are talked about as legitimate policy options, this is an incredibly dangerous time for the court to send a message that federal officials could violate even clearly established law and not be held personally accountable.

Lithwick: One last question, Rachel. This was, in fact, the very last case of the Obama administration. You’ve already mentioned that there’s some form of irony that the Obama Justice Department was laying the groundwork for a pretty broad defense of government officials going forward. Was it bittersweet to be sitting in the court that day, listening to what is a very, very paradoxical last case for the Obama Justice Department to be arguing?

Meeropol: Oh, sure, and the reality is that if I had been arguing it just a few weeks later, the attorney on the other side would be probably approaching it in a very different way. Now what the Obama administration is arguing for is incredibly broad, but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t be broader, and I wonder what kind of argument I would have come up against if this had happened in February.

Lithwick: Rachel Meeropol is a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, where she works on prisoners’ rights, national security, and First Amendment issues. Rachel, thank you so very much for your time this week on Amicus.

“Bros before hos” stands as one of the foundational mottoes of Delta Psi Beta, the frat house headed up by Zac Efron’s Teddy in Nicholas Stoller’s new comedy Neighbors. The Delta Psis hold this bro-privileging principle sacred—in one of the movie’s funniest scenes, Teddy and his frat brother Pete (Dave Franco) engage in an extended competitive riff in which they create increasingly scabrous rhyming variants on the holy credo. But Neighbors itself, which at first appears to be another example of the by now ubiquitous bros-will-be-bros comedy, winds up neatly turning that maxim on its head. Here, it’s the hos who win the day—if by “hos” you mean “adult human beings who recognize that both women’s and men’s experiences have value” (which I know is not the working street definition of the term). Neighbors pits the power of male bonding against the power of pair bonding, suggesting that the eradication of bro privilege is a task not just for women but for everyone.

Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic.

This mildly subversive egalitarian message comes wrapped in a familiar bundle of sex jokes, party montages, and body-effluvia-fueled gross-outs (this time it’s breast milk flying across the room rather than poop or vomit, which I guess is cozier as effluvia go). But it’s somehow easy to forgive Neighbors for its predictable moments, maybe because (like Stoller’s 2008 debut Forgetting Sarah Marshall), the movie has more on its mind than the initial setup would suggest. That setup is established briskly and raunchily, as we meet Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne), a young married couple, having sex in plain sight of their infant daughter (played by scene-thieving cherubs Elise and Zoey Vargas). Kelly and Mac haven’t yet quite accepted that parenthood will mean the end of their old, irresponsible life. They’re new enough at adulthood that they still place a high value on being perceived as cool, which puts them in a bind when the Delta Psi fraternity moves into the house next door and starts throwing wall-shaking, baby-waking nightly ragers.

Before heading over to the frat for a faux-friendly welcome visit, Kelly and Mac practice saying “keep it down” in voices that will make them sound, well, down. But thanks to Teddy’s strategic neighborliness, they wind up at the next kegger themselves, baby monitor in hand, scarfing magic mushrooms till the break of dawn. Having thus bonded, the Radners and the Delta Psis declare a truce—one that disintegrates soon after when Mac, his pleas for quieter parties ignored, calls the cops.

Thereafter it’s open war between the ever-less-mature Radners and the overgrown boys next door. But it’s a war that keeps changing battlegrounds: When the college dean (a wearily snide and very funny Lisa Kudrow) puts the Delta Psis on probation and threatens to close the house, the Radners’ goal becomes not to prevent future parties, but to encourage the wildest ones possible.

Neighbors pits the power of male bonding against the power of pair bonding, suggesting that the eradication of bro privilege is a task not just for women but for everyone.

The plotting in this second half gets a bit busy, with an ever-ascending spiral of practical jokes and dance-floor throwdowns—an overkill that’s particularly regrettable given that most of Neighbors’ best scenes happen in the downtime between frenetic gags. Stoller, who also directed Get Him to the Greek and The Five-Year Engagement, tends to let scenes run a little long, allowing for space for his characters to riff on and react to each other. This technique can be both a blessing and a curse, sometimes dragging down the pace, but just as often permitting lovely moments between actors. That scene I described above—Teddy and Pete’s contest of verbal one-upmanship on the “bros before hos” theme—gets a callback later on, after the two friends have been torn apart by their neighbors’ machinations (and by the simple fact that Pete is outgrowing fraternity life and looking forward to graduation, while Teddy … isn’t). There’s no real reason for the length of the scene in which Pete urges Teddy to remember the intimacy they felt during that awesome rhyming match (“Be with me, man! Be with me in this shit!”). But by letting the moment develop between them, Stoller makes sure these two characters are more than just standard-issue college douchebags—they’re college douchebags who care about each other. A few years ago, this kind of bonding moment between men in romantic comedies was inevitably punctured by a tension-relieving “we’re not gay” joke. It seems like a mark of cultural progress that straight male friendship in a mainstream comedy can now serve as something other than a setup.CBS' mailer includes a page highlighting the number of episodes of each big drama contender, noting that "Mad Men" (seven), "True Detective" (eight) and "Breaking Bad" (eight) produced far fewer than "Good Wife's" 22 hours.

Tired of being shut out of a conversation primarily focused on premium cable, CBS has opted to address the cable vs. broadcast disparity head on. The company is launching a bold awards season campaign that not only praises its own critical darling, but also attacks that cable competition -- or, at least, the rules by which these series play. Included in CBS' Emmy mailer is a page that highlights the number of episodes each of this year's major drama contenders produce per season, noting that series like Mad Men (seven episodes), True Detective (eight) and Breaking Bad (also eight) don't hold a briefcase to Good Wife's 22 hours.

"When you look at the television landscape, you realize, 'Wow, The Good Wife does this 22 times a year,' nearly double and in some cases triple what its competitors are producing," CBS TV Studios president David Stapf tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Scores of critics have taken note of Good Wife's particularly strong fifth season, in which showrunners Robert and Michelle King killed off star Josh Charles and had Julianna Margulies' character open a new firm. That Charles' character's death managed to remain under wraps is remarkable in an age of social media spoilers, and it allowed CBS to execute a post-episode PR push featuring a widely read explanatory note from the Kings and key media interviews for Charles. The New York-shot series continues to be a top destination for guest stars, too, and made the vast majority of TV critics' top 10 lists for the year.

It's worth noting that the series didn't lack for awards show attention earlier in its run. Good Wife earned a best drama series Emmy nomination for its first two seasons (losing both times to AMC's Mad Men), and stars Margulies and Archie Panjabi took home wins in the best actress category and best supporting actress category, respectively. The accolades and critical raves made up for the show's relatively weak viewership (Good Wife currently garners a 2.0 weekly demo rating) and proved important for a network in search of cache. But the past two years have seen the series shut out in the best drama category by an onslaught of cable newcomers including Showtime's Homeland (2012 winner), HBO's Game of Thrones and Netflix's House of Cards. (The latter trio featured 12, 10 and 13 episodes, respectively.)

Adds Stapf of the apples-to-oranges comparison he believes Academy voters are being asked to make: "To maintain the kind of quality over the course of 22 episodes, and this year featuring two of the most talked-about, tweeted-about story points in recent television history, is definitely worthy of recognition -- especially given that it is far more challenging to do so in the broadcast television universe."

CBS' move comes amid several Emmy campaign salvos. FX Networks CEO John Landgraf used his upfront platform April 9 to blast rival HBO's decision to submit its close-ended series True Detective as a drama rather than a miniseries. "It's unfair for HBO to get actors [Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson] that you can't normally get to do a series who would do a close-ended show and pack the category," Landgraf said at the time, adding: "That is patently unfair to people like [The Americans'] Matthew Rhys, who signed for seven years." Perhaps ironically, it was his network's decision to submit its anthology series American Horror Story in the miniseries category rather than as a drama that ruffled feathers a few years earlier.Kay Nietfeld/Getty Images

Facebook must have thought the online news game was pretty easy. Two years ago, it plucked a small team of about a dozen bright, hungry twentysomethings fresh out of journalism school or entry-level reporting jobs. It stuck them in a basement, paid them contractor wages, and put them to work selecting and briefly summarizing the day’s top news stories and linking to the news sites that covered them. It called them curators, not reporters. Their work appeared in the “Trending” section of the Facebook home page and mobile app, where it helped to define the day’s news for millions of Facebook users.

That is, by any reasonable definition, a form of journalism. And it made Facebook a de facto news organization.

But Facebook refused to acknowledge that. It never bothered to reckon with the basic responsibilities that journalism entails, nor the ethical and epistemological challenges it presents—probably because they’re messy and inconvenient and might get in the way of optimizing engagement. And now it’s paying the price.

On Tuesday, Facebook became the subject of a Senate inquiry over claims of anti-conservative bias in its Trending section. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, sent Mark Zuckerberg a letter asking a series of pointed questions about how Facebook chooses stories for the section, how it trains its curators, who’s responsible for their decisions, and what steps it’s taking to investigate the bias claims. He also asks for detailed records of stories that the company decided not to include in the Trending section despite their popularity among Facebook users.

The inquiry followed a report by Gizmodo’s Michael Nunez on Monday, in which anonymous former Facebook “curators” described the subjective process by which they assembled the Trending section. Facebook had publicly portrayed the section—which you can find near the top right of Facebook.com or under the search tab on the Facebook app—as an algorithmically driven reflection of the most popular stories its users are reading at any given time. But the ex-curators said they often filtered out stories that were deemed questionable and added others they deemed worthy. One, a self-identified conservative, complained that this led to subtle yet pervasive liberal bias, since most of the curators were politically liberal themselves. Popular stories from conservative sites such as Breitbart, for instance, were allegedly omitted unless more mainstream publications such as the New York Times also picked them up.

None of this should come as a surprise to any thoughtful person who has worked as a journalist. Humans are biased. Objectivity is a myth, or at best an ideal that can be loosely approached through the very careful practice of trained professionals. The news simply is not neutral. Neither is “curation,” for that matter, in either the journalistic or artistic application of the term.

There are ways to grapple with this problem honestly—to attempt to identify and correct for one’s biases, to scrupulously disclose them, to employ an ideologically diverse staff, perhaps even to reject objectivity as an ideal and embrace subjectivity. But you can’t begin to address the subjective nature of news without first acknowledging it. And Facebook has gone out of its way to avoid doing that, for reasons that are central to its identity as a technology company.

Here’s how Facebook answers the question “How does Facebook determine what topics are trending?” on its own help page:

Trending shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook. The topics you see are based on a number of factors including engagement, timeliness, Pages you’ve liked and your location.

No mention of humans or subjectivity there. Similarly, Facebook told the tech blog Recode in 2015 that the Trending section was algorithmic, i.e., that the stories were selected automatically by a computer program:

Once a topic is identified as trending, it’s approved by an actual human being, who also writes a short description for the story. These people don’t get to pick what Facebook adds to the trending section. That’s done automatically by the algorithm. They just get to pick the headline.

Bias in the selection of stories and sources? Impossible. It’s all done “automatically,” by “the algorithm”! Which is as good as saying “by magic,” for all it reveals about the process.

It’s not hard to fathom why Facebook is so determined to portray itself as objective. With more than 1.6 billion active users, it’s larger than any political party or movement in the world. And its wildly profitable $340 billion business is predicated on its near-universal appeal. You don’t get that big by taking sides.

For that matter, you don’t get that big by admitting that you’re a media company. As the New York Times’ John Herrman and Mike Isaac point out, 65 percent of Americans surveyed by Pew view the news media as a “negative influence on the country.” For technology companies, that number is just 17 percent. It’s very much in Facebook’s interest to remain a social network in the public’s eyes, even in the face of mounting evidence that it’s something much bigger than that. And it’s in Facebook’s interest to shift responsibility for controversial decisions from humans, whom we know to be biased, to algorithms, which we tend to lionize.

But algorithms aren’t magic. They’re built by humans, they’re maintained and updated and overseen by humans, and they’re flawed like humans. Most importantly, they’re built to serve human ambitions, which are inherently subjective. I wrote in depth earlier this year about the human values and decisions that shape Facebook’s news feed algorithm. It’s built to execute goals that range from maximizing user engagement to making users feel good about the time they spend on Facebook.

Human values shape the Trending section, too. The algorithm that surfaces the stories might skirt questions of bias by simply ranking them in order of popularity, thus delegating responsibility for story selection from Facebook’s employees to its users. Even that—the notion that what’s popular is worth highlighting—represents a human value judgment, albeit one that’s not particularly vulnerable to accusations of political bias. (That’s why Twitter isn’t in the same hot water over its own simpler trending topics module.)

The problem with an algorithm that simply harnesses the wisdom of the crowd is that the crowd isn’t always wise. The most popular stories at any given time might well be misleading, or sensationalist, or even full of lies. That’s why Facebook felt the need to hire humans to oversee it. This is in keeping with the company’s broader push for what it calls quality content, another term that entails value judgments without copping to them.

Facebook’s instinct to hire journalists was well-placed: As I’ve explained, no algorithm yet devised can fully substitute for a good human writer or editor.

It’s in Facebook’s interest to shift responsibility for controversial decisions from humans, whom we know to be biased, to algorithms, which we tend to lionize.

But Facebook instead opted to hire cheap contractors and went on to claim that their role is simply to “confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers.” That’s a dubious claim, even if you think the allegations of liberal bias are trumped up. If the curators’ job was really just about cleaning up the data, Facebook seems to have forgotten to tell that to the curators themselves, who described their mandate very differently to Gizmodo. They said they were encouraged to prioritize stories from certain outlets deemed reputable; to avoid news about, among other topics, Facebook itself; and to replace the word Twitter in headlines with something more vague, like social media. That may not be political bias, but it’s bias all the same. They also described choosing stories for the Trending section that may not have been surfaced by the algorithm but that seemed to them to be important or worthwhile, like stories about conflict in Syria or the Black Lives Matter movement.

Facebook can and will dispute the specifics of these claims, as the company’s vice president of search, Tom Stocky, did in a Facebook post Tuesday morning. But they’re missing the point entirely. Facebook’s problem is not that its “curators” are biased. Facebook’s problem is that it refuses to admit that they’re biased—or even really human.

The Senate inquiry is pure political theater, a delicious opportunity for Republican politicians to fuel conservatives’ media-persecution complex. It is likely to answer few questions and solve fewer still. Yet Facebook brought this on itself by deliberately obscuring the process behind its Trending section and pretending to have a neutrality that its underpaid nonemployees couldn’t possibly earn.

The problem will not be solved by firing bad apples or instituting tougher guidelines. The only way for Facebook to extricate itself from this mess is to admit that journalism isn’t as simple as it thought. It’s to stop treating “curators” like drones and stop treating news like a data set to be optimized. It’s to build a real human curation team with a real editor in charge and an ethos and a mission and an understanding of the responsibilities involved in shaping how the news is framed to 1.6 billion people. Surely a company that pays its interns $11,000 a month in salary and benefits can afford it.

Either that or—what is more likely, given Facebook’s distaste for human judgment and fear of controversy—take the humans back out of the loop. Turn Trending into the pure algorithmic leaderboard that Facebook pretended it was all along, and accept that it will be quite possibly be riddled with sensationalist junk. Or dispense with it entirely in its current form and bring it back later as a feature of the main news feed.The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail, current and former U.S. officials said.

The message, delivered by Sally Q. Yates and a senior career national security official to the White House counsel, was prompted by concerns that ­Flynn, when asked about his calls and texts with the ­Russian diplomat, had told Vice ­President-elect Mike Pence and others that he had not discussed the Obama administration sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, the officials said. It is unclear what the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, did with the ­information.

Flynn resigned Monday night in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

[Read Michael Flynn’s resignation letter]

In the waning days of the Obama administration, James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the CIA director at the time, shared Yates’s concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that “Flynn had put himself in a compromising position” and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled, according to one of the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

A senior Trump administration official said before Flynn’s resignation that the White House was aware of the matter, adding that “we’ve been working on this for weeks.”

The current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynn’s communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldn’t rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition.

The FBI, Yates, Clapper and Brennan declined to comment on the matter.

In a Feb. 8 interview with The Washington Post, Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials. One day after the interview, Flynn revised his account, telling The Post through a spokesman that he “couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Two officials said a main topic of the relevant call was the sanctions. Officials also said there was no evidence that Russia had attempted to exploit the discrepancy between public statements by Trump officials and what ­Flynn had discussed.

[National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador]

Flynn told The Post earlier this month that he first met Kislyak in 2013, when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow.

U.S. intelligence reports during the 2016 presidential campaign showed that Kislyak was in touch with Flynn, officials said. Communications between the two continued after Trump’s victory on Nov. 8, according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matter.

Kislyak, in a brief interview with The Post, confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election, but he declined to say what was discussed.

For Yates and other officials, concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama administration on Dec. 29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlin’s interference in the election in an attempt to help Trump.

After the sanctions were rolled out, the Obama administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation. To the surprise of many U.S. officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Dec. 30 that there would be no response. Trump praised the decision on Twitter.

Intelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putin’s move. The search turned up Kislyak’s communications, which the FBI routinely monitors, and the phone call in question with Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general with years of intelligence experience.

[The fall of Michael Flynn: A timeline]

From that call and subsequent intercepts, FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing ­Flynn’s discussions with Kislyak.

Yates, then the deputy attorney general, considered Flynn’s comments in the intercepted call to be “highly significant” and “potentially illegal,” according to an official familiar with her thinking.

Yates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure U.S. statute known as the Logan Act, which bars U.S. citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another country.

At the same time, Yates and other law enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act, a statute that has never been used in a prosecution. In addition to the legal and political hurdles, Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia, which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communications.

Word of the calls leaked out on Jan. 12 in an op-ed by Post columnist David Ignatius. “What did Flynn say, and did it undercut U.S. sanctions?” Ignatius wrote, citing the Logan Act.

The next day, a Trump transition official told The Post, “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever.”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 13, said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had “centered on the logistics” of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin. “That was it, plain and simple,” Spicer added.

On Jan. 15, Pence was asked about the phone call during an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Citing a conversation he had with Flynn, Pence said the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.”

Before the Pence statement on Jan. 15, top Justice Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communications.

Pence’s statement on CBS made the issue more urgent, current and former officials said, because U.S. intelligence agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call, contrary to public statements.

The internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan. 19, Obama’s last full day in office.

Yates, Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter. The officials discussed options, including telling Pence, the incoming White House counsel, the incoming chief of staff or Trump himself.

FBI Director James B. Comey initially opposed notification, citing concerns that it could complicate the agency’s ­investigation.

Clapper and Brennan left their positions when Trump was sworn in, but Yates stayed on as acting attorney general until Jan. 30, when Trump fired her for refusing to defend his executive order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim countries — an action that had been challenged in court.

A turning point came after Jan. 23, when Spicer, in his first official media briefing, again was asked about Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Spicer said that he had talked to Flynn about the issue “again last night.” There was just “one call,” Spicer said. And it covered four subjects: a plane crash that claimed the lives of a Russian military choir; Christmas greetings; Russian-led talks over the Syrian civil war; and the logistics of setting up a call between Putin and Trump. Spicer said that was the extent of the conversation.

Yates again raised the issue with Comey, who now backed away from his opposition to informing the White House. Yates and the senior career national security official spoke to McGahn, the White House counsel, who didn’t respond Monday to a request for comment.

Trump declined to publicly back his national security adviser after the news broke.

On Monday afternoon, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said Trump had “full confidence” in Flynn. Minutes later, however, Spicer delivered a contradictory statement to ­reporters.

“The president is evaluating the situation,” Spicer’s statement read. “He’s speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: Our national security.”

And then late Monday, Flynn resigned.

10 unanswered questions after Michael Flynn’s resignation

President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he intends to nominate fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, a vocal critic of substantially increasing the minimum wage and an opponent of rules that would make more workers eligible for overtime pay, as head of the Labor Department.

Puzder, who runs CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., has been a harsh critic of raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, arguing that it would increase costs for consumers and lead to fewer jobs. He also opposes the recently-delayed Labor Department rule that aimed to make millions more workers eligible for overtime pay.

As the head of a fast-food company, Puzder is a supporter of the approach touted by Trump on the campaign trail that lowering taxes for corporations and the wealthy and loosening regulations for businesses can boost job creation. He is a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act, which he claims has hurt the restaurant industry because higher health premiums have left consumers with less money to spend.

By bringing in Puzder, Trump is signaling that he may scale back some of regulations introduced by current Labor Secretary Tom Perez. If confirmed, he will have the potential to reverse some of the Obama administration’s most notable efforts to bolster protections for workers, families and retirement savers.

[Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet]

His appointment could put the future of the Labor Department’s overtime rule into question. In a Forbes op-ed that ran after the Labor Department finalized the overtime rule in May, Puzder wrote that the rule would “add to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers,” and that the rule would lead to fewer hours and reduced opportunities for workers.

As Labor Secretary, Puzder could potentially decide not to defend the rule in court. He could also propose revisions to the rule, but any adjustments would likely require notice and public comment.

With the upcoming nomination of the fast-food executive, Trump would bring another top fundraiser into his cabinet. Puzder supported Trump’s race to the White House financially and served as an economic adviser to his campaign. He and his wife, Deanna, contributed a total of $332,000 to helping Trump get elected, including money given to Trump’s campaign, to joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission.

His anti-regulation stance is also viewed as a threat to another major rule finalized by the Labor Department earlier this year that would affect the investing advice given to retirement savers. The rule would require brokers and insurers to put their clients’ interest ahead of their own. Financial firms opposed to the rule say it is “burdensome” and could limit their ability to work with small-time investors. While Puzder has not addressed the regulation specifically, his nomination increases the likelihood that implementation of that rule could be delayed, according to an analyst report from the investment bank FBR & Co. The move could give lawmakers and the Trump administration more time to repeal or revise the rule.

Puzder has said that government policies that increase labor costs, such as significantly raising the minimum wage, hurt small businesses and “encourage automation.” In March, he told Business Insider that he and other fast-food companies are investing in automation and considering machines that could tackle simple tasks such as taking customers’ orders. “If you’re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive — this is not rocket science,” he said at the time, though he later added that he would never remove all front-line employees.

Some business groups applauded Puzder’s likely nomination Thursday saying that the fast-food executive understands the challenges faced by retailers and restaurants. “Andrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,” said David French, senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which also opposes the overtime rule.

But some Democrats and consumer advocates are critical of Trump’s expected pick, saying his approach may harm low-wage workers. “The Labor Secretary should be someone who wakes up every day thinking about how they can raise American wages and fight for American workers,” Sen. Charles Schumer said in a statement. “Mr. Puzder’s career has shown exactly the opposite.”

Puzder became the CEO of CKE Restaurants in 2000. The company, which has more than 3,700 restaurant locations in 44 states and 39 countries, is in the process of relocating its headquarters from southern California to Nashville. Prior to joining the fast-food business, he worked as a commercial trial lawyer in St. Louis, Mo.

When it comes to immigration, Puzder’s views may not match the hard-line stance advocated by Trump. In a 2013 op-ed written for the San Diego Union Tribune the executive urged Congress to pass legislation that “creates a path, perhaps an arduous one, to a form of legal status for undocumented immigrants.” Puzder wrote it was unrealistic to deport 10 million people and said modernizing the immigration system could help the economy.

Q. Do I have to visit an estranged, sick parent?: My father was diagnosed with cancer last year, and he has been refusing chemo in favor of some “alternative treatment” he found on the internet. When my siblings and I expressed some concerns about his approach, he basically stopped communicating with us because we weren’t supportive enough. We weren’t even informed recently when he ended up in the hospital for a week. His illness seems to be seriously progressing, and I don’t know how much time he has left. I live across the country, and I’m honestly not sure if I want to visit him while I have the chance. I’ve been thinking about my relationship with him and I don’t have any good, happy memories. He was a workaholic who was never around when I was really young. When I was a teenager, all he ever did was hit on my friends and complain about his relationship with my mom. And as an adult he only talks to me in order to lecture me about how awful every single life choice I’ve ever made is. I dread every interaction with him. I know he’s never going to apologize or say he’s sorry for being a bad parent, so I know I won’t get any closure. I have anxiety, and it’s worse than it’s been in a long time, in large part because he’s forcing my family to watch him slowly kill himself. If I have to sit through one of his self-righteous lectures about how I’m a giant failure, I will probably just fly off the handle and feel awful for weeks. I guess I’m not really asking if it’s OK not to visit an estranged dying relative—I’m not going to make myself do this if I can’t handle it. But if I decide not to, how can I deal with the inevitable criticism I’m going to get for my decision? I know people are going to treat me like a monster if I don’t.

A: You’re in an incredibly stressful situation, and I want to commend you for recognizing what you can and cannot do for your father. If you’re worried about criticism from acquaintances or people you don’t know very well, please know that you are under no obligation to share your decision with anyone. It’s more than OK to keep this decision confidential and to talk about it only with close friends or a therapist. If you fear hearing this from other family members, remember that you can always end a nonproductive conversation by saying, “This has been a painful decision, but my relationship with my father has never been healthy or supportive, and I cannot subject myself to further verbal abuse. He has not asked for me to visit him or expressed interest in reconnecting after he cut me off, and I think it’s best for both of us to keep our lives separate. You don’t have to agree with my choice, but I’m not comfortable discussing it further, and I ask that you respect my privacy.” You may not be able to convince everyone around you that you’re doing the right thing, but you don’t have to subject yourself to endless second-guessing from others, either.

Q. Why won’t you bang me?: I recently met a guy, and it was love at first sight. We have a lot in common, can spend hours talking, and find each other physically attractive. However, he seems completely uninterested in sex. We can spend the whole day kissing and cuddling, but he’s extremely reluctant to take it further and almost sees sex as a chore. Whenever I’ve tried talking to him about it, he comes up with an excuse, and I feel bad pestering him about it. I’m no Victoria’s Secret model, but getting guys to have sex with me has usually been the easiest part of a relationship, not the hardest. We’re both in our late 20s and grew up in liberal families in big cities so it’s not that he has conservative ideas about sex and relationships. One friend suggested he might be gay, but I find it hard to believe that someone from his background and circle of friends would stay closeted well into their late 20s. He’s spoken freely about previous relationships, and nothing seems out of the ordinary. What do you think could be up, and how can I approach it with him in a kind way?

A: He may be gay, he may have reasons for wanting to avoid or postpone sex he’s not yet comfortable sharing with you, he may be asexual, he may be interested in sleeping with you in the future but doesn’t feel ready now—there are a number of plausible reasons, but you don’t have sufficient information to speculate why he’s not having sex with you. You do, however, have sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether or not you want to continue seeing him. If you’d like a romantic relationship to include sex, tell him so and ask him if that’s what he wants too. If he prevaricates or offers further excuses, you can say, “I like you a lot, but I think we want different things, and I’m going to move on;” if he shares something with you that you believe you can work with, then you can proceed from there together.

Q. Should I feel bad for not feeling bad?: About four months ago my sister-in-law separated from her husband and moved out. Last week, she gave birth to her third child and a few days later her estranged husband died of a massive heart attack and stroke at the age of 27. The situation is indeed tragic, but I can’t bring myself to feel bad that he died. He was an abusive heroin addict who refused to get help and used his enabling family to harass and bully my sister. He was dragging out the divorce, causing my sister thousands in legal fees, bullying all of her friends and family into letting him take their kids and creating a massive smear campaign against my sister, making sure everyone on his side turned against her. He even attempted suicide, making sure to blame her in his suicide note. I’m actually really glad he’s dead, which I know sounds heartless, but my sister and her children will be so much better off without him in their lives. The rest of my husband’s family is posting all these loving venerating posts about him all over Facebook, and frankly it makes me very angry. Having lost my own sibling only a few years ago, I understand the grief and pain this kind of loss can bring. But elevating him to the level of a saint is not only dishonest, but makes my sister look like the bad guy in the whole situation. My question is this: Should I just keep my mouth shut and let people grieve how they will? Or should I speak up and remind them that just because my sister’s husband died doesn’t negate the abuse and torture he put my sister and her children through for years?

A: I can tell you unequivocally that nothing good will come out of telling this man’s grieving family that their son was a dangerous and unhealthy person, particularly on Facebook. While your complicated feelings of sympathy and anger and relief are understandable, telling your in-laws that everyone else’s lives will be improved by their son’s death will not make anything easier for your sister or her children. Let them grieve as they see fit, even if it’s through rose-colored glasses, and stop reading their eulogies on Facebook. Stop checking their entries on Facebook entirely! It is the official position of this column that everyone should press the mute on social media whenever they find themselves reading obsessively and unhelpfully. Focus on helping your sister-in-law during this difficult time. Even if her relationship with him was traumatic, it’s still going to be a huge adjustment going from having an antagonistic co-parent to no co-parent at all, and she’s going to need a lot of emotional and logistical support in the coming weeks and months. Make sure you’re in a position to offer her some.

Q. Sister mad at me—for getting pregnant: My sister and her husband have been struggling with fertility issues for a couple of years, and just last month they just found out she is pregnant! I am so happy for her and have already sent her a bunch of gifts. Well, last week I found out I am pregnant and now my sister won’t talk to me because she thinks I am trying to upstage her. My husband and I have been married three years, and while we haven’t really been trying, we have always just figured it would happen when it was meant to be. The timing is purely coincidence since we realized we couldn’t make a baby the way we were doing it, but my sister just won’t listen to reason. Her shower is next month, and I really don’t want it to be contentious and stressful since we are both pregnant! How can I help convince her to focus on her happiness and realize I am not trying to be the center of attention? Thanks

A: I have trouble imagining the mindset necessary to believe that another person would go to the trouble of creating a new life and committing to supporting a child financially, physically, and emotionally for at least the next 18 years, all for the purpose of “upstaging” the last few months of someone else’s pregnancy. It is not possible for a pregnancy to be upstaged; your sister is no less pregnant because you have acquired the same condition. You have not siphoned away or diminished a single iota of her happiness, and it’s unfortunate that she thinks having children is a zero-sum game. If she has refused to speak to you because you are going to have a baby, there is little you can do to convince her of her unreasonableness, only hope that in time she will come to her senses and apologize. You might tell her, “Sister, I’m so happy that you and your partner are having a baby, and I hope you can be happy for me too. I know it was difficult for you two to conceive and I’m thrilled that you’re going to be parents. I’m not trying to take anything away from you, and I still want to celebrate this new stage in your life and wish you every joy. I want having children close in age to bring us closer, for them to get to know one another and grow up together, and I hope you want that too.” If she continues to think of your pregnancy as a threat to her after that, all you can do is give her space and absolve yourself of responsibility for her happiness.

Q. 10-year-old daughter doesn’t want to visit friends: My wife and I live out in the country, and there are no children near where we live. Our 10-year-old daughter has friends at school and participates in other activities but shows no interest in visiting friends or having them visit her. I’ve offered to drive, but she declines. My wife grew up in the country and considers this normal, but she had a lot of siblings. I grew up in the suburbs and spent nearly every afternoon going to friends’ houses or having them over. Our daughter is well-adjusted, but she’s an only child, and I worry about her spending most evenings alone with her parents. Should I worry?

A: Worrying seems like a fairly natural state of being for a parent, so feel free to worry as much as you want, but I think you should reread your own letter. Here’s what jumped out at me: You say your daughter is well-adjusted, that she has friends at school, that she participates in extracurricular activities, and that your wife had a similar growing-up experience (and presumably turned out well). All in all, it sounds like your daughter is well and thriving. As long as you’re sure that she’s not hiding some unknown conflict with her peers, or suspect that she’s secretly unhappy, I think you can take your wife’s word that the situation is just fine. You can, of course, continue to occasionally encourage your daughter to have friends over or offer to drive her around, but don’t feel like you’re doing something wrong if she continues to decline.

Q. Family requests after coming out: I’m a queer woman in a long-term relationship with a trans man. My partner and I were waiting for the right time to come out to my conservative parents ... until someone outed my partner to my parents and I chose to be honest and upfront about my own sexual orientation, too. They were shocked and upset and now expect me to cater to their every request to “show them I care about keeping the family together.” These requests include driving two hours to visit them multiple times a week while they berate me about my choices, deleting all photos of my partner and me off social media, and not speaking publicly about LGBTQ issues. My brother, who has typically been an advocate for me, even suggested that I break up with my partner to make things easier on my parents. I know my parents are having a tough time with my coming out, but these visits are often emotionally taxing for me too. I want to reconcile our relationship, but how can I give them the support they need without sacrificing my own emotional health and well being?

A: You can’t, in no small part because what your parents are asking of you is not support but denial of the person you love. Reconciliation is not possible when one party asks the other to obliterate all signs of their relationship. Deleting pictures of your partner has nothing to do with “keeping the family together,” because being in love with a trans man is not a threat to your family’s continued existence. Your parents aren’t “having a tough time with your coming out.” Your parents are trying to force you back into the closet. Your parents are being cruel. It is fine for them to have feelings about your coming out, it is fine for them to seek therapy or to process their feelings on their own time; it is not fine for them to demand that you take near-daily road trips to be berated and hounded about the nature of your relationship. The most supportive thing you can do right now is to refuse to participate in another conversation that is predicated on the need to erase all signs of your partner. If that means you do not see your parents (or your brother), then that is the kindest thing you can do for everyone involved.

Q. Concerned or creeps?: My partner and I socialize with a retired neighborhood couple who are strident advocates for colo-rectal screening, and I’m over 50 and past due for my first. This couple is always on my case about when I’m gonna get my butt scoped. They took my partner in for his procedure a few years ago, and at the time I considered it a favor because I didn’t have to miss work. Since then, however, they’re always joking about things that my partner supposedly divulged following the procedure while still under the influence of anesthesia, yet they never reveal anything that was said. This has made me uncomfortable. And at our most recent get-together, after a few cocktails, the husband divulged that he had to dress my partner following the procedure because my partner was too loopy to dress himself. And they’re again bugging me about getting butt-scoped and insist that they should chaperone me as they’re retired and there’s no need for me to impose on others. Frankly, I’m squicked out. Is their interest in my butt scope creepy, or am I overreacting? And how do I let them know politely that I don’t want them seeing me naked or interrogating me while doped up on Versed?

A: One of the glorious things about being a person in the world is that you don’t have to worry about whether or not someone else is trying to be creepy. If you feel creeped out—if you’re simply uninterested in repeating a conversation you’ve had multiple times—then you get to say, “No,” full stop, without worrying that you’re overreacting or misunderstanding. Maybe they’re getting some prurient rush over accompanying their neighbors to colo-rectal screenings. Maybe they’re just medical busybodies or slightly overeager health enthusiasts. It doesn’t matter what’s driving them, what matters is that you’re sick of having this conversation. Tell them you appreciate their concern, that you’ve been more than adequately briefed on the importance of colonoscopies and that you’re going to make your own medical decisions, that you don’t need a ride to the doctor, and that you consider the matter closed. If they bring it up again, simply say, “I’ve mentioned before that I don’t want to continue discussing it,” and change the subject. If they try to revisit the subject, end the conversation and walk away.

You do not, by the way, ever have to politely tell someone that you don’t want them to see you naked and/or doped up, especially when they’re asking to do so in an inappropriate and insistent way. You just get to tell them you’re not interested.Among the romantic dresses and fencing-inspired suiting on the runway at Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Dior debut was one piece that will have the fashion world talking. A T-shirt reading We Should All Be Feminists was paired with an embellished midnight blue tulle skirt and sneakers, instantly becoming the most Instagrammed moment of the entire show. The fact that Chiuri is the first female artistic director of the Dior maison was a much-discussed fact in the lead-up to her debut—and clearly one that she took to heart. The show notes also made a point of explaining how important feminism is to Chiuri: “Feminism is a recurring word for her.” What’s more, the Beyoncé song “Flawless,” which features Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s famous TEDx talk about feminism, played on the soundtrack. And the author was in the crowd.

The rest of the show rang of feminism, too, from the flat sneakers paired with gowns to the images of female strength depicted through both tailored suiting and flowing dresses. Still, to those really trying to get the message across—and quick!—we’d recommend going for the tee. If only it were see-now-buy-now . . .Mandel Ngan/Getty Images

Birtherism, the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born abroad and thus ineligible for the presidency, served a very specific purpose. It was a tool of delegitimization, a means to drive xenophobic suspicion and racial hostility. It’s why Donald Trump, its chief advocate, never truly dropped the crusade—not after wide condemnation from critics and fact-checkers; not after wide ridicule from much of the public; and not after Obama released his long-form birth certificate, debunking the charge outright. “A lot of people question it,” said Trump in a 2015 question-and-answer session with Fox News’ Sean Hannity a few months before he announced his bid for the White House.

Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.

Trump’s birtherism didn’t just feed anti-Obama distrust and paranoia among conservative voters. It helped feed a sense of grievance—a feeling that their country had been hijacked by nefarious forces, and they needed to take it back. And whether Trump realized it or not at the time, it also helped till ground for his eventual presidential campaign and its message of nativist anger and racist hostility. It is now important to remember all of this, as Trump and his backers stoke another conspiracy theory, aimed at delegitimizing a different set of opponents.

Since November, Trump and his allies have adopted a similarly false and conspiratorial take on the election, claiming without evidence that millions of unauthorized immigrants voted in the presidential race, handing a popular vote victory to Hillary Clinton. “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” declared Trump just a few weeks after the election. He doubled down on this claim during the presidential transition, repeating it during a meeting with lawmakers and subsequently announcing a “major investigation” into said fraud. In recent days, the president has given a new twist of specificity to his claims of voter fraud, telling a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats that illegal voters from Massachusetts were responsible for Clinton’s win in New Hampshire.

On Sunday, Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president, offered his own support for Trump's claims. “This issue of busing voters in New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics,” said Miller in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. “It’s very real. It’s very serious.” Despite being repeatedly pressed for evidence on this claim, Miller said, “This morning, on this show, is not the venue to lay out all the evidence.” This is what someone says when he doesn’t have the goods.

There is no evidence, of course. No evidence of mass voter fraud in New Hampshire, no evidence of mass voter fraud anywhere. There are individuals with registrations in more than one state—unavoidable when people move to different cities and states and register to vote—and there are dead people on the rolls who haven’t been taken off yet. But both are unrelated to mass fraud at the actual polls, for which, again, there is no evidence. In Iowa, for example, just 10 votes out of the 1.6 million cast in the 2016 elections could be classified as improper. And Republican officials in New Hampshire vehemently dispute the notion of fraud in their state. “Repeating: there is no voter fraud in NH. None. Zip. Nada. Hundreds of lawyers, poll workers, watchers, press — not buses rolled in,” wrote Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire Republican and voting member of the Republican National Committee, on Twitter. Nationwide, the most comprehensive research finds a similarly minuscule rate of improper voting. One investigation found just 31 potential cases of voter intimidation in more than a billion ballots cast between 2000 and 2014. And noncitizen voting, contra claims from White House officials such as Miller, is also so rare as to be negligible.

In which case, what’s the point? Why tell tales of voter fraud? Why assert blatant falsehoods on social media and national television?

A part of it, as with birtherism, is to delegitimize the opposition, to convince the public—or at least Trump’s voters—that the popular vote was illegitimate and that the fact of voter fraud means they can’t trust traditional measures of popularity. The polls, the vote, anything that threatens Trump’s self-image as an avatar for the people—it’s all “fake news.”

Why tell tales of voter fraud? Why assert blatant falsehoods on social media and national television?

The other part is simple signaling. In state after state, Republicans presage new voter restrictions and requirements with claims of fraud and abuse. They warn that without strict voter identification or indiscriminate purging of voter rolls, elections would be tainted by the mere possibility of “illegal voting.” And they use that alleged danger as pretext for a cascade of changes, from slashing the types of voting—reducing or ending early and weekend voting—to cutting the number of polling places, limiting hours, and requiring even more documentation. In Texas, for example, lawmakers have introduced legislation that would create strict documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. Aimed at noncitizen voting, it would also ensnare people who just lack access to those documents, from elderly citizens to low-income blacks and Latinos who, through circumstances, can’t immediately produce birth certificates and don’t have passports.

With Jeff Sessions, an avowed opponent of liberal voting laws, in place at the Department of Justice, and with Kris Kobach, a prolific architect of restrictive voter laws, in an advisory position within the administration, Trump’s constant claims of voter fraud aren’t just the special pleading of someone who craves the affirmation of a popular vote victory; they reflect an actual agenda, aimed at eroding the right to vote for millions of Americans.

What comes next? As a U.S. attorney in Alabama, Sessions prosecuted voting rights activists, and as a senator, he backed the Supreme Court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act and cleared the path for a wave of voter suppression laws. Now, as attorney general of the United States, he, along with Trump, has a chance to take those efforts national, targeting voters of color by purging rolls, going after activists through prosecutions and other intimidation, backing restrictive laws in court, and dropping cases against states and localities that discriminate in voting.President Trump's new pick for labor secretary spoke out against anti-Muslim discrimination in testimony to Congress six years ago.

In a speech to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Alexander Acosta praised efforts by President George W. Bush's administration to protect American Muslims.

Acosta led the Justice Department's civil rights division for two years under Bush. In 2011, after he left government and while he was dean of the Florida International University law school, he testified at a Senate hearing on protecting the civil rights of Muslims.

He said federal attorneys investigated more than 600 "backlash" incidents between 2001 and 2005, resulting in more than 170 prosecutions.

Acosta also said informal meetings between Muslim American and Arab American community leaders and government agencies "worked well."

"These efforts following 9/11 were important. They set a tone," Acosta told the committee. "They reminded those who might be tempted to take out their anger on an entire community that such actions were wrong."

As labor secretary, Acosta would serve a president who once pledged to suspend all Muslim immigration, and whose ban on travel by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries has been overturned by the federal courts.

Trump tapped Acosta on Thursday as his nominee to lead the Labor Department. His original choice, Andrew Puzder, withdrew his candidacy on Wednesday after several Republicans said they wouldn't support him.

Unlike Puzder, a fast food executive, Acosta has spent much of his career in public service. He served on the National Labor Relations Board from 2002 to 2003 under Bush, and was the first Hispanic assistant attorney general at the Justice Department.

Acosta remains dean of Florida International University's law school.

Acosta handled a number of discrimination cases at the Justice Department. In 2004, his office intervened on behalf of an 11-year-old Muslim girl who was suspended from public school in Oklahoma for wearing a headscarf.

"No student should be forced to choose between following her faith and enjoying the benefits of a public education," Acosta said at the time.

He said while local schools have the authority to set dress standards, those rules "cannot come at the cost of constitutional liberties." The school district settled a Justice Department lawsuit, allowed her to wear the headscarf and pledged to change its dress code.

Acosta's department also settled a racial discrimination lawsuit against Cracker Barrel in 2004.

Federal officials accused the restaurant chain of allowing white servers to refuse to wait on black customers and segregating customers by race.

Cracker Barrel agreed to enact "far reaching changes to policies and practices to prevent discrimination."Kim Jong-nam was almost certainly murdered by North Korean agents, according to intelligence officials in South Korea, as suspicions mounted that his assassination at Kuala Lumpur airport was ordered by his estranged half-brother, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.



Death of Kim Jong-nam: depictions of North Korea hide threat of dictatorship Read more

South Korea’s spy agency said on Wednesday that two women believed to be North Korean operatives poisoned the 45-year-old exile in a shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur international airport.

Kim, who had not yet passed through security, was preparing to take a late-morning flight on Monday from the Malaysian capital to his home in Macau, according to South Korean MPs briefed by security services.

Selangor state’s police chief, Abdul Samah Mat, told the Guardian that Kim Jong-nam arrived in Malaysia on 6 February, a week before he was attacked. “He was travelling on a North Korean passport,” he said. “The postmortem is in progress. It’s up to the pathologists on how long it will take. Sometimes it involves lab tests.”

US government sources also said they believed that Kim Jong-nam was murdered by North Korean assassins.

Japan’s Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed Japanese government official as saying that the two suspected assailants may already be dead, but offered no further details.

The theory that Kim had been targeted by spies from the country he left more than 15 years ago gathered pace after Malaysian officials released CCTV image purporting to show one of the alleged attackers as she waited for a taxi outside the airport shortly after the incident.

The local Malay Mail newspaper published a grainy photo of a woman it said was suspected by police of killing Kim Jong-nam. The image showed a young female, carrying a bag and wearing a white jumper that said “LOL” in large black print across the front. The Guardian has been unable to confirm if the woman is a police suspect.

Kim, whose father was the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, claimed to have no political ambitions, but just weeks after his half-brother’s elevation to the leadership in late 2011 he told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi that the world would view his leadership as a “joke”.

In the same email exchange with Gomi, Kim spoke disparagingly of his younger brother, saying he lacked “any sense of duty or seriousness” and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea’s eventual collapse. Two years earlier, he told Japan’s TV Asahi that he “personally opposed” the hereditary transfer of power in his family.

People with contacts in the north believe Kim Jong-un had long targeted his brother, who reportedly divided his time between Macau, China and Singapore, and enjoyed some level of Chinese protection.

South Korean intelligence officials claimed the regime had been planning his assassination for five years, but did not explain why they thought that was the case.

Kim Jong-nam was once considered the heir apparent to the North Korean leadership but left the country to lead a life in exile after attempting to enter Japan on a forged Dominican Republic passport in 2001 – an incident that caused embarrassment to his father. Kim had told Japanese immigration officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

Jiro Ishimaru, of the Osaka-based Asia Press, said Kim’s murder could only have been ordered by his half-brother, whom he had never met.

“Any criticism of the Kim dynasty is viewed as unforgivable, no matter where it comes from,” Ishimaru told the Guardian. “It’s the worst thing you can say about the regime, and certainly not the kind of comment that the leadership would be able to shrug off, no matter how long ago it was said.

“The only person inside North Korea with the power to decide whether Kim Jong-nam lived or died is Kim Jong-un.”

Mark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul, agreed, saying: “It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un.”

Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who want to depose his brother.

Kim Jong-nam had told airport workers that someone had attacked him “from behind” and sprayed him in the face with an unknown liquid. He died in an ambulance on the way to hospital.

“He told the receptionist at the departure hall that someone had grabbed his face from behind and splashed some liquid on him,” said Selangor state’s criminal investigation chief, Fadzil Ahmat, according to Malaysia’s The Star newspaper.

“He asked for help and was immediately sent to the airport’s clinic. At this point, he was experiencing headache and was on the verge of passing out. At the clinic, the victim experienced a mild seizure. He was put into an ambulance and was being taken to the Putrajaya hospital when he was pronounced dead.”

Malaysian police confirmed the death of a 45-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang. “Investigation is in progress and a postmortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.

South Korea’s government called an emergency security council meeting and condemned Kim’s death. “If the murder of Kim Jong-nam was confirmed to be committed by the North Korean regime, that would clearly depict the brutality and inhumanity of the Kim Jong-un regime,” the country’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said.

In exile, Kim Jong-nam had largely managed to stay out of the spotlight. He had lived both in mainland China and Macau, and was also spotted in Malaysia. He reportedly fled to Singapore from Macau in 2012, fearing for his life after his brother assumed power, and suspecting that the regime’s agents had discovered where he lived.

It is not clear if he had returned in recent years, but his family – his second wife and their three children – were living in the former Portuguese colony. A South Korean MP claimed Kim also had a wife and son in Beijing.

He was known to travel around Macau without bodyguards, and was occasionally spotted at nightclubs in the Hotel Lisboa, according to a 2007 investigation by the South China Morning Post.

Since becoming leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has sought to tighten his grip on power by ordering the purges and, in some cases, executions of high-level officials he believes represent a threat to the regime. The most high-profile victim was his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, who was executed on several charges, including treason, in 2013.

North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, although details of the incident are shrouded in mystery. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organise a hit-and-run targeting Kim in China in 2010.

Kim reportedly pleaded for his life after another attempt to kill him in 2012, according to South Korean lawmakers who had been briefed by the head of the country’s national intelligence service, Lee Byung-ho.

“According to [Lee] … there was one [assassination] bid in 2012, and Jong-nam in April 2012 sent a letter to Kim Jong-un saying: ‘Please spare me and my family,’” Kim Byung-kee, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters.

The ex-wife of Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of labor, appeared in disguise on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1990 and said the Carl’s Jr. CEO “vowed revenge” after she accused him of domestic abuse.

Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.



On a panel of what the show called “high-class battered women,” Lisa Fierstein said Puzder was “too smart” to “leave marks” or “hit you in front of everyone.” “The damage that I sustained, you can’t see. It’s permanent,” she said. Puzder’s hearing is scheduled for Thursday.

In January, Politico reported that Fierstein had appeared on Oprah to discuss Puzder’s alleged abuse. It obtained footage of the episode from Charlotte Fedders, who joined Fierstein on the 1990 panel, on Tuesday. Appearing in the clip under a pseudonym, Fierstein says Puzder threatened, “I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over. You will pay for this,” after she went public with her allegations.

Fierstein later retracted her claims of Puzder’s brutal violence during negotiations over a child custody agreement reached in the months after her Oprah appearance. Since accusing Puzder of beating her to the point of bruising and ruptured discs in the late ’80s, Fierstein has claimed that she made those allegations only to get a leg up in divorce negotiations, as Slate’s Ben Mathis-Lilley wrote in January:

The story of the accusations is somewhat convoluted, as Fierstein now says that she invented the two alleged incidents of physical abuse in question, which were said to have taken place in 1985 and 1986, after “impulsively” filing for divorce and being “counseled then to file an allegation of abuse.” But reporting from the time indicates that police responded to the couple's home during the 1986 incident, which took place in May, before Fierstein filed for divorce. Court documents posted by Politico also indicate that Fierstein formally filed a claim of abuse before filing for divorce.Disney announced the official title of Star Wars: Episode VIII this morning, and it seems unlikely to provoke as many snickers as The Force Awakens:

It's official. STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is the next chapter of the Skywalker saga. This December. #TheLastJedi https://t.co/ySkVwQcMTP pic.twitter.com/eHrPgbsRJq — Star Wars (@starwars) January 23, 2017

Instead, the title seems likely to mark the return of one of the Star Wars universe’s oldest debates: What is the plural of Jedi? Many dictionaries accept both Jedi and Jedis for the plural, and there are plenty of instances of characters in the films using Jedi as a plural noun. (See, e.g., Yoda, who—though his approach to grammar is undoubtedly unconventional—calls arrogance “a flaw more and more common among Jedi.”)

The question, then, is are we talking about one last Jedi, or more? If it’s just one, The Last Jedi could refer to Luke, for example, or it could refer to Rey, implying that Luke is going to die. If The Last Jedi is plural, on the other hand, it could refer to Luke and Rey, or it could refer to a whole bunch of “last Jedi”: Leia? Finn? A redeemed Kylo Ren? BB-8?!

There is some precedent for this kind of ambiguity. In the titles of Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, Jedi and Sith could be taken as either singular or plural, leading to different interpretations. (And I should also note that while there is a Star Wars novel called The Last Jedi, it seems unlikely to have any relation to the upcoming movie, given that the book is not about Rey or Luke or Leia or any of the other Skywalkers.)Andrew Puzder, President Trump’s labor secretary nominee, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid growing resistance from Senate Republicans centered primarily on Puzder’s past employment of an undocumented housekeeper.

The collapse of Puzder’s nomination threw the White House into further turmoil just two days after the resignation of Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, amid revelations that ­Flynn had spoken repeatedly, and possibly illegally, with the Russian ambassador last year about lifting U.S. sanctions.

Puzder’s fate amplified the deteriorating relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill, where bipartisan support grew Wednesday for expanded investigations into ties between Trump, his presidential campaign and Russian officials.

The White House, including Trump, offered no comment on Puzder’s withdrawal nor any indication of whom the president would nominate in the restaurant executive’s place. Puzder issued a statement saying he was “honored” to have been nominated. “While I won’t be serving in the administration, I fully support the President and his highly qualified team,” he said.

A top Trump campaign supporter, Puzder had attracted widespread criticism regarding his business record and personal background. He was set to testify Thursday at a confirmation hearing that had been delayed for weeks to allow for the completion of an ethics review of his vast personal wealth.

Critics have railed against Puzder’s positions against minimum-wage increases and more generous overtime benefits. Some have also accused him of sexism, pointed to a rancorous divorce that involved later-recanted allegations of domestic abuse as well as racy TV ads run by his restaurant chains that featured scantily clad women eating hamburgers.

But it was Puzder’s hiring of an undocumented worker for domestic work — as well as his support for more liberalized immigration policies — that pushed several Senate Republicans away, they said.

Puzder had told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions this month that he had been unaware of the housekeeper’s immigration status when he hired her and that he paid federal and state back taxes after terminating her employment.

Similar revelations have forced Cabinet nominees to withdraw dating to at least Bill Clinton’s presidency, but it was less clear this year, in the unpredictable, rule-breaking era of Trump, whether that norm would apply. In the end, the revelation was particularly troubling to lawmakers because of the job Puzder was seeking: running the Labor Department.

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a member of the Senate health committee, said Wednesday that revelations about Puzder’s personal employment practices gave him “serious concerns” that he had conveyed to Senate leaders. Three other GOP senators on the committee, Susan Collins (Maine), Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), had also publicly voiced doubts.

In the hours before Puzder withdrew, 12 Republican senators “at a minimum” were withholding support, according to a senior Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid political retribution. The quick erosion of support compelled Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to tell the White House on Wednesday that Puzder lacked the support needed to survive, according to two senior Senate aides who requested anonymity. Shortly after that, Puzder withdrew.

Senators may yet face another contentious confirmation vote Thursday, when Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), Trump’s nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is scheduled for a final vote on the Senate floor. On Wednesday, Mulvaney lost the backing of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who objects to Mulvaney’s support for military spending cuts.

[Trump’s pick for budget director just lost a crucial backer in the Senate]

Puzder has spent much of his career in the restaurant industry speaking out against wage and labor regulations. The former commercial trial lawyer has been a staunch opponent of rules finalized by the Labor Department last year — and since put on hold — that would have expanded the number of people eligible for overtime pay. He also has been critical of substantially increasing the minimum wage, arguing that it could push companies to cut jobs and encourage businesses to invest more money in automation.

As a result, Puzder’s nomination immediately came under intense scrutiny from unions, labor groups and consumer advocates who worried the executive would prioritize businesses over workers. As recently as this week, workers from his fast-food chain and advocates for a higher minimum wage marched outside of CKE’s restaurants to protest the nomination. Worker advocates had also hand-delivered petitions to senators’ local offices and organized trips for CKE employees to travel to Capitol Hill and share their grievances with senators.

Democrats cheered Puzder’s withdrawal and sought to take credit for helping pressure Republicans to withdraw support.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Puzder’s decision “a victory for the American worker. Puzder should never have even been nominated to lead the Labor Department, and Senate Republicans clearly recognized this, too.” He called on Trump to nominate someone who “champions workers’ rights rather than suppresses them.”

Progressives and Democrats said they hoped Trump’s next pick for labor secretary would be someone with a clear willingness to speak up for disadvantaged workers.

“We need a labor secretary in the mainstream who supports the workplace protections that he or she would be charged with enforcing — and who cares about workers,” said Emily Martin, general counsel for the National Women’s Law Center, which opposed Puzder’s nomination because of “sexist” advertising run by Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s — two of Puzder’s restaurant chains — and reports of harassment from employees working for the chain.

Several names that had emerged on Trump’s shortlist for labor secretary late last year began recirculating Wednesday. Among them: Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. After Puzder’s withdrawal Wednesday, Walker tweeted: “The future is too bright in WI for me to do anything other than being Governor.”

Puzder would have been the first labor secretary since the Reagan era to take the job without some experience in public service. He made a minor foray into politics in 2011, when he served as an economic adviser and spokesman for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who recently endorsed his nomination.

In 2016, Puzder was an avid Trump supporter. In addition to serving as an economic adviser to his campaign, he and his wife, Deanna Puzder, contributed a total of $332,000 to Trump’s bid, joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission.

Senators often do not weigh in on a nominee publicly until after a confirmation hearing, but Republicans have been mostly in lockstep to support Trump’s top Cabinet nominees. Only one other pick — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — drew as much public wavering among Republicans before his hearing, when five GOP senators expressed doubts. Ultimately, all of them voted for Tillerson.

Beyond the committee where Puzder was scheduled to appear Thursday, three other Republicans — John Thune (S.D.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) — publicly expressed concerns about his nomination.

Thune’s hesitancy was notable because he is the third-ranking Senate Republican and responsible for helping to build support for big-ticket GOP causes. He told reporters Wednesday that he wanted to know more about why Puzder employed an undocumented housekeeper and how he paid her. Tillis cited the same concerns to reporters.

Collins and Murkowski also voted against Betsy DeVos, Trump’s choice for education secretary, forcing Vice President Pence to become the first vice president to cast a tiebreaking confirmation vote for a Cabinet member. Both senators are among several who had seen footage of a 1990 “Oprah Winfrey Show” episode in which Puzder’s former wife appeared in disguise to describe allegations of domestic violence.

The health committee requested that Winfrey’s production company provide copies of the episode for senators to review. Puzder has always denied the allegations, and his ex-wife recanted the accusations in 1990 when the couple reached a child-custody agreement at the time of their divorce and again in a letter to senators last month.

Aides said before Puzder’s withdrawal that Portman was still reviewing his history and did not want to weigh in yet, but the senator represents a state where labor unions were building support against the nomination. Portman won reelection last year with the endorsement of several labor unions, a rare feat these days for a Republican.

[Oprah Winfrey’s TV network provided footage of interview tied to Andrew Puzder’s labor secretary nomination]

Another blow to Puzder’s chances came on Wednesday morning when the conservative National Review announced its opposition. The publication cited Puzder’s past support for increased levels of legal immigration for high-skilled or seasonal workers — a position at odds with Trump’s calls for limited legal immigration.

The magazine’s editors acknowledged “the impulse of the White House and the Senate to try to bulldog through rather than to give obstructionist Democrats a scalp.” But, they wrote, “The country, and the administration, can weather a redo on this one.”

The National Restaurant Association — which had marshaled members across the country to help Puzder — called his withdrawal “extremely unfortunate.”

“Andy Puzder would have made a great labor secretary,” said Cicely Simpson, the group’s executive vice president. “We hope that President Trump’s next labor secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy.”

Read more at PowerPostFormer national security adviser Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U.S. officials said.

The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense. But several officials said it is unclear whether prosecutors would attempt to bring a case, in part because Flynn may parse the definition of the word “sanctions.” He also followed his denial to the FBI by saying he couldn’t recall all of the conversation, officials said.

Any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department.

A spokesman for Flynn said he had no response. The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment.

Flynn spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak following Trump’s election and denied for weeks that the December conversation involved sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia in response to its purported meddling in the U.S. election. Flynn’s denial to the FBI was similar to what he had told Trump’s advisers, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

(Reuters)

In a recent interview with the Daily Caller, Flynn said he didn’t discuss “sanctions” but did discuss the Obama administration’s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats it said were “intelligence operatives.” The move was part of the sanctions package it announced on Dec. 29.

Earlier, in an interview with The Post, he denied discussing sanctions but later issued a statement saying “that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Trump asked for Flynn’s resignation Monday night following reports in The Washington Post that revealed Flynn had misled Vice President Pence in denying the substance of the call and that Justice Department officials had warned the White House that Flynn was a possible target of Russian blackmail as a result.

[Justice Department warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, officials say]

One day after his dismissal, the Defense Intelligence Agency suspended Flynn’s security clearance. Officials said the spy agency was reviewing Flynn’s adherence to security procedures in part due to FBI concerns about his conduct.

Two days after the FBI interview, then-acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates and a career national security official informed Donald McGahn, Trump’s White House counsel, about the contents of the intercepted phone call in a meeting at the White House. Yates and other officials were concerned that Russia could not only exploit the mischaracterization of the call — which Pence had repeated on nationwide television — but also did not think it was fair to keep Pence in the dark about the discrepancies, according to officials familiar with their thinking.

At a news conference Thursday, Trump called Flynn a “fine person” and said he had done nothing wrong in engaging with the Russian envoy. Trump said he did not direct Flynn to talk to Kislyak. However, the president added, “I would have directed him because that’s his job.”

Trump said he had asked for Flynn’s resignation because of what the national security adviser had told the vice president about his communications with the Russian diplomat. “I was not happy with the way that information was given,” Trump said.

The president said the real issue in the Flynn saga was the divulging of classified information. “It’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.”

[The Michael Flynn situation just went from bad to worse for Flynn — and the White House]

Senior officials who have reviewed the phone call thought Flynn’s statements to Kislyak were inappropriate, if not illegal, because he suggested that the Kremlin could expect a reprieve from the sanctions.

At the same time, officials knew that seeking to build a case against Flynn for violating an obscure 1799 statute known as the Logan Act — which bars private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes — would be legally and political daunting. Several officials said that while sanctions were discussed between Flynn and Kislyak in the December call, they did not see evidence in the intercept that Flynn had an “intent” to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

“It wasn’t about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,” Flynn told the Daily Caller in an interview just before he resigned and published Tuesday. “So that’s what it turned out to be. It was basically, ‘Look, I know this happened. We’ll review everything.’ I never said anything such as, ‘We’re going to review sanctions,’ or anything like that.”

It is not clear when the FBI began to probe Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Senior members of the Obama administration learned in early January that the FBI was investigating the relationship, according to former officials.

On President Barack Obama’s final full day in office, Yates, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and CIA Director John O. Brennan recommended informing the Trump team of the Flynn matter. But FBI Director James B. Comey pushed back, arguing that doing so could interfere with the bureau’s ongoing investigation. The FBI is examining contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Comey dropped his objections after the FBI interviewed the national security adviser.

After Yates informed McGahn, the White House counsel informed Trump and then conducted an internal review of the matter, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

[Who is Donald McGahn?]

While McGahn and Trump were briefed on the matter on Jan. 26, it does not appear that they informed Pence. A spokesman for the vice president said he first learned that he had been misled when The Washington Post on Feb. 9 disclosed that Flynn had, in fact, discussed sanctions with Kislyak, contrary to the vice president’s public statements.

Flynn said in his resignation letter that he had “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador.”

The timeline of Michael Flynn’s resignation just looks bad for the Trump White House

In an attempt to project some semblance of party unity and momentum, House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled the latest Republican roadmap for replacing the Affordable Care Act this week. It is not the most detailed document—more a collection of broad-stroke ideas than a concrete policy plan—and it's unclear how much support it would find in Congress. But at least one thing is obvious from this outline: Republicans are looking to turn Obamacare repeal into an assault on abortion access.

Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.

Here's how they'd go about it: To make health insurance (somewhat) affordable, Ryan's plan would offer tax credits to all Americans purchasing coverage on the individual market. However, women would not be allowed to use those subsidies to buy plans that paid for aboration. Given that the vast majority of customers would want to use their tax credits, most carriers would likely drop abortion coverage from their offerings.

“It seems pretty clear that this would drastically scale back or possibly eliminate abortion coverage in the individual market,” Adam Sonfield, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, told me. He added that the rule could also have “spillover effects” on employer-based insurance, because of the way the Republican idea could affect COBRA coverage.

Reproductive health advocates faced down a similar threat when Congress was crafting Obamacare in 2010. Back then, the House of Representatives passed the notorious Stupak amendment, which would have banned Americans from using the ACA's tax credits to buy coverage that included abortion benefits. The worry then was that if insurers couldn't sell subsidized plans that covered abortion, they wouldn't bother selling any. One analysis from the George Washington University School of Public Health suggested that would spark an industry-wide change in standards that would end coverage of medically necessary abortions “for all women, not only those whose coverage is derived through a health insurance exchange.” Before Obamacare became law, however, the Stupak amendment was subbed out for a watered-down replacement proposed by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson.

The map of abortion coverage under the ACA is complicated. Thanks to the Hyde amendment, which prevents federal money from being used to fund abortions, Medicaid can't cover abortion anywhere. Meanwhile, 25 states currently restrict or ban insurance plans sold on Obamacare's insurance exchanges from covering abortion, according to Guttmacher. Ten states limit it on all private insurance plans. But in others there are no restrictions on abortion benefits in the private market at all.



The new Republican plan is a bit like the Stupak amendment on steroids. After all, Obamacare's subsidies are only eligible to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty line. The Republican tax credit would be available to anybody in the individual market, meaning insurers would likely expect pretty much everyone to use one, and tailor their offerings accordingly. (For those wondering: No, Ryan has not said how much the credits would be worth, and since they'd be universal, they'd also likely be pretty small.) You would expect abortion coverage to disappear from the whole individual market rapidly. Like the GW team argued years ago, it's possible that the change in industry norms would lead insurers to drop the benefits from the plans they sell to employers. Some might suggest that women could purchase special riders to cover abortion, but those sorts of add-ons haven't worked particularly well in health insurance, since they tend to be extremely expensive.

It's hard to quantify how deeply the GOP plan would damage abortion access. “Even when women do have private insurance coverage, most of them end up paying out of pocket [for abortions]. What is not clear is why,” Sonfield told me. However, driving abortion coverage out of the individual market would certainly make the procedure less affordable for many, while further stigmatizing a procedure that should be considered a standard part of reproductive care.A transgender woman claiming to be a victim of domestic violence was detained by ICE agents in an El Paso courtroom in what county leaders said sends a “horrible message” to the community and victims of domestic violence.



In a conference call Thursday, county leaders spoke with the media about concerns raised by the arrest, which was made by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents.

County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal said the woman arrested was a victim of domestic violence and had filed three reports about the alleged abuse, with the most recent occurring when her partner allegedly chased her with a knife and threw it at her.

On Feb. 9, the woman received a protective order for the domestic violence claim before being detained by ICE.

Bernal said a federal agent was inside the courtroom and sat through the proceedings. That agent, along with another outside the courtroom, waited for the proceeding to end before arresting the woman.

The woman was escorted from the courtroom and out of the building and was placed into custody, Bernal said.



The affidavit states that the woman was detained on San Antonio Street outside the courthouse.

County officials said they will meet with Congressman Beto O’Rourke on Friday and will bring up this issue because they said there was video proof of the agents waiting for the victim in the courtroom and escorting her out of the building.

District Attorney Jaime Esparza said it is difficult for victims to reach out, and he wants to make sure they know that their status in the country doesn’t matter and that they have “the right to live in a safe community.”

Esparza said he is concerned that the ICE agents came into the courthouse, and that it “sent a horrible message to victims of domestic violence.”

Bernal said the arrest happened after ICE received a tip that the woman would be in court that day.

“I’m suspicious that the tip may have come from the abuser, who knew precisely where the victim would be at that time and date since he had received notice to be in that courtroom as well,” Bernal said in an interview Wednesday.

County Judge Veronica Escobar said that the El Paso community, “documented or undocumented,” has been able to enjoy a positive relationship with law enforcement, and she was concerned about their relationship after the arrest.

“This departure from that collaboration and communication – we see as very dangerous,” Escobar said. “When we meet with the congressman (and ICE) tomorrow, we would like to acknowledge this was a onetime mistake.”

Stephanie Karr, the executive director of El Paso's Center Against Sexual and Family Violence, said her office has received several phone calls from clients asking if they were safe and what they should do.

“(We’re) telling them we are there to support them, protect them. We have the support of the county and the district attorney’s office. We will do everything in our powers to make sure they are safe and protected,” Karr said.

In a statement separate from Thursday’s conference call, Texas Senator Jose Rodriguez said in part, “Under no circumstance should a person trying to escape an abuser have to fear that if she tries to get help, then the abuser can call ICE. What an awful choice to make: stay with someone who hurts you, or get a protective order and run the risk that ICE agents will grab you while you're in court.”

County officials said that the woman is being held in the El Paso County jail under a federal ICE detainer, and that she is maintaining a positive attitude about the situation.

According to an arrest affidavit filed by federal agents, the woman was removed from the United States six times and voluntarily returned to Mexico during another incident.

The woman’s criminal history includes convictions for false imprisonment in 2013; assault, probation violation, domestic violence in 2011 and false imprisonment-minor-parental in 2010. She was also previously arrested for possessing stolen mail.A Christian florist’s personal assets and home are now at risk because she could not in good conscience arrange flowers that would be used in a gay wedding ceremony.

On Thursday, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that Barronelle Stutzman broke anti-discrimination laws when she turned away a homosexual couple seeking floral arrangements for their wedding.

“Barronelle knew her customer and friend identified as gay, yet happily served him for years.”

“It’s wrong for the state to force any citizen to support a particular view about marriage or anything else against their will,” Kristen Waggoner, Stutzman’s attorney, wrote in a statement issued shortly after the ruling. “Freedom of speech and religion aren’t subject to the whim of a majority; they are constitutional guarantees.”

Apparently the Washington State Supreme Court disagrees. The decision comes after a lengthy legal battle, which began in 2013. A lower court had previously found Stutzman guilty and fined her, but she appealed the decision.

With the Washington State Supreme Court’s decision, the only option left is to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, something which Stutzman’s lawyer said would be done immediately following the decision.

The Left is hailing the decision as some sort of victory for equal rights and justice. “By ruling that intolerance based on sexual orientation is unlawful, the Court affirmed that Washington state will remain a place where no one can be discriminated against because of who they love,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in a written statement.

Others, however, say the ruling is a gross miscarriage of justice which intentionally distorts the law in order to suppress Christians and their beliefs.

“Americans were told repeatedly that redefining marriage would have little impact on their lives. Yet now courts are seeking to drive families from their businesses — and now today even their homes as the result of crippling government imposed fines designed to force them to deny their faith,” said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins in a prepared statement.

“Barronelle knew her customer and friend identified as gay, yet happily served him for years; she just didn’t want to be involved in his wedding. But the ACLU and the Washington State government couldn’t stand this, and decided to make an example out of her,” Perkins said.

This would indeed seem to be the case. The very fact that that Stutzman knew these customers were homosexual and happily served them in the past is surely evidence that she did not discriminate against them because of their sexual orientation, but simply wished to not lend her services to an event and ceremony in direct contravention of her deeply held religious beliefs.

The Left has blurred the distinction between refusing to serve an individual because of his sexual orientation and refusing to do business with an individual in one specific instance because one does not agree morally with what that individual plans to do with the product.

"The Washington State Supreme Court's ruling tramples on our nation's long-held tradition of respecting the freedom of Americans to follow their deeply held beliefs, especially when it comes to participating in activities and ceremonies that so many Americans consider sacred," Perkins said.

"Cultural elites may succeed in convincing judges to strip away the livelihoods of people but the elites continue to face a losing battle at the ballot box and in the court of public opinion."5485074

National Security Advisor Gen. Michael T. Flynn (ret.) — who resigned Monday — was the victim of a “hit job” launched by intelligence operatives, Obama government holdovers and former Obama national security officials, according to former intelligence officials who spoke with The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.

The talk within the tight-knit community of retired intelligence officers was that Flynn’s sacking was a result of intelligence insiders at the CIA, NSA and National Security Council using a sophisticated “disinformation campaign” to create a crisis atmosphere. The former intel officers say the tactics hurled against Flynn over the last few months were the type of high profile hard-ball accusations previously reserved for top figures in enemy states, not for White House officials.

“This was a hit job,” charged retired Col. James Williamson, a 32-year Special Forces veteran who coordinated his operations with the intelligence community.

Noting the Obama administration first tried to silence Flynn in 2014 when the former president fired him as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Williamson called Monday’s resignation, “stage Two of ‘Kill Mike Flynn.”

Former intelligence officials who understand spy craft say Flynn’s resignation had everything to do with a “disinformation campaign” and little to do with the December phone conversation he had with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

They charge officials from America’s top spy counsels leaked classified government intercepts of Flynn and President Trump’s conversations with world leaders and had “cutouts” — friendly civilians not associated with the agency — to distribute them to reporters in a coordinated fashion.

The issue of leaks was a prime topic for Trump when he tweeted Wednesday, “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia.”

“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Retired Col. James Waurishuk, who spent three decades in top military intelligence posts and served at the National Security Council, said in an interview with TheDCNF. “We’ve never seen to the extent that those in the intelligence community are using intelligence apparatus and tools to be used politically against an administration official,” he said.

“The knives are out,” said Frederick Rustmann, who retired after 24 years from the CIA’s Clandestine Service and was a member of its elite Senior Intelligence Service.

The media is organizing to topple the Trump presidency with assistance of national security leaks, Rustman charged in an interview with TheDCNF.

“I would not be surprised if Trump did not finish four years because of the vendetta they have out for him,” he said, calling the move on Flynn just a “mini-vendetta.”

Williamson told TheDCNF in an interview, “I truly believe it’s orchestrated and it’s part of an overall strategy. The objective is to piece-by-piece, dismantle the Trump administration, to discredit Trump. This is part of an overarching plan.”

D.W. Wilber, who has over 30 years of experience in security and counterterrorism with the CIA and the Defense Department agrees.

“It appears to me there has been a concerted effort to try to discredit not only General Flynn, but obviously, the entire Trump administration through him. He just happened to be the first scalp,” Wilber told TheDCNF in an interview.

Williamson agreed, telling theDCNF, “There are individuals who are well versed in information operations — we used to call that propaganda. They know how to do it. It’s deliberately orchestrated.”

Retired Marine Col. Bill Cowan, who often interacted with the intelligence operatives in combat zones, believes Mike Pompeo, Trump’s new CIA Director, must clean house. Otherwise, the administration will encounter four years of attacks.

“The director, Pompeo, if he doesn’t get a hold of the agency and its personnel, he can expect four years of this: clandestine, undercover disinformation, misinformation, psychological information to undermine this administration and this president,” he told TheDCNF.

Charles Goslin, a 27-year veteran in CIA operations also believes that many insubordinate intelligence staff are working within the National Security Council within the White House.

“With the NSC, I think that’s where the leaks are coming from on calls to foreign leaders. That’s where they undermined Flynn to the point where he got hammered,” Goslin told TheDCNF in an interview.

Goslin noted, “When Trump came in, even though they were able to staff key NSC positions, for the most part it’s still staffed by previous administration holdovers and bureaucratic appointees.”

“I don’t think they have any loyalty to the current administration,” the former CIA operations officer said, adding, “the NSC is going to be a hard one to fix.”

All of the former intelligence officials say the rage against Flynn dated back to when the decorated general headed up the DIA. There he garnered a reputation to balk at the “politicization of military intelligence” in order to conform with President Obama’s world views.

Flynn refused to downplay the threat posed by the Islamic State and other radical Islamic groups throughout his two-year reign at the DIA. He was fired after offering congressional testimony that was at odds with the Obama administration’s posture on the Islamic threat.

Waurishuk, who interacted with Flynn as an Air Force intelligence officer and as deputy director of intelligence at the U.S. Central Command, said Flynn was a “straight shooter” who always demanded accurate threat assessments and never bent to the Obama pressures of political correctness.

Waurishuk worked in military intelligence in the Obama administration. He told TheDCNF Obama officials “know Flynn and they hate Flynn because he would call them out. So, this was their opportunity to wage what is a personal vendetta in some respects.”

California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has promised to look into the leaks of classified information to reporters. The date has yet to be set for the hearings.

There are transcripts of a conversation in at least one phone call, recorded by American intelligence agencies that wiretap foreign diplomats, which may determine Mr. Flynn’s future.

Stephen Miller, the White House senior policy adviser, was circumspect on Sunday about Mr. Flynn’s future. Mr. Miller said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that possibly misleading the vice president on communications with Russia was “a sensitive matter.” Asked if Mr. Trump still had confidence in Mr. Flynn, Mr. Miller responded, “That’s a question for the president.”

This account of life inside the council — offices made up of several hundred career civil servants who advise the president on counterterrorism, foreign policy, nuclear deterrence and other issues of war and peace — is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former council staff members and others throughout the government. All spoke on the condition that they not be quoted by name for fear of reprisals.

“It’s so far a very dysfunctional N.S.C.,” Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a telephone interview.

In a telephone conversation on Sunday afternoon, K. T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser, said that early meetings of the council were brisker, tighter and more decisive than in the past, but she acknowledged that career officials were on edge. “Not only is this a new administration, but it is a different party, and Donald Trump was elected by people who wanted the status quo thrown out,” said Ms. McFarland, a veteran of the Reagan administration who most recently worked for Fox News. “I think it would be a mistake if we didn’t have consternation about the changes — most of the cabinet haven’t even been in government before.”

There is always a shakedown period for any new National Security Council, whose staff is drawn from the State Department, the Pentagon and other agencies and is largely housed opposite the White House in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

President Barack Obama replaced his first national security adviser, Gen. James Jones, a four-star former supreme allied commander in Europe, after concluding that the general was a bad fit for the administration. The first years of President George W. Bush’s council were defined by clashes among experienced bureaucratic infighters — Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell among them — and by decisions that often took place outside official channels.

But what is happening under the Trump White House is different, officials say, and not just because of Mr. Trump’s Twitter foreign policy. (Two officials said that at one recent meeting, there was talk of feeding suggested Twitter posts to the president so the council’s staff would have greater influence.)

A number of staff members who did not want to work for Mr. Trump have returned to their regular agencies, leaving a larger-than-usual hole in the experienced bureaucracy. Many of those who remain, who see themselves as apolitical civil servants, have been disturbed by displays of overt partisanship. At an all-hands meeting about two weeks into the new administration, Ms. McFarland told the group it needed to “make America great again,” numerous staff members who were there said.

Nervous staff members recently met late at night at a bar a few blocks from the White House and talked about purging their social media accounts of any suggestion of anti-Trump sentiments.

Mr. Trump’s council staff draws heavily from the military — often people who had ties to Mr. Flynn when he served as a senior military intelligence officer and then as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency before he was forced out of the job. Many of the first ideas that have been floated have involved military, rather than diplomatic, initiatives.

Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was exploring whether the Navy could intercept and board an Iranian ship to look for contraband weapons possibly headed to Houthi fighters in Yemen. The potential interdiction seemed in keeping with recent instructions from Mr. Trump, reinforced in meetings with Mr. Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, to crack down on Iran’s support of terrorism.

But the ship was in international waters in the Arabian Sea, according to two officials. Mr. Mattis ultimately decided to set the operation aside, at least for now. White House officials said that was because news of the impending operation leaked, a threat to security that has helped fuel the move for the insider threat program. But others doubt whether there was enough basis in international law, and wondered what would happen if, in the early days of an administration that has already seen one botched military action in Yemen, American forces were suddenly in a firefight with the Iranian Navy.

Ms. McFarland often draws on her television experience to make clear to officials that they need to make their points in council meetings quickly, and she signals when to wrap up, several participants said.

And while Mr. Obama liked policy option papers that were three to six single-spaced pages, council staff members are now being told to keep papers to a single page, with lots of graphics and maps.

“The president likes maps,” one official said.

Paper flow, the lifeblood of the bureaucracy, has been erratic. A senior Pentagon official saw a draft executive order on prisoner treatment only through unofficial rumors and news media leaks. He called the White House to find out if it was real and said he had concerns but was not sure if he was authorized to make suggestions.

Officials said that the absence of an orderly flow of council documents, ultimately the responsibility of Mr. Flynn, explained why Mr. Mattis and Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A., never saw a number of Mr. Trump’s executive orders before they were issued. One order had to be amended after it was made public, to reassure Mr. Pompeo that he had a regular seat on the council.

White House officials say that was a blunder, and that the process of reviewing executive orders has been straightened out by Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff.

Still, Mr. Flynn presents additional complications beyond his conversations with the Russian ambassador. His aides say he is insecure about whether his unfettered access to Mr. Trump during the campaign is being scaled back and about a shadow council created by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s top strategist, who was invited to attend meetings of the “principals committee” of the council two weeks ago. For his part, Mr. Bannon sees the United States as headed toward an inevitable confrontation with two adversaries — China and Iran.

Mr. Flynn finds himself in a continuing conflict with the intelligence agencies, whose work on Russia and other issues he has dismissed as subpar and politically biased. Last week, in an incident first reported by Politico, one of Mr. Flynn’s top deputies, Robin Townley, was denied the high-level security clearance he needed before he could take up his job on the council as the senior director for Africa.

It was not clear what in Mr. Townley’s past disqualified him, and in every administration some officials are denied clearances. But some saw the intelligence community striking back.

Two people with direct access to the White House leadership said Mr. Flynn was surprised to learn that the State Department and Congress play a pivotal role in foreign arms sales and technology transfers. So it was a rude discovery that Mr. Trump could not simply order the Pentagon to send more weapons to Saudi Arabia — which is clamoring to have an Obama administration ban on the sale of cluster bombs and precision-guided weapons lifted — or to deliver bigger weapons packages to the United Arab Emirates.

Several staff members said that Mr. Flynn, who was a career Army officer, was not familiar with how to call up the National Guard in an emergency — for, say, a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina or the detonation of a dirty bomb in an American city.

At the all-hands meeting, Mr. Flynn talked about the importance of a balanced work life, taking care of family, and using the time at the council to gain experience that would help staff members in other parts of the government. At one point, the crowd was asked for a show of hands of how many expected to be working at the White House in a year.

Mr. Flynn turned to Ms. McFarland and, in what seemed to be a self-deprecating joke, said, “I wonder if we’ll be here a year from now?”Paul Kim/Flickr

For the past 20 years, as Silicon Valley workers have invented the apps and devices that define this young century, system engineers have sought to bring the Caltrain rail corridor up to date with the last one.

Henry Grabar Henry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate’s Moneybox.

Transforming the Caltrain, which runs between San Francisco and San Jose, into an electric railway would be expensive, but it would bring benefits like cleaner, quieter trains (compared with today’s diesel locomotives), more efficient schedules, and increased passenger capacity. The last piece has come to seem especially necessary: The system’s ridership, which now tallies 62,000 riders a day, has doubled since 2009 and nearly tripled since 2004.

The $2 billion modernization project draws its funding from local, regional, and state revenues, plus a federal grant, two years in the making, that planners thought was all but approved. On Friday, this Core Capacity grant becomes eligible for a signature from U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. It’s supposed to be a formality capping a long period of review at the Federal Transit Administration; contractors are in place to start work on electrification on March 1.

But that was before the California’s 14 GOP U.S. representatives asked Chao not to give the state the money, citing the connection between Caltrain electrification and the state's larger, politically tempestuous high-speed rail project. The representatives want an audit of the state's high-speed rail project before Caltrain can move forward.

For Californians, it’s an early test of a simmering fear that the state’s outspoken political opposition to the Trump administration might come with a price. More broadly, Chao’s decision will show the extent to which she—considered the most qualified of Trump’s Cabinet picks but also the one closest to the GOP power structure—will politicize DOT’s billions of dollars in grants. The letter, sent to Chao on Jan. 24, a week before her confirmation, is the rare effort by congressional representatives to deprive their own state of federal money.

It’s true that the high-speed trains between Los Angeles and San Francisco are currently slated to run over Caltrain’s soon-to-be-electrified tracks and that Caltrain’s state funding was made available by the Legislature’s 2012 grant of high-speed rail funds. But the Caltrain project has been part of the railway’s strategic plans since 1999 and has its own environmental review. In September, a judge in Silicon Valley ruled the projects were separate, calling electrification a “project of independent utility.”

Mimi Walters, one of the representatives who signed the letter, said in a statement provided to Slate that the letter did not oppose electrifying the corridor but “instead expresses serious concerns about the use of taxpayer funds for a project that is tied to high speed rail. ... Taxpayers deserve accountability and transparency, which is why all high-speed rail funding should be put on hold, until a thorough audit of the entire project is completed.”*

For Walters and her fellow representatives, a project “tied to high-speed rail” is effectively the same thing as high-speed rail itself. The letter to Chao mistakenly claims that the California High Speed Rail Authority, or CHSRA, is seeking the electrification grant. It is Caltrain, not the CHSRA, that has applied for the electrification grant from the FTA.

High-speed rail has been a target of GOP politicians nationwide for the past decade, and the California project is no exception. The cause for the letter to Chao, though, was a Jan. 13 article by the Los Angeles Times reporter Ralph Vartabedian that alleged, citing a confidential Federal Railroad Administration report, that the project “could cost taxpayers 50 percent more than estimated,” just on the route’s first 118 miles of track.

In its response, the CHSRA wrote that Vartabedian mischaracterized both the document—which, as a risk analysis, was supposed to outline potential overruns and problem scenarios—and its conclusions about ongoing spending of stimulus funds.

But the L.A. Times “bombshell,” if overblown, was enough for the state’s Republicans to take their case to Washington in the hopes of finding a friendly face at the head of the DOT. Chao can sign off on $647 million for electric trains in Silicon Valley on Friday. She has two weeks. “Everything is ready to go,” said Seamus Murphy, the chief communications officer for Caltrain. Contracts have been issued. “All of the other boxes have been checked for the approval of the project. If we don’t get the grant finalized by March 1, then the project itself is in jeopardy of not being viable.”

The political calculus for Chao is complicated. Her boss, of course, campaigned on a platform of infrastructure improvement and just last week lamented America’s lack of high-speed trains. In a joint press conference last week with Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praised his stance on the transportation mode. “With President Trump taking on the leadership, I'm sure there will be major scale infrastructure investments will be made, including the high-speed train.” (Abe is trying to sell Japan’s maglev technology to the Northeast Corridor.) As the transportation writer Alon Levy observes, the Caltrain project is actually a bargain as far as Trump's wish list of U.S. rail projects go, and would allow the railroad to serve up to 100,000 weekday riders by 2040, enabling population growth without stress on the region's highways.

On the other hand, Trump has revealed nothing of his proposed infrastructure plan beyond vague talk of public-private partnerships, whose impact would be limited. One of the representatives who wrote the letter, Kevin McCarthy, is the House majority leader and a Trump favorite. (“Where’s Kevin? There’s my Kevin.”) Chao’s husband is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been a foremost opponent of Trump’s big infrastructure spending proposal. Wary of federal spending, McConnell also doubted that an infrastructure bill would be a good use of the party’s time and resources.

Caltrain electrification doesn’t really belong in the same breath as pie-in-the-sky infrastructure improvements—its signature from Chao at this stage is supposed to be assured. But it could be the administration’s first opportunity to fulfill one of the president’s fantasies: taking money away from California.The congressman, who prides himself on his prolific schedule of town-hall-style meetings, banged his gavel and insisted that his rules for civility be obeyed.

While Mr. Sensenbrenner did not face the kind of anger that some of his peers did in recent days, he must answer the same question: Is this resistance a sign of a sustainable organic movement, or one that will soon flame out? And like his colleagues, he is also coming to grips with how much he will be saddled with the combative comments made by President Trump.

Mr. Sensenbrenner, in an interview, attributed the turnout at his gatherings to “organized opposition by people who were on the losing side of the election.”

Facing restive audiences in public meetings is not new, but in the age of social media, an ugly scene in one congressional district can quickly attract widespread attention.

“I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” he said.

In California, Representative Tom McClintock was escorted by police officers after a town-hall-style meeting earlier this month; in Utah, the crowd chanted “Do your job!” at Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight Committee. At a meeting last week, House Republicans were advised on security precautions so they would be prepared for protesters at town-hall-style meetings or their district offices.

The questions from voters on display this weekend at a series of town-hall-style meetings in Wisconsin’s Fifth Congressional District, many of which were focused on the future of the health care law, underscored the quandary many lawmakers are facing even in solidly Republican districts.

The imminent problem: Constituents want answers, and without any consensus on how to go about replacing the law, Republicans have little to say.

“It’s kind of like, you know, getting a 30,000-piece jigsaw puzzle for Christmas,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said, “and, you know, cleaning off the dining room table and seeing how long it takes to put all the 30,000 pieces together in the right place. It’s not going to be easy.”

Mr. Sensenbrenner won re-election last year by 37 percentage points. His right-leaning district, which includes suburbs around Milwaukee, voted decisively for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton.

At three town-hall-style meetings over the weekend, Mr. Sensenbrenner sat at the front of the room to take questions from people who submitted slips of paper listing their name and address. When he called on people, he read their names and where they live — a practice that makes people “less likely to make fools of themselves,” he said in the interview.

At the meetings, he faced crowds that were adversarial but generally civil, and he fielded questions on a range of issues. At moments when the gatherings grew a bit unruly, he did not hesitate to bang his gavel. Like a frustrated grade-school teacher, he offered some unsolicited advice about comportment.

“This is not a session on who can cheer or boo the loudest,” he said as he began the Pewaukee meeting on Saturday, urging people to “be respectful of opinions that you do not share.”

The tough questioning of Republican lawmakers has been driven partly by concerns over health care, but also by outrage over Mr. Trump’s presidency.

That was true in Wisconsin, too. Mr. Sensenbrenner, who has long worked on immigration issues in Congress, said the executive order on immigration was “completely messed up” and a “train wreck.” And he suggested he would be of little assistance in reining in Mr. Trump.

“Do you think I’m able to control anybody else’s mouth, from the president on down?” he asked.

Repeatedly, the questions Mr. Sensenbrenner faced over the weekend showed the challenge that lawmakers have in explaining the effects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, especially now, when Republicans have yet to coalesce around a replacement plan.

Pressed by one questioner to oppose a replacement for the health care law if that replacement would raise costs for sick people, he explained that “there are winners and losers” when bills are passed.

A woman told him she learned she had skin cancer in 2005, and she asked about coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Another woman told him that her 97-year-old mother was in a nursing home, and she wondered whether changing Medicaid to give each state a fixed amount of money, called a block grant, could cause her mother to be “put out on the street.”

Leigh Levas, 35, a medical technologist, told him that her 9-year-old daughter had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

“I’ve been sending him postcards with her photo, because I think he needs to see the people that it affects,” Ms. Levas said after the Pewaukee meeting.

Mr. Sensenbrenner offered a reassurance that some popular aspects of the health care law would remain: insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions, young adults could stay on their parents’ health plan until they are 26, and lifetime limits on coverage would not be allowed. And he acknowledged the stakes of the repeal effort.

“From a political standpoint, we Republicans know that we will own whatever the replacement will be, just as Obama and the Democrats own the A.C.A.,” he told Ms. Roelandts, who asked about health coverage for her daughter. “We got to get it right, and we got to get it right the first time.”

Ms. Roelandts, an accountant, said later that she was not happy with his answer. “I kind of interpret it as they don’t really know what they’re going to do yet,” she said, adding that she was alarmed by the comparison to a 30,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

“Don’t talk about repealing something until you have valid ideas on the table for replacing it,” she said. “I mean, it’s causing me to literally lose sleep at night.”

Still, Mr. Sensenbrenner was blunt and unapologetic about the Republican push for dismantling President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.

“I won by 146,000 votes,” he said in the interview. “I represent the majority. Now, they’re a vocal minority.”Mike Segar/Reuters

Under President Obama, people became increasingly concerned about government surveillance both at home and abroad. If you thought Obama was bad, though, imagine Donald Trump—known for his vindictiveness and his lack of respect for the Constitution—in charge of the powerful U.S. government surveillance apparatus. While campaigning, Trump called on Apple to break into the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters and publicly called for a boycott of the company until it did. In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s victory, Twitter was abuzz with online security tips for those concerned with a dystopic surveillance state that could put people—particularly women, minorities, and activists—at risk.

Hey, no joke, and I'm paraphrasing smarter people. If you plan on opposing Trump:

“All of this advice is good security advice” in general, says Micah Lee, a security engineer and journalist at the Intercept. “A Trump presidency makes it more pressing because Trump seems to be eager to abuse his power, but everyone has been able to abuse their power and do these sorts of things for a long time.”

The National Security Agency has extraordinary access to data on U.S. citizens, and as John Napier Tye, a former State Department section chief for internet freedom and a whistleblower, wrote in Future Tense last week, the possibility of Trump using it for nefarious purposes—such as collecting and leaking private information on his enemies—doesn’t exactly seem far-fetched. Whether the Obama administration will succeed—or even attempt—to meaningfully rein in NSA powers before Jan. 20 remains to be seen. Government requests to companies make a big difference in whether any steps to limit surveillance are effective, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which approves electronic surveillance in the United States, is already a rubber stamp under Obama.

For now, here is a look at some of the security tips being suggested and what protection they may provide.

Get Future Tense in your inbox.

Two-factor authentication for email

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security for your email accounts. It works by requiring you to enter a temporary code from a phone app (like Google Authenticator) or a text message in addition to your username and password or by plugging a security key such as YubiKey into your USB port.

But would it protect you if you’re one of Trump’s targets? “I think it depends on how Trump goes about trying to get revenge on his enemies,” says Lee. If you’re an activist under investigation by the Trump Justice Department, two-factor probably won’t help you because the government can just put in a data request into Google to get access to your emails. (It can even send a national security letter accompanied with a gag order.)

But if you’re using a foreign email provider that’s not responsive to U.S. government requests for data, or if the government is trying to hack into emails, then two-factor may help.

“Hypothetically, there is such a thing as parallel construction,” says Harlo Holmes, a digital security trainer at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. (Parallel construction is when law enforcement builds parallel evidence for a criminal investigation to conceal how it began—for instance, by hacking without a necessary warrant or approval.) “It’s conceivable that an account that’s easy to hack could be infiltrated by an agency that would use parallel construction to support what they already learned from the hacking.”

If nothing else, two-factor authentication does offer some protection against run-of-the-mill hackers.

Virtual private networks

A VPN can be used to route traffic through an encrypted connection to the VPN’s server.

Fear of how a Trump presidency might tap into NSA surveillance capabilities provides a good opportunity to take stock of your own security.

It’s not anonymous—the VPN provider knows who you are—but if you’re worried about someone sitting in an unmarked van outside of your house and monitoring your Wi-Fi network (hey, it’s happened before) a VPN could offer some protection. “It has the benefit of giving you a bit of location privacy,” Lee says, because it allows you to log in with the same IP address whether you’re at home, at your office, or at a coffee shop. Otherwise, you may have a different IP address from different locations, which makes it easier to know when you’ve switched locations. (Some workplaces even have their own IP addresses that list the names of the businesses.) Connecting using your carrier’s network may only deliver your general location (usually just the city and state), but authorities could always ask your carrier for specific information. Additionally, commercial outfits such as Skyhook Wireless are capable of providing users of their service with very specific location data based on hotspot IP addresses.

That said, many VPNs have issues of their own. Some log data, which could easily be handed over to the government in response to a data request. And there are many shady VPNs—and no easy way to verify security claims made by VPNs on their sites (or on the many affiliate-based review sites). You also have to pay for a VPN, usually about $4.99-$15 per month.

The Tor browser

Unlike VPNs, the Tor browser (Tor stands for “the onion router”) does offer anonymity by running traffic through multiple relays—and it’s free. Additionally, Tor’s bundled browser has been heavily modified to maximize privacy on the web by disabling Flash and clearing cookies when a window is closed.

Lee emphasizes that since we don’t yet know what Trump would do, it’s too early to say that you should always use Tor exclusively. Tor is slow and actually blocked by many sites (such as Yelp), and it’s not perfect, particularly when it comes to real-time attacks, as opposed to gathering your data after the fact. “If your attacker can watch the traffic coming out of your computer, and also the traffic arriving at your chosen destination, he can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit,” Lee says.

But Tor could well prove useful for individuals perusing potentially sensitive sites—like information on converting to Islam or researching online activism. And as Holmes points out, “Tor has a million other uses.” For instance, it can allow you to look up medical symptoms without your searches becoming a part of an advertisement profile.

Signal

Signal is a scrappy, free phone app created by Open Whisper Systems that’s available for both Android and iOS. Open Whisper Systems can see your metadata, but it doesn’t log it, which limits its ability to turn info over to the government.* When the company received a request for data through a grand jury investigation, it was only able to respond with the most recent time and date the user logged into his or her account.

The government could theoretically try to force Open Whisper Systems to modify its service to make it more surveillance-friendly (just as it tried to force Apple to do), but Signal is far more secure for things like activist organizing than, say, Facebook groups.

Passwords and encryption

Lee says that smartphones are a big attack vector right now and that Android users should enable disk encryption on their phones. (It’s on by default on iOS, but of course you’d need a good password as well.) Using a password manager such as KeePass, 1Password, or LastPass and setting strong, unique passwords for each service you use—as well as your phone—could help you if you are in danger of being detained.

An uptick in future street harassment by law enforcement is more than possible, with stop-and-frisk proponent Rudy Giuliani being floated as a possible attorney general pick—which would put him in charge of the Justice Department and give him oversight of the FBI. Using strong, unique passwords and encrypting your phone offers protection against run-of-the-mill hackers as well. This is a better option than TouchID, since some courts have ruled that it’s constitutional to force suspects to unlock their phones with their thumbprints, but so far, it seems that forcing users to input passwords is not.

Company responses

Some have called for Google, Facebook, and other companies to take greater responsibility for user privacy. For instance, New York Times columnist Zeynep Tufekci tweeted, “tech companies should immediately go to end-to-end encryption and ponder alternative financial models.” Others suggest the companies could give people better tools to scrub their behavioral data. In fact, Google does have some options available for users to prune their account data, which is a good practice, but it’s not clear whether deleting user data is effective against the state—it depends on where Google stores it, for how long, how it’s intercepted, and other factors.

“If you really need to make sure law enforcement or anyone that Trump is controlling doesn’t have access to a lot of your private information, then don’t give it to Facebook and Google,” Lee recommends. Stick to encrypted messaging apps such as Signal, and consider paying to use email or service providers that you trust and that have a policy of fighting unconstitutional government requests for data, such as Electric Embers or Riseup. (That said, there’s a bit of a trade-off as well—smaller providers that are likely to resist government requests for data have fewer security staffers and are not immune to being hacked themselves.)

OK, these tips may sound a bit on the paranoid side. But these tools are versatile and offer some protection not just against mass surveillance, but against run-of-the-mill hackers as well. Fear of how a Trump presidency might tap into NSA surveillance capabilities provides a good opportunity to take better stock of our own security and encourage others to do so as well.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images

On Jan. 13, less than three weeks ago, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder announced the drinking water for Genesee County, the county encompassing Flint, could be linked to two outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease in the area. Snyder said he had been notified of public health emergency days before the announcement. A new set of emails released Thursday, however, show that the outbreak, and its link to a cost-cutting switch to drinking water from the Flint River, was well-known to high-ranking officials in the Snyder administration as much as nine months earlier, in March 2015.

“There were at least 87 cases [of Legionnaires' disease] across Genesee County during a 17-month period, including nine deaths, but the public was never told about the increase when it was happening—even after an initial wave of more than 40 cases was known by early 2015,” according to the Detroit Free Press. The harm done is clear; and the emails are straightforward, unambiguous, and damning. Here’s an example from the Free Press:

Former Department of Environmental Quality Communications Director Brad Wurfel sent the e-mail on March 13, 2015, to Harvey Hollins, who is Snyder's director of urban initiatives. It was copied to Dan Wyant, who was [Department of Environmental Quality] director at the time. "More than 40 cases reported since last April," Wurfel said in the e-mail. "That's a significant uptick. More than all the cases reported in the last five years or more combined." Wurfel said that Jim Henry of the Genesee County Health Department is "putting up the flare," and has "made the leap formally in his e-mail that the uptick in cases is directly attributable to the river as a drinking water source."

Here’s the email from Jim Henry from Genesee County Health Department on March 10.

“The increase of the illnesses closely corresponds with the time frame of the switch to the Flint River water. The majority of the cases reside or have an association with the city,” Henry, Genesee County’s environmental health supervisor, wrote March 10 to Flint leaders, the city’s state-appointed emergency financial manager and the state DEQ. “This situation has been explicitly explained to MDEQ and many of the city’s officials,” Henry said in the e-mail that was forwarded by the DEQ to a Snyder aide three days later. “I want to make sure in writing that there are no misunderstandings regarding this significant and urgent public health issue.”At least two men were arrested by ICE agents across the street from a church in Fairfax County, causing concern that some people may be deterred from going to the church's shelter. News4's Northern Virginia Bureau Chief Julie Carey reports.

Some are questioning the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are handling arrests in Fairfax County after at least two men were arrested near a church shelter.

Oscar Ramirez said he had just left the hypothermia shelter at Rising Hope Mission Church on Russell Road in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County, Virginia, when about a dozen ICE agents surround him and other Latino men.

"'Stop right there. Stop right there. Stop right there. Stay by the wall, where we can see your hands,'" the agents said, according to Ramirez.

The group of men had left the shelter about 6:45 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 8 and crossed the street when the ICE agents ordered them to stand against a brick wall.

Ramirez said the agents questioned all of them and scanned their fingers to find out if they had criminal backgrounds. Agents quickly cleared Ramirez, who has a green card, he said.

But he and other witnesses told News4 that about six Latino men were arrested and taken away in two vans that pulled up to the area where they had been stopped.

"This is the first time I see something like that," Ramirez said.

"It surprised me. I mean, I think it surprised a lot of people who seen it actually happen," said Marvin Roach, a guest at the church shelter.

"They were clearly targeting the church because they knew that they stayed here in the hypothermia shelter. So they were waiting for them to cross the street and then jump on them," said Rising Hope Mission Church Rev. Keary Kincannon.

An ICE spokeswoman said the agency's "sensitive location" policy was followed. The policy requires agents to avoid arresting people at places of worship, schools and medical facilities. The spokeswoman emphasized the arrests took place across the street from the church and not on church property.In October 2012, data security firm Imperva released a controversial report on the efficacy of anti-virus (AV), which concluded that AV solutions only stopped 5 percent of all malware identified. Few reports in the security industry had been as polarizing as this one—many reacting with white-knuckle rage. It was a classic case of Chris Christensen’s “Innovator’s Dilemma,” where old school technologies cling to life, in the face of a new paradigm. Just yesterday, one of the original anti-virus vendors joined the fray in “declaring anti-virus dead” in the Wall Street Journal.

At FireEye, we look at hundreds of malware samples daily, and, in a recent talk at RSA Conference, Zheng Bu, vice president of research at FireEye presented some interesting data that security teams should consider as they think about their AV initiatives. Looking at nearly half a million malware samples over two years, our researchers discovered that the average lifespan of a piece of malware is very short. The chart below compares how many hours (X axis) malware lives against the total pool of malware samples (Y axis) to show just how quickly they disappear:

Our data shows an interesting picture: most malware remains active for no more than two hours when FireEye is detecting it. To be precise, our analysis showed that in 2013:

82 percent of malware disappears after one hour

70 percent of malware only exists once

With the half-life of malware being so short, we can draw the conclusion that the function signature-based AV serves has become more akin to ghost hunting than threat detection and prevention. In spite of this, IDC found the market for endpoint security products like anti-virus to generate $11 billion in revenues in its “Worldwide IT Security Products 2013 – 2017 Forecast” despite APT activities creating nearly fifty unique malware infections everyday.

In AV Land, Everyone Is a Sacrificial Lamb

Today’s AV model makes everyone a sacrificial lamb. In the past, malware writers would write their attack code once with little need to iterate. Today, as our numbers show, rapidly developing iterations of malware is becoming the de facto way of hacking.

A simple comparison of the malware writing process versus anti-virus signature development shows a stark contrast.

First, let’s look at the malware development process:

Malware is developed, QA’d against the latest AV signatures, released, and once it is picked up by AV sensors and shared among vendors—the malware dies. The process takes a few days at most.

By contrast, anti-virus vendors work in a process that takes a few days to a few weeks.

Examining the two “supply chains,” you quickly see why anti-virus is inherently behind the curve – doomed to chasing ghosts. By the time malware signatures are updated from collection and have gone through QA, the samples are more-or-less defunct unless it is a rare instance where the core code of the malware could not be modified. Over the years AV vendors have increased the frequency of signature updates to convey the benefits of eventual detection. However, it is already an increasing challenge to apply frequent security updates to thousands of business-critical computer assets in medium to large size organizations – especially where many assets such as laptops are also mobile. Ultimately this does not close the days to weeks collecting new malware samples can take, which is why security solutions – like FireEye – that do not rely on such a reactive model detect malware faster.

To be clear, single-iteration malware will continue to persist, and a minor need for AV will remain to provide a layer of reactive protection against these unsophisticated, benign threats. But with high-profile breaches occurring frequently, being driven by fast-moving, advanced threats, it is clear that next generation technologies and approaches are needed. Even Gartner has noted the senescence of anti-virus in two very recent reports. Notably, in the Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms (i.e., anti-virus), where its opening sentences of the “Market Overview” state:

The rise of the targeted attack is shredding what is left of the [endpoint] anti-malware market's stubborn commitment to reactive protection techniques. Improving the malware signature distribution system, or adapting behavior detection [in endpoint solutions] to account for the latest attack styles, will not improve the effectiveness rates against targeted attacks. (From 8 January 2014).

So, what should we do as an industry knowing that the AV is ineffective today based on these findings? We recommend:

Accepting that the signature-based AV model cannot play a key part of enterprises’ threat-prevention models. Start shifting security strategies to modern methods that identify malware at the time of attack rather than after it has died.

Reconfigure compliance mandates to place much less emphasis on AV and other reactive, signature-based approaches. Once regulators and compliance mandates make it easier to adopt innovation, we’ll finally make life a little harder for the attackers.

In doing this, we will be able to protect ourselves not from the ghosts that we imagine are haunting our homes, but from the burglars and malware that truly steal our possessions and erode our foundations.Jim Rogash/Getty Images

It gets harder and harder every time. By virtue of having grown up in the greater Boston area, I am a fan of the New England Patriots, perhaps the most successful and most widely loathed sports franchise of the 21st century. For much of my childhood and young adulthood in the 1980s and 1990s, this was a laughable identity—the Patriots mostly vacillated between mediocre and terrible, their two pre-millennial Super Bowl appearances resulting in blowout defeats. This all changed in 2002, when the Pats, under second-year head coach Bill Belichick and first-year starting quarterback Tom Brady, beat the seemingly unbeatable St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. They won two more titles in 2004 and 2005, improbably establishing themselves as the gold standard of the league, and their coach and QB as gridiron geniuses. In the years since, the Patriots have appeared in three more Super Bowls (four come Sunday) and won one more title in 2015, all while relentlessly building a reputation as the league’s foremost heels, a franchise whose devotion to winning has led it to cheating scandals both real and inflated.

Jack Hamilton Jack Hamilton is Slate’s pop critic and assistant professor of American studies and media studies at the University of Virginia. He is the author of Just Around Midnight: Rock and Roll and the Racial Imagination.

That last bit has made it increasingly difficult to be a supporter of this team from a moral and spiritual standpoint, but this year my Pats fan self-hatred shot into the stratosphere with Brady, Belichick, and owner Robert Kraft playing public games of footsie with Donald Trump, the most objectionable presidential candidate of my lifetime. While all three stopped short of endorsing his candidacy, their inexplicable flirtations with Trump have made the team into a symbol for all he represents: In 2016, the Patriots moved from being deplorable to being Deplorable. I didn’t watch most of the regular season out of a combination of apathy and aversion, but as the playoffs rolled around, I once again got sucked in, and against nearly all of my better judgment I’ll be watching them and rooting for them again on Sunday. This has required a considerable amount of psychic gymnastics, so below is my helpful list of tortuous rationalizations for morally compromised Patriots fans who’ll be pulling for that fifth trophy this Sunday night:

Maybe Brady and Belichick didn’t actually vote for Trump. Look, I saw the #MAGA hat in Brady’s locker just like everyone else and have followed his mealy-mouthed nondenials of support for his thick orange friend. I’m not confident that Brady voted for Hillary Clinton; he grew up in a devout Catholic household with a father who attended seminary for seven years, he attended one of George W. Bush’s State of the Union addresses, and he curiously skipped a 2015 White House visit in order to shop for an Apple Watch. I’m just not sure he voted for Trump, either. Tom Brady is a world-class weirdo who seems focused on three things: his family, his own body, and his football team, in disturbingly ambiguous order. Read this Mark Leibovich profile of Brady from two years ago and tell me if this sounds like a guy who votes. And even if Brady did vote for Trump, good lord, if I watched sports because I supported the political views of the players, I probably wouldn’t watch sports.

Hating the Patriots is perhaps the last truly bipartisan pastime in America.

As for Belichick, it’s long been rumored that he’s a Democrat, and I’m resistant to the idea that there’s a single Wesleyan grad in America who pulled the lever for Trump, even one as illustriously dyspeptic as Belichick. It also just doesn’t fit his personality: Belichick is detail-obsessed, myopically focused, pathologically spotlight-averse. None of this screams affinity with our current resident of the White House. So whither the letter? Days before the election Trump read aloud a letter of “support” from Belichick (which stopped short of endorsing his candidacy) at a campaign rally in New Hampshire. My working theory is that Belichick was prodded into his pro-Trump statement by Pats owner Robert Kraft, one of Trump’s most prominent friends in the sports community. If true this is horrific, but pro sports owners are a horrific bunch, and even if Kraft voted for Trump (he, too, has been close-lipped on the matter, and has a history of supporting candidates from both sides of the aisle), he at least hasn’t been tapped for a post in his administration, as Todd Ricketts (Chicago Cubs), Betsy DeVos (Orlando Magic), and Woody Johnson (New York Jets) have.

Trump may love the Patriots, but the vast majority of Trump supporters will be rooting for the Falcons on Sunday. Fine, in fairness, the vast majority of Hillary Clinton supporters will be rooting for the Falcons on Sunday, too—hating the Patriots is perhaps the last truly bipartisan pastime in America. But the average Trump supporter, with his hatred of coastal elites and preoccupation with law and order, likely despises the Patriots with particular intensity, for their extremely coastal and extremely elite (again—Wesleyan) and distinctly cheater-ly approach to their sport.

What’s more, it’s a taken-for-granted truism that the only people in America who root for the Patriots are residents of the six New England states, where Trump was soundly defeated. In Massachusetts, Clinton beat Trump by a whopping 27 percentage points. So not only is there a high probability that the typical Trump supporter hates the Patriots, there are an awful lot of Patriots supporters who hate Trump, too. Even if we take Belichick’s letter and Brady’s stupid hat as “endorsements” there’s no evidence that they moved the electoral needle for Trump. There’s also a decent chance a lot of the Patriots themselves hate Trump: Earlier this week the team’s tight end, Martellus Bennett, one of the NFL’s most interesting and magnetic humans, announced that he’d likely decline a White House invitation were the Patriots to win a Super Bowl.

To root for the Patriots is to root against the NFL and its commissioner, who desperately wants the Patriots to lose. This is my main and perhaps only completely earnest rationalization for supporting the Patriots this Sunday. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is a distinctly Trumpian figure: the self-aggrandizing obsession with law and order, the worshipful attachment to billionaires and their presumed inherent virtues. Like Trump, Goodell is the son of a powerful and more impressive father who was born on third base and has mostly failed upward from there. (Trump himself, in a stunning combination of pot-kettle and correct-stopped-clock, has characterized Goodell as “a weak guy,” “a dope,” and “a stupid guy.”)

The league that Goodell represents is a cesspool for corporate oligarchy and the patriotism of scoundrels. It treats human bodies as disposable and has the worst labor conditions of any major professional sport, despite being the most lucrative. Earlier this season, when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick made the decision to simply not stand for the national anthem as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality, hordes of fans organized a “#BoycottNFL” movement under the asinine logic that Kaepernick’s protest was disrespectful to the U.S. military (incidentally, one of the NFL’s corporate partners). Then-nominee Donald Trump suggested Kaepernick leave the country. When the NFL’s ratings dropped, Goodell issued a cursory defense of Kaepernick’s right to free expression that the commish carefully drowned out in dog whistles, including this incredible passage: “I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don’t live in a perfect society. We live in an imperfect society. On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL. I personally believe very strongly in that.” Whatever “patriotism” is extolled in this passage is pretty disgusting.

Goodell and the Patriots despise each other, as the yearslong cycle of suspensions, challenges, appeals, and resuspensions has driven home. (Brady missed the first four games of this season as punishment for Deflategate, nearly two full years after the alleged malfeasance had occurred.) Goodell hasn’t attended a game at Gillette Stadium since before the controversy, a startling absence considering the Patriots are, ends-wise if not means-wise, his league’s banner franchise. As ESPN’s Don Van Natta Jr. and Seth Wickersham reported back in 2015, from the start Deflategate was taken up by Goodell and his billionaire bosses as a clunky vehicle for a quixotic revenge quest for the commissioner’s own bungling of the Patriots’ “Spygate” misdeeds of 2007. To watch Goodell forced to share a podium with Belichick and Brady this Sunday, handing over a fifth Lombardi Trophy that would solidify the 21st-century Pats as the greatest sustained dynasty the NFL has ever seen, would be like watching Trump in a weight-lifting competition with Arnold Schwarzenegger—you might not be actually rooting for either, but you’re sure savoring the certain embarrassment of one of the parties.Bryan Cox/ICE via Getty Images

Since Donald Trump entered office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have cracked down on undocumented immigrants, conducting coordinated raids that appear to target not only convicted criminals but also individuals whose sole crime is living in the United States without documentation. This “enforcement surge” marks a departure from Obama-era restrictions, which limited the agency’s “enforcement priorities” to convicts, terrorist threats, and people who recently crossed the border—a policy ICE openly despised.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.

ICE is legally empowered to conduct sweeps, and Trump is within his rights to lift Obama’s restrictions. But two recent high-profile arrests suggest that ICE may be altering evidence and manipulating facts in order to move in this aggressive new direction.

Consider first the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, whom ICE agents arrested last Friday. Ramirez is a beneficiary of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which allowed him to remain in the U.S. and work lawfully despite being undocumented. When he explained to ICE agents that he was “legally here” and showed them his DACA work permit, they detained him anyway. At a processing center, Ramirez reiterated that he had a lawful work permit.

“It doesn’t matter,” an agent responded, according a lawsuit filed on Ramirez’s behalf, “because you weren’t born in this country.” After detaining him, ICE found a justification for his deportation, alleging that he was a “self-admitted gang member.” Its evidence for this allegation centered around an appeal that Ramirez wrote after arriving at the detention center requesting to be removed from its gang unit. The government said it included the line, “I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform.” But on Thursday, the Stranger published a photograph of the appeal—and it clearly shows that Ramirez had written in pencil: “I came in and the officers said I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform. I do not have a criminal history and I’m not affiliated with any gangs.”

Ramirez’s lawyers allege that ICE officials doctored the document to prove that he belonged to a gang. The words “I came in and the officers said” were clearly erased so that the statement began with the statement “I have gang affiliation.”

“What began, I thought, as a mistake in bringing Daniel in has turned into a bogus operation that is attempting to railroad him and violate the sacred program that the DACA represents,” his lawyer, Mark Rosenbaum, said on a press call. “It is one of the most serious examples of governmental misconduct that I have come across in my 40 years of practice.”

Next, consider the troubling arrest of an undocumented domestic violence victim in El Paso, Texas, last week. County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal told the El Paso Times that ICE agents arrested the victim, a transgender woman, inside the courthouse shortly after she received a protective order against her alleged abuser. Bernal called the decision to make an arrest inside a protective court “unprecedented.” She added that ICE was likely acting on a tip from the victim’s alleged abuser, who may have been seeking vengeance. Eyewitnesses—including lawyers from the county attorney’s office, the judge who granted the protective order, and the victim’s advocate—confirmed Bernal’s account.

An ICE affidavit told a very different story. According to that affidavit, ICE approached the woman only after she had exited the courthouse and “proceeded to walk along the side walk.” At that point, the affidavit states, agents questioned and arrested her.

On Thursday, KFOX14 published surveillance video from the courthouse that seems to directly contradict the ICE affidavit. The footage appears to show ICE agents approaching the victim inside the courthouse and escorting her out of the building. That, of course, aligns with what multiple eyewitnesses, including county officials present at the courthouse, claim to have seen—and suggests that the ICE affidavit was false. Thus far, ICE has declined to comment on the incident and has insisted that its recent raids have been mostly business as usual.Comstock images / Thinkstock

Be they pediatricians or cardiologists, just starting their careers or at the tops of their fields, female doctors are paid significantly less than their male counterparts.

In a new study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers from Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital compiled a sweeping, diverse dataset in their effort to diagnose the true extent of the pay gap in medicine, analyzing the salaries of 10,241 academic physicians at 24 public medical schools across the country. The results were disheartening. Even after adjusting for the factors that can determine compensation—such as “age, experience, specialty, faculty rank, and measures of research productivity and clinical revenue,” which include how many patients a doctor sees and how often he or she publishes research—the average pay gap between men and women was $19,878 a year. Before adjusting for those factors, the absolute gap between the earnings of male and female doctors averaged $51,315 a year.

The disparity is not only egregious but, evidence suggests, perhaps even worsening, as University of Chicago medical professor Vineet Arora wrote in an editorial published alongside the study. She cited a 2011 paper’s findings that the pay differential for newly trained male and female doctors in New York State went from $3,600 in 1999 to nearly $17,000 in 2008.

The degree of the problem varies across different specialties, though overall, as The New York Times reports, full female professors are paid equivalent to male associate professors: roughly $250,000 a year. But the Times continues:

After adjusting for a variety of factors, the researchers found that female neurosurgeons and cardiothoracic surgeons and women in other surgical subspecialties made roughly $44,000 less than comparable men in those fields. The average pay gap between female and male orthopedic surgeons was nearly $41,000. The difference was about $38,000 among oncologists and blood specialists, about $36,000 among obstetrician-gynecologists and $34,000 among cardiologists.

For reasons not yet understood, one specialty appears to have eradicated the gap: radiology, in which women’s adjusted average salary topped men’s by about $2,000 a year. Two of the 24 universities in the study also paid men and women equally across the board, though the researchers declined to name them. In the interest of progress, it seems vitally important for those institutions to come forward and explain how they achieved what has evaded the rest of the field. As Arora asks in her editorial, “What policies, procedures, leadership, or culture at these sites helps to counteract a gender pay gap?”Anti-Gay Florist Fined $1,000 And Ordered Not To Discriminate

Barronelle Stutzman CREDIT: ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM

Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman has been ordered to pay a fine of $1,000, plus $1 for court costs and fees, after being found in violation of the state’s nondiscrimination laws after refusing to sell flowers for a same-sex couple’s wedding. According to Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom’s ruling, Stutzman is bound not to violate the law again and must sell all products to same-sex couples that she would sell to other couples, “including but not limited to goods, merchandise, and services for weddings & commitment ceremonies.”

This is a better result for Stutzman than the settlement State Attorney General Bob Ferguson offered last month. His original offer was a fine of $2,000, which Stutzman refused. “You are asking me to walk in the way of a well-known betrayer,” she said at the time, “one who sold something of infinite worth for 30 pieces of silver. That is something I will not do.”

Stutzman may yet have to pay more. Damages for the same-sex couple, Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed, have not yet been determined because appeals are still pending. Her lawyer, Kristen Waggoner of the Alliance Defending Freedom, continued to paint Stutzman as a victim in a response to WorldNetDaily. “The ACLU, on behalf of the same-sex couple also suing Barronelle, has asked the court to award them penalties, fees, and costs, which will financially devastate Barronelle’s business and personal assets — including taking this 70-year old grandmother’s retirement and personal savings,” Waggoner claimed. “The message sent by the attorney general and the ACLU to the people of Washington is quite clear: surrender your religious liberty and free speech rights, or face personal and professional ruin.”

This spin largely ignores not only what the judge said in his ruling, but also the Supreme Court precedent he cited. “When followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,” the justices wrote in the 1982 case United States v. Lee, “the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity. Granting an exemption… operates to impose [the follower’s] religious faith on the [person sought to be protected by the law.]” In other words, Stutzman’s religious beliefs do not entitle her to infringe on her customers’ rights.

Ferguson praised Friday’s ruling. “My primary goal has always been to end illegal discrimination,” he said. “I’m pleased that today’s ruling clearly prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples.”Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social network's role in the U.S. presidential election. False news stories that were shared hundreds of thousands of times on the network, including claims that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump and that Hillary Clinton would be arrested on charges related to her private email server, "surely had no impact" on the election, he said, speaking at the Techonomy conference.

Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter.

"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience," Zuckerberg went on. The notion that fake news stories on Facebook "influenced the election in any way," he added, "is a pretty crazy idea."

In an extended on-stage interview with David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect, Zuckerberg noted that fabricated stories made up a small fraction of all the content shared on Facebook. And he suggested that the criticism Facebook has received for fueling such falsehoods was rooted in condescension on the part of people who failed to understand Donald Trump's appeal. "I think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw fake news,” Zuckerberg said. “If you believe that, then I don’t think you internalized the message that Trump voters are trying to send in this election."

Here Kirkpatrick broke in to ask Zuckerberg what that message was. Zuckerberg demurred, suggesting he'd return to that question after he'd finished his thought. He did not.

Zuckerberg suggested that the clincher to his argument was that, to the extent fake news was shared, it must have been shared by Clinton supporters as well as those who backed Trump. "Why would you think there would be fake news on one side and not the other?"

In fact, fake news was shared by both sides, but a BuzzFeed analysis of 1,137 posts by six significant "hyperpartisan" news sources—three conservative and three liberal—found that mostly or partly false stories on the right outnumbered those on the left by a ratio of two to one. BuzzFeed separately reported on a cottage fake-news industry that had sprung up in Macedonia largely around pro-Trump and anti-Clinton content. People who produced the bogus stories said they had tried pro-Clinton content but found that it was less likely to go viral.

Zuckerberg also took a question about whether Facebook might be contributing to the country's political division by insulating its users in "filter bubbles"—communities of like-minded people who reinforce one another's biases rather than challenging them. There, too, Zuckerberg found the criticism misplaced. “All the research we have suggests that this isn’t really a problem,” he said. “For whatever reason, we’ve had a really time getting that out.” He cited a Facebook-funded 2015 study that concluded that while Facebook’s news feed does tend to show people information that supports their political views, their own choices about what to read play a greater role. That study was itself criticized by some for soft-pedaling its findings. Social media researcher and writer Zeynep Tufecki rebutted it in some depth here.Mario Tama/Getty Images

A daily roundup of the biggest stories in right-wing media.

Some conservative media outlets covered Donald Trump’s Thursday press conference without passing editorial judgment. In the Daily Caller, Kaitlan Collins wrote that the president “went off script” at the event, but she otherwise presented the details straight, quoting extensively from Trump’s remarks with minimal commentary. In another piece, Collins compared Trump’s first press conference with Obama’s. Collins set the two side by side on both quantitative points—Trump “lasted almost 90 minutes” while Obama managed a mere hour—and qualitative ones—“Obama was very serious,” but “Trump lightened things up.”

Others were more explicitly enthusiastic about the event. Sean Hannity called it a “marathon,” pronouncing, “It was a historic beat down of the alt-left propaganda media, and they had it coming.” And Breitbart reported, “Rush Limbaugh applauded Trump’s performance on his nationally syndicated radio show,” describing it as “one of the most effective press conferences I have ever seen.” On Twitter, Trump himself seized on that remark, claiming that Limbaugh had characterized his performance as “one of the greatest ever”:

Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

A Sean Hannity post emerging from Trump’s press conference was widely shared on Facebook:

Other news:

Many conservative outlets covered the Washington state Supreme Court's unanimous ruling against a florist who had refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The Daily Caller quoted extensively from a statement by one of the florist’s lawyers that claimed she “stands to lose all that she owns—her retirement, her life savings, her home—simply for declining to create custom expression for one event that violated her conscience for a long-time friend and customer.” (According to the Blaze, the florist faces a $1,000 fine.)

Many worried that the decision could have troubling implications. Pointing out that the florist had knowingly served the couple in the past, LifeZette wrote, “The Left has blurred the distinction between refusing to serve an individual because of his sexual orientation and refusing to do business with an individual in one specific instance because one does not agree morally with what that individual plans to do with the product.” In National Review, David French took it further, warning that we were witnessing an all-out assault on the First Amendment:

If you care about the Bill of Rights, the rights of conscience, or even the English language, there’s a chance that this morning you felt a disturbance in the Force — as if the Founders cried out in rage and were suddenly silenced.



French and others also offered a handful of comparisons in attempts to clarify their objections. The florist’s lawyer, who had argued that floral arrangements constitute a kind of speech, proposed, “No one would expect a Muslim journalist to write a piece for a religious journal that attacked Mohammed; no one would expect an Orthodox Jewish artist to create a mural for a religious customer that contradicted the Torah’s teachings.” In a similar rhetorical spirit, French asked, “Is it now racial discrimination to refuse to bake a cake with Confederate flag icing, since the person asking for such a cake will almost always be white?”Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix

Santa Clarita Diet is a one-joke comedy. The joke gets told and retold from different angles over the course of a half-hour (give or take a few minutes, because this is a Netflix series), and each time the punch line is a bit nastier. I’m sure it’ll be a huge success because the joke is a reasonably good one, but I wouldn’t blame anyone who stopped watching after an episode or two because they felt like they got it the first time, and having the punch line yelled into your ear a bit louder each time doesn’t necessarily refresh it.

What is this joke, you ask? Maybe you don’t want to know yet. In fact, if you’ve successfully avoided media coverage of the show up till now and would rather find it out for yourself, you should probably skip the rest of this review and come back to it later — but only if you want a less-than-enthused take on a series that seems very well-liked so far.

Created by Victor Fresco, the man behind Better Off Ted and Andy Richter Controls the Universe, the series stars Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant (who co-executive produced) as Sheila and Joel Hammond, married Southern California real-estate agents who live in a depressingly indistinct suburb with their teenage daughter, Abby (Liv Hewson). Their lives take a very dark turn one day when Sheila projectile barfs while showing a house. And keeps barfing. And barfs some more. And some more. (The puke scene is the show’s comedy methodology boiled down to a single moment.)

To make things weirder, Sheila has no pulse and her blood has become dark, with a tar-like consistency. Once we learn that Sheila has a mysterious curse-like condition that renders her, um, dead, and craving human flesh, Santa Clarita Diet becomes an exceptionally gruesome and sardonic comedy about marriage and parenting with overtones of an addiction narrative. Joel settles into the role of Sheila’s enabler, trying to figure out some way to feed his wife’s craving without becoming a party to murder. Of course this is a doomed enterprise: Once Sheila kills and eats a co-worker, she realizes nothing satisfies like fresh meat. (This twist is reminiscent of Park Chan-wook’s great film Thirst, about a couple of vampire lovers, one of whom only eats the dead for moral reasons. See it if you haven’t already.)

There’s plenty of potential here for something besides endless reiterations of the same situation. Sheila needs to feast on human flesh, and after an initial round of moral or logistical objections, Joel breaks down and helps slake her thirst. Like many a zombie film (George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead in particular), Sheila’s condition and Joel’s enabling of it have overtones of rampant consumerism and conscienceless capitalism: One person in a partnership wants her horrendous, apparently bottomless appetite satisfied, and her partner goes along even though he knows he’s violating basics of decency. There’s also a bit of a slippery-slope parable to the whole thing: Joel, who does most of the changing in this show, starts out strenuously objecting to the necessity of keeping Sheila supplied with warm meat, then starts rationalizing why he has to do it anyway (out of love, of course — to the actors’ credit, you do believe that their bond is strong enough to support a murder spree).

The thing is, though, none of this stuff is teased out so that it becomes anything other than a notion, one that hovers somewhere above or below all the gut-noshing and blood-guzzling without emerging into full view. If Santa Clarita Diet were more brazen and outrageous and less obviously afraid of alienating its core audience — people watching on a laptop or phone, hopefully in relative privacy and not at, say, a restaurant or preschool or doctor’s office — it might have been a lot more satisfying.

But the show seems to lack the courage of its minimal convictions. A lot of the creative choices are either half-baked (the sets are backlot-bland, practically bold-facing “The Tedious Sameness of Suburban Life”) or overly cute (weirdly so, given all the TV-MA bloodletting). This is another sitcom that’s what I call “Network Dark” as opposed to truly, unapologetically dark. I can’t imagine anyone actually finding it outrageous or even particularly subversive, and this is pretty clearly what Fresco & Co. were after, otherwise they wouldn’t have scored the entire show with ostentatiously “quirky” music, heavy on plucked violins and dingy little bells, that rhetorically asks the viewer “You’re having fun, right?”

Barrymore and Olyphant try their damnedest not to wink at the viewer. The dialogue keeps defeating them, though there are a few winners here and there, as when Sheila and Joel struggle to settle on a murder victim so vile that nobody will miss them, and Joel asks, “Where are all the young, single Hitlers?” Olyphant seems to enjoy playing something other than a skull-busting badass, but the nebbish husband and secret pot-smoker part doesn’t come naturally to him, despite his Matthew Broderick–like intonations. Barrymore is similarly affable and okay, though I kept imagining the miracles that could’ve been wrought by a more resourceful actress, like Rachel Bloom, or Felicity Huffman in Desperate Housewives mode.

I nitpick, of course, because that’s what I do. Santa Clarita Diet isn’t awful — every episode has a few good laughs, and you’ll probably just let Netflix keep cycling through to the next episode rather than switching over to something else, which is the yardstick of creative success for streaming services these days. But I kept wanting more from it besides constant refreshment of the same scenario, and it never seemed inclined to offer it.Mark Wilson/Getty Images

Jedediah Purdy understands President Trump’s supporters better than most champions of the left, having grown up in rural West Virginia (he has the greased-pig award to prove it). But he’s still befuddled by the prospect of peeling away voters from the president’s camp. Purdy’s recent piece in the New Republic is titled “America’s New Opposition.”

Join the discussion of this episode on Facebook.President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Wednesday, but to many in the press corps the big story was how the predominantly liberal mainstream media felt they were treated.

Yes — despite the fact that Trump and Netanyahu discussed West Bank settlements and moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — the real story is how the top dogs of the White House press corps were not asked the two questions that Trump gave to American reporters.

The traditional legacy media were already suffering because of the internet. Trump threatens to be a new wave of change.

Trump, for the third time since he has been taking questions at joint press conferences with foreign leaders, extended the opportunity to ask questions to reporters from right-leaning outlets.

At stake are high-profile questions to be asked of the president, and his guest, at joint press conferences that are broadcast internationally. The mainstream media has enjoyed pushing lesser outlets to the back of the East Room. Those days appear to be over, as Trump spreads his disruptive political instincts to the Fourth Estate.

In fact, the media was insulted a bit more than reported on Wednesday, as Breitbart News, one of the largest conservative news websites in the United States, was allowed a seat in the East Room near the front, next to the Associated Press. The White House Correspondents’ Association assigns the 49 seats in the White House Briefing Room — for now — but the president can arrange seating in any manner he likes during East Room events.

The joint press conference is a grand affair in the White House, not the West Wing. There have actually been four joint press conferences with foreign leaders since Trump took office. The first was with British Prime Minister Theresa May, then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

On Wednesday, Trump held a joint press conference with Netanyahu.

At the press conferences, Trump has taken two questions from the “American side,” from Reuters, Fox News, the New York Post, Fox Business, Sinclair Broadcasting Group, the Daily Caller, the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Townhall.

Only Reuters is not considered to be right-of-center.

“[Liberal journalists] don’t believe competition should exist, especially from the Right,” said Dan Gainor, vice president for Business and Culture for the Media Research Center. “Coupled with the news media’s anti-Trump crusade, it shows a level of disconnect from reality that’s amazing even for privileged D.C. reporters.”

After the press conference ended, with only CBN and Townhall being called on, the latest media meltdown commenced.

CNN’s White House reporter Jim Acosta yelled out questions as Trump was leaving the room. He then seemed to accuse the White House of arranging the questions with conservative reporters.

“The fix is in,” said Acosta.

Acosta's shouting led one reporter to comment that the practice is generally frowned upon after such formal events. On June 15, 2012, when a Daily Caller reporter shouted a question at President Obama before his statement ended, the media descended upon him, with Politico calling the incident "a surprising breach of etiquette."

But today, shouting questions at Trump and his spokesman Sean Spicer is a celebrated tactic.

On Twitter, Acosta later lamented: "I tried."

Exaggerating is also a new media tactic. ABC News' analyst Matthew Dowd, never one to miss a chance to stretch reality, said Trump was "shutting down part of the First Amendment."

The media hissy fit actually began on Monday, when two reporters were chosen by Trump to ask questions at Trump's joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trump chose a reporter, Scott Thuman, from the Sinclair Broadcast Group. And Trump then called on a reporter, Kaitlan Collins, from the Daily Caller. After both failed to ask the "correct" question (about national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned later that night), reporters pounced on Thuman and Collins.

Julie Pace of the Associated Press interrogated Collins immediately, asking if Collins was told to avoid the topic of Flynn, according to Politico. (Collins said she was not.) CNN's Dylan Byers even pried a statement from Thuman's boss that Thuman was still in good standing. (A LifeZette reporter witnessed Thuman preparing his question, by himself, in the briefing room's concession area.)

On Wednesday, this time the freakout was more widespread. Reporters from many major outlets took note of the trend, which threatens their status (and lofty perches) in the White House Briefing Room. The traditional legacy media of major broadcast agencies, major cable channels, and large newspapers and wire services, was already suffering because of the internet. Trump threatens to be a new wave of change.

But, despite John King's prediction, it's unclear what would be accomplished by asking about The New York Times' story, on Wednesday, that Trump's "associates" were speaking to Russians throughout 2016.

The narrative is dubious. The charges of Russian influence are rehashed, and even The Times admitted their anonymous sources didn't see a legal violation.

After the press conference on Wednesday, NBC News reporter Tom Winter tweeted: "NBC's Pete Williams reports (as we have all along) that investigators have found no collusion between Trump campaign and contacts in Russia."

Yet the mainstream media still wants to ask the president about it, at every turn.Being a great network drama in 2016 is like being New York Yankee Roger Maris in 1961: It takes you just a little too long to get there. Sure, network shows pull in the biggest ratings, but when it's time for the industry to honor its best, those lumbering beasts seem just a little too unwieldy: The last time a season longer than 13 episodes won the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series was 2006; the last time one was even nominated was 2011.

The Good Wife was that final nominee — to date, and possibly forever. In an interview leading up to last night's series finale, co-creator Robert King suggested that the CBS drama "might also be thought of as a gravestone on the 22-episodes-a-year paradigm." But though they titled their final episode "End," the Kings chose to leave the story of Juliana Margulies' Alicia Florrick where they began it: in a hotel corridor after a press conference, with one character's face still stinging from a richly deserved slap.

The difference was that this time Alicia Florrick was on the receiving end. In the series' endgame, her husband, Peter, once again faced trial on corruption charges. But after seven seasons of legal maneuvering, Alicia was no dutiful political spouse/photo-op accessory, standing by her man to fill out the tableau of a happy family: She was his lawyer, every bit as cutthroat and calculating as he was. She freed herself from Peter, only to risk becoming him. If keeping him out of jail meant impeaching Diane's ballistics-expert husband on the stand by suggesting that he'd slept with one of the prosecution's experts, well ... that was just the price that had to be paid.

In The Good Wife's home stretch, firm bigwig Diane Lockhart (viva Christine Baranski!) had gotten Alicia on board with a plan to convert their law firm into a female-fronted partnership, but the smack she laid across our heroine's face left the future of that enterprise in doubt — and much more as well. Would Alicia find happiness with Jeffrey Dean Morgan's hunky investigator, the first serious romantic interest she'd had since her former lover, Will Gardner, was gunned down in court? Would she follow Peter into politics, with the support of his former backers? Would she stay true to herself? And who was she, anyway? Those questions were left hanging, although the Kings hedged their bets by posting a video explaining their intentions the instant the end credits finished rolling. (Note to the writers of TV shows: Please stop doing this.)

From the beginning, the show took an uncommonly nuanced approach to the relationship between who was right and who prevailed in court. "Sometimes I think justice would be better served with a coin flip," Josh Charles' Will said in the first-season episode "Doubt," and if the show was never as cynical as he was, it made no bones about the fact that cases are won or lost by a combination of legal strategy and luck; a just result was simply an occasional fringe benefit. Alicia represented drug kingpins and serial killers, and though it sometimes took a toll, she remained morally sound at her core. (See the show's title.)

Except, maybe, at the end? Airing Diane's marital problems in court was no worse than dozens of things Alicia and her supposed allies have done to each other over the course of The Good Wife's run; 156 episodes leaves a lot of room for intrigue. But as much as the Kings looked down their nose at cable's plague of white male antiheroes — and they could be petty about it, too, making Alicia an occasional viewer of a lurid cop drama called Darkness at Noon — their show grew darker over the long run, as if they laid on another coat of lacquer with each successive season. As Alicia dithered over her options in the finale, she had a vision of Will in his old office on a now-abandoned floor. "You wouldn't like it here now," she told him. "Things have gotten sad."

It's hard not to read that line as the Kings' commentary on the turn the show took after Will's death, even an admission that it never recovered from the loss of Charles' live-wire energy. The primetime legal drama had one of the best casts in in television, and it was supplemented with an awe-inspiring array of guest stars — one way for the Kings to flaunt the advantages of a network budget. Half the cast of The Wire passed through its halls, as did more Broadway stars than there are in heaven. The last few episodes crammed Sutton Foster and Hamilton's Leslie Odom, Jr. into throwaway roles, as if the show were eager to complete the set. But Charles' departure, and the much-rumored whatever-it-was that made it impossible for Margulies and Archie Panjabi to appear in the same frame, threw off the show's ensemble balance. The sixth season plotline designed to write Panjabi's leather-clad investigator off the show was distended and divorced from its central action, and in the seventh season, it all but abandoned its long-running characters in favor of Morgan and Cush Jumbo's attorney-slash-bestie.

At its best, The Good Wife was a showcase for the advantages of longer seasons, and the mixture of ongoing drama and procedural bedrock that makes many network shows tick. There was room to experiment with the form — something it never got as much credit for as Breaking Bad or True Detective — and to let conflicts play out at a pace approximating real life. The weight of nearly a hundred episodes gave the fifth season's "Hitting the Fan," in which the tensions inside Alicia's law firm finally explode, an accumulated power that cable's more concentrated seasons can't muster. But it's also a study in sprawl, with dozens of stranded characters and dead-end storylines: Alicia spent the show's sixth season running for political office only to end up right back where she started. The show regained some sense of purpose once it was clear that this season would be its last and the Kings could start writing in earnest towards their planned ending, but the finale was still a mess, with far too much screen time devoted to plot details that distracted from Alicia's story rather than furthering it. The Kings knew for years that they wanted to put Alicia back in that hotel hallway, but it felt like she was shoved there rather than traveling under her own steam.

"End" suggested that, in finally divorcing herself from Peter, Alicia ran the risk of becoming him, but it also left her free. Had Peter been jailed, Alicia would have found it harder to leave him, and, worse, her daughter, Grace, would have followed her lead, delaying her first year at college to stay near her father. She betrayed Diane for Peter, but also for Grace, and for herself. Soon to be divorced, with two children at college — and quite possibly in search of a new job — Alicia stands, at last, on her own, free, or forced, to consider who she is and what she wants. She may not like the answers to those questions, but they'll be hers.Photo by SIMON MAINA/AFP/Getty Images

A social media tug-of-war has emerged in the face of a nationwide strike by Kenyan doctors protesting the government’s failure to honor their collective bargaining agreement. The strike has brought the public health care system to a halt and has stoked public mistrust of the Uhuru government, particularly following allegations of millions of dollars having gone missing from the Ministry of Health.

While doctors have garnered substantial public support in their demands, there has also been a spate of social media messages maligning doctors. Local bloggers have identified a strong correlation between Twitter accounts propagating hashtags such as #GreedyDoctors, #MyBadDoctorExperience, and #DaktariRudiKazi (“Doctors, go back to work”) with those promoting other pro-government messages. Social media experts believe the messages are not being circulated by regular citizens, but rather by government-paid “social media influencers.” Some have suggested links between these accounts and widespread reports of a group of 36 social media influencers purportedly hired by the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit to change online narratives critical of the Kenyan government.

In recent days, #GreedyDoctors and similar hashtags have been overwhelmed by Twitter users promoting the implementation of the collective bargaining agreement, adding to their tweets the hashtag #implementCBA.

Kenya is not alone in this phenomenon. Alongside countries with long-standing practices of promoting state interests via social media commenters, such as China and Venezuela, Mexico appears to have joined these ranks with various recent pro-government campaigns online.

Most recently, after January’s gas price hikes triggered public protests on major roadways and online, a select set of Twitter accounts began promoting illegal activities such as looting and theft, in what appeared to be an effort to influence conversations and delegitimize the protests. Most commonly, they inserted hashtag #SaqueaUnWalmart (“loot a Walmart”) into conversations bearing the #gasolinazo hashtag, which was widely used by protesters. These accounts also propagated images of people rioting, which turned out to be false. (The photos actually depicted street riots in Egypt in 2011.)

By visualizing data from more than 15,000 tweets associated with the protests, data scientists at the Jesuit University of Guadalajara observed that the #SaqueaUnWalmart hashtag interrupted the flow of conversations, seeking to associate #Gasolinazo with malicious intentions. Some of the accounts involved in these campaigns have been identified as bots or trolls who had already been linked to harassment and threats against journalists and social activists.

These observations, along with recent allegations of spyware used against researchers and public servants promoting a tax on soda (reported by the New York Times and analyzed by Citizen Lab) suggest an increasingly threatening environment for citizens seeking to advocate and express their views on matters of public interest in Mexico.

Venezuela blocks more news websites, including CNN

The Spanish language version of CNN, and its corresponding website, were blocked in Venezuela on Feb. 15, after reporting on passport fraud allegations. CNN is not alone—the Mexico-based TV Azteca was also taken off the air on Feb. 16. Since Feb. 7,the Venezuelan news and public opinion website Maduradas has been inaccessible on a majority of internet service providers (including government-controlled CANTV) in seven provinces. The site is known for its summaries of online responses to issues of public interest. In a public statement, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called CNN an “instrument of war.”

Phishing attacks in Qatar target migrant rights advocates

Researchers at Amnesty International uncovered a wave of sophisticated phishing attacks aimed at spying on the activity of journalists, trade unions, and labor activists advocating on the rights of migrant workers in Qatar, a large proportion of whom come from Nepal. The campaign was likely orchestrated by a state-affiliated actor, although there is no evidence at the moment to conclusively identify who was behind the attacks. The attacks invited targets to open links to what appear to be files in Google Drive and Google Hangouts, but actually lead to spyware.

Thai draft law would hand media control to government

Media organizations in Thailand are warning that draft legislation could lead to complete government control over the press. The curiously named “Protection of Media Rights and Freedom, Ethics and Professional Standards” would require journalists to obtain licenses in order to do their work. It would also create a National Professional Media Council that would be staffed primarily with representatives from government ministries. According to Chakkrit Permpool, the former chair of the National Press Council of Thailand, “This kind of thing exists only under dictatorship governments. This is against the new constitution … that ensures media freedom and people’s freedom of expression.” More than 30 media groups have signed a statement rejecting the bill.

Facebook plans to fight fake news in France

Facebook announced plans to combat the spread of fake news in the lead up to French elections in April and May by launching a new partnership with eight media organizations that will fact-check and filter news articles flagged by Facebook users. But some worry that Facebook’s reliance on already-stretched newsroom resources will not be sustainable.

The F.B.I. declined to comment. The White House also declined to comment Tuesday night, but earlier in the day, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump’s previous comments that nobody from his campaign had contact with Russian officials before the election.

“There’s nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period,” Mr. Spicer said in response to a question.

Two days after the election in November, Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy Russian foreign minister, said “there were contacts” during the campaign between Russian officials and Mr. Trump’s team.

“Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,” Mr. Ryabkov told Russia’s Interfax news agency.

The Trump transition team denied Mr. Ryabkov’s statement. “This is not accurate,” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said at the time.

The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed.

The F.B.I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative; and Mr. Flynn.

All of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials.

As part of the inquiry, the F.B.I. is also trying to assess the credibility of the information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative. The dossier contained a raft of allegations of a broad conspiracy between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government. It also included unsubstantiated claims that the Russians had embarrassing videos that could be used to blackmail Mr. Trump.

The F.B.I. has spent several months investigating the leads in the dossier, but has yet to confirm any of its most explosive claims.

Senior F.B.I. officials believe that the former British intelligence officer who compiled the dossier, Christopher Steele, has a credible track record, and he briefed investigators last year about how he obtained the information. One American law enforcement official said that F.B.I. agents had made contact with some of Mr. Steele’s sources.

The agency’s investigation of Mr. Manafort began last spring as an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country’s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has focused on why he was in such close contact with Russian and Ukrainian intelligence officials.

The bureau did not have enough evidence to obtain a warrant for a wiretap of Mr. Manafort’s communications, but it had the N.S.A. scrutinize the communications of Ukrainian officials he had met.

The F.B.I. investigation is proceeding at the same time that separate investigations into Russian interference in the election are gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. Those investigations, by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, are examining not only the Russian hacking but also any contacts that Mr. Trump’s team had with Russian officials during the campaign.

On Tuesday, top Republican lawmakers said that Mr. Flynn should be one focus of the investigation, and that he should be called to testify before Congress. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the news about Mr. Flynn underscored “how many questions still remain unanswered to the American people more than three months after Election Day, including who was aware of what, and when.”

Mr. Warner said Mr. Flynn’s resignation would not stop the committee “from continuing to investigate General Flynn, or any other campaign official who may have had inappropriate and improper contacts with Russian officials prior to the election.”Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

How big was the Patriots’ 25-point comeback against the Falcons? It was by far the biggest ever in a Super Bowl; before Sunday, no team had overcome anything bigger than a 10-point lead. This isn’t just a Super Bowl–based anomaly. In the entire history of the NFL, a team has come back to win just four times after trailing by more than 25 points.

You can see the depths to which the Patriots sunk in this win-probability graph provided by ESPN Stats & Information.

It’s possible to look at that image and think, Wow, ain’t sports grand. We watch all of these games because we can’t know with certainty what’s going to happen. The possibility of witnessing low-probability events helps take my mind off the inevitability of my own death.

It’s also possible to look at that image and think, Those nerds screwed up again. Forget math.

After the election and this game, it's probably time the "win probability" folks take a little break. https://t.co/SfeTiqz33O — Pete Abraham (@PeteAbe) February 6, 2017

Given that number crunchers got the election and the Super Bowl wrong, the time has come to throw these so-called prognosticators in the ocean and see if they float. But before we do that, I’d like to note that a probability is not a guarantee. The fact that a high-probability event doesn’t end up happening is not evidence that it was really a low-probability event. Or to put it another way, if a model says that something is supposed to happen nearly 100 percent of the time, and it in fact happens 100 percent of the time, you need to tinker with your model.

In this case, it seems weird to mock a calculation that matches our own intuition. We knew in our guts that the Patriots had very little chance to come back from 28-3 down to the Falcons. A win-probability graph attaches a number to that feeling. In the Super Bowl, that number peaked at 99.8 percent—ESPN’s estimated win probability for the Falcons with 6:04 to go in the third quarter.

But while I stand with the probability brigade as a general principle, I do think it’s fair to quibble with these specific probability numbers. In-game win probability, which is now de rigueur on sites like ESPN, is an extremely entertaining tool. It also stands to reason that these sorts of pro-football predictions would be more accurate than, say, presidential political forecasts, given that there have been a lot more pro football games than quadrennial American elections. That doesn’t mean, though, that NFL win-probability numbers are correct down to a decimal place.

Brian Burke, who created ESPN’s win-probability algorithm, confessed on Twitter that his model was “overconfident” in a Falcons victory. Real-time betting in Las Vegas suggested Atlanta had closer to a 96 percent chance of winning, and Burke said he believed the correct probability was “somewhere between” those two numbers.

In 2013, Jason Lisk of the Big Lead found—albeit in a smallish sample of games—that Pro Football Reference’s win-probability calculator also tended to overconfidence. Teams that Pro Football Reference claimed had a 91 to 100 percent chance of victory at the start of the fourth quarter, Lisk determined, won 102 of 111 games when the model predicted they’d win 109.

Why might a win-probability model get things wrong at the extremes? As Burke explained in 2014, his calculations take into account score, time, down, distance, and field position. (At the beginning of the game, it also takes into consideration relative team strength as measured by ESPN’s Football Power Index, but Burke told me that the “FPI factor gradually fades as the game goes on.”) Some scores and times are a lot more common than others. While there have been thousands upon thousands of NFL games, there’s not a huge amount of data on teams coming back from 25-point third-quarter deficits. As Burke pointed on Twitter, teams that were roughly in the Pats’ position had been 0-190 since 2001:

Since '01, teams down between 26 and 23 points with 6-9 min left in the 3Q were 0-190, now 1-191 (about .5% win rate). — Brian Burke (@bburkeESPN) February 6, 2017

Because these kinds of comebacks are so rare, Burke told me, it’s very difficult for him to benchmark his model with real NFL data. When sample sizes are smaller, we can be a lot less confident about the predictions we derive from those samples. Based on the evidence we do have and our knowledge of how many points a touchdown is worth, we know the Patriots’ victory in Super Bowl LI was extremely unlikely. It feels like faux precision, however, to say the Falcons were a 99.8 percent favorite with six minutes left to play in the third quarter.Portra/Thinkstock

For the third time in recent months, a state high court took aim at same-sex couples’ marriage rights, even after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015’s Obergefell v. Hodges. This time, the Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a state law that strips married same-sex couples of their right to be named by default as parents on their children’s birth certificates.

The majority in Smith v. Paven determined that the state’s preferential treatment of opposite-sex couples was not an undermining of marriage rights but an “acknowledge[ment of] basic biological truths.” The majority astoundingly—and incorrectly—asserted that Arkansas law does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. A basic understanding of family law reveals that, contrary to the justices’ conclusion, something more sinister is afoot.

Under Arkansas law, a woman who gives birth to a child is deemed the mother on the birth certificate. If the birth mother is married to a man at either the time the child was conceived or between conception and birth, her husband’s name is placed on the child’s birth certificate. However, the presumption of parentage does not necessarily mean he is the biological father. Indeed, presumptive paternity does not require any evidence that the husband is the biological father.

As the Arkansas Supreme Court pointed out in a 2001 case, “[T]he strong presumption of the legitimacy of a child born of marriage continues to be one of the most powerful presumptions in Arkansas law.” The presumption has been justified, rightly or wrongly, as advancing children’s best interests, keeping children off public assistance, and promoting model families. The idea behind presumptive legitimacy, one of family law’s bedrock doctrines, is by no means purely about “biological truths” as the Arkansas Supreme Court purported yesterday.

Of course, a woman who naturally conceives a child with her husband does not neatly map onto the experience of most lesbian couples who decide to have children together. However, take the example of a married lesbian couple and a married opposite-sex couple that avail themselves of a donor and artificial insemination services. If the husband in the opposite-sex marriage consents to the artificial insemination, the birth certificate names him and the birth mother as the child’s parents.

But the married lesbian couple that uses a donor’s services in the exact same manner as the opposite-sex couple is at the receiving end of the law’s cold shoulder. Unlike similarly situated heterosexual couples, same-sex couples must obtain a court order to amend a birth certificate.

Cheryl Maples, the attorney for the Arkansas same-sex couples, ably described the heart of the problem when she said, “There's no requirement that DNA be given or that there be a biological relationship to a child to get on a birth certificate for a father, for the non-birth parent. All you have to do is legitimize the child, and you're entitled, if you're heterosexual. This is wrong.”

The court’s majority utterly failed to understand the constitutional issues at stake, reasoning that the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage ruling in Obergefell was inapplicable because the right to be named as a parent on a child’s birth certificate is not a benefit of marriage. This twisted logic feels strikingly disingenuous. Arkansas law treats one class of married persons differently than another. Call it sex-based discrimination or sexual orientation discrimination; either way, Arkansas law impermissibly isolates same-sex couples for disparate treatment.

The controversy over equal marriage rights and equal treatment concerning birth certificates is not new. In March 2016, federal Judge Robert Hinkle slammed Florida officials for dragging their feet on compliance with Obergefell. Obergefell's mandate was clear: States cannot “exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.” This undoubtedly includes marital presumptions on birth records. Hinkle minced no words and ordered Florida to treat same-sex couples equally when listing parents on birth certificates. Florida began recognizing same-sex spouses on birth certificates in May 2016.

The Arkansas ruling stands in stark contrast to the Iowa Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Gartner v. Newton. There, the Iowa justices unanimously ruled that there is no substantial government interest in favoring biological relationships when naming parents on a birth certificate. Crucially, the Iowa court noted that discriminating against married lesbian couples succeeded only in stigmatizing their relationships: “It is important for our laws to recognize that married lesbian couples who have children enjoy the same benefits and burdens as married opposite-sex couples who have children. ... [T]he only explanation for not listing the nonbirthing lesbian spouse on the birth certificate is stereotype or prejudice.”With a new administration preparing to take charge, there is growing uncertainty about the role of U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.When Donald Trump assumes office in mid-January, there will be 15,000 American personnel deployed to those theaters. He has sent mixed signals regarding the wars, vowing on the one hand to crush extremists determined to attack the homeland while also signaling an “America first” policy meant to avoid expending more blood and treasure overseas.It’s possible all three combat theaters could need more U.S. forces in the coming months. And with President Barack Obama gone and Republicans in control of Congress, there may be less concern in Washington about putting “boots on the ground.”In Iraq, the Islamic State will likely lose the territory it had occupied, transforming into a full-blown insurgency. When that happens, the U.S. may need to continue or even expand its train-advise-and-assist mission in order to help the Iraqi army preserve its hard-fought gains.In Syria, the U.S and its fragile cast of allies must defeat the Islamic State in its self-proclaimed capital, Raqqa. That’ll be a large operation.In December, the Pentagon expanded its authorized footprint in Syria from 300 to 500 troops, primarily special operations forces, advisers and explosive ordnance disposal specialists. Many experts believe a much larger American presence will be required to destroy ISIS there.In Afghanistan, there is considerable pessimism about the 15-year-old war that Obama had hoped to end before leaving office. Instead, he’ll be leaving 8,400 troops there.The Taliban continues to mount large-scale offenses. U.S. airstrikes are targeting a fledgling Islamic State faction there. And top U.S. commanders acknowledge they have overestimated the ability of the Afghan military and government to modernize.The task of assessing and ultimately determining future force levels in all three theaters will likely fall to be a man who knows the region well.

The first, and almost certainly last, film footage of author Marcel Proust has been discovered in the French national film archives, France 24 reports. The film, which can be seen above, was taken at the 1904 wedding of one of Proust’s friends, Armand de Guiche, to Elaine Greffulhe. A man believed to be Marcel Proust walks down the stairs at 37 seconds into the clip.

Proust, who was 30 at the time, was known to have attended the wedding, and, being gay, was one of the only guests who came alone. The bowler hat and grey suit match descriptions of his wardrobe, plus the man looks exactly like Marcel Proust. “The silhouette and the profile match him, although it is always difficult to identify for certainty with a film of this type,” professor Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan told Le Point.

The author would probably have appreciated the way a few seconds of footage has conjured up a wedding he attended more than a century ago: The opening section of his life’s work, the sprawling novel Remembrance of Things Past, has a celebrated passage about the way smells and tastes can bring long-forgotten worlds back to life:

… when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, taste and smell alone, more fragile but more enduring , more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, remain poised a long time, like souls, remembering, hoping, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unflinchingly, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection.Every year as your birthday approaches, you probably think to yourself, “Am I taking advantage of enough free birthday stuff?” The answer is always no.

The determined birthday boy even hits up Starbucks and Hooters a second time in the same day. In the end, he earned $94.54 worth of free stuff. Not bad.President Trump on Wednesday came to the defense of ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying the former aide was subjected to “criminal” leaks in the “fake media.”

“I think he’s been treated very, very unfairly by the media — as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,” Trump said at a press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “I think it’s really a sad thing he was treated so badly.”

Trump's first in-person reaction to Flynn’s exit appeared to contradict the account of his top spokesman, who said Tuesday that the president demanded the aide’s resignation because of an “eroding level of trust” over his conversations with Russia.

Trump called Flynn a “wonderful man” and doubled down on his condemnation of the leaks from the intelligence community that exposed Flynn misled senior officials in the White House about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador. Those conversations took place the day that then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election.

“From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked, it's criminal action. It's a criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time before me, but now it's really going on,” Trump said.

“People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonMark Cuban trolls Trump with No. 46 jersey at NBA celeb game The latest scheme in the left’s war on Trump Local broadcast news knows America better than cable MORE,” he continued.

Trump’s comments followed a string of tweets Wednesday morning, in which he sought to shift attention away from the contents of Flynn’s conversations with Russia’s U.S. envoy and toward the leaking of classified information.

“The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” he tweeted.

Reports from The New York Times and CNN have also asserted that intercepted phone calls and phone records showed several aides and allies to Trump’s campaign were frequently in contact with Russian intelligence operatives.

There is no evidence that those officials collaborated with Russia on its hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign officials.

But the reports turned up the temperature on long-simmering questions about the Trump team’s dealings with Russia, a longtime U.S. adversary.

Trump was not asked directly about those reports during his news conference with Netanyahu.

He took questions from two U.S. reporters representing the Christian Broadcasting Network and the conservative website Townhall, who asked him about his stance on Israeli settlement activity, a Palestinian peace deal and Iran.

Trump declined to answer a shouted question from CNN’s Jim Acosta about the Russia reports at the conclusion of the news conference. He turned to members of the media, said "thank you," and walked off the podium in the East Room with Netanyahu as his aides and advisers stood and applauded.

Later during a meeting with Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump again refused to answer another shouted question on the topic from another CNN reporter, Sarah Murray.

The swirling controversy over Flynn and Russia overshadowed Netanyahu’s first White House visit since Trump’s inauguration, which typically would consume media coverage.

Trump’s comments raised new questions about the circumstances surrounding Flynn’s sudden departure just 24 days into the president’s term.

His defense of Flynn was odd, given that he ostensibly asked for his resignation because he lost his trust.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday Trump fired Flynn because he felt that his trust in him “eroded” because he gave a false account of his talks to Vice President Pence, who then publicly denied the adviser discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, Russia’s U.S. envoy.

“There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,” Spicer said, adding the circumstances created a “critical mass and an unsustainable situation.”

“The president must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position,” he said.

Many years ago I impulsively filed for divorce and was counseled to file allegations that I regretted and subsequently withdrew over thirty years ago. Andy is a wonderful father, a great person, and was a good husband.” Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. Department of Labor, was accused of domestic abuse by his first wife three decades ago, the Riverfront Times reported Thursday.

UPDATE 12/12/16: In a statement, Lisa Feirstein (formerly Henning) said she "regretted" these allegations about her ex-husband and praised his character.

In allegations that surfaced during the couple’s 1989 divorce and were reported on by the St. Louis publication at the time, Puzder’s ex-wife Lisa Henning charged that her husband hit her, threw her to the ground, and unplugged the phone after she called police during a 1986 altercation.

Henning sought a protective order against Puzder following that incident, alleging in the court document obtained by the Riverfront Times that he “attacked me, choked me, threw me to the floor, hit me in the head, pushed his knee into my chest twisted my ar​m and dr​agged me​ ​on the floor, threw me against a wall, tried to stop my call to 911 and kicked me in the back.”

In a separate instance, Henning alleged that Puzder punched her in a car as the couple drove home from dinner one night in 1985.

Police were called to their home in Clayton, Missouri, following the 1986 altercation, and after a shouting match in the late 1970s that devolved into a plate-throwing fight, according to the Riverfront Times.

Puzder, now 66, denied any abuse in a deposition for his divorce and in an interview with the Riverfront Times at that time, accusing the publication of trying to “smear” his reputation.

“There was no physical abuse at any point in time,” he said.

Puzder acknowledged having disagreements with Henning, but claimed that they were mutual and did not involve physical abuse.

Referring to the 1986 altercation, Puzder said in a deposition obtained by the Riverfront Times that his wife was yelling at him and he “grabbed her by the shoulders and pushed her back.” He denied pushing her to the floor, saying he didn’t “know if her foot caught or what happened.”

Puzder also denied punching Henning in the 1985 incident in the car, saying in the same deposition that he only remembered the car going up on a curb.

“I think it had to do with the liquid refreshment we had with our dinner more than anything else,” he said.

At the time, Puzder was an anti-abortion activist and chair of then-Gov. John Ashcroft (R)’s Task Force for Mothers and Unborn Children. He went on to become chief executive of CKE restaurants, which owns Hardee’s, Carl’s Jr., and other fast food restaurant chains.

Trump officially announced his selection as labor secretary in a Thursday press release, praising Puzder for “his extensive record fighting for workers.”President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau trod carefully Monday as they doubled down on divergent positions on national security and Syrian refugees during a joint press conference.

Calling relations between the neighbors "pretty complex," Trudeau opened the press conference with assurances that "we won't always agree on everything" but will "navigate those complexities" and "remain allies and friends."

As his administration mulls the next move on attempts to ban travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Trump underscored the need for stronger national security.

"We don't want our country to have the kind of problems you see taking place not only here but the rest of the world," Trump said during the press conference.

As Trump spoke about his desire to "let people that love our country in" while not letting the "wrong people" in, Trudeau's face was expressionless.

Trudeau, who has been one of the most outwardly supportive of Syrian refugees, suggested they could be offered a safe haven without compromising national security.

"We have welcomed refugees from Syria we have been very successful and we take our responsibility of security very seriously," Trudeau said.

To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017

However, he stopped short of directly criticizing his American counterpart's position during the press conference.

"There have been times when we've differed in our approaches, the last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country," Trudeau said later in response to a question about his thoughts of Trump's so-called travel ban.

A joint statement released less than an hour before the press conference noted a shared commitment to border security, including a coordinated entry-exit information system, as well as the prioritization of "common solutions" to limit opioid trafficking.

"We share a commitment to continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our mutual prosperity and security," the two leaders said in a statement

The travel ban was not the only place where Trump and Trudeau navigated differences.

While the two leaders applauded the robust and interdependent trade relationship between Canada and the United States, the issue of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) loomed large. Trump, who was highly critical of the deal on the campaign trail and promised to renegotiate it, said that we'll be "tweaking" it.

The two leaders also projected unity in the face of policy divergence, repeatedly mentioning the many times Canadians and Americans stood together on battlefields and in moments of international conflict.

"American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together — which we have," Trump said, reading from a prepared statement.

After the pair's first official meeting, border security, energy security, women entrepreneurs, and economic growth were outlined as discussed and jointly supported causes.

Prior to the joint press conference, the president and prime minister participated in a female business leader roundtable. During that meeting the two launched the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneur and Business Leaders, seeking to encourage more business activity between both women business leaders and the U.S. and Canada.

Notably, Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka — a business leader herself until recently — attended the meeting and welcomed the guests to the White House.

The focus on female business leaders is likely to please feminists, who have come to see Trudeau as an ally in the fight for gender equality. His commitment to gender balance in his cabinet earned headlines, when he appointed a cabinet that had exactly as many women as men.

When asked why he did this, he responded at the time "because it's 2015."

On the other hand, past comments from the then-presidential candidate about women often overshadowed verbal overtures to women in the workforce — most notably leaked audio from a hot mic moment in 2005 exposed Trump as saying he could grab women "by the p---y."

The comments nearly derailed Trump's long shot presidential campaign.

But on Monday at the White House, Trump said the female executives he'd hired in the past were "phenomenal, phenomenal, and they really helped me a great deal in business…they play a tremendously important role, women, in our economy."

"In order to create economic growth and lots of very good, well-paying jobs, we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive, and I think that's happening in the United States much more so," Trump said during the roundtable meeting.It’s Time For Taylor Swift To Retire Her Surprised Face

After 103 award wins (and 162 nods) Taylor Swift is still shocked every time her name gets called. Blake Shelton called her out on it at the CMA’s, so now it is time to put it to bed.During Tuesday's press briefing, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer maintained that General Flynn's resignation had come as a result of an erosion of trust between Flynn and President Trump and not, as some have claimed, because Flynn had violated the law when he spoke to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December.

"When the president heard the information as presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively thought Gen. Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsel's review corroborated that," Spicer said.

"What this came down to was a matter of trust," Spicer added, alluding to the fact that Flynn had failed to disclose certain details about his conversation with Vice President Pence and others in The White House.

As it turns out, White House Councel's assessment that Flynn had not violated any laws was shared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI had concluded in January that nothing illicit had taken place in Flynn's conversation with Kislyak according to a report in The Washington Post.

On January 23rd The Washington Post reported:

The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn — national security adviser to then-President-elect Trump — but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government, U.S. officials said. The calls were picked up as part of routine electronic surveillance of Russian officials and agents in the United States, which is one of the FBI’s responsibilities, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss counterintelligence operations.

Hannity.com reported on the FBI's probe in January.

The FBI's conclusions lend weight to the claim that Flynn's resignation came as a result of his failure to inform the White House of the full extent of his conversation with the Russian Ambassador.Photo

The founder of Cerberus Capital Management, an investment firm that owns companies like the gun maker Remington Outdoor and the supermarket chain Albertsons, is in discussions to join the Trump administration, the firm disclosed on Thursday.

Stephen A. Feinberg, the founder, has held discussions with President Trump’s transition team about “a senior role,” according to a letter to Cerberus investors on Thursday that was reviewed by DealBook. The firm said that were he to take such a position, he would have to publicly disclose significant amounts of information about his finances.

That could bring uncomfortable scrutiny upon Cerberus again. The $30 billion firm has been criticized for owning Remington, which made the rifle used in the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. After the shooting, Cerberus sought unsuccessfully to sell its interest in the gun maker, then offered its investors a way to cash out their stakes in the business.

Cerberus said it had a succession plan in place if Mr. Feinberg were to leave, though it declined to elaborate.

Mr. Feinberg, 56, has been a notable backer of Republican candidates and had served on Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council.

He is among several financial moguls to enter the Trump administration’s orbit. The investor Wilbur L. Ross is Mr. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, while the hedge fund manager Steven T. Mnuchin is the administration’s nominee for Treasury secretary. Stephen A. Schwarzman, a co-founder and the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, leads a forum of business leaders who will meet with Mr. Trump on economic matters.

News of Mr. Feinberg’s discussions with the Trump administration was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.I can recount my favorite teachers in the blink of an eye. Funny, isn’t it—how they’re in and out of our lives quickly, but leave such a lasting impression. I remember how my sixth grade teacher made us draw a map of the United States from memory every morning, to help teach us geography. My ninth grade English teacher read us Shakespeare from a big, upholstered chair at the front of the classroom with an array of spot-on character voices. But perhaps no teacher is more engrained in my pastry-loving mind than Chef Dieter Schorner. This is a man with serious professional chops (former pastry chef at Le Cirque and The White House, to name a few of his many accolades).

He managed to name drop without it seeming the least bit arrogant, simply stating facts he knew to be true, like, “Mrs. Reagan, there’s a woman who knew how to eat.” In the kitchen, he taught me everything from mixing large batches of sponge cake by hand to pulling sugar into delicate decorations. Which is to say, he taught me many delicious things—but I’ll never forget the day he rolled out a thin circle of cookie dough and placed it on top of a cream puff before baking it to golden, extra-crispy perfection.

The resulting recipe is called choux au craquelin. It’s the ultimate crispy cream puff—a perfect contrast of textures once it gives way to plenty of luscious cream inside. It’s also gorgeous, the cookie dough forming a rough, craggy top in the oven and transforming the cream puff into something that looks entirely new and different. And it allows for room to play with flavor and color to make an entirely new recipe with just a few tweaks. This year, I’m making these little balls of wonder as Valentine’s Day treat to share with friends: Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry puffs filled with cream and fruit. If you want to get in on the action, here’s what you need to know:

Brush up on pâte à choux.

You can find all the details about making pâte à choux here, but these are the basics in case you’d like a quick refresh:

So many dough and batter recipes require ingredients to be mixed effectively-yet-minimally to create a tender end product. Pâte à choux needs a significant amount of structure to maintain the proper rise and resulting crispness. Advertisement

The jury is out amongst bakers about which liquid is better for pâte à choux: milk or water. I sit somewhere in the middle, and like a 50/50 mixture of both.

There are also disagreements about what kind of flour to use. I opt for bread flour, which can absorb more liquid and has a higher protein content , resulting in stronger gluten development during mixing and, eventually, a crisper cream puff.

No matter how precisely you follow a recipe for pâte à choux, the eggs are a finicky part of the equation. How much you need can (and will) vary depending on how much moisture loss occurs during the cooking process (see below), and the size of the eggs themselves. The best way to know for sure is to master your favorite recipe and note the amount of eggs you used by weight. Until then, plan on having an extra egg or two handy when you’re mixing (more on this later).

Start by cooking your choux on the stovetop (at this stage it’s called a panade). In a medium pot (leave room to allow yourself some vigorous stirring space), bring the milk and/or water, butter, and salt to a boil. Once it’s boiling, add your flour all at once. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture forms a ball around your spoon. The paste will be slightly sticky to the touch, but will resemble a dough, not a batter. In addition to the formation of the dough ball, look for a film to form at the bottom of the pan—this is the sign the starches in the flour have absorbed the water effectively and gelatinized.

Some folks like to mix the dough by hand (which is great!), but I like to use my stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on low speed and mix it for 30 seconds to 1 minute to help cool it down a little. Whisk the eggs together in a container with a spout (like a liquid measuring cup), but keep your spare eggs nearby. Add the eggs in a stream with the mixer running, and then mix on medium speed until fully combined. Once the eggs have been fully incorporated, stop the mixer and take the bowl and paddle off. Dip the paddle into the choux and lift it up. It should form a "V" shape, eventually breaking off from the batter in the bowl, hanging off the paddle and holding the V. If it breaks off too quickly or is stiff, you need to add more eggs. Start with one egg, whisking it and adding it in the same fashion, then test for the V again. This will probably be enough, but if not, use part of or an entire second egg.

Make the Cookie Dough.

The cookie dough is beyond easy to make (we’re talking 3 ingredients easy). Cream together butter and brown sugar (the added moisture of the brown sugar helps contribute to the wonderful crackly texture later), then add flour. That’s it. Well, unless you want to mix it up, which I thoroughly encourage. I made a few variations myself, first substituting dark cocoa powder for a portion of the flour, and another substituting strawberry powder (finely ground freeze dried strawberries) for some of the flour. Just steer clear of ingredients that will add liquid to the batter. The ratio is already made for melting a bit in the oven and forming a craggy surface and too much added liquid can ruin the ratio and create a big mess. The one exception would be a small amount (up to 1/2 teaspoon) of extract, like vanilla or almond. Once you’ve made your dough, form it into a disc about 1-inch thick and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Chill it for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.

Piping the choux.

This is one of the trickier parts of working with pâte à choux. Proper piping will lead to the correct shape, but it also can contribute to the evenness of finished results. Start by transferring your pâte à choux to a pastry bag. You can use a tip (a large round one is best), but I just cut about a 1/2- to 3/4-inch opening off the tip of the bag. Line your baking sheets with parchment paper. I like to trace guides using small round cookie cutters (2 to 2 1/2 inches is my preferred puff size) onto the paper to help me keep things even, but feel free to skip that step and wing it. If you do use guides, be sure to use a thick pen/marker, and then turn the parchment paper over so the ink won’t come in contact with the pastry. It’s helpful to adhere the parchment to the baking sheet by putting a small amount of choux at the corners of the parchment and pressing down firmly.

To pipe the actual cream puffs, hold the pastry bag straight up and down, perpendicular to the baking sheet. Begin applying even pressure to the pastry bag, letting the pâte à choux flow down onto the parchment. Continue applying pressure without moving the bag—the choux will pool out onto itself, creating a rounded mound. When you’ve reached the desired size, stop applying pressure to the bag gradually, then, with a quick twist of your wrist, come away cleanly. Don’t worry if you leave a little tail or point on your mound, just read on!

Use water to smooth things out.

Have a small bowl of warm water on hand when you go to pipe. When you’re finished, if there’s a noticeable ridge, tail, or spiky point on your choux, dip your finger in the water and use it to gently smooth the dough. You can do this as much or as little as is needed, it just helps to smooth things out and make a more uniform shape (and an even surface for the cookie dough).

Topping the choux.

Back to the cookie dough, now! Unwrap your chilled dough and grab two pieces of parchment paper. I’m not always a fan of rolling out dough between parchment, but in this case it’s necessary. This simple cookie dough can get pretty sticky and just be a nightmare to work with – but the parchment makes such easy work of it! Place the dough between the two pieces of parchment and roll it out to 1/4-inch thick. As you roll, occasionally peel the top parchment away from the dough, then flip the dough over and peel away what was the bottom parchment as well. This keeps the dough from fully adhering to the parchment during rolling, and also makes it less likely that crinkles in the paper will leave lines on your dough. When your dough is nice and thin, use a round cookie cutter to cut it out. (Note: If you used a cookie cutter to trace guides on the parchment for your pate a choux, you can use the same cutter to cut the rounds of dough.) Gently transfer each round to a piece of pâte à choux—no need to press it down or anything, just lay it gently on top. You’re almost there!

The key to baking pâte à choux is enough heat and enough time. You want to make sure the eggs inside the batter do their work and create a rounded puff that’s hollow and ready to fill in the center. Bake the cream puffs at 375 °F. Any exposed choux should be very golden brown, and the topping will melt a little and form a crisp, craggy-looking crust on the surface of the puff. This usually takes 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the puff. To ensure the cream puff is nice and crisp, when the puffs have finished baking, use a sharp paring knife to cut a small vent into the side or base of the puff. Turn the oven off, return the pan to the oven. and let the choux dry out for 5 minutes more. The last of the steam trapped inside the choux will escape through the vent, creating a crispier puff.

Fill your cream puffs just before serving (if you wait too long between filling and serving, they can get a bit soggy). Cut the puffs in half, to expose the hollow center. Spoon your favorite cream filling (like whipped cream, pastry cream, or a delightful mixture of both that’s known as diplomat cream and included in the recipe below), and add a few pieces of sliced fruit like strawberries. Serving these with a sauce of some sort – ganache, crème anglaise, etc.) is also lovely, but should be reserved for when you’re having the cream puffs as a plated dessert, as things can get messy to eat. Put the tops back on your cream puffs and voilà! It’s a downright perfect crispy, crunchy cream puff!

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested an undocumented woman who alleges she was the victim of domestic violence, the El Paso Times reported on Wednesday. The agents were likely acting on a tip from the woman’s abuser, whom ICE had taken into custody earlier, according to El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.

In 2016, the woman contacted the police three times alleging that her partner had chased her with a knife in addition to punching, kicking, and choking her. CBS4 in El Paso, Texas, reports that the woman, who is transgender, was living at a shelter for domestic violence victims. She attended court last week to obtain a protective order against her alleged abuser. On a Thursday press call, Bernal said that an ICE agent sat through the proceedings while two agents stood by the doors to the courtroom. After the judge issued the protective order, Bernal said, the victim’s attorney escorted her into a jury room to speak privately for a few minutes. When the abuse victim exited the jury room, two federal agents approached her, escorted her out of the courthouse, and placed her in federal custody. She now faces deportation proceedings.

Eyewitnesses—including attorneys from Bernal’s office, the judge who granted her protective order, and the advocate representing her—confirm this account. An ICE affidavit, however, alleges that agents didn’t speak to the woman inside the courthouse but rather first made contact with her outside the building.

Bernal believes that the agents were likely acting on a tip from the woman’s alleged abuser, who is currently in jail. She noted that such arrests make undocumented victims less likely to report their abuse. Indeed, her office does not ask about citizenship status for that very reason. Bernal told CBS4 that the problem goes beyond domestic violence.

“I think an unfortunate consequence of some of the recent immigration actions that we’ve seen,” she said, “is that victims of all sorts of crimes will be scared to report. People whose children might even be victimized might even be afraid to report it for fear that the parent could deported.”

Judge Yahara Lisa Gutierrez, who oversees the court that granted the victim’s protective order, agreed. Gutierrez told the El Paso Times that abusers commonly attempt to control undocumented partners by threatening to report them to ICE. She said that ICE agents should resist helping domestic abusers by refusing to act on tips they may give about their partners.

On Thursday, Bernal reiterated the unprecedented nature of the arrest.

“In all our years in this courthouse,” she said, “none of us can recall an incident where immigration authorities made their presence known inside a courtroom—and especially not a courtroom reserved for victims of domestic violence.”BEIRUT—The Trump administration is in talks with Arab allies about having them form a military alliance that would share intelligence with Israel to help counter their mutual foe, Iran, several Middle Eastern officials said.

The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee on Thursday issued a stern letter, including a veiled threat of an investigation, to the federal government’s top ethics monitor, who this week had questioned President-elect Donald J. Trump’s commitment to confront his potential conflicts of interest.

In an unusual action against the independent Office of Government Ethics, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah accused the office’s director, Walter M. Shaub Jr., of “blurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance.”

He cited a bizarre series of Twitter posts that the office made in late November congratulating Mr. Trump for divesting from his business — even though Mr. Trump had made no such commitment. Mr. Chaffetz also said that the office had failed to adequately investigate Hillary Clinton, based on allegations that she had not properly disclosed fees paid for speeches she gave after leaving her post as secretary of state.

Mr. Chaffetz’s letter made no mention of Mr. Shaub’s airing of doubts a day earlier about Mr. Trump’s ethics plan, which includes retaining his own stake in his business empire and putting it in a trust managed by his two adult sons. Mr. Shaub, during an unusual news conference at the Brookings Institution, a policy research center in Washington, said that Mr. Trump had not gone far enough and would leave himself susceptible to “suspicions of corruption.”

Tensions have also flared in recent weeks between the ethics office and Republicans over the pace at which Mr. Trump’s cabinet appointees — many of whom are millionaires or billionaires — were moving through the review process.

Mr. Chaffetz, in his letter, noted his committee’s authority to reauthorize the office, a hint that it could perhaps be shut down. “The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is the principal oversight committee of the House of Representatives and may at ‘any time’ investigate ‘any matter’ as set forth in House Rule X,” he wrote.

A spokesman for the Office of Government Ethics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Chaffetz asked Mr. Shaub to appear for an interview with the committee’s staff by the end of the month.

Richard W. Painter, who served as an ethics lawyer in the administration of George W. Bush, said that Mr. Chaffetz was apparently trying to punish Mr. Shaub for criticizing Mr. Trump.

“They are strong-arming them,” Mr. Painter said Thursday night after being sent a copy of the letter. “They are obviously very upset the Office of Government Ethics is leaning on Trump and not willing to jam through his nominees. It is political retaliation.”

Attacks on the ethics office are rare. Mr. Shaub joined the office when Mr. Bush was president, and he was appointed to direct the agency in 2013 by President Obama.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee came to Mr. Shaub’s defense, citing what it called Mr. Chaffetz’s “hypocrisy” in not responding to letters from committee Democrats asking him to investigate the apparent conflicts of interest presented by Mr. Trump, who is prepared to enter office while his family still controls a global real estate firm.

“Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz’s bizarre and fawning devotion to President-elect Donald Trump is beneath the committee he oversees and an affront to the trust his constituents have placed in him,” the Democratic committee’s spokesman, Tyler Law, said in a statement.

A group that supports Republicans, America Rising PAC, this week accused the ethics office of trying to slow down the process for Mr. Trump’s nominees, as a number of hearings have been delayed.

On Wednesday, the organization said it had sent information requests to the office. “The American people deserve to know if Walter Shaub has turned the ethics office into an arm of the Senate Democrats’ campaign of obstruction,” it said in a statement.Cooking with a high-quality piece of stainless steel cookware can be a little... unnerving. They're so pristine and shiny right out of the box! I will surely destroy this perfect thing, I thought to myself placing a Demeyere saucier gingerly on my cooktop last fall, and so I used it as nervously delicately as possible to start out: browned some chicken cubes, added spices, cauliflower, and coconut milk. In fifteen minutes it was dinner, and I cleaned and dried the pan instantly after finishing.

The next morning, I noticed cloud-like white spots had bloomed across its surface. Some were even rainbow-like, the way an oil slick can be. In distress, I did my research (and contacted the maker directly, as any crazy-curious cook would do).

The markings, I learned, are mineral deposits or "scale" from the tap water, also referred to as calcium deposits, lime deposits, and even protein deposits. (I'd imagine if you have extremely hard water at home, this issue becomes even more pronounced.) It's the same thing that sometimes happens to glassware in a dishwasher—the cloudy effect.

These chalky blooms aren't harmful to you or your cooking, but a buildup can encourage bacterial growth, which would be—so either way, it's smart to clean them up at first sign.

Calcium deposits, soon to be very magic-ed away.

Whimsical though these wispies may appear, they won't wipe away with plain soap and water. (I know, I tried!) The solution is to combat them with diluted white vinegar. Our Senior Staff Writer (and one of the most dedicated kitchen cleaners I know) Sarah suggested bringing a 1:3 vinegar to water solution to a boil in the pan, then letting it cool before washing and drying as normal, so that's what I did.

I didn't even have to scrub; after the soak, a soft sponge wiped the wispies entirely away. (Scouring pad not needed and also not recommended—even gentle ones can scratch your stainless steel!)

Mission clean pan, possible. Photo by James Ransom

For heavier deposits (if you have very hard water, let's say), you might try discarding the vinegar solution, refreshing it, and boiling anew before cleaning the pan, or even leaving the solution to sit in the pan overnight before cleaning it. I admit to having also tried using a 50:50 solution on more dramatic deposits, which didn't hurt my pans a bit. There are also scale-removing products on the market, but you'd want to check to be sure they won't damage your cookware before using them (though why bother, when vinegar works so well?).

The day before his inauguration as president, Donald Trump scanned the ballroom during a celebratory luncheon at his Washington hotel: “Where’s Kevin?” he asked. “There’s my Kevin.”

It was a brief but telling acknowledgment of a behind-the-scenes political relationship between two GOP power-brokers on opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue — Trump and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) — that has set the stage for a rapid legislative blitz in the early months of the Trump administration.

McCarthy, the No. 2 House Republican, helped forestall an intraparty war during Trump’s campaign, smoothing over tensions between the Republican front-runner and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who repeatedly clashed with Trump on matters of style and substance.

Now Ryan and Trump are largely on the same page, and McCarthy has staked out a role as a trusted intermediary between the new president and House Republicans — one he earned though a decade-long friendship with Ryan and by serving as an unusually early and loyal supporter of Trump’s campaign.

“They’ve built a good relationship, and I feel as though I was very helpful in making that happen,” McCarthy said in a recent interview. “I just feel as majority leader, my role is to keep a team together. . . . I think it’s been helpful.”

At the Jan. 19 luncheon, Trump acknowledged as much: “Kevin would call me in the heat of battle. Right, Kevin? And I’d be fighting with Paul,” Trump said, going on to describe how he had patched up his relationship with the House speaker. “Paul Ryan’s done a great job, and Kevin, during the heat of battle, was there for us, and I appreciate it.”

The alliance appears to have been forged back in the heat of the GOP primaries, after McCarthy indicated on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he would have no problem working with Trump as president.

The February 2016 exchange appeared to endear McCarthy to Trump, who called him soon afterward. As McCarthy tells it, Trump phoned him as he sat in church one Sunday morning home in Bakersfield — no blocked number, no secretary, no “please hold for Mr. Trump.”

“It’s just him,” he said. “And we’ve just struck up a relationship over the phone. . . .I’d talk to him about things that were happening that we were going to do in the House . . . so he’d know ahead of time and not be blindsided by anything.”

McCarthy and congressional aides describe a relationship unfolding over the months in scores of impromptu calls and in a June meeting on a Sacramento airport tarmac. As Trump’s Capitol Hill whisperer, McCarthy has taken a place alongside Vice President Pence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as a key link in GOP relations between the executive and legislative branches.

That has also given McCarthy new relevance in Washington a little more than a year after his steady ascent in House Republican leadership was suddenly halted after former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) stepped down in 2015.

McCarthy moved to claim the speaker’s chair, but he could not convince the House’s most conservative members to trust him as their leader and stepped aside. Now McCarthy appears to be one of the few on Capitol Hill who has the absolute trust of the one Republican in Washington who matters most.

[McCarthy’s comments on Benghazi should trouble Republicans]

The two men have bonded over a common approach to politics — light on policy nitty-gritty but heavy on back-slapping, deal-making and personal rapport. Their alliance began many weeks before Trump secured the GOP nomination, at a time when most of senior Republicans on Capitol Hill were treating Trump with kid gloves.

McCarthy, on the other hand, was unusually enthusiastic about the businessman’s prospects. On Feb. 22 — more than two months before Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) dropped out, leaving Trump with the nomination — McCarthy declared on “Morning Joe” that there was “more than a 50 percent chance” Trump would prevail.

Host Joe Scarborough asked McCarthy if he could work with Trump as president. “Oh yeah, I think I can work with Donald Trump,” McCarthy said, then gave a less equivocal answer when Scarborough asked if he could work better with Trump than Cruz, who pushed the 2013 government shutdown.

“That’s an unfair question,” McCarthy said.

McCarthy remained bullish on Trump as he edged closer to the nomination. After a Sacramento fundraiser in early March, he told reporters that Trump could be a boon to down-ballot GOP candidates by boosting voter enthusiasm — at a time when the conventional wisdom was that Trump would drive independents and moderate Republicans away from the polls, spelling disaster for the party.

Trump tweeted his appreciation:“Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive!”

The relationship intensified after Trump secured the nomination in early May, and Ryan subsequently declined to immediately endorse the GOP nominee .

Ryan ultimately backed Trump a month later, but the tensions between the two men ebbed and flowed over the course of the campaign. Ryan continued keeping his distance from Trump’s most controversial statements and policy proposals. Trump in August appeared to flirt with endorsing Ryan’s primary opponent in his House reelection campaign.

And in October, after The Washington Post published a recording of Trump making crude remarks about women, the rift threatened to split wide open after Ryan told House Republicans that he would not campaign with Trump in the final weeks before Election Day.

That’s when McCarthy said he got on the phone with Trump to try and separate facts from what he considered media-driven hysteria.

“A lot of those things weren’t described properly,” McCarthy said in the interview. “I would talk to [Trump], because I’d see things heating up, and I’d view the press as causing some of this. ‘Paul didn’t say this. The press said he did this; I was on the call, and this didn’t happen.’ I think he appreciated that.”

“I’d also tell Paul, ‘Hey, he’s not doing that,’” he added. “Get ’em back together.”

What gave McCarthy credibility with Trump were ongoing gestures of loyalty, including regular television appearances backing Trump and his service as a Trump delegate and prime-time speaker at the Republican National Convention.

With Ryan, McCarthy can call on a long relationship they forged as fellow “Young Guns” ascending the GOP ranks together.

Ryan has now patched up his relationship with Trump, noting in recent interviews that the two speak on a near-daily basis. But there are indications of the continuing esteem McCarthy holds in Trump’s orbit.

It was McCarthy last month, as the highest-ranking California Republican in Congress, who introduced Treasury Secretary nominee and fellow Californian Steven Mnuchin to the Senate Finance Committee. And two former McCarthy aides, Ben Howard and Tim Pataki, have joined Trump’s Office of Legislative Affairs and are now working out of office space inside McCarthy’s suite on the first floor of the Capitol.

McCarthy was also among the congressional leaders who were invited to the White House during Trump’s first week in office to discuss his legislative agenda. But he declined to say what exactly he has discussed with Trump since his inauguration.

“I find a lot of people want to go out and talk about their relationship with Trump,” McCarthy said in the interview. “I just want to help him.”

On Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Daniel Ramirez Medina, a 23-year-old man whose parents illegally brought him to the United States from Mexico as a child. The federal government has granted Ramirez deferred action and an employment authorization card under President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, allowing him to remain in the country and work lawfully despite being undocumented. (So far, Donald Trump has let DACA remain in place.) Ramirez renewed his DACA status in May for another two-year period, undergoing yet another background check. In renewing his status, the government confirmed that Ramirez met the requirements and issued documentation affirming his ability to remain in the U.S. He has not been convicted of a crime, nor does he pose a threat to national security or public safety.

Federal agents arrested Ramirez anyway. ICE’s treatment of Ramirez bears disturbing similarities to the behavior of Customs and Border Protection officers in the wake of Trump’s travel ban. CBP officers allegedly violated court orders, lied to lawful permanent residents and visa holders, rushed illegal deportations, and unlawfully detained travelers. When attorneys presented CBP officers with federal court orders allowing them access to detainees, the officers refused, “on CBP orders.” The Ramirez case raises the disturbing possibility that ICE has decided that, under Trump, it too is empowered to take the law into its own hands. And the agency’s willingness to flout Ramirez’s constitutional rights does not bode well for the hundreds of thousands of DACA beneficiaries whose liberty suddenly seems imperiled.

When ICE agents went to Ramirez’s father’s house in Seattle to arrest him on Friday, they encountered Ramirez and asked whether he was “legally here.” Ramirez responded, truthfully, that he was and had a work permit. ICE agents detained him anyway. They took him to a processing center, where, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf, Ramirez once again told an ICE agent that he had a lawful work permit.

“It doesn’t matter,” the agent responded, according to the lawsuit, “because you weren’t born in this country.”

While processing Ramirez, agents allegedly seized his wallet, which contained his work permit. The card identified him as a DACA beneficiary with a “C-33” code, reflecting work authorization. But ICE ignored the permit, questioned him further, fingerprinted and booked him, then sent him to a detention center in Tacoma, Washington. He has been placed in removal proceedings.

ICE’s treatment of Ramirez is almost certainly illegal. Indeed, his arrest itself likely violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures. Under the Fourth Amendment, arrests must be supported by a judicial finding of probable cause (in the form of a warrant), absent exigent circumstances (like a bona fide emergency) that were not present here. This finding must either precede the arrest or follow it within 48 hours. ICE agents had no warrant to arrest Ramirez, nor did they secure one after detaining him. This bizarre dereliction of duty would seem to violate Ramirez’s Fourth Amendment rights.

Even worse, these agents were presented with evidence that Ramirez was complying with the law—but arrested and detained him anyway. These actions raise grave due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment. The federal government has explicitly given Ramirez permission to live and work in the U.S. Unless Ramirez’s DACA status is formally revoked, he retains a liberty interest and a property right in retaining his DACA benefits. Before the government deprives him of these rights, it owes him, at a bare minimum, notice and a fair hearing. Yet ICE agents appear to have spontaneously decided that he no longer deserves DACA benefits and unilaterally revoked them. This complete lack of procedural due process is both unnerving and unlawful.

Even if ICE afforded Ramirez notice and a hearing, it is doubtful the agency can continue to detain him, let alone deport him. Again, Ramirez is authorized to live in the U.S., yet he is now being detained, for no clear reason. The Supreme Court has said that freedom from detention lies at the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause; ICE’s deprivation of that liberty must thus be accompanied by “sufficiently strong special justification.”

Such justification does not seem to exist. An ICE spokeswoman has alleged that Ramirez is a “self-admitted gang member” and a “risk to public safety.” (Ramirez’s lawyers contest that claim, insisting that their client was “repeatedly pressured” to falsely admit gang affiliation and that he “unequivocally denies” the charges.) But ICE’s lone piece of evidence backing up the gang affiliation claim—a purported statement by Ramirez, given to reporters four days after his arrest—doesn’t solve its broader problem. If ICE had evidence that Ramirez is a gang member before arresting him, it should’ve obtained a warrant. If it has this evidence now, it should go get a warrant or ask the government to revoke Ramirez’s DACA status. Simply detaining him based on an unproven suspicion cannot possibly comport with basic constitutional requirements.Win McNamee/Getty Images

National Security Adviser Mike Flynn resigned late on Monday after just 25 days on the job. The Trump administration was facing increasing pressure over Flynn’s contacts with Russia in the waning days of the Obama presidency before Trump took office. Flynn initially denied discussing Obama administration sanctions placed on Russia during his correspondence with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, but over the past month new evidence trickled out contradicting Flynn’s claims and raising questions about whether he had lied to the vice president about the nature of his Russian interactions and what the president and his top advisers knew.

In his resignation letter, Flynn did not say whether he discussed sanctions with Kislyak but admitted to not being truthful with Pence about the conversations. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,” Flynn wrote. “I have sincerely apologized to the President and Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.”*

Earlier on Monday, the Washington Post wrote a nice tick-tock of what we know about Flynn’s shifting story on his Russia call that lead to his resignation:

Word of the calls leaked out on Jan. 12 in an op-ed by Post columnist David Ignatius. “What did Flynn say, and did it undercut U.S. sanctions?” Ignatius wrote, citing the Logan Act. The next day, a Trump transition official told The Post, “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever ...”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 13, said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had “centered on the logistics” of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin. “That was it, plain and simple,” Spicer added.

On Jan. 15, Pence was asked about the phone call during an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Citing a conversation he had with Flynn, Pence said the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia …”

In a Feb. 8 interview with The Washington Post, Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials. One day after the interview, Flynn revised his account, telling The Post through a spokesman that he “couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

The resignation of Flynn, a staunch and vocal advocate for Trump throughout the campaign, will likely shift the focus away from the embattled adviser and toward the president and what role he may have had in directing or approving of Flynn’s going behind the back of the sitting American president’s foreign policy.

(To refresh: “Chairs. Chairs are made so that people can sit down and take a break. Anyone can sit on a chair and, if the chair is large enough, they can sit down together. And tell jokes. Or make up stories. Or just listen. Chairs are for people. And that is why chairs are like Facebook.”)

On Sunday’s episode of Silicon Valley, HBO’s tech comedy reads that infamous commercial — officially titled “The Things That Connect Us” and directed by future Oscar winner Alejandro González Iñárritu — its last rites by unveiling a new ad for Pied Piper that strives to create a connection between tables and the underdog file-compression company. The tables have been forever turned with narration like, “Grapefruits, postcards, hugs. These are things people share to connect to become closer, to open up about ideas and things that make us feel alive, like air, ballet, amazing haircuts, weird countries, three-alarm chili, mountains, continents, the Earth, life.”

Even before it was the title of a movie, the phrase “the social network” was synonymous with Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s startup snatched the title from MySpace in 2008, and its pre-eminence among social networks has gone unquestioned ever since.

Now there are signs that it may have peaked. Not as a media platform, or as a place where people simply spend time on the web, and certainly not as a business. But as a social network per se—a place where people go to connect with friends and acquaintances—Facebook may be just beginning to wane.

To be clear, people are using Facebook as much as ever. At last count, it had 1.6 billion active users, with more than 1 billion logging in each day. It’s just that fewer of those people are using it to actually socialize. According to confidential company data obtained by the tech blog the Information, Facebook has seen a decline in “original sharing”—posts by people about themselves and their personal lives, as opposed to articles they’re sharing from elsewhere on the web. Bloomberg’s sources corroborated the trend and added that the company is internally blaming it on “context collapse,” an academic term popularized by Danah Boyd to describe how social media tend to blur the boundaries between interpersonal and mass communication.

Whatever its effect on the company’s overall numbers, the phenomenon is real. Posting photos of your baby or your vacation, status updates that convey your mood or what’s on your mind, flirtatious messages to a secret crush—these are interpersonal interactions, the kind you’d typically share with people close to you, or at least people you have reason to believe are well-disposed toward you. But as Facebook has grown, and the average user’s friend list along with it, it has escaped the notice of almost no one that what you share on Facebook you might as well be sharing with the world. There are ways to limit the audience for a given post via your privacy settings, but those can be confusing and tedious to apply. It doesn’t help that Facebook’s own software monitors everything you do on the site in order to build up a profile of you that it can then use to help businesses serve you ads tailored to your precise demographic. When you consider all of that, the only thing surprising about the alleged decline in original sharing is that it took this long.

Get Slate in your inbox.

Anecdotally, I’m emblematic of Facebook’s problem. I’m far from the paranoid sort, and I don’t think the company is evil, or even particularly unscrupulous, as multinational corporations go. Yet I stopped sharing anything too personal on Facebook years ago. And when I had a baby, I was surprised to find myself heeding the advice of a Slate column that had struck me as slightly hysterical when it was first published in 2013: “Why I Post Nothing—Nothing—About Our Kid Online.”

Facebook has reportedly formed a task force to reverse this decline in personal sharing. They’ve experimented with new language to prompt more personal status updates. They’ve added new reactions beyond the like button to encourage people to share and react to posts that express sadness or ambivalence. Zuckerberg has been touting Facebook live video as a fresh, spontaneous way to connect with people that obviates the pressure to carefully craft your message. He has explicitly pitched it as an attempt to recapture the “raw,” “visceral” feeling that Facebook lost long ago. The company has formidable resources at its disposal, and when it sets its collective mind to something, it often succeeds.

Still, I’d put its chances of reversing this decline in original sharing roughly on par with those of a MySpace comeback. You can tweak the parameters of an algorithm to show people better news stories, better reflect their tastes, or even make them happy or sad. But there’s no knob you can dial to restore their trust.

All of which might make it sound like Facebook is doomed, or at least headed down a path to obsolescence. What’s the point of a social network where everyone’s afraid to socialize? As Inc.’s Jeff Bercovici put it: “The Worst Thing That Could Happen to Facebook Is Already Happening.”

In one sense, that’s true. This looks a lot like the first step in the doomsday scenario people have been laying out for the company ever since a few teenagers let the media in on their secret: Facebook had become uncool.

And yet, if you look closely at what Facebook has been up to for the past three years, you’ll see that it has been quietly yet aggressively preparing for exactly this sea change.

The company has reinvented itself in two distinct ways. First, Facebook as a platform has been quietly evolving into something different than a social network—something less personal, but no less useful. Second, Facebook as a company has been furiously hedging its bets on the future of technology and social media, to the point that it is no longer properly described as merely a social network—no more than Alphabet (né Google) is properly described as a search website.

So what has the Facebook app and site become, if not a social network? The answer is rather obvious when you watch how people use it. It has become a personalized portal to the online world.

Facebook’s next overhaul of its mobile app might be the one that clinches its transformation from a social network into, well, a news feed.

This world includes news—more than 40 percent of American adults say they use Facebook for that purpose—but also entertainment, games, and yes, updates from friends and family. As a source of referral traffic to publishers around the web, it has become so dominant as to reshape how companies report, present, and distribute their content. Since the rise of the internet, companies have vied to build the perfect portal, the home page that would become everyone’s on-ramp to the information superhighway. Others have tried to devise the ultimate news reader, a personalized feed of the best stories and content from around the internet. Without ever saying so in as many words, Facebook has managed to do both—far from perfectly, of course, but more effectively than perhaps anyone since AOL.

It hasn’t achieved this by accident. I’ve reported at length on Facebook’s yearslong quest to prioritize “quality content” in the news feed. By this, it does not generally mean showing its users better personal updates from friends but showing them better and more substantive stories from professional publishers of all stripes. That might be because its executives, especially chief product officer Chris Cox, foresaw that Facebook could not thrive forever on status updates alone. Meanwhile, it has added trending news topics to its main page, encouraged news organizations to begin publishing their best stories directly to Facebook, and promoted its native video player and live video platform in hopes of luring YouTube stars, celebrities, and media outlets to create more compelling viewing material. It wants to pull more and more kinds of internet uses within its walls, the better to keep its users’ valuable eyeballs there.

Facebook’s next overhaul of its mobile app might be the one that clinches its transformation from a social network into, well, a news feed. Mashable reported recently, and the company confirmed to me, that it is testing a new mobile interface that would offer users the option to sort their feeds by topic. One test of the concept appears to divide the news feed into

categories like “U.S. News and Politics,” “Sports,” and “Entertainment”—mirroring the very sections you’d find in a daily newspaper.

Whoah. Massive change to the Facebook news feed. Anyone else seeing this? pic.twitter.com/EA3dFQRS6y — Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) April 15, 2016

The feeds would still be ranked based on what your friends are liking, sharing, and commenting on, and they’d still include personal updates. But the reorganization would make your reading interests, rather than your social connections, the focal point of the app. In short, Facebook would be transforming itself from a book of faces into a book of news.

So where did all the faces go? What insurgent social media platforms have arisen to topple the Facebook behemoth? Not Twitter, which feels even less safe and private than Facebook and accordingly pivoted away from socializing years ago. (Twitter is now pretty clearly a media company, to the point that it recently signed a deal to simulcast NFL games.) No, the new hubs of online socializing are, primarily, photo- and video-sharing and messaging apps, which focus explicitly on creating more intimate contexts for personal interaction. The two most prominent photo- and video-sharing platforms in the United States are Instagram and Snapchat. The two most prominent messaging apps (not counting Apple’s iMessage, which isn’t really an app) are WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

By now you may have guessed where this is going. Of the four social-media platforms that have done the most to chip away at Facebook’s pre-eminence, three—Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger—belong to Facebook. And it has tried like hell to buy the fourth one. While Snapchat has resisted its overtures, Facebook has often tried to mimic or piggyback on the appeal of its core features, first with the ill-fated Poke app and more recently with live video streaming, which it views as similarly spontaneous and interactive.

Widely mocked at the time, Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 has proved prescient. Same with its $22 billion purchase of WhatsApp, which many Americans had not even heard of when Facebook announced the deal in 2014. Yet Facebook has not confined its expansion to the purely social realm. Its $2 billion purchase of Oculus VR puzzled even some of those who grasped the logic of the Instagram and WhatsApp deals.

Zuckerberg’s claim that virtual reality could one day become “the most social platform ever” feels a little far-fetched, given that the hardware fundamentally isolates the wearer from the people around him. Of course, we’ve doubted him before and been wrong. But the move makes a lot more sense when you stop thinking of Facebook as fundamentally concerned with social interactions. Think of it instead as a company that aspires to dominate online media consumption, and its foray into virtual reality—which so far appears best suited to professionally produced games and videos—suddenly seems entirely natural.

At the same time, the company has been turning Messenger into a futuristic platform in its own right, opening it to developers to create artificially intelligent chatbots and building its own virtual AI assistant, called M. If virtual reality isn’t the next big thing, virtual assistants just might be.

Facebook is still a social network, certainly. The company is quick to point out that, while many of its users now mostly share and engage with articles, photos, and videos produced elsewhere, there are still a vast number who use the site to socialize. And Facebook isn’t about to push them to do otherwise.Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

For Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Monday’s meeting at the White House with Donald Trump went pretty much as well as possible. Trump promised that any change in the binational trade relationship would be a “tweak,” while Trudeau got a meme-able moment of subtle resistance to Trump, when he refused to succumb to the president’s overbearing handshake.

For the most part, their first meeting glossed over the awkwardness of the Trump-Trudeau relationship so far. Earlier this month, Trudeau took a dig at the president’s executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries by tweeting a welcome message to refugees himself, while Trump’s press secretary angered many Canadian officials by using a shooting at a Quebec mosque to justify the travel ban, even though the alleged shooter was a white, right-wing French Canadian.

Temperamentally, the two administrations are quite different. In the age of Trump’s loud nativism, many American progressives have seen Canada as part of the resistance movement, a bulwark against his most illiberal tendencies. As Nicholas Kristof wrote in a column for the Times, Canada “may now be the finest example of the values of the Statue of Liberty,” because of its openness to immigration and continuing commitment to refugees. Over 40,000 displaced Syrians have already been resettled in the country.

But when Trudeau met Trump on Monday, he was careful not to explicitly criticize the president. Trudeau stood by while Trump defended the travel ban. “The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,” he said. His silence was rooted in the same paradox that faces every Canadian leader—how far can Canada go in criticizing its one major strategic partner?

Get Slate in your inbox.

There’s a strong incentive for Canada’s leaders never to speak ill of an American president, no matter how unpopular his positions might be at home. Trudeau’s father, who served as prime minister in the ’70s and ’80s, once compared the relationship to “sleeping next to an elephant.” Canada is a member of many strategic partnerships with the U.S., like Five Eyes, which means our intelligence departments have deep access to each other’s resources. But when discussing the “special relationship” between Canada and the States, trade is a deeper and ultimately more fragile link. Three-quarters of Canada’s exports head south to the United States. NAFTA enshrines free trade between the two countries, while also ensuring certain Canadians have easier access to U.S. visas. For a government trying to keep that deal in place, picking fights with a capricious White House could have real consequences.

There was a time when Canadian prime ministers took on American presidents as a matter of course. In 1965, Lester B. Pearson called for a cessation of bombings in Vietnam. During a diplomatic visit to the White House later on, Lyndon Johnson is said to have grabbed Pearson up by the lapels and shouted, “Don’t you come into my living room and piss on my rug.”

Trudeau’s silence is rooted in the same paradox that faces every Canadian leader—how far can Canada go in criticizing its one major strategic partner?

There is no such grit today. While Jean Chrétien, a Liberal prime minister in the ’90s and ’00s, kept Canadian troops out of the Iraq war, he was always careful to tamp down criticism of George W. Bush inside his own party. He expressed displeasure when an aide called the president a “moron” (the aide resigned) and even kicked a member of Parliament out of his party for stomping on a Bush doll during a comedy show. While Stephen Harper, a Conservative, was clearly frustrated with Barack Obama over the Keystone pipeline, which Harper favored, he always emphasized his “great” friendship with the president, even if the two leaders never looked terribly comfortable side by side.

Trudeau has maintained this friendly neutrality. He remained silent during the presidential campaign, and issued a boilerplate letter of congratulations when Trump was elected. Since then, Trudeau’s official comments have been about agreement and compromise. He’s expressed a willingness to renegotiate NAFTA, an unpopular position at home. And according to several reports, Liberal MPs have been strongly advised to stay quiet on the new president.

Trudeau’s official neutrality was put to the test one week after the travel ban, when Canadian opposition parties called an emergency debate on immigration. For over an hour, members of the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party or NDP—Canada’s social democrats—asked pointed questions about the government’s position on refugees and Trump’s executive order. Canada’s newly minted Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen talked about Canada’s commitment to refugees but refused to denounce Trump or Canada’s cap on Syrian refugees. That’s in sharp contrast to the NDP leader, who has gone so far as to call Trump a fascist.

For Trudeau, there is no good outcome when it comes to dealing with Trump. Polls suggest Canadians would be happy to see their government take on the American president. According to one, over 80 percent of Canadians disapprove of Trump’s performance, while another suggests 58 percent of Canadians would approve of a trade war with America if Trump introduced new tariffs. But officials in Trudeau’s government worry that Canada has more to lose in a trade fight with the United States, particularly after the Canadian economy went through a slowdown in 2016.

This Catch-22 coincides with the end of Trudeau’s political honeymoon. His support of the Keystone XL pipeline and other major energy projects has angered environmentalists, while his push for national carbon pricing has been unpopular with the right.* In the past few weeks, he’s reversed course on a campaign promise to introduce electoral reform and faced backlash over cash-for-access fundraisers where political donors were given access to Cabinet ministers.

For the first time since his election, the poll numbers have started to drop. A recent Ipsos poll shows a Conservative Party led by reality TV star Kevin O’Leary within 1 point of the Liberals, and Trudeau’s approval rating has fallen. Amid this bad news, the prime minister shuffled his Cabinet and embarked on a cross-Canada “listening tour” to re-engage with voters in local town halls. But rather than re-igniting Trudeau-mania, the tour resulted in several gaffes, including a confusing and widely criticized statement about First Nations youth needing more money for canoes.

Trudeau scores political points at home every time the media favorably compares him to the U.S. president. But he can only play up that contrast subtly, or he risks jeopardizing Canada’s relationship with Trump. The meeting between them was stilted and cordial. For Trudeau, that may be an atmosphere worth cultivating.This video wraps up a year’s worth of eye-popping work from Beauty of Science, a team of scientists and artists in Hefei, China.

A daily roundup of the biggest stories in right-wing media.

On Monday, conservative media was abuzz with coverage of Sunday night’s Grammy Awards, most of all about the dress worn by a little-known singer. As Sean Hannity’s site explains, Joy Villa, who was not nominated for an award, “initially arrived in a a [sic] white cape, and revealed the red, white, and blue MAGA dress in front of photographers on the red carpet.”

Many outlets ran articles featuring multiple images of Villa’s outfit, and some actively praised it. Breitbart rounded up tweets from the “many leftists” criticizing Villa’s choice, especially suggestions that she was just seeking attention. If she was, the ploy seems to have worked: The Daily Caller–affiliated Smoke Room reports that Villa’s online music sales spiked after the ceremony.

Posts celebrating Joy Villa’s sartorial choices circulated were heavily shared on conservative Facebook pages:

Despite its own admiration for Villa, “who showed pure courage,” LifeZette was largely dismissive of the other political statements at the Grammys. Two notable exceptions: James Corden, whose “offhanded comments weren’t totally inaccurate [when he] rapped that ‘with Trump we don’t know what’s coming next,’ ” and Jennifer Lopez, who also got a pass from the site for dwelling on “the importance of the artist’s voice during trying times,” since it wasn’t clear whether or not her comments should be “taken as a dig against Trump.”

LifeZette was more critical of A Tribe Called Quest’s performance with Busta Rhymes, who referred to Trump as “President Agent Orange,” writing that the “crowd seemed remarkably disinterested, and showed 10 times more enthusiasm for Adele’s tribute to George Michael.” “Shock: Super Edgy Celebz Bash Trump at Grammys,” is how Breitbart teased the performance. The site was also critical of Katy Perry, who it described as “a prominent Hillary Clinton celebrity consigliere” before noting that she “has never won a Grammy Award.”

In “Liberals Charge ‘Racism’ at the Grammys—Please,” LifeZette pointed to the Tribe Called Quest performance and to nonwhite artists who received awards, going on to pronounce, “Adele won Best Album of the Year because she had the best album of the year. Period.” The piece went on to say:

At its best, art—especially music—can help people of all kinds, of all income levels, of all backgrounds, come together and forget identity politics. Unfortunately, many today are not satisfied until art itself is crippled into something divisive and aggressive.Wright knew this, of course — his characters were purposely exaggerated, in part to elicit a white audience’s sympathy and to shock it into racial awareness and political action. But where does that leave his black subjects? Let us consider some other works published in roughly the same era: Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Jean Toomer’s “Cane,” Ann Petry’s “The Street.” Like Bigger Thomas, the protagonists in these books are black, suffering under segregation and, for the most part, poor. Unlike Bigger Thomas, they are robust and nuanced characters — not caricatures endlessly acting out the pathologies of race. Much of the black literature of the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s, explicitly or implicitly, was concerned with race in America. How could it have been otherwise? For better or worse, many of the characters in the literature of that period were representational to some extent — black people in the real world were the correlative to black characters on the page. And this is significant, because when black writers affirmed their black subjects’ full humanity, the scope of their novels included the expectation that the real world would change radically so that it too could affirm and acknowledge that humanity. I am led to wonder, then, about a character like Bigger Thomas. What future, what vision is reflected in such a miserable and incompletely realized creature?

It would be absurd to deny the accomplishments of “Native Son” or to protest its distinguished place in the literary canon. With Bigger Thomas, Wright courageously defied those who would have preferred a milder character, a less provocative commentary on the “problem of the color line” (as Du Bois called it), one that would reassure white readers rather than terrify them. And certainly, when Baldwin attacked “Native Son” he was, as he wrote in his essay “Alas, Poor Richard,” at a “carnivorous age,” sharpening his sword to kill his literary father so that he could take his place. Nonetheless, with regard to resonance, “Native Son” is limited by a circumscribed vision that fails to extend much beyond the novel’s moment in 1940. Certainly the racism that made Bigger Thomas still exists, but, thank God, Bigger Thomas himself does not — he never did.

Baldwin unmasked treacherous clichés in ostensibly noble programs of protest.

Meeting Ivan Turgenev in Germany in 1867, Dostoyevsky advised the older writer to buy a telescope so that he could see Russia better. The irate Russian nationalist assumed that after a long exile, Turgenev had lapsed into an aversion to Russia and Russians; the price of his acceptance by foreigners had been, as James Baldwin wrote a century later apropos Richard Wright, a “profound, almost ineradicable self-hatred.”

Dostoyevsky may have been guilty of literary parricide, but his jibe about the telescope was also an accusation of inauthenticity: the specter that continues to haunt those writers who rely on professional support and critical validation outside their own societies and communities. The writer who shares a dark but largely unacknowledged history of colonialism and slavery with his metropolitan patrons is burdened with particularly arduous tasks. Baldwin, for instance, not only had to challenge old consensuses about politics and art, as well as overthrow debasing racial stereotypes; he also had to resist the intellectual pieties of victimhood, and the dubious honor of “spokesperson” conferred on many writers who belong to historically ignored communities.

Baldwin’s essay “Everybody’s Protest Novel,” published when he was only 24, initiates a lifelong battle to overcome his own vulnerability as well as his society’s fantasies and prejudices. His main objection to “Native Son” was that it confirmed the damning judgment on African-Americans delivered by their longstanding tormentors. Damaged by hatred and fear, Bigger Thomas tries to redeem his manhood through murder and rape. But this vengeful cruelty only validates “those brutal criteria bequeathed him at his birth,” reinforcing old degrading notions about black men. This is why the “protest novel,” far from being disturbing, had become a “comforting aspect of the American scene,” cherished by white liberals.

To accept, then, that violence and degradation were “the everlasting potential, or temptation, of the human race” was to disclaim moral immunity for any individual or collective; it was to break the simple opposition between virtue and guilt. The protest novel, however, soldered to a Manichaean notion of good and evil, ended up denying the “disquieting complexity” of the human being: the fact that, black or white, he is “something resolutely indefinable, unpredictable,” trapped eternally within a “web of ambiguity” and “paradox.”

In a later essay, Baldwin acknowledged that Wright “worked during a bewildering and demoralizing era in Western history.” Living in France and increasingly disconnected from the African-American experience, Wright also needed, in his later years, a telescope to see America. Yet while regretting Wright’s alienation from his subject, Baldwin did not assume Dostoyevsky’s pious nativism. Rather, he confessed that he could find himself one day in a similarly “baffling and dangerous place”: “For who has not hated his black brother? Simply because he is black, because he is brother.”

Agonized with self-doubt, Baldwin could not forgive people who endlessly conjured up cheering illusions about their innocence and virtue. (You can speculate rewardingly on what he would have made of “American Sniper,” which confers on a mass executioner the glamour of victimhood.) It is bracing to read Baldwin’s denunciation of Bigger’s false redemption alongside his caustic account of Norman Mailer’s craving to be a “white Negro.” In both cases, Baldwin unmasked treacherous clichés in ostensibly noble programs of protest and emancipation. Not surprisingly, he could glimpse a sectarian worm in Albert Camus’s much admired humanism, which merely offered French-style justice rather than political liberty to the Algerians. Such failure, Baldwin insisted, was latent in the causes and manifestoes built on abstract notions about human freedom and fulfillment — those elusive things, which could not be “legislated” or “charted.”

The divide is starkest when it comes to Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised while dismissing American intelligence assessments that Moscow sought to promote his own candidacy.

Against this backdrop, Mr. Trump has appointed Mike Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, to run the C.I.A., and former Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, to be the director of national intelligence (he is still awaiting confirmation). Both were the preferred choices of the Republican congressional leadership and Vice President Mike Pence and had no close or longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In fact, they each endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for president during the 2016 Republican primaries.

But the potential White House role for Mr. Feinberg follows intense speculation among intelligence professionals that Mr. Feinberg is in line for a powerful position within the intelligence community.

Reports that Mr. Feinberg was under consideration to run the clandestine service rocked the intelligence community in recent weeks, raising the prospect of direct White House control over America’s spies at a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Mr. Putin are under investigation by the F.B.I. and congressional committees.

The last time an outsider with no intelligence experience took the job was in the early days of the Reagan administration, when Max Hugel, a businessman who had worked on Mr. Reagan’s campaign, was named to run the spy service. His tenure at the C.I.A. was marked by turmoil and questions about the politicization of the agency. He was forced to resign after six months, amid accusations about his past business dealings. (He later won a libel case against the two brothers who made the accusations.)

Even the prospect that Mr. Feinberg may lead a review for the White House has raised concerns in the intelligence community.

Mr. Coats is especially angry at what he sees as a move by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner to sideline him before he is even confirmed, according to current and former officials. He believes the review would impinge on a central part of his role as the director of national intelligence and fears that if Mr. Feinberg were working at the White House, he could quickly become a dominant voice on intelligence matters.

Michael V. Hayden, a retired general who ran the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency during President George W. Bush’s administration, said it was hard to wrap his head around “the idea of a D.N.I. nominee in the confirmation process while others consider retooling the position.”

“I think I’d be concerned, too,” he said.

The challenge is less immediate for Mr. Pompeo. He does not see an urgent need for a review of the intelligence community, according to current and former American officials, but sees it as better than the appointment of Mr. Feinberg to a job with actual authority over daily intelligence operations.

Many intelligence officials question what purpose a White House intelligence review would serve other than to position Mr. Feinberg for a larger role in the future. Most significant changes to the intelligence community would require an act of Congress, a fact that would ultimately blunt whatever ideas or proposals Mr. Feinberg came up with. Even with a Republican majority in both houses, getting Congress to agree to major changes to intelligence agencies seems unlikely.

It is difficult to “object to someone putting fresh eyes on the organization of the intelligence community,” Mr. Hayden said. “But, even though the D.N.I. staff has become far too large, I don’t think any of us think a major restructuring of the community is in order.”

Tensions between the intelligence community and the White House have already played out on several fronts. Before Mr. Flynn was forced out, one of his top aides, Robin Townley, was denied a security clearance by the C.I.A. But distrust of the intelligence community has been building for years in conservative political circles, where the C.I.A. during the Obama administration was seen as heavily politicized.

Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said in a recent interview that some officials in the intelligence community were trustworthy but “not all.”

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

“People there need to be rooted out,” Mr. King said.

Another Republican lawmaker said that the predominant view at the White House is also that the politicians in the intelligence agencies need to be cleaned out.

Through Cerberus, his private equity company, Mr. Feinberg has strong ties to the government contracting industry. Cerberus owns DynCorp International, which has had a wide array of large contracts providing security to the State Department and other agencies. DynCorp is now locked in a major legal dispute over the fate of a $10 billion State Department contract that it previously held to provide air support for counternarcotics operations overseas.

John F. Kelly, the new Homeland Security secretary, was paid $166,000 a year as a DynCorp adviser until he was named to the new administration.

Cerberus also owns Remington Outdoor, a major firearms manufacturer.

In 2008, Mr. Feinberg also considered investing in Blackwater, the security firm founded by Erik Prince, a former member of the Navy SEALs, before it was ultimately acquired by other investors.

New York magazine reported last year that Mr. Feinberg went to Blackwater’s North Carolina compound in 2005 to take firearms training.Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Mario Tama/Getty Images and Alex Wong/Getty Images.

House Democrats came to Baltimore last week to do the excruciating work of hashing out a “messaging” plan. This would be tedious stuff even if the Democrats were a cohesive entity and not what they actually are, which is a diverse federation of often contradictory interests fond of interminable argument. But messaging is all they have right now, and so here they were for their winter retreat, toiling away on the second floor of an Inner Harbor Hyatt, making occasional trips downstairs in groups to try and convince skeptical reporters that everything was going fine, just fine, and that everyone was on the same page.

Jim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer.

And here, on Thursday morning, was Nancy Pelosi, longtime leader of the House Democrats, pooh-poohing rumors that some progressive members had walked out during a presentation from the centrist think tank Third Way the previous day. She was sharp and lively and not in any mood to entertain questions she considered stupid.

“I didn’t notice that,” she said. “Members walk out over a variety of reasons. Some of them relate to personal hygiene. Some of them relate to, ‘I’ve got to call my mother, I’ve got to call my daughter.’ People just walk out.”

A reporter followed up: Are you saying that there are not real, deep divisions within the party?

“Yeah. That’s what I’m saying.”

She mentioned the Republican grassroots’ tendency in recent years to primary anyone who cast a stray vote, a purity putsch against members who dared work with the Democratic president or against conservative ideology. She sounded a little too confident that this was a “them” problem and not an “us” problem, with tempers already aboil on the left over any perceived collaboration with Donald Trump. I asked if there was any fear among the House Democratic caucus that the party’s base will do to Democrats what the Tea Party did to certain Republicans over any breaks from orthodoxy.

“We don’t have a party orthodoxy,” she said. “They are ideological.”

This was the challenge facing the folks upstairs who were trying to craft a cohesive message: this lingering and longstanding conviction that the Democratic Party comprises a set of nonideological interests, with the party serving as a glorified moderator. But is that really still the case? What was odd in Baltimore was watching elected Democrats struggle to do what has happened organically in the days since Donald Trump’s inauguration. Among wide swaths of the Democratic coalition, there is an orthodoxy forming: The party’s purpose is to block and resist Trump at every turn—and through that process reinforce their own priorities. The question that seemed to hang over the Inner Harbor last week, during both the House Democrats’ retreat and a Democratic National Committee forum on Saturday, was whether the Democrats realized that a message had already been made for them—not in hotel ballrooms, but in town halls around the country and quite literally in the streets.

The House Democratic caucus does not like being called irrelevant.

“There’s so much buzz in the press, ‘Oh, you’re Democrats, you don’t have any power in the House of Representatives, you’re gonna be irrelevant,’ ” Rep. Steny Hoyer said Wednesday in Baltimore. “We’re not irrelevant, not at all.”

The Democrats’ best messaging weapon is in not allowing Republicans to operate independently of the madness radiating from the White House.

Let us try to understand why some members of the press might have this impression, which the House minority whip categorizes as false. To be in the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, during a period of unified Republican control of the federal government and during a broader era of near total political polarization, is to have near-negligible control over the ship of state. Senate Democrats still have some leverage, for now, with what remains of the filibuster. Democrats in the House can stop nothing that hits the floor from passing—only Republicans’ internal divisions can achieve that. There may be some crucial bills coming down the pike for which Speaker Ryan turns to Democrats to make up for votes the Freedom Caucus won’t supply. Those bills have yet to materialize. The legislative efforts that have materialized are the push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and tax reform, congressional Republicans’ two stated goals for the year, which they’ll pursue via the party-line reconciliation process. They’ve shut the door on Democrats, and there’s not much that Democrats can do about it.

What, then, is the House Democrats’ role in the resistance? How are they to spend their time? “It is up to us to make sure that the public knows what is happening here, and how it affects them,” Pelosi said Wednesday.

In other words, all they’ve got is messaging.

That means cutting through the daily frenzy of Donald Trump’s early morning agenda-setting and score-settling on Twitter. “It’s an ancient Chinese, and even more modern, theory of war that one of the things you do in order to win a war is to make sure the other side cannot make its case,” Pelosi said. “So, as soon as they’re doing something—and if it’s not going well, and we’re succeeding in pointing that out, they change the subject. He’s an illusionist.”

Messaging on the Hill also mean sending a crisp signal to Republicans that Democrats will not bail them out with any votes if they go through with a risky escapade such as, say, repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement lined up. Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking Democratic member on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, said his party had a “tremendous” amount of leverage—enough to hold their ground against Republicans.

“If they go ahead and just repeal this thing, and even if they delay it but they have no replacement, then the danger is that the insurance marketplace starts to collapse,” Pallone said. “And I think what they’re envisioning is that if they do that, and it collapses, they would come back to us and say, ‘OK, we want your votes for replacement, because this is a disaster.’ But what they’re realizing is that disaster, that marketplace chaos which would result from repeal and no replacement, is going be blamed on them.”

The minority’s most powerful messaging weapon, though, is in not allowing congressional Republicans to operate independently of the madness radiating from the White House. Consider, to use an example from the week past, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley’s effort to see if Republicans would avoid consideration of a resolution affirming that the Holocaust targeted Jews. He succeeded: Republicans blocked the resolution.

“We want our Republican colleagues to understand that what the White House does, [House Republicans] either have to answer for, or they have to condemn,” a satisfied Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, said on Wednesday. “They can’t have it both ways. That’s another tool by which we will continue to use procedural votes on the floor to hold them accountable. It’s not just about the White House. It’s also about our Republican colleagues.”

“At the end of the day, 2018 will be more a referendum on what it is the House Republicans are going to allow him to do,” Rep. Denny Heck, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s recruitment chair, said Thursday. “He can only do those things that they allow him to do, and he cannot do those things that they choose to stop him from doing. This is a referendum on them.”

If there’s problem with this theory, it’s in the premise that Trump’s insanity and poor approval ratings will drag down the rest of the party. The Republican base, which reliably turns out to vote in midterm elections, quite likes Trump. The question of whether congressional Republicans will provide a check on Trump has a much more obvious answer: of course not.

But messaging against Donald Trump and the congressional Republican agenda is all House Democrats can do right now, and Senate Democrats can’t do much more either. More importantly, it is all they should do. They need not concern themselves with what their platform ahead of the 2018 elections will be, because even if they pick up seats or even a chamber in Congress, they will still not be able to enact any of their agenda. Their goal is to stop Trump and the Republicans from doing bad things. It’s all their base is asking them to do.

Millions of people marched against Donald Trump the day after he was inaugurated. Republican members of Congress can’t hold town halls without being set upon by protesters hassling them about their agenda or the blind eye they turn to Trump. Resistance groups are gathering massive support online; the ACLU will never want for money again; the courts have blocked Trump’s order restricting travel into the United States. As Republicans put the Affordable Care Act on the chopping block, regular people are mustering a moral language for defending it that Democratic politicians have been loath to employ. Constituents have a powerful ability to find the right defense for something dear to them when someone is trying to take that thing away. Maybe the job of Democrats at the top isn’t to draw up a message in a focus group. Maybe it’s to follow those people on the ground expressing it already.

That seems to be the conclusion of several candidates vying for the chair of the DNC. The road to that process is now less than two weeks from its culmination at the DNC election on Feb. 25 in Atlanta. This past weekend, the race stopped in Baltimore—across the street from where the House Democrats had just met—for the final regional forum before the election.

“The job of the next DNC chair is to make sure the party is positioned as an ally.”

The third floor of the Baltimore Convention Center on Saturday, one flight up from an international auto show, was rife with dozens of signs and assorted other literature for the candidates, of whom there are many. Ten people are running for chair, nine for vice chair, and four for secretary. Outside the main ballroom, supporters of various candidates were huddled opposite each other, as if preparing to begin a dance-off. They took turns loudly chanting for their candidates. Each candidate had a table from which to distribute information and, more welcomingly, free food. Henry Muñoz, the party’s national finance chair who’s running unopposed for re-election, set platters of Baltimore crab cakes on his table to distribute to all comers. No wonder the competition was scared off.

The race for DNC chair has receded into the background since Nov. 9, when liberal anger over the election manifested itself as an unprecedented interest in who would fill the role of unofficial tribune of both the party and the Trump resistance. The diminishing interest is telling: It turns out that the role has been more than ably filled by the millions of people who’ve taken to the streets and town halls to demonstrate against Trump and the anticipated predations of a unified Republican government.

But the DNC election still matters, including as a bellwether for how closely the party is listening to the howls of the people it purports to represent. The state of the race is difficult to ascertain. The chair of the Democratic Party will be determined by the votes of its 447 members, whose priorities don’t necessarily align with those of outside activists.

It appears to be a race, though, between former Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. The horserace drama, such as it is, is that of a silly proxy war between the emboldened Bernie Sanders wing of the party (Ellison) and its establishment (Perez). “Silly” not because the proxy war isn’t real—it’s definitely real, as Sanders’ post-campaign political organization, Our Revolution, has aggressively thrown its weight behind Ellison, while Perez is running at the urging of President Obama and his allies. “Silly” because Perez and Ellison are both capable, charismatic, progressive organizers who would serve the party well. They’re not so different.

The 11-person field has other appealing and capable options in the rising-star mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg; South Carolina Democratic Party chair and former House majority whip aide Jaime Harrison; New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair and current DNC Vice Chair Ray Buckley; the deeply credentialed party operative, organizer, and activist Jehmu Greene, and others.

The national party operation under the stewardship of any of these candidates would be a marked improvement over the torn and tattered DNC left behind by the last elected party chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, an incompetent and widely disliked Florida centrist who went so deep in the tank for Hillary Clinton during the primary that she didn’t dry off until Trump’s inauguration. Candidates weren’t shy about expressing their frustration with what the DNC had become, and how it had allowed local and state parties to atrophy. Mitch Caesar, chair of the Broward County Democratic Party and a candidate for vice chair, lamented the deterioration of the DNC into little more than a “federal pass-through for presidential elections.” Buckley described the DNC in recent years as being “the chair and a few staff.”

“For the last eight years, I’ve been a vice chair,” Buckley said, “and I don’t know what the hell is going on in this party any more than you.”

The DNC race of today has changed in scope even in the past month. Candidates entered this race thinking about how they could counter Trump. Now they’re thinking about how they can assist those who are already doing it.

“What I think we’re seeing is the broader organizational movement activity is welling up with or without us,” Buttigieg said Saturday, a few hours before the forum. “And the job of the next Democratic chair of the party is not cramming all of this into the party and try to run it from Washington. It’s to make sure the party is positioned as an ally and sees where it fits within the broader texture of the progressive movement, rather than the other way around.

“You go from the model of the airport protests and the women’s march, to the town hall meetings, where we watch this taken to the feet of the Republican Congress,” he continued. “If we keep guiding it that way, then it’s not such a long walk, a year from now, to start channeling this into working in electoral campaigns. But we can’t just be passive observers until September of next year, and then just suddenly call these people up when we need them to say, alright, time for you to [join] our movement. We have to be a part of theirs.”

Over the past few weeks, the grassroots-level interest in contributing to the resistance has spiked in a way that overloads the creaky local, state, and national Democratic Party infrastructure that’s still low on cash following the 2016 cycle.

“One of the things that’s core, and that’s very, very critical … is about building capacity,” Jaime Harrison said Friday. “I’m really concerned that if 500 or 1,000 of these people go to Democratic offices tomorrow, the question is, what do they do? Are the parties equipped to train them? And that’s what we need to make sure happens here in this race. I want this race to be done, and done soon, so whoever—if it’s me, or whomever the chair is—can make sure that the state parties, and that the DNC, have the capacity to be able to work with all of these groups.”

The Democratic Party will already have to play catchup with the growing sector of outside groups sopping up the overflow energy. Indivisible, over the course of a couple of months, has blossomed from a PDF dumped onto Twitter one night into a go-to hub for finding local meet-ups and organizing protest activity. (If a member of Congress finds himself or herself bombarded by rowdy town hall attendees, a lot of those attendees probably found their way there via Indivisible.) Groups such as SwingLeft and the Sister District Project offer residents of safe districts opportunities to help in other competitive races. The volunteers behind these groups talk to each other. While the Democratic Party has been debating its future leadership, these groups have been doing the early organizing work for them.

Liz Jaff, vice president for business development at Crowdpac and candidate for DNC vice chair, wants to bring this apparatus under the wing of the party.* “This is the DNC. It should happen here,” she said in her fired-up Saturday pitch in Baltimore. “What I’m asking, very simply, is to build this. To bring in these engineers to make this happen. To connect you with the movements.

“We shouldn’t see these groups as a threat,” she said later. “We need to embrace them.”

There was some debate among the candidates about whether the DNC should partner with these and other groups as outside vendors, or cut them out and build a proprietary operation within. That’s a narrow question for the newly elected DNC leadership to figure out. There was very little debate, though, about whether the party needs to plug into these outside movements the way groups such as Indivisible are, and serve as a clearinghouse for the energetic resistance to Trump.

It is much easier to harness energy than it is to be tasked with mustering energy where there is none. The DNC isn’t going to come up with “the message” any more than House Democrats are, or any more than Chuck Schumer is. The message is going to be determined on the ground and filter up to its politicians, and some of the best messaging in years is coming out from these packed town halls. The video of Jessi Bohon’s Christian defense of universal health coverage at a Tennessee town hall for Republican Rep. Diane Black has exploded. The clip of a Republican official in Florida being instantly jeered to silence after saying “death panel” was the most effective rejection of that lie since Sarah Palin first invented it eight years ago. Official Democrats don’t need to come up the message. They just need to get out of the message’s way.

Get the best of Slate in your inbox.The Obama administration has begun a profound shift in its enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws, aiming to hasten the integration of long-term illegal immigrants into society rather than targeting them for deportation, according to documents and federal officials.

In recent months, the Department of Homeland Security has taken steps to ensure that the majority of the United States’ 11.3 million undocumented immigrants can stay in this country, with agents narrowing enforcement efforts to three groups of illegal migrants: convicted criminals, terrorism threats or those who recently crossed the border.

While public attention has been focused on the court fight over President Obama’s highly publicized executive action on immigration, DHS has with little fanfare been training thousands of immigration agents nationwide to carry out new policies on everyday enforcement.

The legal battle centers on the constitutionality of a program that would officially shield as many as 5 million eligible illegal immigrants from deportation, mainly parents of children who are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. A federal judge put the program, known by the acronym DAPA, on hold in February after 26 states sued.

But the shift in DHS’s enforcement priorities, which are separate from the DAPA program and have not been challenged in court, could prove even more far-reaching.

The new policies direct agents to focus on the three priority groups and leave virtually everyone else alone. Demographic data shows that the typical undocumented immigrant has lived in the United States for a decade or more and has established strong community ties.

Although the new measures do not grant illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, their day-to-day lives could be changed in countless ways. Now, for instance, undocumented migrants say they are so afraid to interact with police, for fear of being deported, that they won’t report crimes and often limit their driving to avoid possible traffic stops. The new policies, if carried out on the ground, could dispel such fears, advocates for immigrants say.

In describing the initiatives, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has echoed the language often used by advocates of comprehensive immigration reform, which is stalled on Capitol Hill.

“We are making it clear that we should not expend our limited resources on deporting those who have been here for years, have committed no serious crimes and have, in effect, become integrated members of our society,” Johnson said in a recent speech in Houston. He added: “These people are here, they live among us, and they are not going away.”

Since the new policies took effect in January, Johnson’s instructions have been conveyed to agents throughout the department. “We decided we’re going to draw a clear line between individuals who now have significant equities in the country versus those who are recent entrants,” said one department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.

“If people are not an enforcement priority,” the official said, “. . . bottom line, the secretary has said don’t go after them.”

Broken promises

The United States’ massive dragnet is shrinking rapidly, because of the new enforcement policies and declining flows of new immigrants crossing the southwest border, DHS officials say.

Deportations, for example, are dropping. The Obama administration is on pace to remove 229,000 people from the country this year, a 27 percent fall from last year and nearly 50 percent less than the all-time high in 2012.

Fewer people are also in the pipeline for deportation. The number of occupied beds at immigration detention facilities, which house people arrested for immigration violations, has dropped nearly 20 percent this year.

And on Johnson’s orders, officials are reviewing the entire immigrant detainee population — and each of the 400,000 cases in the nation’s clogged immigration courts — to weed out those who don’t meet the new priorities. About 3,000 people have been released from custody or had their immigration cases dropped, DHS officials said.

“It does have the potential to be extremely significant. It would allow people to live without that noose over their heads of the threat of deportation at all times,’’ said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, referring to the policy shift.

But Hincapié and other advocates — who have long clashed with the administration over its aggressive enforcement — said there is widespread skepticism in the immigrant community about whether agents on the ground will adjust their activities to match the new priorities.

“It all sounds great, but it means nothing if it’s not applied,” said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights and racial justice at the Washington-based Center for Community Change. She faulted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), part of DHS, for what she said has been a series of broken promises to more humanely enforce immigration laws.

“DHS is an agency that has terrorized our community for a really long time,” Matos said, “so the level of distrust and fear is really big.”

‘Out of the shadows’

During Obama’s first presidential campaign, he spoke of undocumented immigrants, telling CNN in March 2007: “It’s absolutely vital that we bring those families out of the shadows.”

When his administration took power, the government was adding thousands of new agents hired at the end of President George W. Bush’s term and as a result ramping up enforcement efforts. Under pressure from Obama’s supporters to end Bush’s post-9/11 crackdown on illegal migrants, DHS tried to target these efforts.

“There were no comprehensive, written enforcement priorities,” said John Sandweg, a government affairs consultant who was a top immigration adviser to then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. “Everyone in the country unlawfully was fair game.”

At ICE, then-Director John Morton put out two 2011 memos laying out the agency’s priorities: protecting public safety and national security; and securing the border. In a move cheered by activists, Morton also said agents could exercise “prosecutorial discretion” and decide not to deport certain illegal immigrants taken into custody based on factors such as their length of stay in the United States.

At the same time, DHS expanded a Bush administration program called Secure Communities. It allowed ICE to lodge official requests with local police departments that had arrested someone ICE wanted to deport. The requests called on police to hold the immigrants for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE could pick them up.

As Secure Communities took hold, deportations kept climbing, reaching an all-time high of more than 409,000 in 2012. Even as Republicans blasted the administration for what they called lax enforcement, prominent Latino and other groups derided Obama as the “deporter in chief.”

“There was a lot of big talk coming out of DHS, big promises that they were going to be more sensitive to immigrant families, said Nick Katz, a staff attorney for Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights group. “And then it didn’t make a fundamental impact on the ground.”

A new plan

Soon after Johnson took office in December 2013, he took on a presidential request. Obama — frustrated by the failure months earlier of legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship — tasked the new DHS secretary with determining what the administration could do on its own.

A former corporate lawyer and Pentagon general counsel, Johnson immersed himself in the legal details, reading the 2011 ICE memos and earlier internal documents. He spotted what he considered some of the same flaws activists had pointed out, DHS officials said.

The 2011 ICE memos, for example, had put a priority on deporting people who reentered the country illegally after having been removed from the country before, even if the initial deportation was years earlier and they had since lived law-abiding lives in the United States. Long-term illegal immigrants with families and other community ties were being arrested — many under the Secure Communities program — for minor offenses and sent to ICE for deportation.

“These individuals were being picked up based on that priority, nothing else was looked at, and they were removed from the country before they had their day in court,” a second DHS official said.

A rebellion was also brewing against Secure Communities, which had been billed as a way to crack down on immigrants who had committed serious crimes. About 300 communities, including major cities such as Baltimore and Los Angeles, ended or scaled back their participation.

“In some ways, [Secure Communities] got away from itself,” the second DHS official said.

Johnson’s answer was a pair of memos, released in November on the same day as Obama’s much-publicized speech about the new DAPA program.

Johnson spelled out that immigrants could be deported only if they had been convicted of crimes, not just arrested. And he specified that only people who had crossed the border since January 2014 could be deported purely for an immigration violation, not someone who had been deported years earlier, reentered the country and lived a law-abiding life.

He also did away with Secure Communities, replacing it with a new Priority Enforcement Program to begin later this summer. Under this plan, ICE will still coordinate with local police about immigrants who are in custody but will ask to be notified 48 hours before the scheduled release of an immigrant who is targeted for deportation, rather than seeking to have immigrants held beyond their scheduled release.

Immigrant advocates expressed widespread skepticism about Johnson’s changes, saying they fear that long-term immigrants who are low-level offenders will still be targeted.

But Sandweg said they should keep an open mind. “I think these new priorities are in­cred­ibly significant,’’ he said. “They will obviously have an impact on the lives of millions of people.”

Thank you.“The Great Wall,” Zhang Yimou’s English-language Chinese monster action adventure movie, scored a smashing $66 million in its opening weekend.

The film delivered box office of $17.7 million on Friday, $24 million on Saturday and $17 million on Sunday, with market share above 70% of the nationwide total on Friday and Saturday, dropping to 62% on Sunday. Including Thursday evening paid previews, that gives a weekend score of $66 million (RMB465 million), according to preliminary data from Ent Group. Other estimates may put the figure higher.

“Hacksaw Ridge,” in its second week, and new release “The Wasted Times” disputed second place, each with roughly 10% of the nationwide total. “Hacksaw” is expected to have accumulated $34.7 million after 11 days. “Wasted Times,” which reunites Zhang Ziyi with Ge You ten years after “The Banquet,” was second on Friday and Saturday, but third on Sunday. It managed $9.42 million in three days.

Behind them was Japanese animation “Your Name,” which added $3.0 million for fourth place. That gives it a total of $78 million, overtaking last year’s “Doraemon” to be the biggest Japanese title of all time in China.

The big story, however, was “The Great Wall,” a hugely ambitious China-U.S. co-production, conceived before production house Legendary East became an indirect subsidiary of Chinese property to entertainment giant Wanda. The release in China was handled by China Film Corp. and Wanda’s Wenzhou Distribution.

The film’s total is the third biggest opening weekend this year — after Legendary’s own “Warcraft” and Stephen Chow’s Chinese New Year release “The Mermaid,” which went on to be the biggest film of all time in China.

It played on approximately 45% of available screens. But had per screen averages that were significantly higher.

“The Great Wall” played on 364 million IMAX screens in China and scored $7 million, for the IMAX circuit’s 2nd highest December opening and the third highest IMAX opening score for a local film, behind “Mojin: the Lost Legend” and “Monster Hunt.” IMAX reported that its screens were represented in 18 of the top 20 locations. Going forward there is no other IMAX release in China until “Rogue One” on Jan. 6, 2017.

Other market data shows the film giving China’s overall theatrical market a much needed boost. On each of the three days, nationwide cumulative takings were more than 26% higher than the corresponding days last week.

Releases by Universal Pictures and UIP in other parts of Asia start later this month. Universal continues the process in Europe through January, and in North America on Feb. 17, 2017.Denis Tangney Jr./Thinkstock

Back in early November (such a simple time!), I wrote a piece for Slate on political scientist Jonathan Rodden’s analysis of precinct-level voting patterns. Rodden, a professor at Stanford, showed that the familiar pattern of high-density Democratic areas and low-density Republican areas had been re-created, fractal-like, in the small towns and cities of the Rust Belt during Barack Obama’s presidential election in 2008.

Henry Grabar Henry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate’s Moneybox.

These little-downtown voters, who helped Obama carry several swing states, were supposed to be irrelevant to the Democratic Party in 2016, as Chuck Schumer infamously said in July: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” After Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania flipped for Trump on Nov. 8, it was easy to think that small-town Democrats had abandoned the party wholesale.

But it turns out Democrats didn’t lose those town cores in Pennsylvania and Ohio; in fact, as Rodden showed with new data this week in the Washington Post, the correlation between living downtown and voting Democrat was (relative to nearby rural areas) just as strong in this presidential election as in its predecessors. Red counties weren’t homogenous before, and they’re not homogenous now.

Rodden thinks this trend rebuts a common cultural trope about small-town America: "A popular claim is that Trump’s populist anti-trade rhetoric resonated most in postindustrial towns with severe job losses,” he writes in the Post. "If so, we might expect that these towns suddenly started to vote more like their neighboring Republican precincts, with the graphs flattening in 2016.”

In fact, his graphs show two things: First, Clinton did worse across the board in all these counties than Al Gore, John Kerry, and Obama (both times). Second, her returns mirrored almost exactly the existing correlation between population density and politics. People who lived closer to downtown were still more likely to vote Dem.

I’m not sure Rodden is right to characterize the downtowns of Ashtabula, Ohio, and Muncie, Indiana, (among other places) as more stung by industrial job loss than their outskirts. They were once. But John Updike’s America, where Harry Angstrom could take the bus home from his job as a linotype operator, is a long time gone. Manufacturing work has taken place outside of downtown for many decades. The top four small metro areas for job sprawl, according to a 2009 Brookings analysis, were all post-industrial Northeast cities: Poughkeepsie, New York; Scranton and Wilkes-Barre in Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Worcester, Massachusetts. In Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, for example, more than half of all jobs are more than 10 miles from the two cities’ downtowns. That’s not new. So when the plant closes, it shouldn’t burn downtown voters more than others.

Still, whatever voters’ grievances about deindustrialization, there are other correlations that would tip these old town centers—Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Reading, and Johnstown, in Pennsylvania, for example—toward Democrats. For one thing, they are almost all poorer than their suburbs. For another, they all have concentrated minority populations. They also have more rental housing, and their residents ought to have a closer relationship to the public assets that Democrats have traditionally championed, like universities, libraries, parks, and transit.

For Democrats, the problem with these people isn’t that they didn’t vote Democratic; it’s that they didn’t vote at all. In some cases, turnout in downtown precincts was about half what it was a few miles away. Clinton still carried them.Saul Loeb/Getty Images

Even for an administration that’s lurched from crisis to crisis since it took the reins of government in January, the past week has been extraordinarily dysfunctional. On Monday, national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned less than a month into his tenure. The news came after the Washington Post revealed that despite White House denials, Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador in the month before Donald Trump took office, an apparent violation of the Logan Act.

Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.

Flynn had also misled Vice President Mike Pence on the nature of those calls, leading Pence to defend Flynn on national television and state unequivocally that the now-former national security adviser had not discussed sanctions. Complicating matters, or worsening them, is the fact that Flynn was a person of concern for the Justice Department, who weeks ago warned the White House that he—having lied about these communications—was vulnerable to Russian blackmail. The fact of this warning calls Trump himself into question, given what he said to reporters after being asked about the Washington Post report. “I don’t know about that. I haven’t seen it,” he said while on Air Force One. “What report is that? I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that.”

Topping off all of this is the revelation that during the campaign, key Trump aides were in contact with the Russian government, which directly contradicts assertions from Pence, who told CBS News there had been no communication between Russians and the campaign, and that, to suggest otherwise, “is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”

Given the implications—an American presidential administration potentially compromised by a foreign power—this swirl of questions around Trump, his campaign, and the Russian government demands a thorough investigation. And yet, Congress is all but missing from the equation. Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate shows any interest in investigating the mounting questions and scandals within the Trump White House. This has less to do with merits and more to do with partisan loyalty. Although some Republicans see the need for more information—Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley joined California Sen. Dianne Feinstein in requesting a briefing on Flynn’s activities—most have taken a “see no evil” approach to the administration, turning a blind eye to its dysfunction if it means they can advance an agenda.

This isn’t idle speculation. Republican lawmakers had already been willing to ignore the president’s statements and controversies as long as he backed their priorities. “There’s a widely held view among our members that, yes, he’s going to say things on a daily basis that we’re not going to like,” Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said to the New York Times, “but that the broad legislative agenda and goals that we have— if we can stay focused on those and try and get that stuff enacted—those would be big wins.”

This has extended and will continue to extend beyond outrageous rhetoric to matters of serious consequence. And so, in the wake of the Flynn revelations, Republican leaders have signaled their disinterest in pursuing new or expanded investigations. “The Intelligence Committee is already looking at Russian involvement in the election,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “They can look into whatever they choose to.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan was similarly reluctant. “I think we need to get all of that information before we prejudge anything,” he said, either forgetting that the point of an investigation is to collect that information or admitting that House investigations—at least under Republican leadership—are punitive rather than genuinely investigative.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was more explicit than most, openly declaring that the party’s legislative agenda is more important than resolving the questions around Trump and the Russian government. “I just don’t think it’s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,” he said on a recent edition of the Kilmeade and Friends radio show. “We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense.”

The White House is embroiled in what might be one of the most serious political scandals since Watergate, and the Republican Congress is absent—it has voluntarily abdicated its role. Americans believe their system runs on checks and balances, but those checks require the will to act. Without that, they’re dead letters. And to that point, it’s unclear if the GOP majority will ever take up its responsibilities. Under normal circumstances, a president’s deep and growing unpopularity is enough of a push to force his party to act. But while Trump is disliked by the broad public, he’s still in the stratosphere with GOP voters. It’s an open question if Republicans are interested in actual oversight, but even if they are, pro-Trump political pressure may pose an impossible obstacle.Kay Nietfeld/Getty Images

Facebook is entering week two of a controversy that is, depending on how you view it, either a tempest in a teapot or a tempest in the world’s largest teapot. On Wednesday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg will meet with conservative political leaders in the company’s latest attempt to contain the damage from allegations of anti-conservative bias. It’s a confusing story in which the principal players on both sides are posturing over a disagreement that largely misses the point. The following is an attempt to sift through the claims and counterclaims to reveal what’s really motivating each side, why it matters, and where it’s all likely to go from here.

Why are we here?

Great question—and surely one that Zuckerberg will be asking himself repeatedly when he’s sitting across the table from Glenn Beck, a Donald Trump aide, and other prominent conservatives on Wednesday.

We’re here, in short, because of a May 9 report in the tech blog Gizmodo that cited an anonymous former Facebook contractor accusing his ex-colleagues of anti-conservative bias in their selection of stories for the site’s “trending” news section. The claims played perfectly into the conservative narrative of liberal bias in the mainstream media, and Republican politicians wasted no time launching a pseudo-official “inquiry” into the matter.

Get Slate in your inbox.

Wait, what’s the “trending” news section?



Glad you asked, because there’s a lot of confusion about this. You know the main Facebook news feed, with all the posts from your friends and the pages you follow? Yeah, no: It’s not that. Rather, the “trending” section is that little box that appears to the right of your news feed on Facebook.com, which the majority of Facebook users no longer visit. It’s that one right below the list of birthdays and event invitations.

Oh, and it’s barely visible at all in the mobile app. To find it, you’ll have to tap the search box and then scroll down past the “Recent Searches,” the “Suggested Searches,” the “Posts You May Have Missed,” and the “Random Other Crap You Don’t Care About” sections, only one of which I made up.

Why is “trending” even there?

If no one reads the trending section, then why do people care so much about it?

Well, some people read the trending section, and it does drive some marginal amount of traffic to the news sites whose stories are highlighted there. Even a small fraction of Facebook users is still an awful lot of people.

That said, this isn’t really about the trending section. It’s about the disconnect between Facebook’s self-portrayal as a content-neutral technology platform and the reality that it is becoming the world’s most powerful media company. Like a traditional media company, it increasingly has the power to not only distribute the news but to shape how it’s produced and presented. It would like us to think that’s all done through the power of data and algorithms, but the truth is more complicated.

Remind me: What, specifically, are the allegations?

The allegation from the conservative ex-contractor is that fellow “curators” on the trending team routinely passed over popular stories from conservative outlets like Breitbart while elevating stories of liberal interest. For instance, the ex-curator charges that they made “Black Lives Matter” a trending topic even though it wasn’t among the most popular on the site, according to the algorithm. As Gizmodo points out, that’s noteworthy because Facebook helped to birth and fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. At least one fellow ex-curator agreed that human biases came into play in the story selection process, though everyone Gizmodo talked to denied consciously discriminating against stories based on their political interest.

What’s Facebook’s side of the story?

Frankly, it keeps changing. The company first issued a vague statement saying it takes claims of bias seriously. Then it came out with a stronger denial, maintaining that the curators were there simply to prevent duplicates and misnomers among the trending topics. Later, after the Guardian published a leaked version of Facebook’s guidelines for curators, the company admitted the curators had a broader role in story selection. But Facebook said they were constrained from personal bias by “checks and balances,” such as relying on a list of 10 major media outlets to verify newsworthiness.

How did Glenn Beck get involved?

When all else failed, Facebook brought out the big guy himself. In a Thursday post on his own Facebook page, Zuckerberg said he took the claims of bias “very seriously” and promised “a full investigation,” despite finding “no evidence that this report is true.” He also pledged to meet with “leading conservatives” to try and clear the air. One of those leading conservatives, it turned out, was Glenn Beck. Another was Fox News’ Dana Perino. A top Donald Trump aide will be there, as will former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint. Good times will, no doubt, be had by all.

What’s really at stake is Facebook’s claim to be a neutral player in politics and the media.

And what about that “inquiry” by House Republicans? Is that a real thing?

Sure—in the sense that political theater and grandstanding are real things. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, wasted no time in capitalizing on the controversy by sending an official letter to Zuckerberg in his capacity as chair of the Senate Commerce Committee.* In the letter, he demanded answers to a series of questions about how the trending section works and how Facebook ensures that it’s objective.

But Facebook is a private company. Isn’t this, like, a free-speech issue?

You’d think! Especially since conservatives are always calling for the government to get out of people’s business. Thune said his committee is looking into the matter on “consumer protection” grounds, which feels like a pretty thin justification for government interference in political media.

So Facebook is pushing back, right?

Wrong! Facebook is tripping over itself to appease conservatives while continuing to insist that its trending news section is thoroughly neutral and objective.

But objectivity is a myth! There’s bias involved in every human judgment. Even algorithms have subtle human biases and value judgments built into them.

Then why is Facebook being so awkward about this?

Because the whole thing is extremely awkward for Facebook.

You see, the company probably could make the case that its trending section amounts to political speech protected by the First Amendment, and therefore the government should butt out. But Mark Zuckerberg knows that John Thune and the Senate Commerce Committee are the least of its problems.

What’s really at stake here?

What’s really at stake is Facebook’s claim to be a neutral player in politics and the media. If it’s just distributing the news according to “objective” algorithms, then no one need be too concerned about the outsize influence it wields over the global news industry and our reading habits. If, on the other hand, Facebook employees can use the service to advance their own agenda—say, to try to stop a Donald Trump presidency—then people might be right to fear its power.

Even more crucially for Facebook’s $335 billion business is its ability to appeal to people of all kinds, including conservatives. With some 1.6 billion active users, Facebook is far bigger than any political party or movement, and its ubiquity is its greatest strength as a platform. An exodus by conservatives would put that ubiquity in jeopardy. In order to reach as many users as possible, Facebook needs to be as uncontroversial as possible. That’s why it wants to preserve the notion that it’s somehow “neutral.”

OK, I think I finally get why people care about this. But is Facebook really biased against conservatives?

As a matter of policy, it almost certainly is not. Again, Facebook’s greatest interest is in keeping as many people as possible on the site as much as possible: posting photos, liking photos, clicking on links, and ultimately, viewing and buying ads. It would be wildly counterproductive for the company to jeopardize that by intentionally twisting the news feed, or even the trending section, to one political end or another. And there is zero evidence it has done that. Keeping stories from the likes of Breitbart out of “trending” until they’re confirmed elsewhere isn’t bias. It’s just the rather crude form of news judgment you get when you refuse to acknowledge that you’re exercising news judgment.

That said, Facebook is a Silicon Valley company with Silicon Valley values. Making piles of money is certainly one of those values. But Facebook has also publicly advocated for gay rights and immigration and a number of other political causes. Zuckerberg has his own pet issues, including some more compatible with conservative values, like school reform. Facebook seems to want us to believe that the values of the people who run and work for Facebook have no role in shaping the product that we all use. That seems naïve at best.

So the whole thing is overblown?

Yes—and no. The outrage over political bias in Facebook’s trending topics is overblown, although it could still have serious consequences to the extent that perceptions shape reality. But the deeper question of Facebook’s “neutrality” and its role in shaping the media is not overblown, and it’s not going away.

What’s next?

On Wednesday, Zuckerberg will sit down with those “leading conservatives,” and they’ll probably all come away making noises about a “productive discussion” and the need for “ongoing dialogue.” Meanwhile, other conservatives will dismiss the meetings and continue railing against Facebook, saying things like “the bias runs too deep.” At some point, Facebook will probably announce some sort of changes to its trending news module so that it can assure people that the problem has been fixed. That is, if there ever really was a problem in the first place, which it will continue to assure people there wasn’t.2016 Annual Florida Chapters Conference

Fevered media speculation about Donald Trump’s psychological motivations and psychiatric diagnosis has recently encouraged mental health professionals to disregard the usual ethical constraints against diagnosing public figures at a distance. They have sponsored several petitions and a Feb. 14 letter to The New York Times suggesting that Mr. Trump is incapable, on psychiatric grounds, of serving as president.

Most amateur diagnosticians have mislabeled President Trump with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. I wrote the criteria that define this disorder, and Mr. Trump doesn’t meet them. He may be a world-class narcissist, but this doesn’t make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder.

Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr. Trump (who is neither).

Bad behavior is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely. Psychiatric name-calling is a misguided way of countering Mr. Trump’s attack on democracy. He can, and should, be appropriately denounced for his ignorance, incompetence, impulsivity and pursuit of dictatorial powers.

His psychological motivations are too obvious to be interesting, and analyzing them will not halt his headlong power grab. The antidote to a dystopic Trumpean dark age is political, not psychological.

The writer, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical College, was chairman of the task force that wrote the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (D.S.M.-IV).The Department of Homeland Security considered — but says it rejected — letting governors in 11 states decide whether to deputize their National Guards to enforce immigration law, including helping to detain and deport unauthorized immigrants.

The memo, first reported by the Associated Press Friday, matches the description of a memo leaked to Vox. The memo lays out several possible policies to help implement President Donald Trump’s executive order regarding border enforcement.

The White House strongly denied the report, calling it “100% not true.” A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security says the memo was a very early draft, and the idea for National Guard mobilization was “never seriously considered.”

A DHS official says memo was "a very early, pre decisional draft... and was never seriously considered by the Department" — Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) February 17, 2017

The memo described by the AP and the memo leaked to Vox were both dated January 25, 2017 — the same day that President Trump signed the executive order in question. That’s consistent with DHS’s statement that it’s an “early draft.”

DHS has not yet formalized its plan to implement the executive order for border enforcement. The memo reported by the AP and posted by Vox appears to still be under consideration in some form, but it’s not clear how substantially it’s been revised.

It’s uncertain whether the National Guard provision has survived in any form — including mobilizing National Guard units for border enforcement, as happened under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Nor is it clear whether any of the other policies considered in the draft memo will be implemented.

But the fact that it was floated at all is still significant. President Trump arrived in office on the promise of a sweeping crackdown on immigration enforcement, and proceeded to sign executive orders that made substantial changes — but didn’t always provide details.

The suggestion to deputize the National Guard indicates that the federal government is trying to think big about what implementing Trump’s vision on immigration would look like — even if it ends up rejecting some of its most aggressive ideas.

Using the National Guard to arrest unauthorized immigrants in the US would be unprecedented

The federal government has signed agreements to deputize other government officials to arrest and detain immigrants before. But those agreements, known as “287(g) agreements” under the provision of federal law that authorizes them, have traditionally been signed with local law enforcement agencies: police departments and sheriff’s offices.

Under George W. Bush, 287(g) agreements allowed police officers to engage in immigration arrests and raids as part of “task forces.” Obama curbed the use of those task forces, which had been widely criticized for inspiring fear in immigrant communities and chilling immigrants’ willingness to report crimes to police, as well as raising constitutional concerns about local versus federal authority.

It’s been widely expected that the Trump administration would start deputizing local police to start enforcing immigration law again.

But deputizing National Guard members to do so would have gone much farther — and could raise questions about posse comitatus, which is intended to draw a sharp line between the military and domestic law enforcement.

According to the draft memo, the National Guard option would be given to governors in “states adjacent to the land border with Mexico and […] those states adjoining such border States,” per the draft memo. As the AP has pointed out, this covers 11 states — from Oregon in the Northwest to Louisiana in the Southeast.

Here’s the relevant passage from the memo:

I am directing the Commissioner of CBP and the Director of ICE to immediately engage with the Governors of the States adjacent to the land border with Mexico and to those states adjoining such border States for the purpose of entering into agreements of section 287(g) of the INA to authorize qualified members of the state National Guard, while such members are not in federal service, or qualified members of a state militia or state defense force under the command of the Governor, to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the apprehension, investigation and detention of aliens in the United States.

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) has the story. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — Republican leaders in Congress refused to commit Tuesday to opening an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, suggesting instead that ongoing probes of Russian influence in the 2016 elections have the authority to investigate Flynn if warranted.

"The Intelligence Committee is already looking at Russian involvement in our election," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "They can look into whatever they choose to."

Flynn acknowledged in his resignation letter that he had not fully informed Vice President Pence of his conversations with the Russian ambassador before Trump was sworn in. Pence had gone on television to defend Flynn, saying Flynn had not discussed U.S. sanctions in his calls with ambassador Sergey Kislyak. It appears that was not correct, and Flynn did discuss sanctions on the calls.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said there are "a number of unanswered questions" that the panel will be looking at in regard to Flynn. He said the committee would be talking about those questions later this week, possibly as early as later Tuesday.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told the Dallas Morning News that the intelligence committees were the appropriate place for such a probe, and having Flynn testify "would certainly be an option."

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was more circumspect earlier in the day, declining to endorse an investigation of Flynn. "I think we need to get all of that information before we prejudge anything," he told reporters.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer, asked by reporters about possible congressional investigations, said the White House would comply with the law, but he did not commit to cooperating with a congressional probe.

"I think the president feels very confident the review that was conducted by White House counsel was very thorough and concluded ... that there was nothing wrong," Spicer said. "People are free to do what they wish, but i think they will find exactly what the president first believed and what the White House counsel concluded."

The House Intelligence Committee is also looking into Russian tampering, and Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said Tuesday, "alleged contacts and any others the Trump campaign may have had with the Kremlin are the subject of the House Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation. Moreover, the Trump Administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn's conversations with the Ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the President or any other officials, or with their knowledge."

Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., did not commit to investigating Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador, but Nunes spokesman Jack Langer said the panel "will continue to investigate any intelligence or counter-intelligence issues involving Russia and follow the facts wherever they lead."

North Carolina Republican Reps. Mark Meadows and Mark Walker, members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, both suggested an investigation of Flynn may be premature during C-SPAN appearances on Tuesday morning.

“Perhaps there was some inappropriate conversations that took place but, yet in terms of actually violating and going deeper is not something I would support,” Meadows said.

Walker agreed. “I have not seen the evidence that there is any kind of collaboration that would require an investigation at this point,” he said.

Even Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who has not hesitated to criticize the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia, was not yet ready to call for a separate probe of Flynn. "It’s too early yet to draw conclusions except that there are serious questions that need to be answered," McCain told reporters Tuesday.

But Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which Meadows chairs, said Tuesday, "I want the Intelligence Committee to look into it." He said that if Nunes is not pursuing an investigation, "maybe he’s already looked at the transcripts (of Flynn's calls) and realized there is no there there.”

Meanwhile, Democrats tried to force investigations in other venues.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal violations.

He said it is not enough for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the Flynn incident because they have no legal authority to prosecute anyone.

Schumer said Attorney General Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from the investigation because Justice Department rules prohibit someone with political ties to the people being investigated to conduct the investigation. He pointed out that Sessions was involved in Trump's presidential campaign, serving as a national security adviser.

"Jeff Sessions cannot be the person to lead that investigation," Schumer said. "I expect Attorney General Sessions will recuse himself and make sure a thorough and independent investigation proceeds."

"There needs to be an independent and transparent investigation, because the White House knew for weeks that General Flynn misled the vice president, and yet they let him stay on for weeks, participating in the highest levels of national security discussions," Schumer said. "If an investigation is not independent, non-partisan and, most of all, transparent, there is no guarantee this administration will ... take the decisive actions needed to keep us safe."

Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called for full classified briefings this week.

“We in Congress need to know who authorized his actions, permitted them, and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks. We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,” they said in a statement released Tuesday night.

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said, "Now more than ever, we need an independent commission to fully investigate Russia's interference with the election and any potential Trump campaign ties to the Kremlin.

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley of New York said Flynn’s resignation “is not the end of our investigation into Russia’s influence over President Trump, but the beginning. This is much larger than Flynn ... the real question is, what did President Trump know and when did he know it? Did the president order Flynn to call the Russians?"

Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement Tuesday, “Nothing about this resignation, or resignations that could occur in the future, precludes the Senate Intelligence Committee from continuing to investigate Gen. Flynn, or any other campaign official who may have had inappropriate and improper contacts with Russian officials prior to the election.”

Then, before anyone had a chance to review Between, Toni Morrison had anointed the younger writer, via blurb, as having finally filled the “intellectual void” left behind by Baldwin.

Related Stories The Hard Truths of Ta-Nehisi Coates

There’s much beyond this brand of public relations to link Between the World and Me and The Fire Next Time — after all, the books share a perennially important theme: the abiding problem of the color line, and the cost of that problem to black and white Americans alike. But the differences between the two (leaving aside any tedious descent into which is better, a conversation better left to some middlebrow barbershop) are actually more revealing than the similarities. Despite Coates’s stated desire to write in Baldwin’s inimitable “way,” the two men actually deploy opposing styles — Coates the rapper, Baldwin the reverend — in a manner that has something to tell us about how the rhetoric and attitude of the fight for freedom have changed in the last 50 years.

The thing to remember about Baldwin is that he was always — at least since adolescence — a skillful, if sometimes unbelieving, preacher. Indeed, religion — the hypocrisy of Western Christianity, the moral and logical limits of black nationalist Islam — is one of the great themes of The Fire Next Time, beginning with Baldwin’s time as as a popular “Young Minister” in Harlem. He describes the ecstasy he sometimes felt before the congregation: “Nothing that has happened to me since equals the power and the glory that I sometimes felt when, in the middle of a sermon, I knew that I was somehow, by some miracle, really carrying, as they said, ‘the Word’ — when the church and I were one.”

Talk of this kind of unifying self-transcendence is as old as America itself, from John Winthrop and Jonathan Edwards down through Whitman, Emerson, and, later, Melville, who, under the thrall of a kind of nationalist paganism, created the language and philosophical outlook that informed — and continues to inform — our particular American religion. That religion, despite claims to the contrary, is not Christianity, not really. Instead, it’s a hybrid mix of Puritan-descended certainties regarding causality — good fortune as indicative of virtue, hard work as guarantee of future spoils — and a potent, if basically insane, belief in the power of self invention. That belief has often found expression in long, wavelike sentences, built with short, frank Germanic words, forming a topography of the American self-image: compulsively — almost unwittingly — forthcoming, searching to and fro and to again for an identity that might match our endless capacity for growth.

The Baldwin who loves these American transcendentalists is the Baldwin who sometimes sounds like an earnest but pragmatic exceptionalist, who writes sentences like these: “If we — and now I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious blacks, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of the others — do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world.”

The source of another species of long Baldwin sentence (by contemporary standards, almost all of Baldwin’s sentences are long) is Henry James. In his wide-ranging “Art of Fiction” interview with The Paris Review, Baldwin admitted to having learned narratorial control from James: “This is where Henry James helped me,” he said, recounting the process of writing his debut novel Go Tell It on the Mountain, “with his whole idea about the center of consciousness and using a single intelligence to tell the story.” That intelligence, in Baldwin as well as in James, is uncannily precise, and often unsparing on the topic of its country and those who make it up.

Baldwin’s Jamesian sentences are long, but long because they are almost legal in intent: Each dependent clause hedges, qualifies, clarifies, and eliminates room for specious readings. (Coates recently tweeted his admiration of these rhetorical feats.) When Baldwin finally hits the period, his meaning is bare, and the only option left to the reader is to decide whether to agree.

The sum of these influences is the quintessential Baldwin — hot in the heart but cold in the eye, fully American while also fully aware of America, simultaneously observer and observed.

Coates, an avowed and lifelong atheist, is the Native Tongues–era emcee to Baldwin’s preacher. In Between the World and Me, there is no sanctuary, literal or figurative, but there’s always a mic somewhere close at hand. When he admits to his son that “[f]ear ruled everything around me,” he is, sure, relaying a set of facts about his life in Baltimore, but he is also echoing the song that laid bare the essentials of capitalism for an entire generation. The highly stylized — even mythologized — evocations of the violence of Coates’s youth read like prose renditions of songs from Nas’s Illmatic. And, like the rappers of his youth, Coates writes downhill, rolling toward punch lines. Here he is, for example, on murderous police: “The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions.” And, again, on the diaspora as witnessed at Howard: “I remember those days like an OutKast song, painted in lust and joy.” And on watching his future wife smoke a blunt: “I was lost and running and wondering what it must be to embrace her, to be exhaled by her, to return to her, and leave her high.” Each the kind of line one designs to shut down the cipher. Great rap albums create and then employ new languages, languages which, upon relistening, echo from bar to bar and track to track. Hence Coates’s repeated intonations of “the Dreamers” and “the people who believe that they are white” (a Baldwinism), of “plunder” and, especially, the body.

Another huge, controlling influence on Coates is the Black Arts movement of the 1960s and ’70s. That short-lived burst of intellect and art, born of Black Power and various attempts at a working Afrocentrism, was led by poets like Amiri Baraka and Sonia Sanchez, both of whom provide section-leading epigraphs for Coates’s letter. Coates’s reminiscences of Howard University — or “The Mecca,” as he calls its spiritual alter-ego — are full of loving meditations on the infinite expressions of blackness, each a tender little catalogue of hues and styles and diasporic origins. This kind of unembarrassed racial wonder — and a correspondingly lush and deeply felt rendering of that wonder — is classic Black Arts. The lines from Baraka’s poem “Ka ’Ba,” which Coates quotes before BTWAM’s second section — “We are beautiful people / with african imagination / full of masks and dances and swelling chants / with african eyes, and noses, and arms, / though we sprawl in grey chains in a place / full of winters, / when what we want is sun” — are direct ancestors to lines like these, from Coates’s description of the Yard at Howard: “There were the scions of Nigerian aristocrats in their business suits giving dap to bald-headed Qs in purple windbreakers and tan Timbs. There were the high-yellow progeny of AME preachers debating the clerics of Ausar-Set. There were California girls turned Muslim, born anew, in hijab and long skirt … It was like listening to a hundred different renditions of ‘Redemption Song,’ each in a different color and key.” Where Baldwin directs his attention to what black Americans might mean — and therefore, what they might achieve, and, until achievement, be able to withstand — amid the larger American scheme, Coates’s interest, like Baraka’s, is on the beauty of black people alone, especially insofar as that beauty points to a contrast with the wider world, not a synthesis. Coates describes how, through the tough disillusioning work of his history professors at Howard, he shed the extreme black particularism of his youth — gained the honest way, from his ex-Panther father — but that impulse continues to nourish him aesthetically: BTWAM is, at least in part, a love letter to black people in America and abroad whose “dark energies” are Coates’s energies, too.

Hip-hop and Black Arts make Coates’s prose purpler than Baldwin’s, more lyrical and less precise — he has meaning to convey, but also a beat to keep. If Baldwin — in Fire and elsewhere — is an essentially argumentative writer, aiming, alternately, to exhort and cajole and remind and convince, Coates’s terrain is the experiential and emotional. Here is the feeling, says Coates, of a life lived within the parameters of terror; here is the sound of the percussion of the world against my life.

This, I think, is what we are really talking about when we talk about the matter of “hope,” especially with respect to Coates. So much of the criticism of his work returns to the question of whether he’s too negative, or warrantlessly fatalist, but this is a kind of category error. Baldwin, no doubt compelled on some level by the Christianity whose dogma he eventually rejected but whose air he breathed for too long to fully forget, felt a duty in his writing to stretch toward some better racial understanding, however asymptotically. Under no illusion as to the difficulty of the task, he shouldered it anyway: “I know that what I am asking is impossible,” he says toward the end of The Fire Next Time, “But in our time, as in every time, the impossible is the least that one can demand — and one is, after all, emboldened by the spectacle of human history in general, and American Negro history in particular, for it testifies to nothing less than the perpetual achievement of the possible.” Here Baldwin’s Emersonian streak reads as almost strategic. The rhetoric of illimitable potential makes way for the actual and the practical, no matter how painstakingly achieved.

Coates, with the benefit of having witnessed the almost 30 years of fits and false starts since Baldwin’s death, feels no such responsibility. His materialism — with so much repeated emphasis on the “body” — is more than a metaphysics: It is a guide for the conservation of precious energy. Because the body is finite, time is of the most urgent importance. Because the body is fragile, why weight it with impossible burdens? Coates is not opposed to protest or activism — he’s adamant on the necessity of “struggle” — but he refuses to expect transcendence, having witnessed none so far.

This obsession with corporeality — and, by extension, with limits — has a discomfiting salience to our time. The impetus behind the political moment that stretches roughly from Trayvon to today has been chiefly technological: Suddenly, via smartphone, we see lives turned to corpses on a seemingly endless loop. That this kind of rough and weirdly fetishizing visual evidence is what has been needed, finally, to bring police violence to the fore of the public consciousness is slightly depressing, and maybe indicative of the outer limits of rhetorical power in the 21st century.

The civil-rights movement that borrowed so much of Baldwin’s intellectual force was powered on ideas: Christian brotherhood, post-Enlightenment notions of freedom, the counter-Colonialism that swept Africa throughout the ’60s and put America to shame. Today it sometimes seems that ideas have lost that ability to charge and to chasten. It seems we need to see a body.Global Nomads Group

In November 2015, middle school students from Westchester County, New York, found themselves on a windswept field in South Sudan mingling with a crowd of refugees fleeing civil war. Suddenly, they heard the deafening roar of low-flying military cargo planes overhead, followed by large bags of grain thudding to the ground all around them.

“The kids were jumping back from those bags dropping at their feet,” recalled Cayne Letizia, the teacher who used immersive virtual reality to transport his class into this emergency food drop featured in the New York Times’ 360-degree video series about refugees. Count Letizia among VR’s burgeoning fan base in education, where the spread of high-quality content and more affordable hardware (especially Google’s $15 Cardboard viewer) give students myriad ways to briefly inhabit what they’re learning—from wandering the streets of ancient Rome to touring the International Space Station.

“So much of the technology our kids use removes empathy. [Virtual reality] breaks that distance down.”

Education researchers caution that immersive VR, like any technology, may be perfect for some kinds of learning and superfluous, or even counterproductive, for others. Studies of immersive classroom VR are still scarce. But emerging evidence suggests that one of VR’s biggest strengths is its ability to tap student emotions, notably empathy and the can-do confidence known as self-efficacy.

The power of VR to stoke empathy is the focus of research at Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, led by communications professor Jeremy Bailenson. In the lab’s “Empathy at Scale” studies, people who inhabit avatars of a different race in a virtual world later score lower in tests of subconscious racial bias, and young people who “wear” an elderly avatar are then more inclined to save for retirement. Charities, including the International Red Cross, have made VR films to counteract “compassion fatigue” and boost donations.

Empathy isn’t a subject in most schools, and it’s not an explicit part of the Common Core standards, noted Letizia, an English teacher who parlayed the emotional connections of immersion into reading and writing lessons in the power of narrative and authorial point of view. Still, he thinks empathy needs to be taught, especially (and perhaps ironically) due to how much time we spend interacting digitally.

“My students live and die by their phones. They ‘like’ somebody’s Snapchat and move on. It’s so temporary and removed,” he said. “So much of the technology our kids use removes empathy. But in this case, by placing kids in the moment, [VR] breaks that distance down.”

Another middle school teacher who dropped his students into the virtual lives of refugees was Charles Herzog in Londonderry, Vermont, whose class tried VR in December near the end of a unit about forced migration. The Google Cardboard viewers that Herzog’s students used were bought by his partner in the project, the Tarrant Institute for Innovative Education at the University of Vermont. According to Tarrant’s professional development coordinator, Rachel Mark, empathy education fits into Vermont’s required “Transferable Skills,” specifically “Responsible and Involved Citizenship,” which includes the ability to “demonstrate ethical behavior and the moral courage to sustain it.”

Mark’s blog post about teaching empathy mentions both the refugee VR video and one about the lives of police in Flint, Michigan. “In other forms of media, people may see conflicts as black and white,” she said. “By bringing in the perspective of human beings living through this, it might make you, as a fellow human being, reconsider the topic through someone else’s eyes.”

That’s the idea behind a new VR-based curriculum called “One World, Many Stories” by the nonprofit Global Nomads Group, which produced a series of 360-degree autobiographical videos from the perspective of a boy in eastern Kentucky; a young man in Amman, Jordan; and a young black woman in New York City.

Last fall, when Daniel Gross, a sixth-grade teacher in Los Altos, California, heard about “One World, Many Voices,” he jumped at the chance to pilot it. “We discuss current events on a weekly basis,” said Gross, “and inevitably that ends up with us talking about perspective-taking and empathizing with others.”

The four-minute dips into the lives of these young people are interwoven with paper-and-pencil class activities and discussions about the mix of individual and communal identities and the importance of perspective. A post-VR worksheet, for instance, asks students what preconceived ideas they had about the people in each video that were either bolstered or changed after being immersed in their worlds. Finally, students storyboard the scenes that they would include in their own 360-degree videos.

“We have always used technology to help connect young people who would otherwise not have a way to connect, to promote global awareness, curiosity, and critical thinking,” said Abigail Finck, the marketing manager for Global Nomads. For more than a decade, the nonprofit has fostered discussions between young people from different cultures via webcasts, and one of these—a 2015 exchange between teenagers in South Los Angeles and Syrian refugees living in Amman, Jordan—first showed the potential of VR to further Global Nomad’s mission. Before the two groups met online, the kids from Los Angeles visited the lab of VR pioneer Nonny de la Peña to walk a mile through a simulation of war-torn Aleppo, Syria.

When the students finally did sit for their webchat, along with translators, the two groups of young people soon felt comfortable enough with each other that the discussion moved from the violence afflicting Syria to the “food deserts” of the inner-city neighborhood where the Los Angeles students lived.

“The refugees asked, ‘Why don’t you have a garden?’ ” Finck recalled. “ ‘We don’t have a home, but of course we have a garden, because that’s how we survive.’ ” Soon after, the students from Los Angeles started a community garden at their school.

In addition to sparking connections with others, there is evidence to suggest that embodying a VR avatar can change a student’s self-perception as well.

“I believe that immersion is very important and powerful, which is why I started working in it 25 years ago,” said Chris Dede, a professor of learning technologies at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education who is editing a book about VR and learning. “But VR isn’t magic. It’s a very specialized tool.”

Dede’s research focuses on both VR and less-immersive augmented reality for science learning. On the fully immersive end of the spectrum, Dede and his team created a VR science game called EcoMUVE, in which students are immersed in a pond or forest ecosystem where they have to solve the mystery of a species collapse. Studies of EcoMUVE indicate that spending time working as a scientist in a virtual world may bolster a student’s confidence in her ability to be a scientist in the real world.

“We’re not just interested in what students are learning intellectually, but also in their degree of engagement and self-efficacy, so when the going gets tough, they will have confidence in themselves and keep trying,” said Dede. “In our virtual ecosystems, we want to help students believe that they, too, can be ecosystem scientists.”President Uhuru’s government is not taking chances with social media and the blogosphere – an area it has dominated since romping to power – with revelations that it has hired 36 ‘bloggers’ to manage its online presence.

To deal with the opposition, the government has also hired 13 hackers.

The Jubilee government has lost much of the enthusiasm among young people which peaked during the 2013 election and immediately after but which has since dwindled as the stark reality of governance faces up with pomposity of lofty campaign pledges.

Top blogger Joseph Githu has gone rogue of late with his continuous faulting of the Uhuru regime non delivery of essential services to Jubilee backyard.

The 36 bloggers are said to be working under an expanded digital unit of the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit (PSCU) and will work under Blogger-In-Chief Dennis Itumbi.

They will all be operating from Office of the deputy president William Ruto and NOT STATEHOUSE.

With the hiring of the 36 bloggers it is expected that CORD Bloggers will NOT be harassed by state agencies since the 36 can overrun the CORD bloggers anytime.

The recruits will be joining the likes of Edith Wambui Fortune, Thuku, Mastanga, Omosa, Wainaina, Opiyo, Kowar, Onyango Ogure among others.

The Associated Press (along with Japan Times and the Voice of America’s China Service) reports that President Trump, “after suffering rejection after rejection in China’s courts,” has finally gotten something “that he has been trying to get from China for a decade: trademark rights to his own name.”

In 2006, Trump applied for a trademark for “Trump” in connection with a company providing construction services in China. China’s Trademark Office rejected the application, on the grounds that someone else (Dong Wei) had filed a similar application about two weeks earlier, and had priority under China’s first-come-first-served trademark rule.*

* There are, apparently, more than 200 other “Trump” marks on the Chinese trademark register — for everything from Trump toilets to Trump pacemakers, Trump condoms and even a “Trump International Hotel” — that have been claimed by persons other than Trump (or any of the Trump Organizations). This, as all good trademark nerds will recognize, is a concrete illustration of a common problem in “first-to-file” jurisdictions, where it can be relatively easy to “reserve” a mark by filing an application, without evidence that you are actually using the mark in question.

Trump appealed the adverse ruling to the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board, then to the Beijing Intermediate People’s Court, and finally to the Beijing High People’s Court, but his appeal was rejected at every turn. He also instituted a separate action to invalidate Dong’s trademark, but the Trademark Office, and the Review Board, ruled against him on that one as well.

The latest of these adverse rulings was in May 2015, the month before Trump declared his candidacy for president.

Then, in April 2016, with Trump’s presidential campaign in full swing, Trump’s lawyers went back to the Review Board, and asked it to reconsider its earlier ruling and to invalidate Dong’s trademark.* This time, it worked; On Sept. 6, the Trademark Office announced that it was voiding Dong’s trademark. Trump’s competing mark was then published in China’s Trademark Gazette on Nov. 13 — less than a week after he won the presidential election — and it became effective Tuesday.

* At around this time, Trump also submitted 49 new trademark applications for the “Trump” mark in China in connection with a wide variety of goods and services. Those applications are all still pending.

So there you have it. An agency of the Chinese government has granted our president a valuable benefit, in the form of a trademark for “Trump construction services.”

Let’s review the Constitution, Art. I Sec. 9 (the “foreign emoluments clause”):

No Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States] shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. [emphasis added]

We’ve been hearing a lot about the meaning of “emolument” over the past few weeks, and we will, I predict, be hearing a great deal more in the coming months. Much of the discussion to date has centered on whether a market exchange — the Kuwaiti government, say, renting out the Trump International Ballroom at the going rate for a function there, or China’s state-owned bank renting out an entire floor of Trump Tower in New York City — constitutes an “emolument” under this clause.

Trump’s spokespersons have said that it does not. I think — for the reasons set forth here in a paper by Norm Eisen, Richard Painter and Laurence Tribe — that it does, that the word, as understood in the 1790s, encompassed any “conferral of a benefit or advantage, whether through money, objects, titles, offices, or economically valuable waivers or relaxations of otherwise applicable requirements.”

But put that question aside for the moment. This Chinese trademark matter raises a different issue regarding the meaning of “emolument.” The Chinese government hasn’t engaged in a like-for-like market exchange with Trump; rather, it has conferred a legal benefit that has some, non-trivial value, on him. Is receiving trademark rights a constitutionally-prohibited “emolument … of any kind whatever … from a foreign State”?

I think it is. I’m even willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt here, and to assume that everything that has taken place here is on the up-and-up and strictly by the book, i.e., that there’s been no quid pro quo, that this is simply a case where Trump received a benefit to which he (or anyone similarly situated) would be lawfully entitled under the relevant provisions of Chinese trademark law, and that it is simply a coincidence that, after a number of rejections, the application was approved after Trump was elected president of the United States.

Why do I think this is an “emolument”? The meaning of “emolument” — an “archaic term,” as the Office of Legal Counsel noted in a lengthy analysis, back in 1982, and one that may well have already been somewhat antiquated in the 1790s — is, to be sure, not crystal clear. My Webster’s Unabridged tells me that it comes from the Latin emolumentum, or “gain, profit, or advantage,” and it defines it as “the profit arising from office or employment,” with the “archaic” meaning of “advantage, or gain in general.”

Nobody disputes that it covers gifts; one of the practices that the framers clearly were targeting was the practice of several foreign monarchs — the French King Louis XVI was a particular offender — of giving valuable gifts to officials of the newly-independent United States. (Both Franklin and Jefferson, for example. received diamond-encrusted snuff boxes from the king while they were serving in ambassadorial positions in Paris, and this had become something of a scandal).

But “emoluments” must cover more than just gifts; the Clause already prohibits receiving “present[s],” so by ordinary rules of textual interpretation, “emoluments” must include something additional.

One clue to what it means comes from asking: What were the Founders concerned about? What’s the purpose of this clause (and its sister “domestic emoluments clause” in Art. I Sec. 7)? What’s the harm — a harm serious enough to include in the new Constitution? Why shouldn’t Jefferson be allowed to take a nice snuff box from the French king?

The answer, as Hamilton put it, is that the receipt of the gift would “weaken his fortitude [and] corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice,” giving him a “pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution.” Men are avaricious; give them a nice snuff box and they’ll be more likely to treat you with special favor down the road, perhaps out of a desire not to show ingratitude, perhaps out of a desire to obtain additional valuable gifts, perhaps both. In either case, dealing with the foreign sovereign will be compromised, no longer having the interests of the people of the United States as the sole motivating factor in all decisions and actions.

It’s not bribery, exactly, that we’re trying to prevent in this clause. We don’t need a special constitutional provision prohibiting office-holders from taking bribes, because taking bribes is already illegal under the common law, and it is also one of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” for which office-holders can be impeached.

But it’s a close cousin to bribery; accepting an emolument introduces an improper element — personal gain — into the decision-maker’s calculus, less obviously and overtly than in cases of actual bribery, but no less serious for that.

And that is precisely the situation Trump is now in. He has 49 additional applications pending before the Chinese Trademark Office. He has been given a nice, valuable gift, and he could be forgiven for thinking that other similar gifts could follow (if he behaves himself well).

You might object by saying that it’s not a “gift” at all. Not like those snuff boxes. He’s just been given what he’s legally entitled to — the trademark rights — under Chinese law.

And it’s true, of course, that it is not a gift. He’s legally entitled (as we’re assuming — see above) to the trademark; they’re not giving it to him as a present.

But why should that matter for purposes of the foreign emoluments clause? If France had had a law that gave all visiting Americans a snuff box (if they came at a certain time to the Hotel de Ville and submitted an application), would Jefferson have been able to keep his? Wouldn’t it have been just as troublesome in those circumstances as an outright gift would have been?

With the Trump presidency in crisis mode already and at some risk of unraveling completely, violating the foreign emoluments clause is hardly the most serious charge that can be leveled against the president. If I were sketching an outline of a preliminary Bill of Particulars for an impeachment proceeding, it would certainly not top the list, which might include such more worrisome matters as discussing and displaying classified information in a public restaurant, or running a campaign that may well have been colluding with foreign governments to sabotage the election. But it would be on there somewhere — the violation of an express constitutional prohibition is a serious matter, and I just hope that it is not getting drowned out amidst all the other noise.By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Fearful of President Donald Trump's policies, the Maryland General Assembly empowered the state's Democratic attorney general on Wednesday to sue the federal government without permission from the state's Republican governor.

The House of Delegates voted 89-50 along party lines for a joint resolution already approved by the Senate.

Democrats, who control Maryland's legislature, have noted concerns about potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act as reasons for expanding the attorney general's powers. They also have cited concerns about lax enforcement of federal regulations to protect the Chesapeake Bay, the nation's largest estuary, and how the Trump administration could affect Maryland's large federal workforce.

Maryland's highest court has ruled that unlike more than 40 other attorneys general in the country, the state's attorney general lacks the common-law authority to sue the federal government without permission from either the General Assembly or the governor. The Maryland Defense Act of 2017 would enable the attorney general to sue to protect the health, public safety, civil liberties and economic security of Maryland residents, as well as the environment.

"There is nothing unprecedented about this resolution," said Del. Kirill Reznik, D-Montgomery. "There is nothing unique about this resolution. It simply gives the attorney general the same powers to be able to sue the federal government as 41 other attorneys general. That's it."

But Republicans charged that Democrats were injecting the highly charged partisan politics of Washington into Maryland in an effort to bypass the governor and disrupt checks and balances.

"No one wants the federal government steamrolling Marylanders, steamrolling the Chesapeake Bay," said Del. Nic Kipke, an Anne Arundel County Republican who is the House minority leader. "Our governor would be first in line to defend the interests of Marylanders, I believe."

Amelia Chasse, a spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan, said too many lawmakers are focusing on what might happen in Washington and not enough time focusing on Maryland. Hogan, who did not support Trump and said he didn't vote for him, has avoided taking positions on Trump's actions, saying he's focused on Maryland.

"Marylanders don't want Washington-style party politics in their state capital, and if the past two weeks has taught us anything, we need a lot fewer talking heads in Annapolis and a lot more action," Chasse said.

The Senate approved the resolution 29-17 last week, with all of the chamber's 14 Republicans opposing it. Nine Senate Republicans walked out of the chamber in a rare show of protest during a debate, because a request to delay action on the fast-tracked resolution for a day was rejected.

Attorney General Brian Frosh sought to file his own lawsuit to protect Marylanders against Trump's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, rather than an amicus brief that expressed support for states' actions.

He asked the governor for permission on Feb. 1, but his office said he never received a final response. Chasse said the governor's lawyers had follow-up questions about filing a separate Maryland lawsuit. She said the attorney general then filed the amicus brief without telling the governor's office, which assumed he had decided to go that route in court.

Unlike a regular bill, a joint resolution cannot be vetoed by the governor.Hi members! To get your ad-free podcasts and bonus audio content, follow the directions below. Click on a Quick Link to find what you need, or take our Baby Steps tutorial for a complete walk-through.

Girls, the sixth and final season of which began Sunday night, arrived on the scene in 2012 with a bang—if you can use that word to describe what Adam and Hannah did together on that dingy Brooklyn couch. From that cringingly unromantic encounter through the dozens of awkward hookups and one infamous rim job that followed, this show pioneered a certain kind of naturalistic, unsexy millennial sex scene. So to send off this show in the manner it so richly deserves, we’ve ranked every sex scene on the show, up to this season’s premiere, according to how Girls it was. You’re welcome.

It was necessary to draw up some parameters to make this highly intensive, very scientific project feasible, so before we begin, a few notes on methodology: This list is limited to acts or attempted acts of manual stimulation and vaginal, oral, and anal sex. This means several makeouts, some of which included generous second-base action, did not make the cut. Apologies to the time Shoshanna made out with a doorman and Marnie, Jessa, and Thomas John’s almost-threesome.

Screencap from HBO

46. Season 5, Episode 10, Desi and a groupie

Position or act: Fellatio

Circumstances of sex: Desi gets a blow job from a very young-looking groupie in his dressing room while Marnie and Ray angrily beg him to open the door.

Millennial awkwardness: Hardly awkward at all. What would pass for scandalous on another show barely registers on Girls. Nothing we haven’t seen in a thousand other storylines about male musicians with Peter Pan complexes.

45. Season 5, Episode 4, Elijah and Dill

Position or act: Missionary anal

Circumstances of sex: Elijah and Dill’s first time together—Elijah’s on top of him, and they face each other on a bed—comes with a lot of instructions from hunky Dill Harcourt (Corey Stoll), who has very specific thoughts on how fast Elijah should be going. Bossy!

Millennial awkwardness: Dill isn’t a millennial, and for Girls, speed instructions are not particularly awkward. Wait until one of the people tells the other to pretend he’s a prostitute junkie and we’ll talk.

Screencap from HBO

44. Season 3, Episode 1, Hannah and Adam

Position or act: Cowgirl/lotus

Circumstances of sex: After being broken up for most of Season 2, Hannah and Adam are back at it, complete with Adam’s grunts and Hannah’s flailing.

Millennial awkwardness: How can such a comprehensively nude scene (Hannah chats with Adam for a while topless after they finish) be ranked so low here? All we can say is you get used to the sight of Lena Dunham’s breasts. Also, both parties seemed to be enjoying the sex equally, which is also pretty un-Girls.

43. Season 3, Episode 11, Hannah and Adam

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Hannah and Adam are temporarily living apart so Adam can focus on a play he’s acting in, but he still makes time for booty calls.

Millennial awkwardness: More of Hannah’s boobs, of course. In this scene, we also get to see Adam rolling off her and ripping off the condom, something of an Adam Driver signature move, and we sense the trouble ahead when Hannah asks afterward, “Wait, so you’re just gonna leave?”

42. Season 4, Episode 6, Marnie and Desi

Position or act: Standing against a wall

Circumstances of sex: Marnie and Desi, who are trying to make it as a singing duo together while being together-together, have sex in the narrow hallway of Marnie’s apartment, with her up against the wall.

Millennial awkwardness: The most awkward part is that they’re playing one of their own songs while they do it, which is surely the right backdrop for Marnie’s performative moans.

41. Season 6, Episode 1, Marnie and Ray

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Marnie is divorcing Desi and back with Ray, officially this time.

Millennial awkwardness: The sex itself is tame for Girls—no nudity—and Marie climbs right out of bed and heads into her kitchen, which is approximately two feet away. “Sorry, I just have a million things going on,” she says. Ray answers, “That’s OK, I’ve got a bunch of reading for pleasure to do,” before pulling out a copy of A Little Life. That part, at least, is very Girls.

40. Season 5, Episode 3, Hannah and Fran

Position or act: Cowgirl/lotus

Circumstances of sex: Fran is sitting on the couch with Hannah on top of him, you guessed it, shirtless. She’s mad at him but trying not to acknowledge it.

Millennial awkwardness: She won’t look at him, and he says, “I feel like you’re not really here right now.” She’s pissed that he keeps dirty pictures of his exes on his phone. They have sex anyway.

Advertisement



39. Season 4, Episode 9, Jessa and Ace

Position or act: Cowgirl/lotus

Circumstances of sex: This is the only time we see Jessa have sex with Zachary Quinto’s Ace, the guy who used to date Mimi-Rose (Gillian Jacobs), who is now dating Adam.

Millennial awkwardness: They’re in bed, Jessa is wearing a netted bra you can see her nipples through, and she tells him, “You look like a teacher I had in the fourth grade. I thought I wanted my mom to marry him, but I realize now I just wanted to fuck him.” Par for the course for this show and for Jessa in particular.

38. Season 4, Episode 1, Hannah and Adam

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: The two have quiet, passionless, routine sex on their last night together before Hannah goes off to graduate school and an unknown future.

Millennial awkwardness: On Girls, where sex is usually full of noises and dialogue, quiet sex speaks volumes about the state of the relationship of the couple who’s having it.

37. Season 5, Episode 1, Hannah and Fran

Position or act: Cowgirl/lotus

Circumstances of sex: Hannah, bare-chested as ever, is on top of Fran in the front seat of a car at Marnie’s wedding.

Millennial awkwardness: The gag about Hannah having no idea how to put her bridesmaid dress halter top back on afterward is funny in a very Girls-ian way. But this scene is less about the sex than about using sex as an engine to drive the plot, so Hannah can demonstrate how frustrated she is with Marnie’s bridezilla behavior and Fran can reveal that Desi has been engaged seven other times.

Screencap from HBO

36. Season 1, Episode 5, Jessa and her ex-boyfriend

Position or act: Doggy

Circumstances of sex: Jessa bursts into her apartment and has sex with her ex against a window, even though her ex was just telling her about his new partner. She refuses to kiss him afterward.

Millennial awkwardness: In all the rush to get it done, Jessa fails to notice that Shoshanna is home, and though she calls her a “batshit little perv” for watching, she treats it as a teachable moment: “That was me showing that I cannot be smoted. I am unsmoteable.”

35. Season 5, Episode 7, Elijah and Dill

Position or act: Fellatio

Circumstances of sex: Dill shows up drunk at Elijah’s place and starts to give him a blow job.

Millennial awkwardness: Dill falls asleep down there instead of finishing. A good lesson on the perils of drunk sex.

34. Season 5, Episode 6, Marnie and Charlie

Position or act: Cowgirl

Circumstances of sex: Marnie reunites with Charlie after running into him years after their breakup, even though she’s married now.

Millennial awkwardness: After a whirlwind adventure around the city, Charlie brings Marnie back to his scuzzy apartment (he doesn’t even have his own bathroom), and they do it in his bed. A scene more notable for its context than for the specifics of the sex itself.

33. Season 1, Episode 2, Jessa and a guy she meets at a bar

Position or act: Digital stimulation

Circumstances of sex: Avoiding going to the clinic for an abortion, Jessa needs something to take her mind off of it and picks up a stranger.

Millennial awkwardness: They make out, and she orders him, “put your hands down my pants.” “Is that OK?” he asks. “Don’t ask me that ever again in my life,” she answers. No sooner does than that he reveal to her that she’s bleeding—her period has arrived. Theoretically the awkwardness level is high, but Jessa is so blazingly confident that it all feels smoothly executed anyway.

32. Season 2, Episode 10, Marnie and Charlie

Position or act: Cunnilingus

Circumstances of sex: After being broken up for the better part of a season, Marnie and Charlie are back together, and Charlie is going down on her in his apartment.

Millennial awkwardness: “You have no idea how good this feels,” Marnie says. “When did you get so good at this? Seriously. When did you get so good at this. How many people have you slept with since we broke up?” Not the most comfortable discussion, nor the ideal time to raise it.

31. Season 3, Episode 5, Marnie and Ray

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Marnie visits Ray amid a moment of existential confusion and asks him to tell her what’s wrong with her. He explains to her that she is a “big, fat fucking phony.” Marnie appreciates the candor. They have sex on Ray’s table.

Millennial awkwardness: Marnie hastily tries to pull down his pants and asks, “How many pairs of underwear do you wear?” His shirt stays on, such is the rush they’re in. As Marie’s leaving afterward, Ray suggests that maybe they should keep their hookup on the DL, to which Marnie responds, “Go fuck yourself. Like I’d advertise this.” A hate-sex coupling for the ages is born.

30. Season 5, Episode 5, Jessa and Adam

Position or act: Spooning? Missionary? It’s a little hard to tell what’s going on here.

Circumstances of sex: After a painfully awkward first time together, Jessa and Adam start to find their groove.

Millennial awkwardness: This of course includes lots of smacking noises and dirty talk. Jessa confusingly requests, “After you come, pretend like you meant to pull out, and then you’re gonna freak out like you might have gotten me pregnant.” Adam does as directed, and Jessa play-acts, “What am I gonna tell my parents?” To which Adam one-ups her: “What the fuck am I gonna tell coach?”

29. Season 2, Episode 9, Marnie and Charlie

Position or act: Standing

Circumstances of sex: In the time since they broke up and now, Charlie has become a hot rich tech douche. After a memorable performance of “Stronger” at his office party, Marnie remarks on their change of fortunes and how lost she feels, and before long they’re doing it on a desk.

Millennial awkwardness: Marnie worries that his co-workers will see them. “Who gives a fuck?” he answers. This clearly isn’t the same Charlie Marnie broke up with last year for being a wuss.

28. Season 3, Episode 6, Marnie and Ray

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Marnie and Ray have more hate sex. Marnie asks him if he’s ever seen reality TV, to which he responds that he’s seen the Ken Burns jazz documentary about 17 times—a fitting metaphor for how different these two are.

Millennial awkwardness: In bed, the two are shown from above, Ray’s bare butt exposed to the camera, and Marnie can barely look at him. Peak awkwardness is achieved when Ray says, “Marnie, I think I slipped out.”

27. Season 5, Episode 4, Jessa and Adam

Position or act: Cowgirl; missionary

Circumstances of sex: Jessa and Adam have been trying really hard not to become a couple, but they finally give in.

Millennial awkwardness: It’s their first time doing it after lots of buildup, and it doesn’t go well. They keep stopping each other and switching positions, and eventually Adam says, “Is this what bad sex is like?” Strangely enough, it doesn’t seem all that different from a lot of the sex on the show.

26. Season 3, Episode 11, Marnie and Ray

Position or act: Cowgirl

Circumstances of sex: Hannah hears moans coming from Ray’s room, and despite Adam’s protests, opens the door and catches Marnie and Ray in flagrante, her boob only covered by his head. (The two had up till then managed to keep their hate-sex alliance a secret.)

Millennial awkwardness: We don’t know if the sex itself was awkward, but the fallout sure was. Hannah screams, and Ray says, “What the fuck are you doing?” Hannah commands him to “Put your dick away.” From the other side of Ray, Marnie half-heartedly yelps, “He made me.”

25. Season 3, Episode 10, Hannah and Adam

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Worried that their sex life has grown stale, Hannah tries out role-play. Wearing a blond wig and using an old-timey accent, she brings Adam to Marnie’s apartment and declares, “This is where my husband puts me.”

Millennial awkwardness: Adam plays along, and she undresses to reveal some very complicated lingerie. He also has some very specific instructions for how she should eat strawberries. When they’re actually having intercourse, Hannah changes course and says, “I usually fuck football players, but now I’m fucking the school weirdo. And I’m a cheerleader, and you’ve thought so much about fucking me before.” Adam is thrown (“it doesn’t make any fuckin’ narrative sense”). It doesn’t go well.

24. Season 2, Episode 7, Hannah and Frank

Position: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Hannah is visiting Jessa’s family in the country, where she meets her strange stepbrother, Frank.

Millennial awkwardness: “Are you 18?” Hannah asks Frank when he suddenly kisses her. “No, I’m 19,” he responds, and they have sex in some grass. Afterward, Hannah tells Jessa, “I just had sex with Frank. It lasted for like eight seconds.” For the rest of the episode, she struggles with a urinary tract infection.

23. Season 2, Episode 10, Shoshanna and Ray

Position or act: Spooning

Circumstances of sex: Not all is well in Ray and Shoshanna–land after a season of stops and starts, as she worries that he doesn’t have enough ambition.

Millennial awkwardness: They’re both lying on their sides in bed so he can’t see how uncomfortable she looks as he gropes one of her boobs over her zip-up sweatshirt. She tells him he can finish, and he’s says he won’t finish unless she does. She says he’s being weird, he says she’s being weird, and finally she says, “Will you get out of me?” He does.

22. Season 1, Episode 2. Marnie and Charlie

Position or act: Missionary; doggy

Circumstances of sex: Marnie and Charlie’s long-term–relationship sex life doesn’t seem much better than Hannah and Adam’s new thing, mostly owing to the fact that Marnie can’t stand Charlie.

Millennial awkwardness: As a candle burns on the nightstand, Charlie tells Marnie he wants them to look at each other when they come. Marnie is bored and repulsed and suggests doggy instead, which Charlie thought she hated because it makes her feel like a piggy bank. “No, I said it makes me look like a piggy bank,” she clarifies, annoyed. Meanwhile, he is so enjoying himself that he says “foak!” with a long o instead of fuck.

Screencap from HBO

21. Season 2, Episode 1, Hannah and Sandy

Position or act: Cowgirl/lotus

Circumstances of sex: It’s a new season, and Hannah has a new boyfriend, Sandy, played by Donald Glover. He’s a black Republican and a breath of fresh air from a convalescing Adam.

Millennial awkwardness: She is shirtless as usual, and, in terms of Girls-ness, their dialogue feels like a message to the viewer and a provocation to critics as a new season of a much-discussed show was kicking off, now with a person of color finally on screen: “You wanted this,” Sandy says. “I wanted this so bad,” Hannah responds. “And now you’re getting it,” he says. “Now I’m finally getting it,” she agrees. “It’s about fucking time,” he says.

20. Season 1, Episode 5, Marnie and Charlie

Position or act: Cowgirl

Circumstances of sex: After a fight, Marnie visits Charlie, intending to win him back. All he asks is that she not abandon him.

Millennial awkwardness: The mid–sexual encounter breakup is a Girls specialty. She’s on top of him and their heads are close together, but when he says “I love you,” she pulls away and bumps her head on the top of the bed’s loft. “I wanna break up,” she says.

19. Season 1, Episode 2, Hannah and Adam

Position or act: Missionary; masturbation

Circumstances of sex: Hannah and Adam’s second on-screen sexual encounter in the series.

Millennial awkwardness: Oddly specific dirty talk: Adam tells Hannah he knew she wanted it like this when he found her as an 11-year-old junkie in the street with a Cabbage Patch lunchbox. “You’re a dirty little whore, and I’m going to send you home to your parents covered in cum,” he continues, before telling her from then on she needs to ask his permission whenever she wants to come. “That was really good. That was so good. I almost came,” Hannah says. When this is all done, he offers her a Gatorade.

18. Season 1, Episode 10, Shoshanna and Ray

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Shosh’s deflowering. After Jessa’s wedding, Shosh is ready to lose it … she thinks.

Millennial awkwardness: “It doesn’t hurt,” she says, Ray on top of her in bed. “Good, ’cause I haven’t done anything yet,” he answers. “My aunt says it kinda feels like scratching a sunburn,” she offers, pretty nervous. Ray considers stopping because he’s not sure he deserves to have this much power. “But I probably do,” he decides.

17. Season 6, Episode 1, Hannah and Paul-Louis

Position or act: Missionary; doggy

Circumstances of sex: Hannah may have quit surf lessons after a dubious injury, but after a night of alcoholic slushie–fueled dancing at the bar with her surf instructor (Riz Ahmed), she winds up in his (bottom bunk) bed.

Millennial awkwardness: Interestingly, we haven’t seen a lot of drunk sex on this show, and drunk Hannah is even more rambly than usual. Part of what tripped Hannah up during surf lessons—lack of athletic ability—once again stands in her way when Paul-Louis tries to position her limbs in ways she’s not used to, including bending her leg up to her chest while he’s on top of her. They eventually settle into a pretty standard missionary. What saves the encounter from total awkwardness is Paul-Louis’ relentless chill. He is a surfer, after all.

16. Season 3, Episode 1, Jessa and Laura

Position or act: Cunnilingus

Circumstances of sex: After basically outing “fat, gay Laura” (Danielle Brooks) in group therapy at rehab, Jessa offers her an olive branch in the form of oral sex.

Millennial awkwardness: We don’t see much, but we do see rehab administrators walk in on them and pledge to write Jessa up.

15. Season 3, Episode 6, Shoshanna and Parker

Position or act: Standing; doggy

Circumstances of sex: After fellow NYU student and potential boyfriend Parker passes Shosh’s vetting process at the library, they have sex while standing up in her apartment.

Millennial awkwardness: As she’s making plans for their relationship, he’s taking her from behind and asks if they can talk about it later. Bent over a couch, she says, “Honest and open communication about mutual needs is like the cornerstone to any healthy relationship.” “Do you want me to stop?” he asks. “No. There’s no need to terminate sex just ’cause we’re not meant for each other. God, you’re so dumb, Parker.”

Screencap from HBO

14. Season 1, Episode 4, Shoshanna and Matt

Position or act: Cunnilingus

Circumstances of sex: One of Shoshanna’s doomed attempts to lose her virginity in Season 1. Her old camp friend Matt comes over and gets a boner on the couch (“you could touch it if you want”).

Millennial awkwardness: Matt remarks on how chill it is that their hangout has taken a turn for the sexy, compliments Shosh’s “hot rod little bod,” muses on city girls vs. Long Island girls, and starts to go down on her. Then Shosh makes the fatal mistake of revealing her V-card status. Matt pauses, remarking that virgins are “really not my thing.” Shosh protests, “I so don’t get attached when I bleed. You know It’s like amazing, I’m like totally not an attached bleeder,” but the die is cast, and her hymen will remain intact for another few episodes.

13. Season 5, Episode 8, Hannah and Ray

Position or act: Fellatio

Circumstances of sex: Hannah is so thankful that Ray has come to save her when she’s stranded in the middle of nowhere after breaking up with Fran that she decides to reward him with some road head.

Millennial awkwardness: Despite Hannah’s invitation to relax, Ray is initially uncomfortable (“I don’t think this is good for our friendship”). But then he gets into it, closes his eyes … and promptly crashes the van he’s driving into a speed-limit sign. The van then tips over. For those counting, that’s three out of four Girls that Ray has hooked up with throughout the show.

12. Season 1, Episode 6, Hannah and Eric

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Hannah visits her hometown and goes out with a pharmacist she went to high school with.

Millennial awkwardness: A hat trick of awkwardness: First she asks him what his favorite part of “fucking” her is, before they’ve even started; next she slips a finger in his butt (“What are you doing? Please don’t put your finger in my asshole”); and then she whispers to him, “I’m tight like a baby, right?” This Midwestern boy is just not prepared for Hannah’s big-city ways.

11. Season 2, Episode 10, Natalia and Adam

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: After the last time didn’t go so well (see No. 3), Natalia and Adam give it another go.

Millennial awkwardness: Adam keeps veering into overly aggressive territory, which is not what Natalia is looking for. He turns her affirmations that she likes what he’s doing into, “You like my cock? … You’re dirty little whore, and you love my cock.” She stops and says, “No. I can like your cock and not be a whore.”

10. Season 5, Episode 2, Jessa and Adam

Position or act: Simultaneous masturbation

Circumstances of sex: Jessa and Adam are trying really hard not to get involved with each other, on account of Hannah’s feelings.

Millennial awkwardness: They decide they’re not gonna have sex, no way. “Can we be together but not touch each other?” “Yeah. That’s the whole point. We’re not gonna touch each other.” Cut to them sitting on opposite sides of a couch masturbating. “Don’t look,” Jessa says.

9. Season 5, Episode 5, Hannah and a yoga instructor

Position or act: Cunnilingus

Circumstances of sex: Hannah is at a spa with her mother, in a terrible mood, and starts chatting with Holly, a yoga instructor, even though Hannah is still with Fran at this point. One thing leads to another and ...

Millennial awkwardness: Hannah goes down on the yoga instructor but gets uncomfortable midway through. She says she’s too hot (and has a serious case of bed head), and even though Holly begs her to keep going, she stops. It’s no secret that Hannah is selfish, but this is profoundly uncomfortable. Holly finishes on her own and starts to cry/laugh, and Hannah looks on in horror.

8. Season 2, Episode 3, Marnie and Booth Jonathan

Position or act: Doggy, or “prone bone,” which is when a woman is lying flat on her belly

Circumstances of sex: Marnie’s had a crush on Booth since she first met him in Season 1. After she runs into him at work, he brings her back to his place, where he locks her inside one of his art installations for a while.

Millennial awkwardness: Booth is splayed out like a starfish on top of Marnie in his bed, and at one point he commands her to “look at the doll” in the room. “Describe her.” This is what happens when you sleep with an artist, Marnie.

7. Season 1, Episode 6, Loreen and Tad

Position or act: Doggy

Circumstances of sex: While Hannah is out on a date, her parents take part in the ageless pastime of shower sex.

Millennial awkwardness: How does sex between two nonmillennials end up being so millennially awkward? Things start off well enough—“Fuck, that feels good! Wet and wild!,” Hannah’s dad Tad says. But he soon falls (showers being slippery places), and Hannah comes into the house while he’s still naked on the floor. She and her mom help him up.

6. Season 2, Episode 1, Marnie and Elijah

Position or act: Missionary

Circumstances of sex: Hannah and Elijah, now roommates, just had a party at their place, and Elijah and Marnie are reconnecting afterward once everyone’s gone home. It gets flirty.

Millennial awkwardness: Elijah, musing on whether he might be bi, tells Marnie she’s hot. “You know how hot you are, that’s why you’re such a little bitch.” He kisses her, she smacks him, then she reconsiders. But the mood in the room quickly shifts when Elijah has trouble sustaining his erection. “How am I supposed to get hard if you’re rolling your eyes?” This was less a sex scene than two egomaniacs almost getting off on mutual flattery.

5. Season 1, Episode 5, Hannah and Adam

Position or act: Masturbation

Circumstances of sex: Adam is confused when Hannah shows up at his place, because he thought they broke up. A little later, he starts to masturbate, and then Hannah is confused—she’s still there, what’s happening? She announces that she’s leaving, at which point Adam asks, “You wanna stay till I finish? You know, for the story?”

Millennial awkwardness: Hannah starts to neg Adam, insulting him for masturbating while she’s standing right there. She goes to start touching herself, and he stops her; it’s a pretty confusing situation. He finishes and says, “shake my hand.” It feels like Hannah has made it to the freaky next level of whatever game Adam is playing.

4. Season 2, Episode 5, Hannah and Joshua

Position or act: Missionary; digital stimulation

Circumstances of sex: After Joshua (Patrick Wilson) comes into the coffee shop where Hannah works to complain that Grumpy’s garbage is ending up in his trash cans, Hannah goes to his house to ’fess up to being the one who put it there. He is beautiful and has a beautiful home, and Hannah kisses him. Before you know it: sex.

Millennial awkwardness: Hannah is at first surprised that a man like Joshua wants to be with her, even apologizing for kissing him, but she eventually gives in to her impulses. She spends a whole day with him, living a life of leisure and luxury, including the famous topless ping-pong game, and it all feels like a weird dream. A guy like Joshua is a lot to take in when one is used to the vicissitudes of twentysomething Brooklyn boys. You’re never more of an awkward millennial than when you’re engaging in cross-generational sex with a storybook-handsome nonmillennial.

3. Season 2, Episode 9, Natalia and Adam

Position or act: Analingus; doggy; masturbation

Circumstances of sex: After an unusually sweet first time together (most of which happens off screen), Natalia sees Adam’s apartment for the first time and calls it depressing. Something’s gotten into Adam, maybe the alcohol he had that night, and he’s back to being the creepy guy we knew in Season 1.

Millennial awkwardness: Awkward would be one word for it; semi-consensual might be another one. Adam tells Natalia to get on all fours and crawl to his room, and she plays along despite being uncomfortable. After he picks her up and puts her on his bed, her distress is compounded; he starts going for her butt and doesn’t seem to care when she protests that she didn’t shower that day. After some doggy-style sex, he pulls out and starts masturbating, and she cries out, “No, no, not on my dress!” He comes on her chest and takes off his shirt to wipe it up, completely silent. She says quietly, “I don’t think I liked that.”The Hard

Truths of

Ta-Nehisi

Coates After the dreams of Martin Luther King Jr. and the hopes of Barack Obama.

Photographs by Lyle Ashton Harris

Late this spring, the publisher Spiegel & Grau sent out advance copies of a new book by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a slim volume of 176 pages called Between the World and Me. “Here is what I would like for you to know,” Coates writes in the book, addressed to his 14-year-old son. “In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body — it is heritage.”

The only endorsement he had wanted was the novelist Toni Morrison’s. Neither he nor his editor, Christopher Jackson, knew Morrison, but they managed to get the galleys into her hands. Weeks later, Morrison’s assistant sent Jackson an email with her reaction: “I’ve been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died,” Morrison had written. “Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates.” Baldwin died 28 years ago. Jackson forwarded the note to Coates, who sent back a one-word email: “Man.”

Morrison’s words were an anointing. They were also a weight. On the subject of black America, Baldwin had once been a compass — “Jimmy’s spirit,” the poet Amiri Baraka had said, eulogizing him, “is the only truth which keeps us sane.” On the last Friday in June, the day after Morrison’s endorsement was made public and then washed over Twitter, Coates sat down with me at a Morningside Heights bar and after some consideration ordered an IPA. At six-foot-four, he towers over nearly everyone he meets, and to close the physical distance he tends to turtle his neck down, making himself smaller: “A public persona but not a public person,” explained his father, Paul Coates. Ta-Nehisi said he thought ­Morrison’s praise was essentially literary, about the echo of Baldwin’s direct and exhortative prose in his own. The week before, The New ­Yorker’s David Remnick had called the forthcoming book “extraordinary,” and A. O. Scott of the New York Times would soon go further, calling it “essential, like water or air.” The figure of the lonely radical writer is a common one. A writer who radicalizes the Establishment is more rare. “When people who are not black are interested in what I do, frankly, I’m always surprised,” Coates said. “I don’t know if it’s my low expectations for white people or what.”

It had been nine days since the young white supremacist Dylann Roof had massacred nine black churchgoers in Charleston, and Coates, whose great theme is the intractability of racial history, had helped to orient the debate, to concentrate attention on the campaign against the Confederate flag: Even casual tweets he sent out were retweeted hundreds of times. The television behind the bar was tuned to President Obama’s eulogy for Reverend Clementa Pinckney, which was just about to start. The broadcast was muted, but Coates noticed the tableau: “There’s a sister over here to the left, she’s natural, no perm, and a very black dude, and then an African-American president.” Coates imagined how this would appear to a 4-year-old white boy: “That’s the world as he knows it,” Coates said. “So all these people saying that symbols don’t mean anything — that’s bullshit. They mean a lot.” Coates has often been a critic of the president from the left — of his instinct to submerge race in talk of class, of his moralizing to black audiences. “I’m going to make a prediction,” he said. “He’s going to say something incredible.”

When Obama began his first campaign for the presidency, Coates was all but anonymous, a journalist in his early 30s who had worked mostly at alt-weeklies and mostly for short stints. But in 2008, he was hired by The Atlantic — to write longer pieces, then to blog — and eventually his commentary formed a counterpoint to the White House line. Against the optimism of the Obama ascendancy, Coates offered a bleaker view: that no postracial era was imminent, that white supremacy has been a condition of the United States since its inception and that it might always be. “ ‘White America’ is a syndicate arrayed to protect its exclusive power to dominate and control our bodies,” Coates writes to his son. While the president talked about the velocity of our escape from history, Coates insisted that the country was still stuck in its vise. Last year, he wrote an Atlantic cover story titled “The Case for Reparations,” probably the most discussed magazine piece of the Obama era, which detailed the persistence of structural racism — racism by government policy — into the present day. When Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and then Tamir Rice in Cleveland and Walter Scott in South Carolina, it was Coates who seemed to most adeptly digest the central paradox of the time: how, within an increasingly progressive era, a country led by a black president could still act with such racial brutality. In late December, when Funny or Die published a fake text-message chain between the president and his daughters, it had its fictional, radicalized Malia Obama coolly insisting, “I wish Ta-Nehisi Coates was my dad.”

The sudden shift after the massacre, in which southern politicians turned against the Confederate flag, filled Coates with both awe and perplexity. “I mean, I tweeted this out, but I didn’t expect it to happen: ‘You talk about how this makes you feel. Then take down the damn flag,’ ” Coates said. “And hell, they did it! It turns out that was actually what was in motion.” He shook his head. “Shit!”

That Sunday, the Times would give Coates a small role in focusing attention on the flag. More essential, the paper reported, were the public gestures of forgiveness that family members of the victims had offered to Roof. “I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again, but I forgive you,” the daughter of a slain 70-year-old woman told her mother’s murderer at his hearing. These gestures had moved conservative Christians in a very religious state. Coates believes in the power of social structures, not in the politics of emotion. The consensus account — in which Strom Thurmond’s son State Senator Paul Thurmond looked into the eyes of black fellow citizens at a church service after the massacre and decided that he could no longer defend the flag — reeked of myth. Even the public forgiving, so soon after the slaughter, seemed unreal. “Is that real?” Coates said, watching the service. “I question the realness of that.”

Coates is not a Christian. The heavy force in Between the World and Me — what makes it both unique and bleak — is his atheism. It gives Coates’s writing urgency. To consider the African-American experience without the language of souls and destiny is to strip it of euphemism, and to make the security of African-American bodies even more crucial. It also isolates him from the main black political tradition. “There’s a kind of optimism specifically within Christianity about the world — about whose side God is on,” he said. “Well, I didn’t have any of that in my background. I had physicality and chaos.”

Coates was still wondering about the Charleston family members, Christians forgiving. He splayed his fingers over his brow and covered his eyes, so that as he talked he could not see. “Is it aspirational?” he wondered. “Like, I say, ‘I forgive you’ because I think I’m supposed to?”

On the mute television, something was happening. The ministers were standing up and smiling. To their left, the first African-American president of the United States had lifted his head. He was singing “Amazing Grace.”

The first time Coates met the president, at an off-the-record White House conversation with liberal opinion writers in 2013, he left disappointed in himself. “Everyone was too deferential, and I was too deferential, too,” he said. The second time, a few months later, he was determined to do better. Coates had been reading Baldwin’s 1963 book, The Fire Next Time, and as he left his home in Harlem for the train station, his wife, Kenyatta Matthews, said to him, “What would Baldwin do?” On the train to D.C., Coates thought about the off-the-record 1963 meeting that Baldwin had brokered between Robert Kennedy and leading black activists, at which Kennedy felt the full force of black anger. (“They seemed possessed,” Kennedy would later say.) Coates arrived at the White House late and, because he had not prepared for rain, wet. He was not wearing a suit but a blazer and jeans. The president was going around the room answering questions on a wide range of topics, handling each expertly, in Coates’s view.

“And the race aspect is not gone from this,” Coates said. “To see a black dude in a room of the smartest white people and just be the smartest dude in the room — it just puts into context all the stuff about ‘Let me see his grades.’ ”

Occupying Coates’s mind were the racial dimensions of universal health care. It had become apparent, as reporters dug through Census data, that as Republican governors opted out of the federal government’s expansion of Medicaid, blacks and Hispanics would be disproportionately left out because of where they lived. Coates wanted the president to take more targeted action to counter this — to make the policy acknowledge race and not just class. Obama said that progressives were doing the best they could. At a certain moment, Coates became self-conscious. “This dispute happens, and all the other journalists are saying, ‘Oh my God, the two black dudes are fighting.’ ”

As the meeting ended, Obama pulled Coates aside. On his blog, the writer had criticized the president for suggesting, during a speech on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, that many African-Americans had “lost our way” and calling for more personal responsibility. The president told Coates he had been unfair. As he was walking away, Obama turned back and said, “Don’t despair.”

Coates took the long walk back to Union Station and found himself thinking about Baldwin. The warm optimism of the early civil-rights movement (the insistence that the universe has a moral arc, the sense of destiny in the lyrics to “We Shall Overcome”) echoed in Obama, but Baldwin had not shared “all of this sentiment and melodrama; he was just so cold,” said Coates. “Baldwin was saying, ‘You should be aware that failure is a distinct possibility.’ That was so freeing.” Coates called Christopher Jackson and asked him why no one wrote like Baldwin anymore, and the editor suggested that he try. The book Coates eventually wrote wasn’t exactly that, though it borrowed its form from The Fire Next Time, part of which is addressed to his nephew. But it argued that what the president had called despair was actually the product of experience.

Coates was born in 1975 and grew up in Northwest Baltimore, in a sprawling family infused with black political consciousness. Paul Coates, who had briefly been a Black Panther and became a radical librarian and independent publisher, had seven children with four different women. Ta-Nehisi’s mother, Cheryl, a schoolteacher, was the last. Northwest Baltimore was sharply segregated — it basically still is — and so though Coates did not grow up poor, he did grow up in proximity to violence. “To be black in the Baltimore of my youth was to be naked before the elements of the world,” Coates writes in Between the World and Me. “The nakedness is not an error, nor the import of deviant culture. The nakedness is the correct and intended result of ­policy.” Coates’s first book, The Beautiful Struggle, published in 2008, was a memoir of growing up in this environment as a spacey, conscious kid, head deep in comic books, Malcolm X’s “The Ballot or the Bullet” speech on his Walkman. The book did not register widely, but the crime novelist Walter Mosley called Coates “the young James Joyce of the hip-hop generation.”

In one way, at least, Coates earned that praise: He could express very deeply the dimensions of fear. He writes of the kids gathered around Mondawmin Mall, across the street from his house, in puffy ’80s Starter jackets: “I think back on those boys now and all I see is fear, and all I see is them girding themselves against the ghosts of the bad old days when the Mississippi mob gathered ’round their grandfathers.” In this environment, the Black History Month ­invocations of Martin Luther King Jr. and the early civil-rights leaders seemed especially discordant: Nonviolence seemed like an impossible standard. Violence was a product of fear; it was also a tool against it. “My father was so very afraid. I felt it in the sting of his black leather belt, which he applied with more anxiety than anger, my father who beat me as if someone might steal me away, because that was exactly what was happening all around us.”

Coates arrived at Howard University in 1993, when he was 17 years old, as Afrocentrism was just beginning to lose strength as an intellectual force, a shift that complicated Coates’s own nationalism, in particular his veneration for Malcolm X. Coates was writing poetry then, and the effort pushed him into a circle of older black writers. They often told him how much more he had to learn. One mentor, the poet Joel Dias-Porter, quit his job and moved into a homeless shelter for two years so that he could spend each day at the Library of Congress, working through an impossibly long list of books he felt compelled to read. Coates developed a similar ritual — sitting down each morning at the Howard University library and requesting three books at a time, battling with the histories of nationalism and integration in his mind.

The happiest sections of Coates’s new book are set at Howard: It is where he met his wife and where he found a “base, even in these modern times, a port in the storm.” In the book he calls Howard “Mecca.” Eventually he dropped out to work as a journalist, first at the Washington City Paper and then at some other alt-weeklies, where he usually was assigned to the race beat, to write about black experience, and though this was in some ways diminishing it also gave him an angle on the world. When Coates was 24, he and Matthews had a son, Samori — whom they named after a West African military leader who routed the French colonists — and moved to Brooklyn. Coates’s personality, built for West Baltimore, was at times an ungainly fit in his new world: He writes of feeling himself swelling toward physical fights, of being conscious of his race, of not feeling comfortable. They did not have much money. For a while, Coates mainly stayed home with Samori. An essay of his from the period is titled “Confessions of a Black Mr. Mom.”

The fear that gives life to Between the World and Me is the fear of a parent for his child. Though the book went through many revisions, Coates said he was always sure that he would end it by describing his meeting with a woman named Mabel Jones, whose son, Prince, had been a friend of his at Howard and who was later killed by a police officer who tracked him from Maryland to Virginia in a case of mistaken identity — he had committed no crime. Mabel Jones was a sharecropper’s daughter who worked to become a radiologist, then sent her children to private schools and made sure to give them things like “jaunts off to Europe.” For Coates, Mabel Jones became not just an emblem of dignity, of “all of the odd poise and direction that the great American injury demands of you,” but also a signal of the impossibility of escaping the tragedies of race, even for well-off blacks. Her son was killed, and the police officer who shot him, a black man himself, was allowed to return to the force. Jones’s death so alienated Coates that when he watched 9/11, slightly stoned, on the roof of his Brooklyn building, he recalls that he felt nothing at all. “You must always remember,” Coates writes to Samori, “that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body.”

Coates has borrowed this language from feminist writing. For him, it contained a basic truth, that indignity is always physical. The vulnerability of African-American bodies has become a main theme of the racial protests over the past year under slogans like “I Can’t Breathe.” “Sell cigarettes without the proper authority and your body can be destroyed,” Coates writes. “Turn into a dark stairwell and your body can be destroyed. The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions.”

Coates’s first piece for The Atlantic was an essay criticizing Bill Cosby, who was then still an icon, for tearing into black audiences about values and responsibility. Soon, the magazine gave him his own blog. The form (intimate, open-ended, inquiring) suited him, and eventually he took up the personal project that had lapsed once he’d left Howard, a study of history. Reading new books, trading notes with his commenters, Coates sharpened his sense of the historical weight of white supremacy: The Civil War was fought over slavery and nothing else; the American Dream could not be separated from slavery because “slavery was the dream.” At the time, most young journalists were leaning on social science for authority — history had a human warmth. Coates noticed the good people on the wrong side of history, suggesting that individual virtue was a weak counter­weight to the pathologies of states. Had he been alive and had means, he tweeted, “I would have owned slaves too.”

A community grew in his comments section, but it was a community of a particular type: liberal, wide-eyed, pining for moral authority — and redemption. “Coates’s creepshow commenters asking him to forgive their sins,” the left-wing critic Fredrik deBoer sardonically described it. Last week on Twitter, a woman asked Coates about the pronunciation of his first name: “I’m really curious what the etymology is that makes the ‘hi’ a ‘hah’ sound?” Coates replied, “It’s an ancient, arcane dialect which we like to call ‘hood.’ ” One irony of Coates’s war on white innocence is that he has arrayed against it an army of white innocents.

In the fall of 2012, Coates told his editor at The Atlantic, Scott Stossel, that he wanted to make a case for racial reparations in the magazine. The case was formless then, but over the following months it took shape as an account of the experience of housing discrimination in Chicago and the way government policy deliberately fenced blacks into particular neighborhoods and denied them the benefits that went to whites nearby.

Coates’s hero was a 91-year-old man named Clyde Ross, who had left the segregated Mississippi Delta, where his family had been unable to keep white people from simply taking their possessions, and come north, only to be trapped by redlining and predatory banking into a home loan that he had no hope of repaying. Ross became an activist, but in Coates’s alchemy, he became a symbol of the presence of history, a physical reminder that these crimes did not happen so long ago. The great theme of the piece is plunder (the word appears 14 times) — of what was taken from African-Americans specifically because they were black and not because they were poor, and specifically because of government policy, and recently. Reparations were morally necessary, Coates argued, because the harm was so tangible. He wrote, “Plunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient.” The essay had a moral consequence too, to refocus the idea of reparations. Coates’s reparations weren’t about the country cleansing itself of original sin. They were restitution to be paid for property that continues to be taken.

That article appeared two months before Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson. Coates’s view of the world was growing starker. “It’s only in the last 18 months that he’s said he’s a nonbeliever,” said Jelani Cobb, a close friend of Coates’s since Howard and a historian at the University of Connecticut. If you did not believe in the soul, then police killings took on especially high stakes because the body was all you had. Coates said he would not have written Between the World and Me in 2008. His view was less bleak then, less concretized by history. “I have become radicalized,” he said.

Coates’s quarrel isn’t really with Obama, in the end, or with civil-rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. It is instead with the metaphors through which they made a compromise with the country — Obama as the embodiment of hope and King the embodiment of dreams. These formulations gave white liberals a pass. Coates plays with both these words in his book, reconsidering them, twisting them around. In the very first scene, he disdains white Americans’ “reveling in a specious hope”; later, he urges his son to accept “the preferences of the universe itself,” among them the preference for “struggle over hope.” The Dream became a controlling metaphor for white innocence. “That what your ancestors did doesn’t matter,” Coates explained. “That you went out to the suburbs, and the houses grew from nothing and it’s not contaminated by anything. The idea that you’re entitled to it, and people who don’t have it are either pathological or lower than you. That nothing’s wrong.”

Part of what distinguishes Coates is that he is not interested in uplift. Obama’s insight into his own biography was that it revealed American progress. Coates saw far more stasis running in the background of his own life. When he spoke in Charleston, Obama took his metaphor from “Amazing Grace.” Through God’s grace, the president said, Americans could now see the legacy of brutality that the Confederate flag embodied clearly. Coates’s writing takes an almost opposite position: that religion is blindness, and that if you strip away the talk of hope and dreams and faith and progress, what you see are enduring structures of white supremacy and no great reason to conclude that the future will be better than the past.

“That’s the thing that linked Martin Luther King and Malcolm X,” Coates said. “People say Malcolm was a pessimist. He was a pessimist about America. But he was actually very optimistic. Malcolm very much believed in the dream of nationalism. He believed we could do it. And Martin believed in the dream of integration. He believed that black people could be successful if they did x, y, and z.” Coates did not share that optimism: African-Americans are a minority in America, and he sees limits to what they can control. “I suspect they were both wrong. I suspect that it’s not up to us.”

The Monday after the president’s eulogy in Charleston, Coates flew to Colorado for the Aspen Ideas Festival. Private jets were scattered over the tarmac, each sleek and bony as a fish skeleton. Aspen is a junket to end all junkets. Tickets cost up to $9,000; there are pop-up planetariums; at sponsor dinners, Atlantic writers sometimes stand up from their tables, forks clinking against glasses, and discourse for three minutes about, say, mass incarceration. The speakers are ideologically promiscuous. The collision of real intellectuals and real money is surreal.

The Atlantic invited Coates to the festival for the first time in 2008, when he was still a freelancer. He found it disorienting. At The Atlantic’s Publisher’s Dinner, he wound up talking with a very wealthy man who had made his money in department stores, who was telling a story about lending Peter Jennings his yacht. Coates liked him. “He was talking about how that morning he had gone out and taken his dog up into the mountains and seen a moose. And I was like, ‘Damn, that’s your life?’ Not in a mad way, I just did not know that this was what people did.”

Coates is more comfortable here now. That afternoon, he was wearing a red T-shirt that said MAKE CORNBREAD NOT WAR, which everyone complimented. He still notices the wealth, but it does not especially faze him; he has a theory about the ideological profile of the attendees (split between Republicans and Democrats, but with very few real conservatives); he knows which barbecue places are actually good and which restaurants will overcharge you. It was sunny and immaculate and the crowd was diverse in a way that made you, or at least me, think warmly about America. Soon Coates would walk toward a shuttle into Aspen for dinner, shortening his steps to keep behind the penguinlike form of Bill Kristol, also waiting for a ride. Coates gestured. “It would be very easy to come here and then complain about people making me have all these dinners and lunches with sponsors and how I’d much rather be out there standing with the people on 125th and Lenox,” Coates said. “But truthfully I’m very happy to be here. It’s very nice.”

The next morning, Coates debated Mitch Landrieu, the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, on the sources of American violence. The exchange was moderated by Coates’s friend and colleague Jeffrey Goldberg. The mayor — shaven-headed, coachlike — had made crime in black neighborhoods a political focus. It was an issue on which he was accustomed to being the good guy. The search engine Bing had sponsored an app that allowed audience members to rate the speakers in real time. Landrieu said he hoped they liked him. Coates said, a little masochistically, he hoped they hated him.

Landrieu seemed mindful of all the ways a well-meaning white liberal in a situation like this might embarrass himself. He knew all the statistics about the scale of murders in African-American communities and mentioned them; he stated the problem in a way that focused on blacks as victims of violence rather than perpetrators; he told the audience that he had recently personally apologized for slavery; he said the core issue was “a pattern of behavior that has developed amongst young African-American men since 1980.” Coates asked if the change in 1980 wasn’t simply the increased prevalence of handguns. Landrieu said that was part of it. Then he talked about personal responsibility. “If you knocked me off the chair last week, that’s on you, but if you come back and I’m still on the floor this week, that’s on me.”

“It is my fault if I knocked you off the chair,” Coates said.

“I didn’t say it wasn’t,” said the mayor.

“No, it’s never not my fault that I knocked you off the chair.”

Landrieu started to talk about “black-on-black crime,” then retreated, saying he might be using the wrong words. Coates said the term didn’t offend him: “I think it’s actually inaccurate.” The plain fact, he said, was that when black people killed one another, the victims were their neighbors. They didn’t kill their neighbors because they were black. Inner-city violence, he said, had everything to do with the legacy of structural neglect in the inner city and nothing at all to do with culture. Even from the cheap seats, it was clear that Landrieu was struggling, that there was some turn in the politics of race that he had not fully comprehended, some way in which the old Clintonite phrasings were failing. In their place was a more radical language, of structuralism and supremacy. Now that language has a place in Aspen.

Coates’s book is, he said, “oddly conservative” in its sense of the futility of individuals confronting the structure of white supremacy, in its pessimism about what can be changed. Goldberg asked what he would do if he were in Landrieu’s position — surely there was something, “I don’t know what I’d do if I were mayor, but I could tell you what I’d do if I was king.” He’d let criminals out of prison, he said. “And, by the way, I include violent criminals in that.” Goldberg asked what he meant by “violent.” “Gun crime, too,” Coates said.

There is a radical-chic crowd assembling around Coates. The oddity is that there is no obvious opposing force. Conservatives have not focused on him; the old anti-structuralist wing of liberalism has faded. In Aspen, even people who actually disagreed with him seemed to want to believe they did not. A woman in a nautical top (“Ta-Nehisi, I think you’re the greatest,” she began) asked Coates whether, in addition to structural solutions, black icons ought to do more to condemn crime. She mentioned “Oprah, Jay Z, whoever the kids relate to.” Coates patiently brought up the Charleston families forgiving the man who murdered their loved ones. “There’s no lack of effort on behalf of black people,” he said. “I think black folks are doing just fine.”

Late one evening at Aspen, Coates was in a lounge with some of the conference’s other speakers. Things were a little bit boozy. Melody Barnes, formerly the president’s domestic-policy adviser, sailed by. Goldberg monologued jokes from a couch. Everyone in the room was almost exactly equally famous — just a little bit famous — but somehow the evening seemed to hinge on when NPR’s Michele Norris would arrive. A friend of Coates’s was back from a conference-sponsored tour of a marijuana-grow operation, a little high and with product in her backpack. Coates inquired with interest about how she had procured it. The friend said that Coates had it all wrong, that this was Colorado in 2015 and no evasions were required, that all you had to do was go down to the store.

Progress was in the air — days after the Confederate flag had fallen and gay marriage had been legalized across the country, here we were in a place where you could buy marijuana by walking into a store. The changes seemed to speak to the great question of the late Obama era: Would the half-century-long era of increasing prosperity and expanding human freedom prove to be an aberration or a new, permanent state? To Coates, the long arc of history was simply too strong, too rooted in human nature. From Baldwin’s writing, he had concluded that though struggle was essential, progress was not ordained. If white supremacy were ever eradicated, Coates said, he suspected it would simply be because the country had found “a new peon class,” someone else to kick around.

“Chaos is what we have,” he said. “That is what I believe. If to the end of its existence America harbors white supremacy, I don’t know how remarkable that would be. France has dealt with anti-Semitism since its inception.” America was built by humans, he said. “These things tend to have flaws.”

What a strange, dark, beguiling place America is. It killed Prince Jones. It reveres Ta-Nehisi Coates.

Coates is leaving the country. In a few weeks, he’ll move to Paris with his wife and son for a year. Part of the attraction is simple pleasure. Part of it is the intellectual project of viewing state supremacy and race in another place, to discern whether America is truly exceptional or not. Part of it is the welcome exchange of one social mask for another: Because his French is not so smooth yet, he says, he is seen first as American in Paris rather than as black, and this is a relief.

Lately Coates has been putting himself through rituals of self-improvement: He has been learning to swim, and he has been learning French — conjugating verbs, aligning tenses. One Friday morning at the end of June, his instructor at the Berlitz school in Rockefeller Center asked him about the upcoming trip. In French, Coates said, “My wife tells me that when I am in France I am a different person.” Madame Danielle expressed surprise. “A different person,” he insisted. “Very extroverted. Very nice. Just different.”

Paris carries with it reminders of the black intellectuals who moved there before: Richard Wright, and especially Baldwin. “I think my exile saved my life,” Baldwin wrote in Esquire in 1961, “for it inexorably confirmed something which Americans appear to have great difficulty accepting. Which is, simply, this: a man is not a man until he’s able and willing to accept his own vision of the world, no matter how radically this vision departs from that of others.” To be clear, he added: “When I say ‘vision’ I do not mean ‘dream.’ ”

Coates’s vision is already clear. In the chapter of his book set in Paris, Coates finds himself ruminating on the old Baltimore codes that took him too long to shake. “What I wanted was to put as much distance between you and that blinding fear as possible,” Coates writes to his son, about the allure of Paris. “I wanted you to see different people living by different rules.” Travel is an ordinary, bourgeois desire for one’s children: “I want him to see more than I saw,” Coates said. It is also the instinct of a survivor, who realizes his home is fundamentally inhospitable: to keep an eye on the exits, and to map out the routes of escape.

President Trump’s ouster of national security adviser Michael Flynn, and the circumstances leading up to it, have quickly become a major crisis for the fledgling administration, forcing the White House on the defensive and precipitating the first significant breach in relations between Trump and an increasingly restive Republican Congress.

Even as the White House described Trump’s “immediate, decisive” action in demanding ­Flynn’s resignation late Monday as the end of an unfortunate episode, senior GOP lawmakers were buckling under growing pressure to investigate it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that the events leading to Flynn’s departure would be added to a broader probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Intercepts showed that Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions in a phone call with the Russian ambassador — a conversation topic that Flynn first denied and then later said he could not recall.

McConnell’s comments followed White House revelations that Trump was aware “for weeks” that Flynn had misled Vice President Pence and others about the content of his late-December talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

White House counsel Donald F. McGahn told Trump in a briefing late last month that Flynn, despite his claims to the contrary, had discussed U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration in late December, press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. That briefing, he said, came “immediately” after Sally Q. Yates, then the acting attorney general, informed McGahn on Jan. 26 about discrepancies between intercepts of Kislyak’s phone calls and public statements by Pence and others that there had been no discussion of sanctions.

Trump brought in senior strategist Stephen K. Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to join the discussion with McGahn, according to two officials familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

McGahn then conferred with Yates again the following day, Jan. 27, to try to glean more information, these two officials said. Within the White House, the matter was viewed skeptically, and Trump, Bannon, Priebus and McGahn for several days remained among the few people briefed, they said.

Over the next two weeks, the officials said, Flynn was asked multiple times about what exactly he had said. He brushed aside the suggestion that he had spoken about sanctions with the ambassador — denials that kept him afloat within the White House even as he was being actively evaluated, they said.

It was not until a Washington Post report last Thursday, in which Flynn was quoted as saying that he had no “recollection” of discussing sanctions but couldn’t be sure that he hadn’t, that the downward slide culminating in Monday’s forced resignation began, several administration officials said.

“We’ve been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth,” Spicer said at the daily White House press briefing. He emphasized that an internal White House inquiry had concluded that nothing Flynn discussed with the Russian was illegal but that he had “broken trust” with Trump by not telling the truth about the talks.

When asked whether Trump told Flynn to talk to Kislyak about sanctions, Spicer responded: “No, absolutely not.”

Asked why Trump had waited nearly three weeks to act after what Spicer called a “heads-up” from the Justice Department, he said that once the question of legality was settled, “then it became a phase of determining whether or not [Flynn’s] action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined” Trump’s trust. He declined to specify the “other issues.”

In an interview conducted early Monday and published Tuesday by the Daily Caller, Flynn said that he did not specifically discuss sanctions with Kislyak but rather President Barack Obama’s simultaneous expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. He said he told the ambassador that “we’ll review everything” following Trump’s inauguration.

Current and former U.S. officials have said, however, that much of the conversation was about sanctions and that Flynn suggested that Moscow not respond in kind to the expulsions — advice that Russian President Vladi­mir Putin took in declining to take retaliatory action.

Although Trump has not publicly mentioned his view of the sanctions, Spicer said that the president “has made it very clear he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea,” even as he hopes to cooperate with Putin on terrorism.

Asked Tuesday on a flight to Brussels about Flynn’s ouster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it “has no impact” on his job. “It doesn’t change my message at all, and who is on the president’s staff is who I will work with,” he said.

Mattis was on his way to a meeting of NATO defense ministers, who were expected to discuss their significant concerns about Russian aggression. During his confirmation hearing, Mattis placed Russia first among threats to U.S. security.

Officials inside the National Security Council described low morale and concern about the future. The “worthless” message at a five-minute staff meeting Tuesday morning, one official said, was: “Keep working hard. Don’t leave.”

For those who knew and liked Flynn, another official said, “it’s sad. He’s a good man, and I hate to see this.”

Various accounts of the Flynn saga offered by White House officials in recent days have added to confusion about how the administration viewed Flynn’s actions, who knew what and when they knew it.

News accounts about a Flynn-Kislyak conversation in late December — the day before Obama announced new sanctions related to Russian election interference — first surfaced in a David Ignatius column in The Post on Jan. 12. Asked the next day whether they had talked about the sanctions in light of Trump’s campaign and post-election pledges to better relations with Russia, White House officials said the subject had not been discussed.

Three days later, Pence told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Flynn had assured him personally that there was no conversation about sanctions. Spicer offered similar assurances in a subsequent White House briefing.

On Jan. 24 or 25, based on discrepancies between comments by Pence and Spicer and what they knew from regular intercepts of Kislyak’s calls, FBI agents interviewed Flynn. Details of that interview, first reported Tuesday by the New York Times, are unknown but they could expose Flynn to possible charges if he denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. That interview was followed by the Justice notice to McGahn, who immediately informed Trump and others, officials said.

After Trump ordered McGahn to review the matter, Spicer said, he quickly concluded that the president’s “instinctive” conclusion that the discussions were not illegal was correct. But some in the White House who had long distrusted Flynn began to contemplate his departure. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Keith Kellogg, the National Security Council chief of staff, began attending intelligence briefings with Flynn.

“The president was sort of like: Until this matter is sorted out, I want buttressing,” said the senior official, one of several who discussed the sensitive matter on the condition of anonymity. “The idea was . . . if the president decides to pull the trigger, we need to make sure that we have some options.”

Flynn was eventually made aware of the White House investigation, which led to alarm among senior Trump aides when he initially told The Post, in a Feb. 8 interview, that there had been no discussion about sanctions. He revised his remarks to the paper the next day, saying through a spokesman that “while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

The two accounts were published by The Post on the evening of Feb. 9.

“His story remained the same until that night,” Spicer told reporters in his office Tuesday evening. “There was a story in The Post where there’s a White House official that says that he could not recall. . . . Whatever that quote was is what matters. . . . His story remained the same until that night.”

Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told reporters that the vice president first became aware of the “incomplete information” Flynn had provided him by reading the same newspaper account.

[Pence did not learn that Flynn misled him on Russia until last week]

Flynn was then questioned by McGahn, Pence and Priebus, who the official said was so frustrated that his tone became more that of a litigator than a colleague.

Asked Friday aboard Air Force One about the Post reporting that Flynn allegedly had not told the truth about the calls, Trump said he was not familiar with it.

“I don’t know about that. I haven’t seen it. What report is that? I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that,” Trump told reporters on the plane.

Spicer said Tuesday that Trump was responding only to a question about the Post report and was not speaking about the overall issue of Flynn’s contact with the Russian ambassador and his discussion of sanctions.

After discussing the situation throughout the weekend at Trump’s Florida resort, a final decision was made Monday night by Trump, along with Priebus and senior advisers Bannon and Jared Kushner, to tell Flynn to resign, officials said.

That is a notably different version of events than the one offered Monday night, when administration officials characterized Flynn’s departure as voluntary. One senior White House official said Monday that Trump had not fired Flynn but that he had made the decision to resign on his own because of “the cumulative effect” of damaging news coverage.

Flynn’s swift downfall: From a phone call in the Dominican Republic to a forced resignation at the White House

Pence remains above the fray, but is he outside the inner circle?

Robert Costa, Dan Lamothe, Ellen Nakashima and Ashley Parker contributed to this report.Our own Katie Pavlich was among a handful of journalists -- all representing non-"mainstream" outlets -- from whom President Trump took questions at yesterday's joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Cortney and Twitchy covered the legacy media's resulting conniption fits, including expressions of anger from aghast Democratic operatives. Some of these criticisms are valid; others are preposterous, insular, and arrogant. Assorted thoughts:

(1) It's fair to say that if President Obama had exclusively called on explicitly left-leaning outlets over the course of multiple consecutive press conferences (setting aside the question of prevailing left-leaning bias within the mainstream press), conservatives would have melted down. Many of us were very critical of some of the embarrassingly obsequious questions he fielded over the years, several of which Republican strategist Rory Cooper dredged up on Twitter yesterday in the midst of this MSM tantrum:

2nd Question to Obama at APEC presser: Are GOP candidates "Ill-informed, out-of-touch or irresponsible?" Seriously. — Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) November 14, 2011

First question: "Are you ready to call yourself the comeback kid?" -Media at the top of their game. Groan. #ObamaPresser — Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) December 22, 2010

Media doesn't get many opportunities to question President. Thankfully we got a question in on how much Obama loves Chicago. — Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) May 21, 2012

Hillary Clinton, who was famously stingy with her press access, sometimes got mind-blowing passes when she finally deigned to take questions. And the Obama administration initially attempted to freeze out Fox News, which it viewed as a hostile outlet. Those facts aren't a justification to toss softball questions in the other direction; they do, however, represent context. Overall, I think it's totally in-bounds for members of the media (and those who cover media) to object to what could be an emerging presidential strategy of avoiding major news outlets -- especially if it's 'punishment' for unfavorable coverage.

(2) Journalists who cried foul over Trump's selection of questioners often came across as aggrieved and bitter that they had been passed over, but I don't think personal pique was the top driving factor of their grousing. More likely, these reporters were angry that those who were called upon didn't ask the questions that they believed should have been asked. Specifically, they wanted a feeding frenzy on the New York Times and CNN reporting about Trump associates being in frequent contact (but not coordinating or colluding with) with Russian intelligence figures during the campaign. That's certainly an important story, even if the actual reported facts suggest that it has been overblown. I'd agree that someone probably should have asked Trump about it. But that doesn't mean that opting to go with inquires on other important and serious matters was a dereliction of journalistic duty.

(3) It should be noted that the 'we-know-better' professionals often go overboard in the opposite direction. For instance, earlier this week, a House GOP press availability about Obamacare repeal got overshadowed when every single question was about the Flynn imbroglio. Of course it was reasonable to seek answers from the Speaker of the House about that active controversy. But the assembled Republicans didn't get a single question about the highly relevant issue of healthcare. What is the timeline? What is the legislative strategy? Where is the replacement bill? What about recalcitrant conservative members who only want to vote on repeal legislation? How will people with pre-existing conditions be covered? Is the Trump administration's use of executive "discretion" that undermines the individual mandate appropriate and constitutional? These are questions to which a great many people would have liked answers, but instead, we got Flynn, Flynn and more Flynn. Does that approach serve the diverse interests of news consumers?

(4) The ugliest reactions to Katie's questions were tinged with deep-seated arrogance and ideological myopia. The DC press corps is an elite club, and some of its members truly believe that they're the only ones who are entitled to ask, or are even capable of asking, "important" questions. If they had a problem with the substance of Katie's questions -- aside from the fact that they didn't pertain to their current narrative -- that's one thing. But there was nothing, and I mean nothing, illegitimate about her two-part query. Watch:

My summary on Twitter:

Uh, @KatiePavlich asked DT what spec peace compromises he wants from each side & BN what he expects from new WH re: Iran deal. *100%* legit. — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) February 15, 2017

From a journalistic perspective, these were solid, relevant questions on newsworthy topics -- especially in light of the pair of world leaders standing at their respective podiums. Trump had just mentioned "compromises" in pushing back against Israeli settlements (newsworthy!), so Katie drilled down for specifics. And the Iran nuclear deal was a major subject of intense debate during the campaign, with recent Iranian malfeasance drawing more attention to the issue. There's even a Flynn angle to the story, if people simply must write and talk about it through that lens. The journalists in that room, and those carping on Twitter, had zero substantive beef with her questions. "The fix" was not "in." In truth, it was the fact that she was offered that platform that offended their professional sensibilities. As if openly conservative journalists are genetically incapable of asking worthwhile or fair-minded questions -- unlike the Washington press gaggle, of course. They're just an overwhelmingly liberal tribe who wake up every morning convinced that their personal opinions will not color their coverage. Because they're the professionals.

Dear Prudence,

I recently moved to a neighborhood where it’s relatively common for people to allow their dogs to roam the neighborhood freely—a practice that seems outrageous to me. There is one dog in particular that keeps showing up in my yard. Though he is very sweet, he is not neutered, does not have a collar or microchip, and was filthy and covered in fleas when I found him. He seems to be well-fed and otherwise healthy. I took the dog in, put up a few lost dog signs, and learned from another concerned neighbor who the owners are. He said they have ignored his repeated requests to keep their dog on a leash, and he witnessed several near-accidents as cars swerved to avoid the dog. Should I give this dog to a good home? My gut says this is the right thing to do, but I’m worried that I’m stealing a dog from a family. On the other hand, if I find this dog dead in the street in two weeks I will feel responsible.

—Thief or Rescuer?

Subscribe to Prudie!

I’m reluctant to give anyone advice that boils down to “Steal the dog,” and yet I think you might have to steal this dog. Normally I’d suggest that since you know who the owners are, you might consider getting in touch with them and letting them know you’re worried about their dog’s safety and are trying to find a good home for him. But you’ve already put up lost dog signs and haven’t heard a word from them, so I think you’ve done your due diligence. I think you can find a safer home for him with a clear conscience; it sounds as if they’re about as interested in recovering their dog as they were in taking care of him when they had him.

Dear Prudence,

I have a longtime friend who fancies herself a career writer. She has contributed a few freelance stories to local news organizations, mostly announcing local events not covered in the traditional news outlets. Before she submits her pieces, she sends them to me to edit. There’s no other way to describe them: They’re bad. Her pieces lack focus or purpose, she blatantly plagiarizes ideas, and her grammar and punctuation are at a junior-high level. I try to give constructive criticism, but she ignores me entirely. It’s clear that she has no intention of revising her work, and she’s just fishing for compliments.

Recently, she has started applying for journalism positions with major news organizations. She gets angry when she does not get called for an interview. I refuse to lie to her and tell her that her writing is excellent when it is subpar. What can I say when she wants me to tell her that her writing is good?

—Not Fit To Print

The hallmark of incompetence is the inability to recognize itself. Most writers are plagued with at least occasional self-doubt and impostor syndrome, but your friend is convinced the only reason she’s not a full-time reporter after a year of sporadically covering retirement parties is bad luck. You’ve already tried giving her feedback on her work to no avail, so your first step should be to stop editing her work for free. Tell her you simply don’t have the time to act as her unpaid copy editor. If she keeps fishing for compliments after she realizes she can’t squeeze any more free work from you, stick to blandly polite statements of fact: “I think it’s great you’ve found something you enjoy so much.” If she has a meltdown, hold your ground. As a reader pointed out in the comments this week, “No” is a complete sentence.

Dear Prudence,

I am 30 years old and have been with my current boyfriend for over four years. I love him, and we have a lot in common. However, there’s another friend I’ve known since I was 18. We hooked up while we were in school, but every time we considered dating, the timing wasn’t right. We’re philosophically similar and can read each other’s moods and minds, though we sometimes go months without talking. I’ve never felt such intense passion with anyone else, including my current boyfriend. Recently this friend expressed regret for never dating me, although he’s with someone now (to whom he seems indifferent). Do I owe it to myself to explore the intense feelings I never could shake before settling down with someone? Or should I chalk the feelings up to adolescent nostalgia and accept that if we had really wanted to be together, we would have made it happen?

—Follow My Heart or Head?

If your friend had told you, “Things aren’t working out with my girlfriend; I’m leaving her, and I want to be with you,” that would be one thing. But he merely expressed a vague sense of regret, as if the fact that he never dated you was entirely outside of his control. It sounds as though he’s perfectly happy to stay with this woman while checking in with you every few months to make sure you’re still thinking about him. Which is a great setup for him! Not so great for you—especially if you were to leave your lovely-but-nonintense boyfriend only to hear, “Oh, I didn’t mean we should date now. Sorry if you misunderstood!”

Dear Prudence,

I have been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and cyclothymia; last year, due to a change in my medication, I had a series of major attacks, including manic episodes and intense suicide ideation. Since then, I have become much more stable with the help of therapists and psychiatrists. Unfortunately, many of the relatives who saw me during that period have basically cut me out of their lives, even though my father told them I was mentally ill during that time and had an adverse drug reaction. I commonly see advice columnists talking about cutting toxic people out of their lives, including family members. I fear that people with mental illnesses are commonly lumped into this “toxic” category and are forced to live an isolated life after our maladies become a little too visible. What advice do you have for someone like me, who in no way meant to permanently damage key relationships due to an instability out of her control?

–Not Toxic

Your letter has settled heavy on my heart, and I am so grateful to you for writing it, as well as enormously glad you have found the treatment and resources you need to stay well. I am so sorry that in addition to having to deal with a change in medication and suicidal thoughts, you’ve also experienced a painful and unwanted estrangement from your own family. Cutting someone “toxic” out of your life is an appropriate response to long-term abuse or cruelty, not a strategy for pushing away someone seeking treatment for mental illness.

It sounds like your father is very much in your corner—could he possibly act as an advocate with the family members who have distanced themselves from you? I don’t know the specifics of what your relatives saw or experienced, but it might be easier for your father to lay some groundwork on your behalf before setting up a conversation or a low-key get-together for you to see one another again.

You experienced manic and suicidal episodes as a result of your mental illness, sought treatment, and have found relief. For your family to continue to avoid you out of fear is unnecessary. To withhold their affection from you as some sort of punishment is deeply unkind. Coldness and distance are the wrong response to pain. If nothing else, I hope seeing this letter will prove helpful to any readers unsure of how to show compassion and support to anyone in their own lives who experiences mental illness.

Dear Prudence,

Last Christmas, when my boyfriend and I were still dating, I gave him a card promising the delivery of a chair he had always wanted. At the time, I hadn’t actually ordered the chair, though of course I intended to do so. Flash forward one year, and you’ll find us no longer together—we amicably parted ways in the spring—and my ex-boyfriend still chairless. Although we remain friends, I’m torn between wanting to honor my original gifting promise and thinking that, at this point, I don’t have to buy him anything! Compounding the problem is that I’ve now moved onto someone new; ordering a belated Christmas gift for an ex-boyfriend feels decidedly unseemly. Do I need to fulfill the material promises I made while still in love?

—A Shady Chair-acter

Oh, the good intentions I have given myself credit for without ever following through on them! I wish I did not relate to your situation quite so much. You do not have to buy your ex-boyfriend the chair you promised him before you broke up. After a year, he is probably wise to the fact that you never actually ordered it. He may, in fact, be aware that overpromising and underdelivering are habits of yours. If you decide not to buy it, since you’re still friends, go ahead and make the sheepish admission that you never got around to it and hope he’ll forgive your sin of omission. “My ex never bought me a chair” is probably not keeping him up at night.

If, however, you decide that while you don’t have to honor your promise, it would be nice of you to do so, order the chair as a sign of your appreciation for his continued friendship. And don’t worry about the seemliness of the thing. Sooner or later we all buy furniture for someone we used to sleep with.

Dear Prudence,

I’ve been dating a guy I met in law school for about two years. He is the type who wants to work constantly his entire life, be extremely successful, and provide lavishly for his future family. He’d prefer to work 12-hour days and make more money than work 8-hour days and come home for dinner. I strongly disagree with this. In a conversation about our future, He said he would spend as much time as possible with a child when he wasn’t working, but when I asked him if he would take two weeks of paternity leave, he said absolutely not. Once upon a time, he said, men were back at the office 30 minutes after the baby was born. He thinks I don’t appreciate his work ethic and desire to provide the best life possible for his future wife and children. Are we incompatible, or is something that can be worked out?

—Future Single Parent

You are incompatible! He’s made himself perfectly clear: If you want a high-earning husband who’s rarely at home but pays for everything, he’s your guy. If you want someone who comes home in time for dinner and won’t rush out of the delivery room to jump on a conference call after the birth of your firstborn, thank him for his honesty, and move on to someone whose idea of work-life balance more closely resembles yours.

Dear Prudence,

My aunt and uncle are an older, well-to-do couple and the only relatives on my mother’s side. Recently, my aunt has become a “stylist” for a jewelry-party company, the sort that rewards its associates for sales to friends and acquaintances. Since then, she only give us her company’s items for Christmas, none of which we particularly care for, and emails us the receipts in order to boost her sales numbers. We don’t even like these items! We either give them away to charity or let them sit in a drawer. My mother has tried gently hinting that we have enough jewelry, and my sister and I are pushing for a gift-free Christmas. What should we do?

–No Necklace, Please

What a disappointment! Wealthy, eccentric relatives are supposed to whisk you away to their country houses and give you their old Aston Martins, not send you costume jewelry for part of their multilevel marketing schemes. (I myself have no wealthy, eccentric relatives, so I get all my knowledge about them from old Agatha Christie novels.) Stop gently hinting. Tell your aunt kindly and directly that you don’t need gifts from her, that you have more than enough jewelry, and if she sends you any more, you’ll donate it to Goodwill. If that doesn’t work, you could start sending her Mary Kay products in return, but that seems likely to backfire.

Dear Prudence,

I’ve worked at a 25-employee firm for over 20 years. I’ve also had breast cancer for 15 years. About two years ago my cancer traveled to my brain, and I had to leave my job because of the treatment I was receiving. I almost died, yet I never heard from my co-workers. Not one even called to say, “How are you feeling?” My boss told me he wanted me to come to the office holiday luncheon, yet never followed up with the date and time. I am so disappointed and hurt by their lack of empathy. I thought we were a family, but I’ve found out otherwise. Should I be as upset as I am, or should I let this go? I don’t want to die without saying anything. Can I write them a letter explaining how hurt I am?

—Tired of Holding It In

How awful to realize the coworkers you thought of as family barely think of you at all. I know plenty of people feel uncomfortable and unsure of what to say in the face of illness, but it’s hard to imagine that all 25 of your former colleagues couldn’t muster up a single get-well card or phone call between them. Their absence during your illness may have stemmed more from discomfort and uncertainty than from callousness, but that doesn’t make their silence any easier for you to bear.

I don’t know if you’ve seen a therapist during your illness, but it might be helpful to speak with a grief counselor about your feelings of betrayal and abandonment before you decide how, if it all, you’d like to speak with your ex-co-workers. If you do decide to respond, it may be easier for you to speak with your former boss instead of the entire office; tell him that you’d love to attend the office holiday party but haven’t received an invitation or heard anything from your former officemates during your illness. Give yourself permission to feel as upset as you need to feel. You’ve earned that.

More Dear Prudence Chat TranscriptsWashington (CNN) President Donald Trump launched an extraordinary denunciation Thursday of his critics, complaining he inherited a "mess" and slamming stories that his campaign was constantly in contact with Russia as "fake news."

Trump held court during a news conference that lasted an hour and fifteen minutes, carving out a stunning moment in modern American political history. He displayed a sense of anger and grievance rarely vented by a President in public -- let alone one who has been in office for just four weeks.

"I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly than the political media," Trump said, later slamming leaks to the press from the intelligence community -- some of which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.

"The leaks are real. The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake," Trump said.

While it was a marked contrast with the normal dynamics of a presidential news conference, the East Room show was vintage Trump. He touted his own poll numbers, victory over Hillary Clinton and discussed cable TV ratings and panel discussions.

"I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess."

That was the kind of message -- directed at large numbers of voters disgruntled with the performance of Washington's political establishment and delivered in a plainspoken, unvarnished manner -- that helped Trump win the presidency against all odds.

But his manner is also likely to offend or alarm other voters and may do little to alleviate skepticism towards Trump among political elites in Washington. Trump in fact predicted how his animated and unorthodox news conference will be interpreted in the press.

"Tomorrow, they will say: 'Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,'" Trump said. "I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it."

The general impression was of a president who is deeply frustrated at the way his new White House is being portrayed and who had decided to take matters into his own hands with a dramatic intervention.

The news conference was not scheduled until Thursday morning, but aides said Trump was itching to get out and defend himself.

A senior administration official told CNN's Jeremy Diamond that Trump walked into the Oval Office this morning and told his top aides: "Let's do a press conference today."

The news conference was "the President's idea, 100%" the official said.

"I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration," Trump said, after quickly announcing his new pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta

"We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done," Trump said.

And saying he resented picking up newspapers and turning on the television to hear reports that his White House was in chaos, Trump said, "This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine."

Trump's appearance betrayed apparent deep frustration not just with the media coverage of his White House and a desire to talk directly to the American people but also possibly dismay with aides charged with defending him.

"I don't mind a bad story if it's true," Trump said, but complained much of what was reported about his administration was unfair.

The President lashed out, for instance, at coverage of his temporary travel ban on nationals of seven mostly Muslim nations that caused a weekend of chaos at the nation's airports before being suspended by a federal court.

"We had a very smooth roll out of the travel ban. But we had a bad court," Trump said. "We had a bad decision, that is the only thing that is wrong with the travel ban."

But the President also said a new executive order would be tailored to the court's ruling to ensure that it could legally go into force.

Trump also accused holdovers from the Obama administration of leaking out information about his alleged contacts with Moscow to hammer his administration.

Trump was repeatedly pressed on whether his campaign staff had been in contact with Russia, as a widening drama over his alleged connections with Moscow dominates news coverage.

"Nobody that I know of. How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years," Trump said.

"I own nothing in Russia, I have no loans in Russia, I don't have any deals in Russia," Trump said. "Russia is fake news."Gelman stars in the film he co-wrote with Janicza.

Read MoreA federal judge, on Thursday, dismissed a defamation suit against Bill Cosby filed by actress Katherine McKee claiming that Cosby defamed her in his denial of her accusation that he raped her in a Detroit hotel room in 1974. “An accused person cannot be foreclosed ... from considering the issuance of a simple and unequivocal denial—free from overall defamatory triggers or contextual themes," the judge wrote. “In the court's view, such a situation would be inconsistent with basic First Amendment principles.”

“I remember I walked in the door, and he had a robe and cap on. He took the ribs from my hands and just grabbed me,” McKee said in December 2014. McKee was one of more than 50 women to come forward in the past several years alleging Cosby had sexually assaulted them. In almost all of these new cases, the statute of limitations on the alleged crime prevented criminal prosecution of Cosby. In response, dozens of accusers took up civil cases charging Cosby and his representatives had defamed them in his public relations push back and legal filings against the accusations. McKee was one of at least eight women that took their cases to Massachusetts, where Cosby owns a home, and sued him for defamation.Marc Piscotty/Getty Images

The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to repeal a rule Barack Obama signed in December as a Hail Mary effort to protect Planned Parenthood from GOP defunding efforts. The rule reiterates that state governments may not block federal family-planning funding from specific health care providers for any reason other than their ability to competently provide family-planning services. In other words, state legislators cannot deny Title X grants to certain clinics just because they offer abortion care.

Advocates for Thursday’s bill, which would roll back Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services rule if it passes the Senate and is signed by Donald Trump, say that states should be able to choose exactly how and where to spend the money the federal government gives out through Title X, the nation’s nexus of family-planning grants. This would make it easier for states to justify withholding federal funds from certain health care centers for political reasons, putting reproductive health clinics at risk of closure or hampered ability to provide care for uninsured and low-income patients.

When politicians talk about “defunding” Planned Parenthood, they’re usually talking about blocking affiliated clinics from accepting Medicaid reimbursements, which means blocking Medicaid patients from getting care including cancer screenings, contraception, and HIV testing at Planned Parenthood clinics. (Federal dollars are already ineligible for use in abortions in all but very few specific circumstances.) Planned Parenthood gets about 75 percent of its federal funding from these Medicaid dollars.

The other 25 percent is in the form of Title X grants, which funds family-planning services like contraception for more than 4 million people in the U.S. each year. Planned Parenthood serves about 1.5 million of those patients whose care is subsidized through Title X, and its clinics get Title X grants because they prove they’re best able to provide that family-planning care. If states decide to reroute that funding elsewhere, it will likely go to less-equipped or overburdened clinics, while Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion-care providers struggle to stay afloat. Some states, like Florida, have recommended that low-income patients in need of reproductive health care get their pap smears and birth control from dentists and elementary school nurses if Planned Parenthood loses funding and can no longer meet their needs.Story highlights Chaffetz has so far declined to investigate President Donald Trump's potential conflicts of interest

Trump's administration has been beset by damaging leaks over its first month

Washington (CNN) Two top House Republicans asked the Inspector General on Wednesday to investigate leaks surrounding the ouster of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The request came in a letter from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

"We request that your office begin an immediate investigation into whether classified information was mishandled here," the letter to the Inspector General read.

Trump's administration has been beset by damaging leaks over its first month, including reports of Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador to the US in December that ultimately led to his downfall.

Trump himself has decried such leaks as the "real scandal."

For an administration that has been generally dismissive of the historical role—and hostile to the contemporary reality—of black America, this tweet misspelling civil rights writer, thinker, and all-around icon W.E.B. Du Bois’ name is not a good look.The evolving “blooms” in this video are 3-D-printed sculptures made by John Edmark. Technically, they’re “phyllotactic spirals,” in which a tiny geometric pattern repeats, growing in size. Nature uses phyllotactic spirals all the time—think the floret of a daisy, or a pineapple. As Edmark says on his website, “If change is the only constant in nature, it is written in the language of geometry.”Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, chose to make the statement as an update to his original founder’s letter, which was published in 2012 when Facebook went public. In that letter, he wrote that the social network “was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected.”

In an interview this week at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Mr. Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, “the idea of connecting the world was not controversial.”

“The default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction,” he said. “Now, that’s actually a real question.”

Mr. Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains — making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order.

Against that backdrop, the timing of the letter is notable. While other technology executives, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, regularly update their founder letters each year — often tied to financial results — it is the first time Mr. Zuckerberg has refreshed Facebook’s mission statement since the company’s initial public offering.

Mr. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year’s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together.

“We have to build a global community that works for everyone,” he said. “I really don’t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term.”

Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. His letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of “social infrastructure” and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals.

One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this “social infrastructure” — essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests — mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said.

While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook’s finances.

Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, becoming one of the world’s biggest and most valuable public entities.

Yet the power that Facebook has amassed has raised hackles globally. The social network is blocked in China, has stumbled in India and is facing a thicket of regulatory questions in Europe. More recently, Mr. Trump’s election prompted an outcry over whether Facebook influenced the American electorate with false stories on its site. The company has scrambled to contain the fallout, undertaking several experiments to better sort through what people see on its site.

A key moment for Mr. Zuckerberg’s shift in thinking about how to be a global company happened six months ago. In September, Facebook censored an iconic photograph that featured a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Mr. Zuckerberg said the image, titled “The Terror of War,” was rightly censored by Facebook at the time because the company’s content policies did not allow child nudity.

Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value.

Mr. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook’s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company’s blanket global approach of the past decade or more.

“I don’t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “At some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves.”

Mr. Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to “very meaningful groups” — Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to — that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said.

To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook’s “safety check,” a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year.

Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook’s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook’s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying the social network is “not just technology or media.”

Facebook’s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger.

It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people, which in turn may increase the company’s profits.

“There’s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “I just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this.”“This strike force ought to take the form of a national state litigation team to challenge the E.P.A.’s overreach,” Mr. Miller said in an email to Mr. Pruitt’s office. “Like the Dalmatian at the proverbial firehouse, it could move out smartly when the alarm sounded.”

A Call to Arms

Mr. Miller’s pitch to Mr. Pruitt became a reality early last year at the historic Skirvin Hilton Hotel in Oklahoma City, where he brought together an extraordinary assembly of energy industry power brokers and attorneys general from nine states for what he called the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels.

The meeting took place in the shadow of office towers that dominate Oklahoma City’s skyline and are home to Continental Resources, a leader in the nation’s fastest-growing oil field, the Bakken formation of North Dakota, as well as Devon Energy, which drilled 1,275 new wells last year.

More liberal attorneys general, such as Douglas F. Gansler, Democrat of Maryland, did not participate.

“Indeed, General Gansler would in all likelihood try to hijack your summit,” Mr. Miller wrote to Mr. Pruitt in an email. “At best you would be left to preside over a debate, rather than a call to arms.”

Oklahoma energy companies were there, according to an agenda, joined by executives from Peabody Energy of Missouri, the world’s largest private-sector coal producer, as well as the Southern Company, which has aggressively challenged federal air pollution mandates.

The nation’s top corporate energy regulatory lawyers were there, too, including F. William Brownell, a senior partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams, which has spent more than 25 years fighting the enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

The event was organized by an energy-industry-funded law and economics center at George Mason University of Virginia. The center is part of the brain trust of conservative, pro-industry groups that have worked from the sidelines to help Mr. Pruitt and other attorneys general.

And there was nothing ambiguous about the agenda.

“Suggested Responses to Assaults on Federalism” was the topic of one breakfast meeting, moderated by Attorney General Wayne K. Stenehjem of North Dakota, that showcased Mr. Brownell and three other top corporate regulatory lawyers. Mr. Hamm was the featured dinner speaker.

Top Individual Recipients of Energy Industry Money Since 2004 Many attorneys general collect contributions directly from energy industry donors, in addition to money passed on from party associations. Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, for example, has received at least $215,574 from companies and industry employees since 2010, even though he ran unopposed in his most recent election.

“We need to ensure the robust role of the states,” said Paul M. Seby, another coal industry lawyer who attended. “And as the chief law enforcement officers, it is not surprising this is becoming a cornerstone of attorney generals’ attention.”

Attorneys general said they had no choice but to team up with corporate America. “When the federal government oversteps its legal authority and takes actions that hurt our businesses and residents, it’s entirely appropriate for us to partner with the adversely affected private entities in fighting back,” said Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida, whose top deputy attended the meeting.

A ‘Strike Force’

The impact of the gathering was immediate. A week later, a new Federalism in Environmental Policy task force was established by lawyers in the offices of 19 state attorneys general, according to email records obtained from the office of Attorney General Timothy C. Fox of Montana, who had participated in the Oklahoma meeting.

“This message is in follow-up to the excellent environmental conference put on last week by George Mason University and hosted by the Oklahoma attorney general’s office,” said one email sent by Katie Spohn, the deputy attorney general in Nebraska. “In order to continue our coordination of efforts regarding Federalism in Environmental Policy, I am seeking input from each state who participated in the conference.”

Mr. Miller was pleased. “Just the kind of strike force I was talking about,” he said in an interview.

And the input poured forth. The states worked to detail major federal environmental action, like efforts to curb fish kills, reduce ozone pollution, slow climate change and tighten regulation of coal ash. Then they identified which attorney general’s office was best positioned to try to monitor it and, if necessary, attempt to block it.

Follow-up by Mr. Pruitt’s federalism office often came after coordination with industry representatives, especially from Devon Energy. The company, one of the most important financial supporters for the Republican Attorneys General Association, is guarded about its public profile. But it readily turned to Mr. Pruitt and his staff for help, setting up meetings for the attorney general with its chief executive, its chief lobbyist and other important players.

“We have a clear obligation to our shareholders and others to be involved in these discussions,” John Porretto, a Devon spokesman, said in a statement.

While some of the exchanges were general in character, others were quite explicit, especially the communication about the E.P.A.’s methane regulations that had prompted Mr. Whitsitt, the Devon official, to propose that Mr. Pruitt send a letter to the agency.

“Just a note to pass along the electronic version of the draft letter to Lisa Jackson at E.P.A.,” said one September 2011 letter to Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff from Mr. Whitsitt. “We have no pride of authorship, so whatever you do on this is fine.”

Mr. Pruitt took the letter and, after changing just 37 words in the 1,016-word draft, copied it onto his state government letterhead and sent it to Ms. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator.

That was just one of his challenges to Washington. Devon officials also turned to Mr. Pruitt to enlist other Republican attorneys general and Republican governors to oppose a rule proposed by the Bureau of Land Management that would regulate hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on federal land.

“As promised, we are sending you the attached draft of the R.G.A./RAGA follow-up letter to President Obama opposing B.L.M.’s proposed rule,” Brent Rockwood, Devon’s director of government affairs, wrote to Mr. Pruitt’s staff in late 2012, in an email marked “confidential.”

Weeks later, that letter was sent to Mr. Obama without only a few word changes, signed by Mr. Pruitt and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who was the head of the Republican Governors Association at the time.

Company officials again expressed their pleasure to Mr. Pruitt.

“I’ve learned that we’re having an effect — and may be able to have more, perhaps even to having the rule withdrawn or shifted to almost a reporting-only one,” Mr. Whitsitt wrote, in another email marked “confidential.”

The rule — which the industry claims would cost $346 million a year to comply with — has still not been issued.

Coordination between the corporations and teams of attorneys general involved in the Rule of Law effort also involves actual litigation to try to clear roadblocks to energy projects, documents show.

Energy producers, for instance, wanted to sue the Interior Department as it considered adding animals such as the sage grouse — which nests near sites of oil and gas drilling — to a list of endangered species, a move that could put tens of thousands of acres off limits to new drilling.

The energy companies could have sued on their own, but their executives believed that the case would be more potent by bringing in Mr. Pruitt and the weight of the State of Oklahoma.

“We just came to the conclusion he would be the best person to be the lead attorney on this,” said Mike McDonald, an owner of Triad Energy, a small oil and gas exploration company, and the president of a group that calls itself the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance. “He has exceeded our expectations.”

For the industry, the state is an extremely valued partner because states are granted “special solicitude” from the federal courts, a critical advantage to private companies that helps confer legal standing and means that a matter is less likely to be dismissed.

Mr. Pruitt’s office, in a statement to The Times, rejected any suggestion that the attorney general has been wrong to send to Washington comment letters written by industry lobbyists, or to take up their side in litigation.

“The A.G.’s office seeks input from the energy industry to determine real-life harm stemming from proposed federal regulations or actions,” the statement said. “It is the content of the request not the source of the request that is relevant.”

Persuading lawmakers to offer legislation has been another effective lobbying tool. In West Virginia, Mr. Miller handed Attorney General Patrick Morrisey a draft of legislation that he argued would put West Virginia in a better position to sue the Obama administration over proposed regulations to tighten pollution controls on power plants, emails show.

“I trust you will find the legislation acceptable in its present form,” Mr. Miller wrote to Mr. Morrisey in February, referring to a private meeting the two had had in the law library of Mr. Morrisey’s office in Charleston. “If so, I would appreciate your having it introduced by your friends in both the Senate and the House.”

A version of the bill was introduced and passed by the West Virginia Legislature in March. Delegate Rupert Phillips Jr., the chief sponsor of a second bill that also contained language identical to what Mr. Miller had requested, said in an interview that he had acted with Mr. Morrisey’s support, an account supported by William B. Raney, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association.

“It is nice to have everybody singing from the same sheet of music,” Mr. Raney said.

A spokesman for Mr. Morrisey disputed this account, saying that while he supported the effort to challenge the rule, he did not play a role in promoting the legislation.

Blurred Lines

The work in Mr. Pruitt’s office has sometimes seemed to blur the distinction between his official duties and the advancement of his political career.

Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Crystal Drwenski, served as gatekeeper to his office, arranging meetings and helping companies get Mr. Pruitt and his staff to intervene with the federal authorities. But Ms. Drwenski also played an important supplemental role for the attorney general: fund-raising aide.

“A.G. Pruitt is working with the Republican Attorneys General Association on their national meeting in Washington,” Ms. Drwenski wrote to Mr. Whitsitt. “The benefit of membership and participation is having 25 Republican A.G.s in a room to discuss policy issues.”

Ms. Drwenski wanted Devon Energy’s help in enlisting the American Petroleum Institute, and Mr. Whitsitt agreed.

“I’ve put in a plug to A.P.I.,” Mr. Whitsitt wrote back to Ms. Drwenski, a few hours after her request, having reached out to the organization’s senior lobbyist, Marty Durbin. “He is expecting a call.”

In addition to the American Petroleum Institute, major energy companies — ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas company; Alpha Natural Resources, a coal mining giant; and American Electric Power, the nation’s biggest coal consumer — have recently joined the Republican Attorneys General Association, bringing in hundreds of thousands of additional dollars to the group, internal documents show.

By last year, the association was starting to pull in so much money under Mr. Pruitt’s leadership that it decided to break free from its partnership with the Republican State Leadership Committee, a group that represents state elected officials. Within months, the association also set up the Rule of Law Defense Fund, yet another legal entity that allows companies benefiting from the actions of Mr. Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general to make anonymous donations, in unlimited amounts. Fund-raising skyrocketed.

The $16 million that the association has collected this year is nearly four times the amount it collected in 2010, money it used mostly to buy millions of dollars’ worth of television advertisements in states like Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado and Nevada, all places where Republican candidates for attorney general won election.

The fund-raising has taken place on the state level as well. Oklahoma Gas & Electric — a for-profit utility that Mr. Pruitt joined with in federal court to fight the E.P.A. — invited its employees to the Petroleum Club in downtown Oklahoma City late last year for a fund-raising event for Mr. Pruitt, drawing donations from about 45 company employees, including the chief executive. Four days later, Mr. Pruitt filed a new appeal in the case — timing that the utility said was a coincidence.

Photo

While Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to raise money for the Republican Attorneys General Association have been an unqualified success, the lawsuits and regulatory appeals he has filed have yielded mixed results.

In May, the Supreme Court declined to take up the appeal on the Oklahoma Gas & Electric matter, meaning the company is now moving ahead on retrofitting its coal-burning plants. But other lawsuits are pending, including Mr. Pruitt’s challenge of the Dodd-Frank law, which rewrote the nation’s financial regulations, and, perhaps most important, his challenge of the tax subsidies that are a critical part of the Obama administration’s health care law.

Mr. Pruitt’s staff has juggled various duties — helping major corporations push their challenges against Washington, and then turning to these same executives, at times, to ask them for financial support.

For example, Ms. Drwenski, who is no longer Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, asked Devon Energy in 2012, on a workday afternoon, for help in signing up the American Petroleum Institute as a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association.

She used her personal email account to send out the initial request. But the subsequent exchange took place on her work email account, even though Oklahoma state law prohibits state officials from using state property or time to solicit political contributions. A spokesman for Mr. Pruitt said, “It is entirely possible she could have been taking a late lunch.”

Mr. Pruitt, who ran unopposed to win a second term, has not needed much of the money himself, but his fund-raising efforts have greatly benefited other Republicans running for the job.

That explains the partylike atmosphere late last month in South Florida, where members of the Republican Attorneys General Association held their fall meeting at the chic Fontainebleau Miami Beach, along with hundreds of lobbyists, lawyers and corporate executives, whose companies had paid as much as $125,000 for the privilege to celebrate with them.

During the opening reception, on a giant terrace overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, with red, white and blue lights beaming onto the walls and rock music blasting, the Republican attorneys general strode to the stage to trumpet their new majority in the states.

Mr. Pruitt was there for the weekend’s festivities, an event at which Devon Energy served as a corporate host, with banners hung in the hotel hallways featuring the corporate logo.

The Oklahoma attorney general’s stay was brief. The Rule of Law campaign had a new and urgent target.

“Our president sees himself as above the law,” Mr. Pruitt said from Oklahoma City as he announced several days later yet another front in the campaign, a lawsuit he planned to file to challenge the Obama administration’s new immigration policies. “We will take action to hold him accountable.The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “a bad high school student would understand.”

“This is highly unusual,” said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. “Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity.”

Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued.

Mr. Trump’s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack.

Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump’s comments “extremely self-defeating and self-destructive” because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump.

“Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under; it’s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,” said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush.

Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law.

“But those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it’s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,” Mr. Rosen said.

“Judicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,” he added, “and it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes.”

Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation.

“I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right.”

Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched “in amazement” Tuesday night as a three-judge federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security.

“I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s sad. I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today.”

His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing — the audio of which was carried live on national television — during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump’s order.

Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday.

Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, “I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge.”

The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush; and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama.

“If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they’d do what they should be doing,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s so sad.”

By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. “Right on — they were perfect,” Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton’s comments.

Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts; Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections.

John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history — the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake — on an insignificant matter.

“I hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,” said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “President Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency.”

Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts’ legitimacy.

“It’s not illegal, it’s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it’s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,” Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, “I always cringed.”

Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with “very evil intentions,” to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect.

That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump’s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans.

“Believe me, I’ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’re going to take care of it. We’re going to win.”Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

On Wednesday, CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski reported that Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller had been at the helm of something called the “Terrorism Awareness Project” while a student at Duke University in 2007:

Miller served as national campus coordinator, president, and co-founder of the initiative, which was launched by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a right-wing group which describes its missions as combating "the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror."

A key premise of the project, Miller wrote in a blog post, was that schools and universities under left-wing influence had failed to educate students about the risk of what the project's leaders called "Islamofascism" and had allowed the ideology to penetrate school systems and academia.

According to Kaczynski, the project organized around holding “Islamofascism Awareness Week” events at colleges around the country.

Miller’s group sold books by Robert Spencer, an Islamophobe who has said that “Islam is not a religion of peace” and whose activities are tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which studies hate groups. Spencer, who designed an ad for the project, told CNN that he was pleased Miller had attained a position in the White House. Miller is personally close to conservative writer David Horowitz, whose group runs Spencer's site Jihad Watch—Kaczynski writes that it was Horowitz who got Miller an early job as press secretary to former Rep. Michele Bachmann. “I know that he admires my work,” Horowitz told CNN. “As many normal people do."

In October, white nationalist Richard Spencer (no relation to Robert Spencer) told Mother Jones that he and Miller had bonded at Duke over “concerns that immigrants from non-European countries were not assimilating.”Most important, because these services allow people to communicate with one another more freely, they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among once-marginalized groups. These ad hoc social movements range widely in form, from “alt-right” white supremacists in the United States to Brexiters in Britain to ISIS in the Middle East to the hacker collectives of Eastern Europe and Russia. But each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable power, resulting in unpredictable, sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms.

“You now have billions of people on the internet, and most of them are not that happy with the status quo,” said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a research firm that forecasts global risks. “They think their local government is authoritarian. They think they’re on the wrong side of the establishment. They’re aggrieved by identity politics and a hollowed-out middle class.”

Many factors accounted for Mr. Trump’s win: middle-class economic anxiety in the industrial Midwest; an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national direction; and some mix of latent racism, xenophobia and sexism across the electorate. But as even Mr. Trump acknowledged in an interview with “60 Minutes” aired Sunday, social media played a determining role in the race.

In the past, Mr. Bremmer said, the concerns of Mr. Trump’s supporters might have been ignored, and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered. After all, he was universally written off by just about every mainstream pundit, and he faced disadvantages in money, organization and access to traditional political expertise. Yet by putting out a message that resonated with people online, Mr. Trump hacked through every established political order.

“Through this new technology, people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their grievances,” Mr. Bremmer said. “If it wasn’t for social media, I don’t see Trump winning.”

For people who like an orderly, predictable world, this is the scariest thing about Facebook; not that it may be full of lies (a problem that could potentially be fixed), but that its scope gives it real power to change history in bold, unpredictable ways.

But that’s where we are. It’s time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the world-shattering forces that their boosters long promised they would be — and to be unnerved, rather than exhilarated, by the huge social changes they could uncork.

This should come as no surprise. In a way, we are now living through a kind of bizarro version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media.

Over much of the last decade, we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world. There was the Green Revolution in Iran and the Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa. In the United States, we saw the Occupy Wall Street movement and the #BlackLivesMatter protests.

Social networks also played a role in electoral politics — first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of Howard Dean in 2003, and then in the election of the first African-American president in 2008.

Yet now those movements look like the prelude to a wider, tech-powered crackup in the global order. In Britain this year, organizing on Facebook played a major role in the once-unthinkable push to get the country to leave the European Union. In the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by opponents, managed to marshal a huge army of online supporters to help him win the presidency.

The Islamic State has used social networks to recruit jihadists from around the world to fight in Iraq and Syria, as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas.

And in the United States, both Bernie Sanders, a socialist who ran for president as a Democrat, and Mr. Trump, who was once reviled by most members of the party he now leads, relied on online movements to shatter the political status quo.

Why is this all happening now? Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University who has studied the effects of social networks, suggested a few reasons.

One is the ubiquity of Facebook, which has reached a truly epic scale. Last month the company reported that about 1.8 billion people now log on to the service every month. Because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among people, they become strikingly more powerful as they grow. With about a quarter of the world’s population now on Facebook, the possibilities are staggering.

“When the technology gets boring, that’s when the crazy social effects get interesting,” Mr. Shirky said.

One of those social effects is what Mr. Shirky calls the “shifting of the Overton Window,” a term coined by the researcher Joseph P. Overton to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss.

From about the early 1980s until the very recent past, it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the mainstream, things like overt calls to racial bias (there were exceptions, of course, like the Willie Horton ad). But the internet shifted that window.

“White ethnonationalism was kept at bay because of pluralistic ignorance,” Mr. Shirky said. “Every person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the TV about immigrants or was willing to say white Christians were more American than other kinds of Americans — they didn’t know how many others shared their views.”

Thanks to the internet, now each person with once-maligned views can see that he’s not alone. And when these people find one another, they can do things — create memes, publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview, and then break into the mainstream. The groups also become ready targets for political figures like Mr. Trump, who recognize their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for real-world victories.

Mr. Shirky notes that the Overton Window isn’t just shifting on the right. We see it happening on the left, too. Mr. Sanders campaigned on an anti-Wall Street platform that would have been unthinkable for a Democrat just a decade ago.

Now, after Hillary Clinton’s loss, the way forward for Democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on Facebook as by elites in Washington — and, as a result, we’re likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past.

The upshot is further unforeseen events. “We’re absolutely going to get more of these insurgent candidates, and more crazy social effects,” Mr. Shirky said.

Mr. Trump is just the tip of the iceberg. Prepare for interesting times.Photo

The Food and Drug Administration’s lethargic regulation of dietary supplements containing a dangerous stimulant described in recent reports in The Times is a classic example of what happens when industry representatives infiltrate the agency that is supposed to regulate them. The worrisome ingredient is BMPEA, a chemical nearly identical to amphetamine that is added to weight-loss and workout products in an effort to enhance their effect. Whether it does so is unclear, since there have never been tests of its effectiveness and safety in humans.

As noted in The Times, the F.D.A. was actually the first agency to suspect that BMPEA had been added improperly to supplements that listed among their ingredients a little-known plant called acacia rigidula. Experts say that listings like this are often tip-offs that the manufacturer is trying to disguise a chemical additive as a natural botanical extract. The agency tested 21 popular supplements that listed acacia rigidula on their labels and found that nine of them contained BMPEA.

The F.D.A. did not, however, recall the products, name them or issue a health alert. By contrast, in December, Canadian health authorities found the chemical “a serious health risk,” issued a public health alert and forced a recall of JetFuel Superburn, which they found to contain BMPEA and another amphetamine-like stimulant.

Much of the responsibility for the F.D.A.’s sluggish response must fall on Dr. Daniel Fabricant, who left a senior position at the Natural Products Association, a trade group for supplement makers and sellers, to head the F.D.A.’s division of dietary supplement programs in early 2011 and who jumped back to the trade association as its chief executive in the spring of 2014. He has been succeeded at the F.D.A. by several acting directors; the current one is Cara Welch, from the same trade group. Both dragged their feet on BMPEA.

Disturbed by the F.D.A.’s inaction, Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, and other academics conducted their own tests. In a paper published on Tuesday, they identified BMPEA in 11 of 21 brands of supplements with acacia rigidula listed as an ingredient. They urged an immediate recall of all supplements containing BMPEA. The Council for Responsible Nutrition, another leading trade group for the supplements industry, immediately joined in by urging the F.D.A. “to enforce the law” and remove products containing BMPEA from the market “before there are serious health consequences.” Some vitamin stores began doing so voluntarily.

The F.D.A. says it hires people with industry ties because it needs experts from diverse backgrounds in public health, academia, science and industry working collaboratively to produce the best health outcomes. And some experts say that an industry perspective helps the agency understand what impact a regulatory action might have in the business world.

But consumer advocates are surely right that putting the industry in charge of supplement regulation is like appointing the fox to guard the henhouse. Clearly, the F.D.A. should not allow industry insiders to fill key positions. A permanent solution is for Congress to enact conflict-of-interest laws forcing employees above a certain grade level at any agency to recuse themselves from official actions that affect a former employer or client, including trade associations and their members.Slate is a daily magazine on the web.

Media coverage, press releases, and awards.President Donald Trump's acceptance of Beijing's demand that he re-commit to a "one China" policy was heavily influenced by his new top diplomat, who argued behind the scenes that relations would remain on hold until Trump cleared up doubts about a longtime bedrock of U.S.-China ties, officials said.

The abrupt course adjustment, made public in a White House statement on Thursday after a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, followed White House meetings this week involving Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Tillerson joined Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn and others in what one administration official described as a concerted effort to persuade the president that "this is the right way to go, this is right for the relationships and regional stability - and they won the day."

The successful intervention by Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive with no previous diplomatic experience who was confirmed just nine days ago, suggests that in a White House-dominated administration, the new secretary of state could help drive decisions on some geopolitical issues.

Tillerson's sway on other Trump priorities, such as fighting Islamic State, countering Iran and improving ties with Russia, remains to be seen.

Chinese anger toward Trump has simmered since December when he spoke to the president of Taiwan and said the United States did not have to stick to the "one China" policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. Beijing considers self-ruled Taiwan a renegade province.

China had signaled to Washington that there would be no phone call between Trump and Xi and the relationship could not move forward until Trump reaffirmed the "one China" policy, one of the U.S. officials said.

U.S.-based China experts said Trump’s change of tack should help ease tensions and open the way for discussions across the board. But they cautioned that this does not suggest a softening of Trump’s stance over other issues, including the contested South China Sea, his threat of high tariffs on Chinese goods and his pressure on Beijing to rein in North Korea.

But Trump's acquiescence on an issue of extreme Chinese nationalist sensitivity also "creates the risk that the Chinese will conclude that Trump is tough in his rhetoric but can be rolled if they apply sufficient pressure," said Bonnie Glaser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The White House and State Department had no immediate comment.

Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump signaled on Friday that he was pleased to have broken the ice with Xi, describing the call as a "very, very warm conversation."

But he also noted that he had long complained that China’s currency was undervalued and predicted that "a level playing field" in terms of trade would be reached between the two countries sooner than many people think.

Tillerson’s emerging role suggests that he could be a moderating influence with both friends and adversaries who have been unnerved at times by Trump’s rhetoric and unpredictability.

The secretary of state played a role in crafting the "one China" statement but it was not immediately clear whether he or others met directly with Trump to make the case for issuing it. Another major player on the issue was Flynn, who spoke by phone to China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, on Feb. 3, the sources said.

As an oil executive, Tillerson had a complicated history with China. He had regular dealings with China’s state-run oil companies over Exxon Mobil’s longtime business interests there, but also developed oil exploration ties with Vietnam, which has territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea.

During his Senate confirmation hearings last month, Tillerson raised Chinese ire when he said China should be denied access to islands it is building in the South China Sea.

But in written responses to follow-up questions from lawmakers that surfaced this week after his confirmation, Tillerson softened his language, saying that in the event of an unspecified "contingency" the United States and its allies "must be capable of limiting China's access to and use of" those islands to pose a threat.Streeter Lecka/Getty Images

Clemson won the national championship on a pick play. Sorry, a “rub route,” one in which Alabama cornerback Marlon Humphrey got picked—er, rubbed—at the goal line, allowing Tigers wide receiver and future New England Patriots draftee Hunter Renfrow to break wide open for the last-second, game-winning score in Clemson’s 35–31 victory. This was a scandal! This was interference! This was the exact same play Alabama used to win a tight game against LSU two years ago!

It’s not surprising that the two best teams in college football would dabble in red-zone frottage. Every team does whatever it takes to score—at least, every team that’s serious about winning a national title. Still, it was fitting that the Tigers won their title-game rematch against what was supposed to be Nick Saban’s best team ever by doing Alabama things to Alabama. Clemson’s Dabo Swinney, who won a national championship as a player at Alabama in 1992 and coached at the school from 1993 to 2000, molded his team in the image of the Crimson Tide.

Under Saban, Alabama won four titles in seven years thanks to a simple championship formula: Get the best players in the country and put them in position to succeed. The Tide gets more five-star recruits—the best of the best high school players—than most conferences bring in collectively. Alabama has signed 23 five-star players in the past five years. Clemson has signed five. Those high school heroes get faster, stronger, and smarter once they get to campus. Saban’s defensive linemen, linebackers, corners, and safeties always seem to know what play is coming. They don’t give up touchdowns because they don’t make mistakes. And when Saban saw high-tempo, no-huddle offenses shake up the sport, he brought in Lane Kiffin to modernize his team’s offense, ensuring that Alabama’s superior skill players wouldn’t be hamstrung by an outdated system.

Clemson lost last year’s title game 45–40 because it screwed up one too many times. In particular, the Tigers seemed to forget that tight end O.J. Howard was an eligible receiver. The Tigers did it again on Monday night, allowing the perpetually-underutilized-except-against-Clemson Howard to break free for a long touchdown pass that gave Alabama a 24–14 lead late in the third quarter.

All OJ Howard does is light up Clemson https://t.co/QwpSaosYRW pic.twitter.com/l4ftciSVff — SB✯Nation CFB (@SBNationCFB) January 10, 2017

That was … not good. It was also an outlier, the only glaring mental blunder I can recall either team making all night. This was professional football, played by athletes who are coached by professionals and trained like professionals and essentially are professionals except for the getting-paid-more-than-the-fixed-cost-of-a-college-scholarship part. If the Howard play was an unusual departure, Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware’s read of quarterback Jalen Hurts’ sweep in the second quarter represents everything the Tigers did right. Boulware knew the play was coming, told his teammates to move over to stop it, and then led a marauding horde into the Alabama backfield, where Hurts got tackled for a 4-yard loss.

This is the kind of thing Alabama does to other teams. The Crimson Tide make you look bad, and they make you feel dumb. But Clemson wasn’t outclassed or outsmarted on Monday night. Although the Tigers’ talent isn’t on par with Alabama’s at every roster spot, Clemson’s lineup is pretty damn loaded. Wide receiver Mike Williams was the freakiest athlete in Raymond James Stadium, and young defensive linemen Dexter Lawrence and Christian Wilkins led a Clemson front seven that pressured Hurts into his worst passing performance all year. Boulware and the Tigers defense knew what Alabama wanted to do, and Deshaun Watson and the Clemson offense kept the Tide off balance with formation shifts, jet sweeps, and up-tempo play-calling—various gadgetry that forced Alabama’s gaggle of five-stars to account for all manner of speedy, orange-legged playmakers: Williams, Renfrow, receiver Deon Cain, running back Wayne Gallman, tight end Jordan Leggett, Watson himself.

It was clear from watching the last two title games that Clemson is SEC-level serious about putting a national title–grade product on the field. And it is clear from looking at this snazzy online presentation that Clemson is beyond SEC-level serious about building a national title–grade football facility. That $55 million building, which is scheduled to open in the next few months, will include an “outdoor village” with a beach volleyball court, a laser tag venue, and an indoor slide, all of which seem like a lot of fun, and all of which also seem like great ways to test whether a player has passed the concussion protocol. In a world where paying quarterbacks and receivers is a bad idea because, per Alabama athletic director Bill Battle, they’ll spend that cash on “tattoos and rims,” fashioning an indoor slide is the best way for a program to indicate that it’s a big player in the business of college athletics. As of 2017, Clemson is a very, very big player. Whee!

All the progress Clemson has made on roster and facility construction since Swinney took over as head coach in 2008 gave the South Carolina school the opportunity to make the national championship game. But it took a player, Deshaun Watson, to win it. In his last game as a collegian, the Clemson quarterback got knocked around on the ground and in the air.On immigration, the road to the noxious nativism of Donald Trump was paved by centrist Democrats and moderate Republicans.

In November 2009, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano laid out President Barack Obama’s immigration agenda at the Center for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank with close ties to the White House. After eight years of George W. Bush, voters seemed to expect change. But on immigration, Napolitano pledged to achieve reform through more of the same.

Comprehensive reform comprised a “three-legged stool,” she said, echoing centrist conventional wisdom: legal status for undocumented immigrants, greater opportunities for authorized immigration, and an enforcement crackdown. As usual, the crackdown would come first.

“It’s an affront to every law-abiding citizen and every employer who plays by the rules,” said Napolitano, referring to the presence of an estimated 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants. “We are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.”

Napolitano’s insistence on enforcement measures like mass deportations as a precondition for legalization mirrors the recent political history of immigration reform in this country. Under Obama and Bush, business-aligned “establishment” wings of both major parties have tried to use tough enforcement policies in an effort to gain the cooperation of the virulently xenophobic right wing for the other two legs of the stool. But that cooperation never came.

Reformers failed to advance legalization — they could never bring the right to the table. But they did succeed in dramatically expanding punitive immigration enforcement.

The enforcement-first strategy has resulted in hundreds of miles of border fencing, a dramatically enlarged Border Patrol, a brutally efficient deportation pipeline — and a hard right that is more insistent on mass deportations and border walls than ever. Legalization efforts collapsed along with the political center that championed it.

The three-legged stool was supposed to protect “hardworking” immigrants and deport those who were undesirable criminals. In reality, centrists deployed just one leg — and it was used to relentlessly beat up on immigrants of all sorts.

Finally, under pressure from immigrant rights groups, Obama took executive action to shield many from deportation. But his administration had already spent years orchestrating mass deportations, deepening the links between immigration enforcement and the criminal justice system, and pledging to secure an already-militarized border — thus lending credence to right-wing sentiment that immigrants are criminals or hostile foreign agents.

Seeking to placate the right wing, the bipartisan establishment ended up angering everyone: Obama prompted the anti-deportation movement to mobilize against him and fed into a false narrative about unsecured borders and criminal aliens that helped lead to the rise of Donald Trump.

Trump made his way to the top of the Republican Party by calling immigrants criminals and rapists. But he wasn’t the first to use such rhetoric on his own — Democrats and moderate Republicans had endorsed such ideas for years. Immigrants were caught in the crossfire. And there they remain.

Obama’s Deportation Pipeline

The centerpiece of Obama’s deportation efforts, and the best window into the Democrats’ lurch toward the right on immigration, was the Secure Communities program, initiated under Bush in October 2008.

Secure Communities gave the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) access to an FBI database of fingerprints entered by local law enforcement after an arrest. As a result, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) received a flood of positive identifications on deportable immigrants.

ICE then issued a cascade of “detainers,” asking that immigrants be held for forty-eight hours past their release time — or far longer, given that detainers blocked people from getting released on bail — for pickup and, ultimately, deportation proceedings. By 2013, according to testimony from a Migration Policy Institute analyst before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Secure Communities was responsible for a majority of all deportations.

Secure Communities initially received little media attention even as grassroots immigrant rights groups saw people in their communities being deported and began to mobilize against it. In November 2009, when DHS announced that Secure Communities had “identified more than 111,000 criminal aliens in local custody during its first year,” the program was still little known.

That changed in April 2010 when Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the virulently anti-immigrant law SB 1070, which among other things directed local law enforcement to search out people suspected of being undocumented immigrants even if they had committed no crime. The “show me your papers” law energized immigrant activists and liberals wary of the Tea Party’s rise nationwide, and drew a successful legal challenge from the Obama Administration.

SB 1070 drew a successful legal challenge from the Obama Administration. Immigrant rights activists, however, seized the opportunity to point out that Obama’s Secure Communities wasn’t altogether unlike SB 1070: both turned local law enforcement into immigration agents and created an automated deportation pipeline that began in local jails.

“Any mundane encounter with police officers could quickly become a life-changing problem for many migrants, whether they were in the United States with the federal government’s permission or not,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a professor at University of Denver Sturm College of Law.

Unlike Arizona’s unabashedly right-wing law, Obama’s soft-spoken and sanitized mass deportation program was implemented with little scrutiny. Immigrant rights activists, however, were determined to link the two and turned to city halls nationwide in an effort to thwart Secure Communities at its entry point.

Advocates charged that the program made local police a de facto arm of ICE and that immigrants would be afraid to report common crimes. The program could also, they warned, incentivize local police to make racially biased stops, using common offenses like traffic violations as a pretext to hand people over to ICE.

A growing number of elected officials and law enforcement leaders echoed this criticism. In May 2010, the Washington, D.C., City Council unanimously announced their support for a resolution calling on the city to boycott Arizona—part of a nationwide movement—alongside a bill instructing police to not share arrest data with DHS. Other cities, like Arlington, Virginia, and Santa Clara, California, tried to block Secure Communities as well. In 2011, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts announced that they were pulling out of the program.

But it turned out that it would be nearly impossible to do so. That August, DHS tore up their agreements with localities and asserted that the program was essentially mandatory.

All along, ICE had sent mixed messages about whether localities could actually opt out, suggesting at some points that it was voluntary, at other times that it was compulsory. Now, ICE was on the defensive. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network and others filed a major public records lawsuit, revealing internal discussions about how to handle the rebellion. One takeaway, according to the federal judge handling the case, was that there was “ample evidence that ICE and DHS have gone out of their way to mislead the public about Secure Communities.”

Activists had forced the federal government to reveal that its mass deportation campaign had always been premised on a lie: it wasn’t federal cooperation with localities but rather a negotiation-free imposition. ICE was happy for localities to believe Secure Communities was voluntary only so long as everyone volunteered.

By the end of 2010, the percentage of individuals targeted by detainers who were actually taken into ICE custody fell to 57.7 percent, down from 71.8 percent in October 2008, according to data analyzed by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC. In December 2012, it fell to just 54.6 percent. In part, that might have been due to ICE lacking the capacity to deport the huge number of undocumented immigrants flagged by the new system. It also likely reflected the spreading resistance to the program.

Obama was pushing hard on deportations in an effort to appease the Right. Instead, he provoked the Latino communities that formed a critical part of the Democratic coalition to mobilize against him — while the Right remained unsatisfied.

Obama’s criminalization of immigrant communities, however intensive, isn’t new. It built on policies dating back to the Reagan Administration. For decades, immigration enforcement, long primarily a civil matter, has become entangled with the criminal justice system. Experts call it “crimmigration.”

The term applies to programs like Secure Communities, which use the criminal justice system to enforce immigration laws, and also to the fact that immigration enforcement became a driver of mass incarceration. Tens of thousands of border crossers are now behind bars at any given moment — not only in civil detention centers pending deportation but also in federal penitentiaries serving hard time.

Federal prosecutions of immigrants charged with illegally reentering the country, a felony, rose steadily under Presidents Clinton and Bush, then skyrocketed under Obama. Prosecutions for illegally entering the country, a misdemeanor, have jumped as well. Today, people convicted of immigration-related related offenses make up roughly 9 percent of the federal prison population, or 15,702 inmates.

Obama certainly didn’t invent crimmigration. That distinction belongs to politicians waging the war on drugs during the 1980s and 1990s, who tied the narcotic threat to immigrants. As has become clear this election, the Right can easily link distinct sources of perceived external threat to one another in Americans’ minds.

It was a key early drug-war law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which made the first statutory reference to detainers, says Christopher Lasch, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law. Later, those detainers would become the key tool under Secure Communities to transfer immigrants from local to federal custody.

“Often, those dealing drugs have entered this country illegally and show absolutely no fear of United States law,” Rep. Gary Ackerman, a Democrat from New York, said at the time. If a suspect in local custody “is determined to be an illegal alien the INS must take the necessary actions to detain the suspect and process the case.”

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 also tied immigrants to the narcotic threat, subjecting noncitizens convicted of the newly coined category of “aggravated felonies,” defined as murder, drug trafficking and firearms trafficking, to mandatory detention, said García Hernández.

But the nativist right wasn’t yet setting the agenda because establishment figures like President Ronald Reagan, who opposed restrictionist policies in part because of his alliance with business, were firmly in control. In 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized nearly 2.7 million immigrants, increased the size of the Border Patrol and, in a move that prompted opposition from Latino civil rights groups, included a crackdown on employers who hired unauthorized immigrants.

Just as today, establishment centrists paired enforcement with legalization. Ultimately, however, the country’s last major legalization program was a big success. But the employer sanctions failed to have much impact, and unauthorized migration from Mexico grew.

Still, nativists had not yet gained traction and centrists maintained the upper hand. In 1990 President George H.W. Bush signed a law that actually expanded authorized immigration. The nativists, however, would soon come off the fringe.

The contemporary nativist movement dates to the late 1970s and was rooted in hysterical concerns over population growth’s purported effect on the environment. And, of course, racism: a 1965 law abolished a long-standing and unabashedly discriminatory system favoring Europeans, causing immigration from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean to soar, in addition to the influx of refugees from Communist nations. Legal pathways for Mexican workers, however, had narrowed over the years. Unauthorized flows of Mexican migrants, largely dictated by economic conditions on the both sides of the border, rose dramatically.

In the early 1990s, the movement exploded as an anti-immigrant earthquake shook American politics. California was its epicenter. A recession had taken hold, and the number of immigrants, authorized and not, was growing. In 1990, the estimated number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States stood at 3.5 million, and would rise to 5.7 million five years later.

For decades, hostility toward immigration has risen and fallen alongside the unemployment rate. In California, the nativist right seized the opportunity with the 1994 passage of Proposition 187.

Prop 187 denied public services to undocumented immigrants and required localities to report them to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS, the federal immigration agency before the post-9/11 reorganization creating DHS). It asserted that people in California, which at the time was home to more than one-third of all foreign-born people nationwide, “suffered” not only “economic hardship” but also “personal injury and damage caused by the criminal conduct of illegal immigrants in this state.”

Republican Gov. Pete Wilson made the proposition a centerpiece of his reelection campaign and rode it to victory.

According to Frank Sharry, a longtime advocate and the executive director of the major immigrant rights organization America’s Voice, “The anti-immigrant groups were trying to figure out how to catch fire. And they were really effective at using the media, particularly newsmagazine shows,” said Sharry.

Demagogues, as they would continue to do over the following decades, took advantage of economic anxiety and security concerns to foment xenophobic sentiment. After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, far-right Republican presidential contender Pat Buchanan charged that “foreigners are coming into this country illegally and helping to burn down one of the greatest cities in America.”

“I can’t understand why this Administration fails to enforce the laws and close that border,” Buchanan told a crowd of senior citizens. “If I were President, I would have the Corps of Engineers build a double-barrier fence that would keep out 95 percent of the illegal traffic. I think it can be done.”

In 1994, Newt Gingrich’s Republicans won control of Congress and the nativist tide rolled into Washington. But they rolled in with President Bill Clinton’s assistance.

Clinton merged his wars on crime and drugs with an immigration crackdown, signing the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, or IIRIRA, which harshly punished immigrants who had committed crimes. The law transformed immigration policy by making it easier to deport immigrants (undocumented and permanent residents alike) for a growing number of criminal offenses, made those individuals’ detentions mandatory and foreclosed most opportunities for relief. It also authorized a program called 287(g), which allowed the federal government to authorize local law enforcement to enforce immigration law.

“There certainly were things that the administration did not like in the bill,” said Doris Meissner, INS Commissioner under Bill Clinton and currently a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. “And there were things that when it came to implementation, the way we went about implementing it was not necessarily what was pleasing to a lot people in the Congress. But [Clinton] was not about to be vetoing an immigration enforcement bill in ‘96 given the law enforcement agenda that he was pursuing, of which immigration enforcement was a part.”

Meissner said the administration slow-walked implementation, failing to sign a single 287(g) agreement to deputize local law enforcement and jails to enforce immigration law and only narrowly implementing “expedited removal” (which allows authorities to deport some migrants with little recourse to any judicial review).

At the time, the debate consuming centrist Democrats and Republicans was over how much to push back against the anti-immigrant right. There wasn’t so much a discussion over legalizing undocumented immigrants so much as whether to cut the number of authorized immigrants allowed into the country. When it came to enforcement, the question was not whether the policy should be harsh, but just how harsh it should be.

“The mid-nineties was when the anti-immigrant crowd really gained a lot of momentum,” said Sharry. They “made significant headway in their desire to characterize immigrants as welfare cheats, as criminals, as threats to the economy” and, after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, “as security threats . . . The combined effect was to criminalize immigration in a dramatically new way.”

Unlike the centrists who would follow, Clinton wasn’t preoccupied with immigration reform’s three-legged stool. For Clinton, it was just about enforcement, which he tried to use to ward off Republican attacks. Clinton spent heavily on the INS, and to increase the size of the Border Patrol. His chief of staff, Leon Panetta, boasted of the administration’s “comprehensive anti-illegal immigration policy that beefs up our border and workplace enforcement inspections and has used the criminal justice system to deport a record number of criminals and other illegal aliens.”

Clinton laid the groundwork for a deportation pipeline that operationalized a rapidly-growing criminal justice system to remove millions from the country, militarized the border, and nurtured a paranoiac far-right narrative about a criminal alien invasion. This was all in an attempt to outflank the Republicans. But Clinton ended up just capitulating to the Right’s punitive demands. The pattern would repeat itself again and again over the following two decades. During the Clinton years, the parameters of the debate over immigration, much as with welfare and crime, were set by conservatives.

“He saw law enforcement as an issue that he wanted Democrats to basically take back from Republicans,” said Meissner. “Illegal immigration was increasing and increasing and that was politically an initiative that Clinton felt — in the same way that he felt with welfare reform — that was part of a new Democratic-centrist set of ideas and commitments.”

The goal was to strike a tough pose, tacking to the right in an effort to capture the center while staying just to Republicans’ left.

Staying to Republicans’ left, of course, was easy. During the 1996 presidential campaign, Republican candidate Bob Dole went so far as to support a proposal that would allow states to deny undocumented children access to public schools. He even attacked Clinton for making it so that “illegal aliens afflicted with AIDS cannot be denied taxpayer-funded medical treatment, no matter how high the cost.”

One terror-inducing Dole attack ad slammed Clinton for opposing California’s Prop 187 and accused him of giving “citizenship to aliens with criminal records” against a stark backdrop of prisoners and young and ostensibly Chicano men walking down the street.

“Twenty thousand in our prisons; four hundred thousand crowd our schools. Every year they cost us $3 billion tax dollars,” the narrator intoned. “We pay the taxes. We are the victims. Our children get shortchanged. If Clinton wins, we lose.”

Clinton, who responded to Dole’s attacks with an ad that boasted of signing “a tough anti-illegal immigration law protecting US workers,” won big in part by simultaneously cracking down on immigrants and casting Republicans as extremists.

Republicans, said University of Oregon political scientist Daniel Tichenor, were “trying to crack down on a problem that their base perceived as critical” while Clinton was “trying to be reactive and I think quite skilled at . . . casting Republicans as broadly anti-immigrant.” The president won a greater share of Latino and Asian voters in 1996 than he had in 1992.

While Clinton may have scored a short-term political victory, the real advantage would accrue to the Right. The myriad problems perceived to be caused by immigrants were becoming inseparable in American politics.

Criminality was mentioned alongside concerns over government spending and labor competition, and the criminal justice system was becoming a key enforcement tool. The war on crime shaped Clinton’s approach not only to traditional law and order matters but to immigration as well. It helped to craft a legal and political template — and a fundamentally punitive and criminological way of thinking about immigration — that would shape policy from then on.

The Post-9/11 Backlash

By the end of his second term, Clinton had done so much to outflank his right-wing critics that further crackdowns or restrictionist measures landed on the back burner.

“A couple of years ago people were advocating to build a wall around the country,” Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican, said in 1998. ”That’s no longer the case. Before, we had heard only one side of the immigration issue. Now, we get to talk about some of the positive contributions immigrants have made.”

As the economy boomed and more virulent xenophobia declined, a push to legalize unauthorized immigrants, who numbered an estimated 8.6 million in 2000, took shape. That year, the AFL-CIO, thanks to new, progressive leadership, announced a historic shift to embrace legalizing undocumented workers.

But mostly, the subject went unmentioned. A New York Times story on presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush’s aggressive courtship of the Hispanic vote only mentioned immigrants once in passing. Unemployment was down, so unsurprisingly, immigration was not discussed in any of the presidential debates.

With nativist anger at a nadir, after Bush took office in 2001, his aides discussed a legalization program. The president was negotiating with his Mexican counterpart and friend, Vicente Fox. Bush had won just over one-third of the Latino vote. But his pollsters predicted he would have to do even better to win reelection in 2004. Conservative states like Utah, North Carolina and Tennessee were issuing drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants. The rise of Bush, who liked to break into Spanish at campaign events and touted a “compassionate conservative” agenda, suggested that the Republican pendulum had swung away from Gov. Wilson’s harsh rhetoric of the mid-1990s.

But after the September 11 attacks, everything about immigration, like so many political issues, was transformed. The discussion shifted sharply back to enforcement.

Hundreds of immigrants, often from majority-Muslim countries, were quickly jailed and held on immigration charges — often in what the Justice Department inspector general found to be physically and verbally abusive conditions — and then deported. Tens of thousands of noncitizens from a list of almost exclusively Muslim and Arab nations were forced to register with authorities.

”If a loophole can be exploited by an immigrant, it can also be exploited by a terrorist,” said one DHS official, summarizing the new conventional wisdom linking national security and immigration.

The national security scare spiraled into a nationwide panic over immigration. Using tools signed into law by Clinton, Bush increasingly relied on the criminal justice system to crack down. This time, the goal wasn’t so much to placate or outflank the right. Rather, it was one piece of the domestic War on Terror’s new national security state, indifferent to civil liberties, that rose from the World Trade Center’s ashes.

“People start to see immigration as a real national security issue,” said Juliet Stumpf, a professor at Lewis & Clark Law School. “After September 11, there is a real emphasis on using the crimmigration deportation grounds and mandatory detention.”

After the attacks, local police began to play a major role in enforcement. The first agreement deputizing local cops or jails to conduct immigration enforcement was signed in 2002, even though they had been authorized since Clinton signed them into law in 1996, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, the leading anti-immigrant think tank. Thanks to the terrorist attack, an issue that hadn’t interested many Americans just a few years prior was now a preeminent domestic policy concern.

By 2004, presidential debate moderator Bob Schieffer told Bush and John Kerry that he had received “more email this week on” immigration “than any other question.” Bush, who had just that year proposed a legalization program, responded by attacking his opponent for backing “amnesty.” Kerry, while defending legalization, falsely asserted that “the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11,” adding that “we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.”

Once again, the right wing had set the parameters of debate over immigration with Democrats’ eager acquiescence. Supposed centrists from both parties stood by proposals to legalize undocumented immigrants but conveyed outright lies about border security in an effort to win credibility. Predictably, that effort not only failed but actually backfired, further stoking post-9/11 nativist public sentiment.

“Perhaps people feel like that is the politically necessary thing to say in order to gain Republican support to move forward with other things that we truly need to do, like immigration reform,” said Democratic US Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, Texas, asked about the bipartisan track record of demonizing the border. “But it only adds to the impression that the average American has that the border is out of control, that it’s lawless, that it’s a security concern that must be contained — a complete departure from reality.”

In 2005, the undocumented population reached an estimated 11.1 million, and right-wing anti-immigrant politics increasingly set the tone. Volunteer members of an anti-immigrant militia called the Minuteman Project were patrolling the border, and Arizona and New Mexico declared states of emergency. That December, Wisconsin Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner’s harsh enforcement bill passed the House, prompting millions of immigrants to protest in the streets in historic demonstrations the following year.

Xenophobic measures began to spring up locally as well: The mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, asked that state troopers to enforce immigration laws. In 2006, Hazleton, Pennsylvania, barred landlords from renting to undocumented immigrants.

Large-scale immigration from Mexico had made its way far beyond California, Texas, and New York and into bastions of white conservatism like Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Georgia. Working-class people had been in long-term crisis and were about to be hit by the largest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression. Unauthorized immigration had skyrocketed and the country was heading toward becoming minority-majority. Demagogues had a field day.

“This is a function of the economy,” said Meissner, referring to migrant flows. “But of course, immigration is more than the economy — it’s social issues, cultural issues, and ultimately issues of identity. And the country is changing under people’s noses, and a great deal of it is people coming illegally. That was more and more a set of contradictions and set of political tensions.”

Sensenbrenner’s bill failed to pass the Senate, and he accused Bush, who supported comprehensive reform legislation in the Senate, of shying away from his proposed crackdown. But the president, like his successor, would engage in a crackdown of his own. Quixotically, the goal of this iron-fisted policy was, as it would be under Obama, to make the case for reform.

“I’ve made no secret about the fact we need a comprehensive program,” said DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff at the time. An enforcement crackdown “clarifies the choices we have . . . The choices are clear, and the consequences of the choices are clear.”

The Bush administration orchestrated massive workplace raids. In one case, nearly 1,300 immigrants were rounded up Swift & Company meatpacking plants nationwide. A number were prosecuted and sentenced to federal prison for identity theft because they had used fraudulent Social Security cards to gain employment.

In a recent interview, Chertoff confirmed that crackdown was intended in part “to establish credibility with respect to enforcement, which would then enable reforms in a more comprehensive way.” Obviously, that didn’t happen.

Bush had backed repeated Congressional efforts to pass comprehensive reform. In 2007, they failed spectacularly when liberal critics opposed to guest-worker programs and right-wing anti-immigrant legislators blocked a measure crafted by Senators Ted Kennedy and Republicans. Expanding guest worker programs has long been a priority for business-aligned legislators. The undocumented labor force provides employers with a second-class labor market that is easy to exploit: for business, reform was worthwhile if it maintained that system in a legalized form. When the effort fell apart, however, the crackdown continued.

“It was pretty clear there wasn’t going to be legislation, but we still felt it was important to establish that, one way or the other, the government was going to apply the law,” said Chertoff. “And we’re not going to back down on enforcement. Because there had been a sense that somehow enforcement in the past had been relaxed because of political pressure.”

In other words, the Bush Administration, frustrated at right-wing opposition to legalization, engaged in a massive deportation campaign to please the Right. The Right accepted the gift and offered nothing in return.

The nuances of this failed political wheeling and dealing were likely not appreciated by many immigrants. Their reality, courtesy of ostensible reform allies in the Bush Administration, was persecution.

Meanwhile, local police and jails were playing a growing role on the frontlines of enforcement. By 2008, sixty-seven 287(g) agreements in total were in place nationwide, according to CIS. In Arizona, ICE signed an agreement with Gov. Napolitano’s Department of Public Safety. So did Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, notorious for running an abusive desert jail camp and for using his deputies and posses to hunt down undocumented immigrants in Phoenix, arrest critical journalists, persecute political enemies, and even investigate Obama’s place of birth.

In the mid-2000s, harsh immigration enforcement became Arpaio’s calling card and made him a right-wing folk hero. First, however, he had made a political pact with Napolitano.

The two had long been close, according to former Arizona Republic reporter Tom Zoellner. In Slate, Zoellner writes that as US Attorney during the mid-1990s, Napolitano protected Arpaio during a Justice Department investigation into abuse at his Tent City Jail. During Napolitano’s 2002 run for governor, Arpaio paid her back by appearing in a commercial that may have proved decisive in a contest that she won by fewer than twelve thousand votes.

After taking office as governor, Napolitano looked the other way as complaints of Arpaio’s abusive and racist practices mushroomed. Then, she moved to Washington to take over at DHS and left Jan Brewer and the Republicans’ unabashedly anti-immigrant agenda in control.

Napolitano had tapped right-wing anti-immigrant sentiment to consolidate her power in Arizona. Taking a similar tack under Obama, she would orchestrate mass deportations in an effort to convince Republicans that the administration was serious about enforcement. Once again, establishment Democrats, like their Republican counterparts, would do the Right’s work for them in an effort to win a business-friendly reform. Immigration enforcement, and its ever-tightening linkage with the criminal justice system, increasingly took on a life of its own independent of any realistic political program.

Obama’s Failed Strategy

In 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain who, under right-wing pressure, had backed away from the very comprehensive reform legislation he had once championed. On immigration, the Republican business-friendly center had been consumed by the far right. It was Obama who, pledging reform, adopted Bush’s centrist mantle — and, along with it, the principle that harsh enforcement was the way to secure right-wing support.

Obama embraced Secure Communities rather than workplace raids as his enforcement tool of choice. The program, developed under Bush, was seen as a cost-effective force multiplier, employing local law enforcement to detain immigrants rather than an expensive army of federal agents. It also promised better public relations, deporting not sympathetic low-wage workers but the “apprehension and removal of dangerous criminal aliens.”

The result was an unprecedented computerized deportation machinery linking local police to ICE.

“The scale in just the number of people who were being checked against these databases increased tremendously. And what that led to was a lot of removals,” said Migration Policy Institute analyst Faye Hipsman. “It became essentially the main pipeline into the removal process, into the deportation process.”

But it soon became clear that many of those being deported had either no criminal record at all or had only been convicted of minor crimes. The centrist approach to enforcement, prioritizing the removal of supposedly “bad” immigrants, created an automated deportation pipeline as voracious and sweeping as anything their right-wing detractors could have have proposed.

Under Obama, the conversation was “revolving around this good immigrant/bad immigrant binary,” said García Hernández. Immigration moderates, he said, were “repeatedly willing to sacrifice the so-called criminal aliens in order to move the CIR [Comprehensive Immigration Reform] ball forward.”

Obama, however, could not placate a party where congressmen like Tom Tancredo, who suggested bombing Mecca and impeaching the president, held sway. But instead of fighting the Right, Obama let them dictate policy. Obama’s crackdown, like Bush’s, succeeded in deporting large numbers of immigrants. And it once again failed to bring right-wing legislators to the table while mobilizing immigrant rights activists in opposition.

In December 2010, the DREAM Act, which would have legalized undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, failed to clear the Senate. If a bill targeting the group of undocumented immigrants most immediately sympathetic to the public couldn’t make it through Congress, it seemed increasingly clear that nothing would. Rather than sating right-wing demands for harsh enforcement, Obama’s strategy had made them even more fervent.

The next month, Republicans riding the mid-term Tea Party wave took control of the House and gained ground in the Senate. They were more hostile than ever to anything smelling of “amnesty.”

On the Right, it had not only become conventional wisdom that the United States was being invaded by “illegal immigrants” but also, thanks to the conspiracy theory that Obama was born outside the United States, that the White House was as well. Economic crisis has traditionally bolstered anti-immigrant sentiment. But the Great Recession helped usher in a novel trend: Democrats, increasingly liberals and non-white people, were adopting more favorable views toward immigration while Republicans not only remained hostile but became more emboldened and vitriolic.

The president had orchestrated record deportations to win over right-wing support for a reform bill that was going nowhere and paying a heavy price with his base as a result. In the lead-up to the 2012 presidential election, Democrats worried about turning out the Latino vote.

In June 2012, with an eye on his re-election fight, Obama announced a new program to protect the DREAMers, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who had arrived as children, from deportation. The program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was an acknowledgement that Obama had been waiting on Republican partners who might never show up. It also reflected the growing power of the Latino vote and of organized immigrant groups.

But activists still believed that the administration was balancing deportation protections for some with crackdowns on others. That year, activists gathered at the White House to strategize over the coming Supreme Court decision on the legality of Arizona’s anti-immigrant law. Napolitano, according to National Day Labor Organizing Network Legal Director Chris Newman, said “that DACA was essentially an extension of the Secure Communities policy” and that “felons get deported so DREAMers can stay.”

Representatives for Napolitano, now president of the University of California system, declined an interview request.

In 2012, Obama won reelection, beating Mitt Romney with nearly three-quarters of the Latino vote. Romney, a one-time avatar of the cleancut and soft-spoken business establishment, lost in part, many believed, because he had picked up harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric to appease his party’s right wing.

“Ni Uno Más”

With Secure Communities, Obama took a page from the playbook Clinton used to decimate welfare, orchestrate the war on crime and, of course, crack down on immigration: he endeavored to negotiate with the Right by taking up its cause. In doing so, it undermined the principles he purportedly stood for.

Both parties’ positions were becoming untenable. For Republicans, caught between the hard right and a general electorate put off by extremism, there was no easy way out. For Obama and Democrats, however, the political downsides of enforcement had risen, costing them credibility with large numbers of Latinos, while the upsides, in the form of Republican cooperation, remained illusory. Increasingly militant immigrant activism in the face of the Right’s recalcitrance meant that the only solution was to move, in fits and starts, leftward.

That December, the shift continued when the administration moved to end 287(g) task force agreements that deputized local police as enforcement agents (while leaving agreements authorizing inspections in local jails in place). But Secure Communities, which the administration continued to defend, was more efficient at accomplishing much the same thing. In 2013, Obama deported his second millionth immigrant — many of them through Secure Communities.

“It was a conscious effort on the part of the administration,” said Hipsman, “as a down payment on immigration reform.”

The political costs, however, were rising. Emboldened immigrant rights activists, standing between the Democratic Party and a critical slice of the electorate, were less and less willing to settle for half measures.

In November 2013, comprehensive reform legislation that had passed the Senate, the effort’s great last gasp, died in the House as Speaker John Boehner capitulated to right-wing legislators unimpressed with the bill’s enforcement and border militarization measures. For grassroots activists, two things were clearer than ever: Republicans were hopeless and that it was Obama who, presiding over the deportations that were tearing families and communities apart, was the problem to focus their energies on.

Inside the immigrant rights movement, a fissure had opened between well-funded inside-the-Beltway groups that had backed the Senate bill, like the National Council of La Raza, and grassroots groups frustrated at their closeness to the White House. Cecilia Muñoz, a onetime La Raza official who had sharply criticized Bill Clinton in the 1990s, was directing Obama’s Domestic Policy Council.

“The advocates who are not based in Washington, D.C., and are not very closely aligned with the Democratic Party and with the mainstream political circles were irked, and were seeing that their members . . . were suffering the brunt of this for years with very little concern resonating in the conversations about comprehensive immigration reform,” said García Hernández.

Grassroots groups believed that Washington-based organizations mistook access for influence — and in doing so offered Obama political cover for mass deportations. The grassroots strategy, said veteran DREAMer activist Mohammad Abdollahi, was to put a face on individual immigrants and “show who Obama is actually deporting even though he says he’s not deporting them.” The DREAMers joined groups like NDLON to demand “Not 1 More” deportation.

“It’s becoming something that you can’t control,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said at the time, referring to grassroots-level pressure on Obama. “People have tried to control it. This administration has put inordinate pressure on people not to criticize the president on his immigration policy and not to talk about prosecutorial discretion.”

The Obama Administration, however, still insisted that it could not act to halt deportations on its own. With reform dead in Congress, National Council of La Raza President Janet Murguía in March 2014, under pressure from militant grassroots groups, declared Obama to be “deporter in chief,” a term seemingly cribbed from NDLON. Grassroots radicals, mobilizing on the ground in immigrant communities, had outflanked and overtaken the establishment camp in Washington.

The united opposition from radical and mainstream immigrant rights groups had put Obama in an incredibly difficult position. Sharry said that he and other immigrant rights activists met with Obama in March 2014, just after Murguía had condemned Obama.

“When Janet spoke up,” he said, “it was the most intense silence you can imagine. It was clear [Obama] was composing himself . . . to not express how thoroughly pissed off he was.”

On the ground, Secure Communities was under unprecedented stress. In March 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that detainers were not mandatory. The next month, a federal judge in Oregon ruled the same, finding that Clackamas County had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment rights by detaining her without probable cause.

The rulings gave activists extraordinary leverage. Cooperating with ICE wasn’t just bad policy, as they had argued, but could also make localities subject to heavy civil damages. Almost immediately, counties across Oregon announced that they would no longer honor ICE detainers. In California, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the TRUST ACT, limiting local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE detainers in October 2013 — a far cry from the state’s brutal nativist measures in the mid-1990s.

Obama’s deportation pipeline was under heavy political and legal duress. But the deportations would continue. And so would the narrative about dangerous, murdering, raping, and drug-dealing criminal aliens that underpinned it.

In 2013, the Remembrance Project, highlighting the stories of “families whose loved ones were killed by illegal aliens,” began to receive media attention not only in far-right publications but mainstream outlets as well. Increasingly, the dominant right-wing message was that immigrants were not only taking jobs and threatening cultural norms but killing Americans.

Obama’s rhetoric was that some immigrants were bad felons while others were law-abiding workers. But the reality was that both president and his right-wing detractors had made immigration enforcement a criminal justice priority.

After weeks of back-and-forth communication, the White House failed to set up an interview for this story.

Obama’s Final Act

In the spring and summer of 2014, thousands of unaccompanied minors and families streamed across the border, fleeing accelerating violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Rather than welcoming the immigrants — who, after all, were fleeing countries thrown into chaos by decades of US intervention — the Obama Administration responded harshly, moving to detain them while their asylum claims were pending.

One reason they may have done so, said Stumpf, was out of fear of the Right’s pushback. Conservative critics had asserted that the asylum-seekers had been lured to the United States by DACA’s deportation protections. (In fact, they were fleeing nightmarish violence.)

“The Obama administration had rolled out DACA, it was extremely controversial, yet it was also the biggest pro-immigrant action that the executive branch had taken,” said Stumpf. “And so I think they felt like they needed to protect it.”

Once again, Obama paired a humanitarian gesture with a draconian one. Pleasing all sides, however, was still impossible.

In November 2014, Republicans took control of the Senate and successfully cut into Democrats’ advantage among Latino voters — who, after all, are a diverse constituency in terms of class, religion, and ideology. But instead of welcoming those voters to the party, incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell responded to a restive base that now clearly set the party’s immigration agenda, warning Obama that unilateral action on immigration would be like “waving a red flag in front of a bull.” The president, however, had a restive base of his own to attend to in the form of a newly unified and militant immigrant rights movement.

After the election, Obama addressed the nation during prime time to announce major executive actions to limit deportations. The centerpiece was a new program to protect millions of undocumented parents of US citizens from deportation, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA. Though he didn’t mention it during his speech, Secure Communities would, at least in name, come to an end as well. A united immigrant rights had won a major victory, though its extent was far from clear. “Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom that’s working hard to provide for her kids,” said Obama. “If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you’re a criminal, you’ll be deported.” In a memo issued the same day as Obama’s speech, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson explained that Secure Communities would be replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program. Fingerprint sharing would remain in place. But ICE would limit enforcement mostly to people convicted of certain crimes and, by and large, request notification of a prisoner’s release instead of requesting that their detention be extended. Secure Communities was in crisis politically and operationally, Johnson acknowledged. In September 2014, the percentage of individuals targeted by a detainer who were taken into ICE custody had declined to 41.2 percent while the portion of detainers marked as refused had risen to 10.1 percent — up from zero in 2008. “The goal of Secure Communities was to more effectively identify and facilitate the removal of criminal aliens,” Johnson wrote. “The reality is the program has attracted a great deal of criticism, is widely misunderstood, and is embroiled in litigation; its very name has become a symbol for general hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws. Governors, mayors, and state and local law enforcement officials around the country have increasingly refused to cooperate with the program, and many have issued executive orders or signed laws prohibiting such cooperation.” PEP’s reforms were substantial, at least on paper. But activists were wary that the program would be merely a change in name geared to win back local cooperation with ICE and disputed Obama’s continued use of the “good immigrant, bad immigrant” dichotomy. Rhetorically, it played into stereotypes about migrant criminality and in practice failed to recognize that many immigrants who had broken the law were no worse than native-born people who had done the same. In reality, immigrants break the law far less often than native-born Americans. “If you adopt the opposition’s messaging frame as your own whatever you say within that framework ends up further cementing the opposition’s argument,” said Lindsay Schubiner of the Center for New Community, a research and advocacy group tracking anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups. “I think Obama is trying to partially push back against this nativist argument. But by continuing to talk about felons he’s really just giving their narrative additional space.” The nativist tide had been rising for decades. Democrats consistently failed to take it on. Instead, its rhetoric became even more virulent. “As Whites see their power and control over their lives declining, will they simply go quietly into the night? Or will there be an explosion?” asked the Federation for American Immigration Reform founder John Tanton, who the Southern Poverty Law Center calls “the racist architect of the modern anti-immigrant movement,” in 1986. The right-wing story line was set. All it needed was its orange-hued hero. Trump’s Descent On June 16, 2015, Donald Trump announced his presidential campaign. From the beginning, his rhetoric was drenched in xenophobia. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he warned. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with [them]. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” For many Americans, the assertions were shocking but also kind of laughable: he was, it seemed, an absurdity. This was reality television star Donald Trump, more a brand name applied to purportedly luxury goods drowning in chintz than a credible aspirant to the White House. But for others, Trump crystallized a sentiment spreading from the far right to the heart of American fears over demographic change and economic crisis: immigrants were dangerous criminals. As Obama prioritized cracking down on criminal immigrants, the right-wing notion that average immigrants were criminals was taking hold like perhaps never before. Time and again, Democrats and moderate Republicans would underestimate the appeal of nativism to Republican voters. Immigration politics had become a powder keg. The month after Trump’s announcement, an undocumented immigrant shot and killed a young woman named Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. The fuse was lit. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez showed signs of mental illness and said that he had found the gun, reported stolen from the vehicle of a Bureau of Land Management ranger, wrapped in a t-shirt. Lopez-Sanchez had a warrant out for a small-time marijuana offense. But there was apparently nothing violent on his record. He had been transferred from prison, where he had been serving a sentence for illegal reentry, to the San Francisco Sheriff who then released him. He would never have been prosecuted for the old, trifling pot bust he was wanted for. Though many to this day know nothing of this profoundly idiosyncratic tragedy, it became a cause célèbre on the right and was sucked into a new national debate about immigrant criminality that Trump’s announcement had inflamed like never before. Steinle’s killing, Trump declared, was a “senseless and totally preventable act of violence” and “yet another example of why we must secure our border.” By that month, the Center for Immigration Studies had published a map of so-called sanctuary cities that “protect criminal aliens from deportation.” CIS Executive Director Mark Krikorian took to the National Review to declare that “San Francisco’s refusal to turn over illegal aliens for the feds until they’ve been convicted of violent felonies (and the Obama administration’s support for, and even promotion of such policies) is the only reason this poor woman was killed.” He added that Trump’s “widely mocked warnings of this very danger have been vindicated.” Breitbart likewise blamed the president, charging that “the only reason sanctuary cities like San Francisco get away with flagrant lawlessness is because the federal government and its degenerate bureaucracy allow them to do so. President Obama could have taken steps to end this ‘sanctuary city’ garbage long ago.” To put things in perspective: Obama was being blamed for so-called sanctuary city policies that were in fact rebellions against Obama’s embrace of Secure Communities — and the result of federal judges’ rulings suggesting that it might violate the Constitution in practice. The backwardness of centrist immigration policies pushing harsh enforcement had come to a full and surreal circle. Trump, the most anti-immigrant major party presidential candidate in modern history, had made Obama’s anti-immigrant policies a centerpiece of his platform. ICE, however, seemed to embrace the right-wing narrative and grasped for an opportunity to achieve PEP’s major goal of coaxing local law enforcement to renew cooperation. After Steinle’s murder, an ICE email to the media lamented that “an individual with a lengthy criminal history, who is now the suspect in a tragic murder case, was released onto the street rather than being turned over to ICE for deportation.” “Bottom line,” ICE continued, is that “if the local authorities had merely notified ICE that they were about to release this individual into the community, ICE could have taken custody of him and had him removed from the country — thus preventing this terrible tragedy . . . ICE desperately wants local law enforcement agencies to work with us so we can work to stop needless violence like these [sic] in our communities.” ICE told Jacobin that PEP has indeed coaxed localities back into the fold. According to the agency, seventeen of the twenty-five jurisdictions with the highest number of declined detainers under Secure Communities are now participating in PEP. But ICE refused to provide a list of participating localities. According to Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” García, ICE and Secretary Johnson have been pressing them hard to renew cooperation in Chicagoland. García recalls that he told Johnson that “PEP seemed to be more of a public relations repackaging of Secure Communities; that many of the worst aspects of Secure Communities could still be found in PEP.” It’s too early to tell whether PEP has achieved its operational goal of targeting serious criminals with more precision and leaving everyday immigrants alone, according to data analyzed by TRAC. Half of all detainers issued during the first two months of fiscal year 2016 were for people who had no criminal record, and four out of five detainers requested that individuals be detained beyond their release time. The percentage of detainer targets with criminal records actually fell after Johnson’s announcement. “The heart of Secure Communities, the thing that was different and that rallied all this opposition, was the idea that every single interaction with local law enforcement should lead to an immigration background check,” said NDLON Litigation Director Jessica Karp Bansal. “It’s a huge problem because it entangles local police and immigration enforcement in a totally unprecedented way and PEP has changed nothing about that.” Meanwhile, Trump has turned Obama’s enforcement crackdown against the president and used it to fan his campaign’s nativist flames. At July’s Republican National Convention, Trump slammed Clinton, asserting that “my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle? . . . Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.” “We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program,” Trump said in August, at a major speech on immigration in Phoenix that he ended surrounded by “angel moms,” parents who spoke of losing children to illegal immigrant violence. “We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don’t even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.” Politicians, Democrat and Republican, have made a lot of big promises to secure the border and deport the bad guys. Yet every crackdown has simply beget calls for something harsher. The attack on immigrants that launched Trump to the nomination has faded in the face of non-stop October surprise revelations. But it was immigration that made Trump’s rise possible, and that will play a major role in shaping the future of right-wing politics. It’s important to remember that centrist politicians helped lay the groundwork. On the Democratic side, those centrists are being pushed to move left. DAPA, a major piece of Obama’s deportation protections, is on hold thanks to an evenly-split Supreme Court that reflects longstanding divisions on the issue that, like the Court, have for the first time become neatly partisan. Hillary Clinton, who as a US senator asserted that she was “adamantly against illegal immigrants,” has promised not to deport anyone save for violent criminals and terrorists. Clinton, said Sharry, is “running on the most avowedly pro immigrant platform in modern American history compared to the rhetoric of her husband back in the mid-nineties in the throws of this backlash . . . It’s night and day.” But Abdollahi, the DREAMer activist, remains skeptical, citing Clinton’s checkered record to make the case that she has “public” and “private” positions on immigration, echoing recently leaked comments she made to a trade association. “Clinton publicly talks about her support for immigrants. It just so happens though that any time she has had a chance to make a policy decision on immigration without 20/20 hindsight it has often been a position against immigrants,” said Abdollahi. Whatever one’s view of Clinton’s changing views, they certainly have changed. The Clintons are the great triangulators of our time, experts at finding the political sweet spot at the center wherever it may have drifted. But now, the center on immigration, like much everything else in politics, has fallen apart. In 1994, roughly a third of Democrats and Republicans had positive views of immigration. Today, 35 percent of Republicans and 78 percent of Democrats do. Within the Democratic coalition, immigrant rights groups hold greater sway than ever while hardcore nativists and white nationalists run the Republican Party. Mass deportations were intended to sate nativists’ appetite for enforcement. Under Bush and Obama, centrists embraced harsh enforcement as the prerequisite for reform. Clinton did so to outflank Republicans. In reality, they all created a massive deportation machinery and militarized border, and reinforced an ascendant right-wing explanation that helped suffering or anxious people make sense of their problems and the precarious world around them. Trump has nearly made his way to the top by calling immigrants criminals. It wasn’t an idea he came up with on his own.

The latest hike in fuel prices – known as the gasolinazo – went up by about 20% virtually overnight on January 1. This spurred daily protests in the streets and online.

During these protests, Twitter has served as both a megaphone and a platform from which people can show their anger and discontent. However, friction and conflict have increased on the site, as well as the propagation of false stories.

One of the most important phenomena that has been observed in this fight is the circulation of rumors and hashtags that promote illegal activities such as looting and theft. These strategies two objectives: to influence the conversations and to delegitimize the protests. Alarmist messages have even been shown alongside photos from other contexts and situations, such as the deleted tweet displayed here, published by Radio Fórmula with a photo that fact-checkers later confirmed depicts a street scene in Egypt.

Some of the accounts involved in these disinformation campaigns have been identified as bots (automated accounts) or trolls who had already been linked to harassment and threats against journalists and social activists.

The strategy of these accounts is to reshape the natural online conversation via trending topics, interfering with the discussion. This kind of strategy has been used at different times to systematically curb or modify conversations that are not favorable to certain groups in power.

#SaqueaUnWalmart (Loot a Walmart)

During the protests on January 4, 2017, two hashtags were used, #Gasolinazo and #SaqueaUnWalmart (Loot a Walmart), which grew to be trending topics in Mexico. The following image shows the relationship between different hashtags found in the tweets published on that date. The links between hashtags represent the times when two or more hashtags were used in the same tweet, and the size of each node shows the number of times each hashtag was used. This analysis was generated using more than 15,000 downloaded tweets, posted and re-tweeted by more than 10,000 different accounts.

Here we see the importance of #Gasolinazo and its relationships with the rest of the hashtags used that day. The appearance of #SaqueaUnWalmart can be read as a cluster in the system, an unnatural insertion that links up with #Gasolinazo in order to gain momentum and invade the natural conversation.

The diagram also allows us to identify other hashtags associated with #SaqueaUnWalmart, which gives clues as to the strategy used to enter into the conversation. Specifically, the hashtag #Hail100cia (a play on words meaning “hail ciencia” or “hail science”) stands out. This hashtag is associated with the group of Twitter user accounts that coordinated the appearance of #SaqueaUnWalmart and has continued pushing forward new hashtags such as #GolpeDeEstadoMX (State of Mexico Coup D'état).

In order to identify the real influence of the hashtag within the conversation, the accounts that were active with both tags were analyzed and graphed. This allows us to see who is posting messages and who their audience is. The following graphic shows these relationships. The size of the nodes depends on the number of times a user is mentioned within the conversations with the hashtags #Gasolinazo and #SaqueaUnWalmart — the more mentions, the larger the node.

The active communities range from traditional media who reported on the hike in gas prices, to particular organizations — in this case the group that instigated the #SaqueaUnWalmart hashtag.

At first glance it is difficult to see the relationship between said accounts within the many active accounts who adopted #Gasolinazo, but as the following image shows, the #SaqueaUnWalmart group managed to link themselves up with #Gasolinazo to position their hashtag as a trending topic.

The community highlighted in red in the above diagram identifies the group of active accounts that used the hashtag #Hail100cia. This is the same group of users (trolls and bots) that interrupted the natural conversation surrounding #Gasolinazo to insert the #SaqueaUnWalmart message. This group represents only 4.19% of the total active accounts (5,302 in total used the tags #Gasolinazo and #SaqueaUnWalmart). However, despite their small numbers, their attack through the use of replies and mentions managed to boost #SaqueaUnWalmart so much it impinged upon the natural conversation.

The battlefield

Manipulating trends within a global conversation not only draws attention, but also “pops” or “deflates” the conversation as well as any pressure the real activists exert on the government and/or certain figures. These types of strategies, while not illegal, represent a new challenge in the use of digital spaces for public discourse.

Other questions arise after identifying these patterns, strategies and accounts. First, what is the motivation for influencing the conversation in a certain way? Second, what people or groups benefit from this kind of behavior? Third, what are their long-term plans? And lastly, what mechanisms can be developed to curb or mitigate the artificial modification of trends?

It is imperative these days to ask the right questions and keep working along this vein. Federal elections in Mexico are only a year away, and the circus of social media could easily become a battlefield between artificial discourse and society, journalists, activists and analysts. And what's more, it could make building a critical, transparent and robust public space difficult.Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images

Tim Kaine reaffirmed his opposition to public funding for abortion care on Friday, standing against both Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party’s platform. “I have been for the Hyde Amendment, and I haven’t changed my position on that,” the vice presidential candidate told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on New Day. The Hyde Amendment is a rider that has been attached to every yearly appropriations bill since 1976, prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from funding abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the pregnant woman.

Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.



Clinton called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment in January, making a strong statement about the connection between reproductive and economic justice. A few months later, the Democratic Party added demolishing Hyde to its platform for the first time.

When Clinton selected Kaine as her running mate, abortion-rights advocates protested that the senator and former Virginia governor’s record on the issue was spotty. Like fellow Catholic Joe Biden, Kaine has said that his faith has made him personally opposed to abortion but that he supports the Supreme Court–affirmed right of a woman to have one if she chooses.

But Kaine’s attempt to strike a similar middle ground on Hyde in recent days has made him look like a weakling on women’s rights, not a principled pragmatist. He reportedly told Clinton’s people “privately” that he’d stand behind her in her efforts against Hyde. The Wall Street Journal reports that a Clinton-Kaine campaign spokesman said, “The senator is not personally for repeal of the Hyde Amendment,” but “as he’s made clear, he is committed to carrying out Secretary Clinton’s agenda.”

It’s wonderful that Kaine would never personally terminate a pregnancy, since he cannot get pregnant and will never have to make that decision. But when a politician’s personal beliefs bleed into his positions and legislative decisions, they are no longer personal nor beliefs. They are political actions that affect constituents’ lives and livelihoods.

Hyde has long been an archetypal example of legislators using poor women’s bodies as political battlegrounds. Politicians who support the Hyde Amendment aren’t just trying to keep some women from getting a constitutionally protected medical procedure. They’re entrenching a system that lets rich women do whatever they want with their bodies—which, let’s be honest, they’ll be able to do no matter how severe abortion restrictions get—while poor women’s bodies remain under the custodianship of whichever politicians happen to be in office.

This makes repealing the Hyde Amendment more than just an incremental step toward true reproductive freedom. It’s at the very heart of a movement that’s slowly shifting its paradigm from choice and rights to a broader focus on justice and access. For as long as women’s reproductive health has been legislated by politicians, the reproductive rights movement has delivered the bulk of the gains to wealthy white women, while poor women, women of color, and other marginalized women have been left behind. For the Democratic Party to take economic injustice and gender inequality seriously, it must fight like hell on Hyde.Chris Kleponis–Pool/Getty Images

Ethics experts and good-government watchdogs spent months warning that Donald Trump would face a swirling mess of conflicts of interest once he took office. One week into his presidency, the full scope of that ethical catastrophe is already coming into focus.

In no particular order, the world learned this week that:

Advertisement



Trump replaced the head of the General Services Administration, the federal agency that effectively serves as the landlord for the new Trump hotel in Washington and has been asked to investigate whether Trump is now in violation of that lease.

Trump signed orders clearing the way for the disputed Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines to proceed. As recently as last summer, the president owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in the company building the Dakota project, and its chief executive donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint effort between Trump and the Republican Party. (Trump claims to have sold off his stock portfolio before the election, though he has not provided documentation proving he did.)

Trump signaled his intent to sign an order suspending the granting of visas to seven predominantly Muslim countries. Not on the list: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Azerbaijan, aka predominantly Muslim countries where the Trump Organization has existing business interests.

Trump is pushing forward with his plans for a massive, privatization-heavy infrastructure bill that appears tailor-made for cronyism and self-dealing.

The Trump Organization hired a longtime Republican lawyer as its ethics adviser and a longtime Trump executive as its chief compliance counsel. Neither one of those familiar faces is likely to raise a stink in Trump Tower. Furthermore, both have a clear incentive to play nice since they’d put their jobs at risk if their oversight proves too costly to the company signing their paychecks.

The CEO of Trump Hotels is planning a massive domestic expansion, a decision that will significantly compound the conflicts of interests created by its existing portfolio.

The Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 for new members after Trump was elected.

At least two of Trump’s wealthy foreign business partners got the VIP treatment during the inauguration weekend, including plenty of time with the new first family.

The American Chamber of Commerce in Canada, a business lobby focused on North American trade, made a sudden, last-second decision to move a scheduled event from the Vancouver home of a U.S. diplomat to the newest addition to the Trump Hotel family in the same city. (The Trump Organization does not own the Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver, but it makes money managing the property and cutting naming-rights deals.)

Trump and his allies continue to shrug off any and all criticism of the obvious overlapping interests of the president and his family’s sprawling business empire, in which he retains a major financial stake. Their defense, as much as they even bother to offer one, is that the appearance of such problems just comes with the territory of electing someone of Trump’s wealth, which voters were well aware of when they pulled the lever for him on Election Day. Americans, Team Trump contends, should simply trust the president to put the nation’s interest before his own because that’s what he says he’ll do.

Calling that argument unconvincing would be kind, but a week into Trump’s presidency it’s turned downright farcical. Take another look at that list. These developments aren’t the unfortunate but unavoidable byproduct of having a businessman in the Oval Office; they’re the result of that businessman and the company he built acting in their own self-interest. It’s not an accident that those interests align, either. President Trump is running the nation just as he ran his business: to maximize his own profits.

Dear Prudence,

In the decade since my sister married her husband (when her daughter was 4 months old), she has suffered from multiple miscarriages and one stillbirth. This has devastated them emotionally and financially and now I think my sister is driving her family to the point of no return. She has been fundraising on Facebook for yet another round of fertility treatments. My brother in-law confessed to my husband that sex only happens when my sister thinks she is ovulating, that he “doesn’t have an actual wife anymore.” My niece has asked me why she isn’t “enough for Mommy.” She has become extremely withdrawn lately, and I am very worried about her. I feel for my sister, but she brushes off all concerns. What can I do? I don’t want to hurt her but at this point she is damaging the family she has in pursuit of the one she dreams of. How can I get her to see that?

Subscribe to Prudie!

—Baby Obsessed

It is, I think, solely your brother-in-law’s obligation to tell his own wife that he’s not happy with their sex life. You and your husband should both strongly encourage your brother-in-law to be honest with your sister about the toll that her single-minded obsession is taking on their marriage, especially if he does not want to have a biological child at the cost of their daughter’s well-being.

As her sister, however, you can still talk to her about what you’ve seen (outside of their bedroom) that’s caused you concern. Tell her that you cannot in good conscience contribute to her fundraiser because you’re worried that her uncompromising quest to have another biological child is wearing her out and negatively affecting her daughter’s development. Make sure you don’t soft-pedal your observations or allow her to brush you off until you’ve said everything you need to say; tell her you’re worried about her physical and mental health, as well as her daughter’s. You can’t necessarily save her marriage, because it’s up to her husband to be honest about what’s not working and what he’s not willing to do, but you can do your level best to reflect reality to her at a time when she seems unable to see things as they are.

Dear Prudence,

My boyfriend and I have been together for six years. Lately sex has become sporadic. First I was on my period, then he had to work early, then we were too tired to do it or not in the mood and it just spiraled from there. Now we’re looking at around six months without. But I’m OK with it. I’m happy with just hugs and kisses and curling up at night. I have spoken to my boyfriend about this dry spell, and he seems OK too, though he voiced he would like more. Are we just an odd couple or should I be worried? I feel very happy right now, but if I Google, every result says we’re on the verge of a breakup because we’re not having sex.

—Is No Sex Bad?

You say you’re happy, which is absolutely fine, but that your boyfriend merely “seems OK,” and he “would like more,” which doesn’t sound like quite the same thing as happiness. It may be that he’s genuinely easygoing and can thrive in a sexless relationship but wouldn’t be opposed to having sex; or, as seems likely, he’s ambivalent about your situation but is afraid to express dissatisfaction since you’re so comfortable with it. The best thing you can do with him is be honest and say that you love him and that the level of intimacy you’re currently sharing works for you, and that you’d (presumably) be happy staying together and never having sex again. Then ask if he can see himself happy in a similar situation. Don’t just look at what he seems like; ask him directly what he wants, and find out if there’s a workable compromise for the two of you. Were you happy with the sex life you had before this cooldown, or did it feel like a chore you had to get through in order to have a relationship? Would you be willing to have sex more often if that’s what your partner wants, or have you found the only relationship arrangement that works for you? If he’s fine with having sex once a month or so and you’re amenable, then you two get to be as happy as you like, no matter what Google says. If his idea of “more” sex is actually closer to five nights a week and the thought of that makes you miserable, you will have much harder conversations ahead of you.

Dear Prudence,

I need an unbiased opinion over whether I’m overreacting. My 8-year-old daughter Grace received a kitten for her birthday and loves her cat, Pasta, very much. She’s been talking about Pasta frequently at school, and this annoyed a girl named Holly, who has a history of saying mean things to Grace. During art period, Holly made a clay cat and encouraged the rest of their classmates to take pieces of “Pasta” to “eat.” Grace cried, and the teacher eventually alerted the vice principal. My husband and I have a meeting with Holly’s parents and the school this week, but I know several other parents in the class think this is an overreaction. They’ll allow it was not nice but claim no one knew how upset Grace would become. Are my husband and I out of line for thinking this is bullying that needs to be addressed, at least at an administrative level?

—Class “Butcher”

What Holly did was deliberately unkind, but it seems as if it would have fallen under the individual teacher’s purview, and he or she ought to have been able to stop Holly and told her to apologize. If you are meeting with administrators because you think it’s necessary for Holly to be reprimanded by a vice principal as well as a teacher, then yes, that may be an overreaction. If you’re meeting with administrators because you want to make sure everyone involved at this school has a clear idea of what the policy is on bullying and how to escalate appropriately, then that may fall more within reason.

Dear Prudence,

My cousin is a single mother who needs rides everywhere. She has to take two buses just to get to the grocery store (with a toddler in tow), and that’s both time- and cost-prohibitive for her. In theory, I don’t mind helping occasionally, and I’m not going to let her go without food or diapers. But I work full time and have a busy life of my own, and I dread getting unexpected texts to drive her to the grocery store after a long day of work and a commute of my own. My mother is the only other person who can help, but she often demurs, which frustrates me because she doesn’t work and has more time to help. My cousin and I recently agreed on a set day each week where I’ll take her to the store, but yesterday she needed a ride on our “off” day and Mom refused to take her, even though she was going shopping anyway. I was in tears at work arguing with my mother about it. The hardest part is I feel like no one does anything nice—or anything at all—for me. I work and pay bills, loan money out, drive people around, bring my mom candy or dessert or leftovers when I go out (to the point that she gets angry if I don’t bring her anything). I’ll probably get a cake on my birthday in a couple of weeks and that’s pretty much it. I fantasize about moving far away so I won’t be available to them. I guess there are a couple of issues here and I’ve made a much overdue appointment with a therapist but was wondering if you have any advice on how to handle all of this. How do I start putting myself first when others constantly need or want something from me?

—Needy Family

Congratulations on starting therapy! There’s one problem that you can fix right away, and that’s your feeling that no one does anything nice for you. Start doing nice things for yourself, right now, and do them every day for at least the next month. Every activity you describe above—working, paying your bills, taking care of your basic daily needs, supporting others—has to do with functioning. You should also, occasionally, enjoy yourself. Take full responsibility for your own well-being so you don’t waste any more time wishing other people would put you first.

Next up: Stop bringing your mother candy and dessert and leftovers when you go out. If she doesn’t like that, well, she is a grown woman and more than capable of purchasing a slice of cake or half a Reuben if she so desires. Any gift-giving routine that’s based on unspoken expectations and resentment is a recipe for misery and disappointment, and you need to disengage. Remember too that you do not owe her an argument when she refuses to help your cousin. You and your cousin have already worked out an arrangement that suits you both, and it’s not your job to make sure your mother holds up her end. Acting as a go-between will only make you feel more frustrated and unappreciated. Your cousin, though, is a different case than your mother. You’re feeling overwhelmed on both fronts, but your cousin at least sounds like she’s in genuine need and is not going out of her way to make things difficult for you. Your compromise of one shopping day a week is a good one, but if the time is bothering you more than the money, consider giving her cab fare or paying for a round trip on a ride-sharing app rather than driving her yourself. You’re right in that there are a lot of different issues at play here, and there will likely be more battles to come, but you don’t have to move across the country in order to set limits with your family.

Dear Prudence,

I’ve been friends with “Laura” for 15 years and have seen her through many crises. Last fall she lost her job and was evicted, so I invited her and her son to stay with us until she got back on her feet. Laura was a slob who never picked up after herself or her son, did the dishes, or picked up a broom. She spent four months surfing the internet on our couch, while I spent day and night cooking, cleaning, caring for both her child and mine, and working full time (I was also pregnant with twins). When she finally got a job, I sat down with her to discuss a timeline for moving out, and she got upset because she was hoping to stay for several more months. I told her we weren’t kicking her out and that she didn’t have to leave immediately, but that my partner and I had to start preparing for our twins.

A week later we came home to find her, her son, and all their things gone; she’d left a generic thank-you card on the bed with her name on it. I’m really upset at her ungratefulness. She even told mutual friends that I kicked her out. We didn’t speak for a few months, and then when I tried to contact her, she didn’t return my calls because she was still angry that I asked her to find her own place. Through a mutual friend I know she expects at some point to resume our relationship, but I am no longer interested. I’m still hurt that she would end a 15-year friendship after we housed and fed her for four months without more than a perfunctory “thanks.” I feel like conveying this to her would provide me with some closure. Is it OK to write her a letter telling her all this, and that I wish her well but no longer want to be friends?

—Need Closure

It’s understandable you would want to explain your frustrations to your friend given that you spent four months quietly seething in her direction without ever communicating directly that she needed to clean up after herself or setting a firm expectation in terms of how long you were willing to let her stay with you. But don’t let the fact that you failed to communicate adequately before result in excessive communication now—writing out a laundry list of everything she did that drove you crazy might feel cathartic in the moment but won’t net much in the way of productive results. That’s not to say that should Laura reach out, you can never explain how her behavior affected you and your own family. But putting those thoughts in writing and sending them to her out of the blue would be a continuation of the conflict-avoidant behavior that got you in this mess in the first place.

Ask yourself, too, why you chose to continue to clean up after your friend in angry silence for four months rather than having a conversation about house rules and expectations. You’ve learned that’s not a strategy that produces good results; consider finding a new approach as your family expands.

Dear Prudence: The “Oppression Olympics” Edition My friend thinks his Irish heritage means he can’t be racist. Help!

* * *

Dear Prudence,

So this may seem odd, but the experience I had totally dumbfounded me. It’s trash day in the neighborhood on Thursdays. I always walk my dog in the morning, and normally it is before the trucks have come through the neighborhood. After my dog did her business I tossed the bag into a full trash bin on the street as the trucks were coming up the street. The owner of the house opened her door and yelled at me for using her trash bin, and said how dare I use it, it’s not mine, and that I’m a terrible person. I apologized, and we continued home. I never toss the doggy bag into a trash can that is not mine unless it’s full and about to be picked up. Did I do wrong? I am still perplexed on the etiquette of this.

—Doggie Bags

This is totally a thing! This is a huge, divisive Thing, and the internet is full of flame wars over this exact topic, which I find more than a little amazing. By the way, Dear Abby is For it and Ask Amy is Not-For it. Here are the For and Not-For arguments, as I understand them:

FOR:

The waste is bagged up and on its way to the dump rather than on the sidewalk, which is a net good.

Humans are not so virtuous that they could enjoy primly carrying a full bag for the back half of a 40-minute walk until they get home or get lucky enough to find a public trash can.

It is a trash can, the purpose of which is to hold trash.

NOT-FOR

It’s possible to mistake a recently emptied can for one awaiting pickup, in which case you’ve just given that neighbor a bag of dog waste to ferment for a week in their side yard.

It’s possible the bag isn’t tied as tightly as you thought, thus opening up the possibility of seepage.

“I don’t own a dog and therefore my trash can should not have dog poop in it; am I my brother’s keeper?”

The real question, I suppose, is whether or not trash cans should be considered a public good or private property. Generally, most cities own the garbage cans used by private citizens; you can’t move and take your garbage cans with you because you don’t actually own them, which is another argument For, I suppose. Try explaining that technicality to a screaming neighbor, though.

My ruling is this: If my trash can is out on the street and clearly full, anyone’s welcome to fling whatever they need in there, as long as there’s room for it. But I would rather carry a full bag of dog poop to the actual sun and back than get yelled at by one of my neighbors, so in the interest of my guiding principle of never getting yelled at, I generally hold out until I find a public waste bin.

The New York operation was planned one week ago and was part of a national action that was planned several weeks ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.

“New York was late to the game,” said an agency official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because details about who had been detained were still being learned. The official said the arrests had not been impromptu and had been planned around individuals’ routines, adding that a fuller account would be available on Monday.

“All these people are in violation of some sort of immigration law,” the official said, adding that some of their convictions included rape and aggravated assault. “We’re not going out to Walmart to check papers — we know who we are going out to seek.”

At least in the New York area (including Long Island), fewer people were arrested than during an Obama administration enforcement sweep in August, when 58 people were arrested.

The Obama administration was especially active in deporting unauthorized immigrants, most notably in 2012, when 409,849 people were deported. In 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the arrests of more than 2,000 people nationwide in one week, targeting criminals. And the Obama administration was still sweeping up low-priority immigrants last summer.

Nevertheless, Steven Choi, the executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said last week’s action was worrisome because it seemed to be only the beginning.

“It really doesn’t matter if it’s business as usual from ICE’s perspective — at some point, we know that they will start to ramp up enforcement activity,” Mr. Choi said in an interview. He added that a Jan. 25 executive order from the president about ensuring public safety included the bolstering of the immigration force.

Mr. Trump’s executive order also vastly expanded the group of immigrants considered priorities for deportation, including those without criminal records.

When asked if the recent operations had incorporated the new priorities, a Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because operations were continuing, said, “The president has been clear in saying that D.H.S. should be focused on removing individuals who pose a threat to public safety, who have been charged with criminal offenses, who have committed multiple immigration violations or who have been deported and re-entered the country illegally.”

About 160 foreign nationals were recently arrested in six counties in the Los Angeles area, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. An additional 200 were arrested last week in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. And about 200 were arrested across Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin.

At least some of the rumors circulating on social media over the weekend proved to be false, including reports of raids in Jackson Heights, Queens, and in Huntington Station on Long Island. Similarly, immigration advocates in Kansas City, Mo., were on alert after hearing rumors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents planned to arrest people who were on their way to worship on Sunday.

“Absolutely not!” Ms. Christensen, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, said. “That is completely false and an example of the many kinds of irresponsible, baseless fear-mongering we’ve been seeing.”

Through a statement from his spokeswoman Rosemary Boeglin, Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to reassure New York City’s immigrants on Sunday. “New Yorkers should rest assured that city officials, including the N.Y.P.D., will never ask about your immigration status, and the N.Y.P.D. will never become immigration enforcement agents,” Ms. Boeglin said.

New York is a so-called sanctuary city, which means that it generally does not comply with requests by immigration authorities to hold undocumented immigrants who have committed low-level crimes. Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding for such cities.

On Long Island, activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had not yet reached the level of the large-scale enforcement seen under the George W. Bush administration. In one week in 2007, 170 people were arrested in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, said Pat Young, the program director of the Central American Refugee Center on Long Island.

“At least so far, it’s important to know that in the New York area, we haven’t had checkpoints; we haven’t had sweeps,” he said, adding that he had had to quash rumors all day about where immigration officials had conducted their activities. “They are taking place at homes.”This post is part of a series on the candidates we understand to be under consideration for Secretary of Labor .

Last week, President-elect Donald Trump met with Peter Kirsanow, a management-side employment and labor attorney practicing with Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff. Although he is based in Cleveland, OH, Kirsanow, an African-American conservative, is no stranger to Washington. He served as a member of the NLRB from 2006 to 2008. Currently, Kirsanow is a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

National Labor Relations Board Opinion Highlights

While on the Board, Kirsanow participated in a number of decisions that were criticized for undermining protections for unionized employees. In 2009 in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., the Board reinterpreted three aspects of the statutory definition of “supervisor” enumerated in Section 2(11) of the Act. This decision expanded the group of employees who are defined as supervisors and therefore excluded from the bargaining unit. The dissent in the case criticized the majority’s approach as “threaten[ing] to create a new class of workers under federal law: workers who have neither the genuine prerogatives of management, nor the statutory rights of employees.”

Kirsanow also participated in the weakening of protections against “salts” in Oil Capitol Sheet Metal, Inc. and Toering Electric Co.. In Oil Capitol Sheet Metal, Inc., the Board eliminated the presumption that a union salt fired for discriminatory reasons would have been employed indefinitely, placing salts on unequal footing with other employee victims of discrimination. This decision marked a departure from the Board’s prior rule, which placed the burden on the employer to show backpay should be reduced for salts. Protections for salts were further eroded in Toering Electric Co., where the Board stated that the Act only protects job applicants who are “genuinely interested in seeking to establish an employment relationship with the employer.” The dissenters in this decision argued that this new standard undermined the status of salting as a protected, concerted activity under Section 7 of the Act.

Finally, Kirsanow joined the majority in two cases that diminished protections for unionized employees in the card check process. In Dana/Metaldyne, a precedent later reversed in Lamons Gasket Co., the Board overturned a 40-year precedent and reformulated the Board’s recognition bar doctrine. Under the rule in Dana/Metaldyne, 30 percent of a unit could force a decertification vote or vote for alternative representation within 45 days of the employer’s voluntary recognition of the union. Emphasizing the differences between secret ballot and card check elections, the majority questioned whether card check elections were reliable indicators of employee free choice because “card signings are public actions, susceptible to group pressure exerted at the moment of choice.” In Wurtland Nursing, decided the same day, the Board found that a petition showing that 50 percent of employees wanted to decertify their union was sufficient for immediate decertification without holding a secret ballot vote.

Kirsanow has also remained active in current disputes over the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. He has been critical of the NLRB’s representation election rule. Kirsanow also opposes the Board’s decision in Browning-Ferris and believes it should be overruled.

U.S. Commission for Civil Rights

A George W. Bush appointee to the U.S. Commission for Civil Rights, Kirsanow has advocated conservative positions.

Illegal Immigration and African-American Employment

Kirsanow has been vocal regarding the detrimental impact of illegal immigration on low-wage jobs held by African Americans. Kirsanow voted to approve a U.S. Comission for Civil Rights report that stated that reducing or eliminating the flow of undocumented immigrants would improve workforce participation of black workers. Testifying before Congress, Kirsanow stated that undocumented immigrants compete with low-wage workers, particularly African American men, and drive down wages. He advanced the theory that undocumented immigration correlates to increased rates of incarceration among African Americans. Kirsanow argues that lower wages and higher rates of imprisonment create a ripple effect contributing to the destabilization of black families.

Religious Liberty

In 2016, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report on the conflicts that can occur between religious liberty and other civil rights protections. Despite voting to release the report, Kirsanow suggested that the report, which stated that “religious exemptions to the protections of civil rights based upon classifications such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, and gender identity, when they are permissible, significantly infringe upon these civil rights,” should serve as “an alarm to liberty loving Americans.” In the context of the conflict between sexual orientation and religious liberty, Kirsanow believes in the primacy of religious liberties.

Affirmative Action

Kirsanow is a proponent of the controversial “mismatch” theory, positing that African American students are disadvantaged when they are admitted to prestigious universities they would not have been admitted to without affirmative action. Recently, Kirsanow has garnered attention for a brief he filed with fellow member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Gail Heriot, in Fisher v. Univ. of Texas at Austin. Justice Scalia referenced this brief when he intimated that black students might be more successful at “slower-track” universities.

Other Employment Issues

Kirsanow has been sharply critical of President Obama’s minimum wage executive order, which increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for federal contractors. Kirsanow contends that the order is an unconstitutional exercise of executive power. Kirsanow disputes that he is an opponent of minimum wage laws generally, but he is against indexing the minimum wage. He also indicated that he believes increasing the minimum wage, especially coupled with immigration reform, would “[p]rice [low-skilled workers] right out of the market.” Additionally, he opposes the prevailing wage, arguing that the requirement disadvantages small businesses in bidding for these projects.One of Donald Trump's senior advisers used a Sunday television appearance to repeat an unfounded claim that "thousands" of people were driven to the state of New Hampshire to vote illegally in November's election.

The voter fraud allegation was first made by the President himself in a meeting with senators. Federal Electoral Commissioner Ellen Weintraub called it an "astonishing" claim that "cannot be ignored", and urged Mr Trump to provide evidence.

Senior adviser Stephen Miller did the rounds of Sunday politics programmes in the US and was praised by Mr Trump for his performance. During one, he asserted the New Hampshire claim and other fraud claims a number of times without giving evidence for them.

On ABC, he told presenter George Stephanopoulos: "I can tell you that this issue, of busing voters into New Hampshire, is widely known by anyone who's worked in New Hampshire politics, it's very real, it's very serious.

"This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence, but I can tell you this: voter fraud is a serious problem in this country.

"You have millions of people who are registered in two states, or who are dead who are registered to vote, and you have 14 per cent of non-citizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote."

Pressed by Mr Stephanopoulos on the basis for his claim, he said: "Go to New Hampshire, talk to anyone who's worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody's aware of the problem in New Hampshire."

Challenging Mr Miller a second time, Mr Stephanopoulos said: "I'm asking you as the White House senior policy adviser, the President made a statement saying he was the victim of voter fraud. Do you have any evidence?"

Mr Miller replied: "If this is an issue that interests you, then we can talk about it more in the future."

Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017

Mr Stephanopoulos said: "You have provided absolutely no evidence." Mr Miller, repeatedly glancing out of shot, said: "The White House has provided enormous evidence." He added there were "massive numbers" of non-citizens registered to vote.

"That's the story we should be talking about, and I'm prepared to go on any show, anywhere, any time and repeat it and say the President of the United States is correct 100 per cent."

President Trump later tweeted: "Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!"

Commissioner Weintraub, appointed by George W Bush in 2002, said: "President Trump has alleged an astonishing voter-fraud scheme that he claims denied him and former Senator Kelly Ayotte victory in the state of New Hampshire in the 2016 elections."

"As a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, I am acutely aware that our democracy rests on the faith of the American people in the integrity of their elections."

When last we checked in on President Trump and his assorted emoluments issues, a lawsuit had been filed and there was some question of whether the plaintiffs had any standing to proceed. There is now reason to believe the standing issue will be resolved and that there is a relatively easy way forward.

Dahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.



The Emoluments Clause, as you will recall, is to be found in Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. It provides that “no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.” In addition, a second emoluments provision in Article II, Section 1 prohibits the president from receiving, on top of his salary, “any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

The fear animating these clauses was that foreign governments might try to bribe elected officials with gifts and payments, a form of corruption the founders found terrifying. When President Trump indicated he would not divest from his businesses or place them in a blind trust, scholars argued that he was taking gifts from foreign powers every time a Trump-owned property took payments from a foreign government, or whenever Trump Tower rented out property to foreign banks, or when the Trump businesses received loans or international licensing agreements. The theory is that any time a foreign government feels like laying a little cash on the new president, they need only book a party at his D.C. hotel or shovel some business toward Trump Tower. While such things have been happening with some frequency since Inauguration Day, the president claims he is immune from prosecution. In a press conference explaining his legal posture in early January, Trump’s lawyer Sheri Dillon explained, “Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present, and it has nothing to do with an office. It’s not an emolument.”

The reason we haven’t seen a ton of Emoluments Clause cases is that prior officials have gone to great lengths to avoid the perception of corruption. Trump, on the other hand, has gone to great not-lengths, and ethics experts largely agree that Trump’s limited efforts to correct for any conflicts—putting his sons in charge of his companies, donating any profits from foreign clients to the U.S. Treasury—are simply insufficient.

Last month, a government watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and some of the country’s leading ethics and constitutional law experts—among them Harvard’s Laurence Tribe, Fordham’s Zephyr Teachout, and University of California–Irvine’s Erwin Chemerinsky—filed suit arguing that the president is in violation of the Constitution, and more urgently, that CREW has standing to sue. Without standing, or claims of a concrete and imminent injury to plaintiffs, a suit cannot go forward. CREW argues it has legal standing to bring this action because Trump’s Emoluments Clause violations are using up the organization’s time and resources. Many legal analysts have expressed doubt as to whether that claim will suffice to get CREW into a courtroom. But a new theory advanced by Fordham University Law School professor Jed Shugerman may present an end run around that standing problem.

Shugerman’s approach uses a whole lot of Latin words, but in a nutshell, he wants to use state laws of incorporation to investigate and revoke Trump’s business charter in New York. In an article last week, Shugerman laid out the theory that corporations are creatures of state law and that attorneys general have the authority to bring actions against corporations that are acting against the public interest. As he put it, “State attorneys general can bring quo warranto proceedings to access information about whether the entities are conduits for illegal emoluments.” By asking state attorneys general in the states Trump businesses are incorporated to sue, the standing problem disappears. As Shugerman puts it: “Instead of private parties suing the public official (Trump), public officials can sue the private parties (the Trump hotels and other business entities). Corporations are a creature of state law, and state attorneys general have a special role in making sure that corporations adhere to federal and state law.” Not only does the standing problem disappear but because standing requirements are lower in state court than in federal court, the state AGs will be more likely to be allowed to proceed.

Quo warranto is the Latin term for an old English writ that dates back to the 12th century. The idea here is that if a corporation is behaving in a fashion that is deemed ultra vires, or exceeding its legal authority, the state must investigate. In New York, the attorney general has the authority to bring an action against a corporation under New York Business Corporation Law § 1101 (a) (2), which allows the AG to dissolve a corporation if it finds “that the corporation has exceeded the authority conferred upon it by law, or has violated any provision of law whereby it has forfeited its charter, or carried on, conducted or transacted its business in a persistently fraudulent or illegal manner, or by the abuse of its powers contrary to the public policy of the state has become liable to be dissolved.”

To that end, an advocacy group called Free Speech for People (FSFP) has asked New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to investigate whether to revoke the charter of The Trump Organization, Inc., due to the president’s ownership stake in the corporation and its alleged history of illegal activity.

The 24-page letter is less interested in new legal arguments, or even in arcane questions of standing, than existing evidence that Trump’s corporate entities are being used to funnel illegal emoluments to Trump. The group’s claims run the gamut from allegations of discriminatory housing practices in the 1970s through last year’s claims against Trump University. In addition to getting around the standing problem, the initiative also sidesteps the need to rope in Congress, the Justice Department, or any other entity disinclined to investigate or question Trump conflicts.

Schneiderman has been at the vanguard of state attorneys general who have pushed back on Trump’s actions: He brought one of the cases against Trump University, launched an investigation of the Trump Foundation, and has opposed the president’s executive order on immigration. But Shugerman insists that this legal move could work in many different jurisdictions. Actions under a state’s quo warranto authorities could be brought, for instance, against the Trump Organization in Washington, where it appears to be in violation of the General Services Administration lease that bars any federal official from operating the hotel. And Shugerman adds that in some states, like California, entities beyond the state AG would be authorized to bring such an action. California law also grants this power to local governments and municipalities.

I asked Shugerman whether there is any reason to believe the states would be willing to take as dramatic and draconian an action as threatening to dissolve Trump Organization entities. In an email, he explained that this remedy can be tailored to be more or less dramatic, but one meaningful benefit is that it allows for broad discovery:

Under quo warranto proceedings, the state attorneys general and the courts have flexibility to create a balanced remedy. The first step is discovery to find out about the Trump Organization’s financial arrangements and entanglements with foreign and state entities. The next step is to take the emoluments and fraud claims into court. In the end, the attorneys general and the courts may craft a mix of injunctions, fines, divestment, and/or limited dissolutions of LLCs. It’s important to recognize that the first step of transparency about the Trump Organization is a service to the public interest by itself, but so is the rule of law and anti-corruption. If this action prevents foreign entities from using payments and debts to manipulate American policy, some relatively minor and temporary instability is worthwhile and necessary.

As to whether one more lawsuit alleging yet more corruption can dislodge an intransigent president who believes himself above the ethics laws, Shugerman reminded me that allowing the appearance of corruption to persist is not costless. “Look how much instability the Trump Organization and its foreign entanglements have already created,” he said. “This action will actually reduce that instability, legally, economically, and in national security.”Photo illustration by Mal Langsdon/Reuters

Encryption has become a major buzzword in the digital world in the past few months. You’ve probably heard that Apple and Google have made it a default setting for their latest smartphones, while FBI Director James Comey and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron think encryption should be banned unless governments have ways to get around it. Even President Obama commented on the subject recently, saying that he supports “strong encryption” (albeit with some caveats). But for all this talk about encryption, less than 20 percent of Internet users actively use it, according to Pew. So what is it, exactly, and how does it affect the security of your online communications?

In simple terms, encryption relies on mathematical algorithms to protect the security and integrity of data as it is transmitted or stored on devices. Encryption is the process of combining the contents of a message (“plaintext”) with a secret password (the encryption “key”) in such a way that scrambles the content into a totally new form (“ciphertext”) that is unintelligible to unauthorized users. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt the information and convert it back into plaintext. Encrypting data doesn’t stop someone who is not the intended recipient of a message from intercepting it—but it helps ensure that he won’t be able to decipher it if he does. Herewith is a basic explanation of where encryption stands today—and how you can use it protect yourself and your communications.

As a consumer, you have the power to decide to give your business to the companies that you trust.

For much of the 20th century, sophisticated encryption was available only to members of the military and intelligence communities. They used it to protect their most sensitive communications and kept the technology secret to prevent their adversaries from adopting it. But in 1976, two researchers named Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman discovered and published a paper on “split-key encryption,” which demonstrated how individuals and ordinary users could communicate securely by creating a pair of related private and public keys that would be used to encrypt and decrypt plaintext conversations. Diffie and Hellman’s discovery laid the foundation for a number of innovations in secure communications over the past 40 years—many of which were necessary for the growth of the Internet as a public platform for sharing personal information, shopping, banking, and much more.

Today, encryption is an integral part of many of the tools and protocols we rely on to protect the security of our everyday transactions and online communications. Encryption can be used on the physical layer of the Internet to scramble data that’s being transmitted via cable or radio communications. It adds support for secure communications to plaintext protocols like the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which enables Web browsing, and can protect the integrity of data exchanged through applications like email and mobile messengers. You can also encrypt data that is stored on devices like cellphones or computers, shielding the local copies of emails, text messages, documents, and photos from unauthorized snooping.

How and at what layer your data is encrypted makes a huge difference. Just because a product or service uses encryption doesn’t necessarily mean that everything that’s stored on or sent over that platform is completely private. For example, Google now makes the HTTPS protocol (HTTP over an encrypted connection) the default for all Gmail traffic, which prevents unauthorized users from reading emails while they travel between Google’s email servers and end users’ computers—but it does nothing to stop Google itself from accessing plaintext copies of those conversations. If you don’t want your email provider to be able to read your messages, you have to take additional steps to implement end-to-end encryption, which refers to a system in which “messages are encrypted in a way that allows only the unique recipient of a message to decrypt it, and not anyone in between.” With end-to-end encryption, you encrypt the contents of a message on your local machine or device. That data is then transmitted as ciphertext by the email provider to the intended recipient, who is the only person who can decrypt and read it.

Even if you’ve never done anything proactive about encryption, you almost certainly use tools and services that rely on it every single day. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), are used by many popular websites and embedded in a large number of physical products—including smartphones, home routers, and media streaming devices—to protect the security of data as it’s sent back and forth between clients and servers. Your bank uses strong encryption to keep hackers away from your sensitive financial information when you log on to the bank’s website to check your account balance. In fact, there is an entire industry dedicated to supporting the secure digital communications ecosystem. Companies like Verisign and Comodo exist primarily to verify the authenticity of digital certificates and assure customers that the secure sites they are visiting have implemented encryption properly and are not being impersonated by malicious actors. That’s how you can reasonably trust that when you make a purchase from an online retailer, you’re not handing your credit card information over to a stranger who will use it to commit identity fraud.

But there is also a lot that you can do as an individual to add an extra layer of security to your communications. The simplest step is to make sure you’re taking advantage of the option to encrypt whenever it’s offered by the products and services that you use. If you have an iPhone, for example, you should upgrade to the latest iOS, which is comes with encryption by default—meaning that a third party that manages to get around your pass code and get access to the device will find all of the stored information is unreadable. (The same is true for the newest Android OS.)

You should also pay attention to whether the websites you visit use HTTPS, which is an increasingly standard security practice. You can figure this out by looking at the URL of a website: If there is an “s” after the “http,” that means HTTPS is turned on, and any data sent from your browser to the site’s servers is encrypted. Some browsers, like Chrome, have features that make it even more obvious—you’ll notice that “https” is displayed in green with a lock icon to the left of it. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Tor Project have created a handy tool you can download as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox known as “HTTPS Everywhere,” which creates a workaround for websites that still default to unencrypted connections or have otherwise implemented HTTPS in ways that make it difficult to use.

Do your homework to find out which companies and services use strong encryption. There are a number of digital security–focused organizations that have made guides and tools to help ordinary users better understand how this technology works and where it exists online. After the Snowden leaks, EFF began publishing a report called “Encrypt the Web,” which compares how the major Internet companies measure up against five best-practice encryption criteria (including support for HTTPS). The “Encrypt All the Things” campaign, from the advocacy group Access, similarly encourages Internet platforms to improve their data security to prevent unauthorized access to user information. Don’t forget that as a consumer, you have the power to decide to give your business to the companies that you trust—and to help pressure those companies to continually improve their security practices.

If you’re willing to invest the time to go a step further, there are a variety of free and open-source tools that you can use for end-to-end encryption. The first widely available tool that facilitated end-to-end encryption was called PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy and can be used to encrypt text, emails, files, and even parts of your hard drive. Although PGP has been around since the early 1990s, many users still find it difficult and time-consuming to use.* That’s one of the reasons why Google announced last June that it was releasing the source code for the Chrome browser’s new End-to-End extension, which it hopes will be an easier option that allows users to encrypt their data before it leaves the browser. The source code for End-to-End is currently being audited by the computer security community to ensure that the product is robust before Google adds it to the Chrome store. You can also install plugins like Off the Record and TextSecure, which similarly enable end-to-end encryption on instant messages and text messages.

At the end of the day, there’s no such thing as perfect security online. But encryption provides one of the best ways to defend yourself against unauthorized access to your sensitive communications, and it’s worth taking the time to get to know what tools and services are available to you.Panoply is looking for a business development and strategy manager to work in the fun and fast-paced new media environment of podcasting.

Media professionals and intellectuals in the large coastal cities have long struggled to understand the white, non-metropolitan counties in the middle of the country. Just as Christians often fail to understand the diversity of the faraway Islamic world, American coastal elites have come to see the non-metro sections of the heartland as an undifferentiated mass of white, evangelical Republicans. This is far from the reality.

Simplistic county-level maps of election results have helped reinforce a mistaken sense of homogeneity. Inevitably, the non-metro counties of states such as Ohio are the same shade of red, while the counties containing Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo look like small islands of blue.

[The U.S. is becoming more racially diverse. But Democrats may not benefit.]

Before the presidential election, I wrote an article pointing out that the homogeneity of “red” America is an illusion: Small and medium-size postindustrial U.S. towns routinely vote for Democrats — sometimes by very large margins. Few had noticed, because the largely rural counties in which these towns are located were often colored red on election-night maps. In fact, these counties are typically internally polarized, with a solidly Democratic downtown core around Main Street that is surrounded by Republican suburbs and rural areas. The Republican periphery has more voters who go to the polls at higher rates, and so the county is “red” overall.

This polarization only intensified in the most recent election. In this first of two posts, I take a closer look at the voting behavior of postindustrial towns in 2016.

Let’s begin with Ashtabula County, Ohio, which received a lot of media attention before the election. As anticipated, Donald Trump made very large gains and won the county. But in the city of Ashtabula, Hillary Clinton still received 58 percent of the two-party vote.

As you can see in the map below, Trump won majorities in virtually the rest of the county.

[Republicans and Democrats can’t even agree on how they disagree]

We can see a similar pattern in another area that got a good deal of media attention: the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre corridor in Pennsylvania. Clinton received 62 percent of the two-party vote in Scranton and 54 percent in Wilkes-Barre. Trump won large majorities in the surrounding higher-income suburbs and the rural periphery.





The story is quite similar elsewhere. Where the data are available, I have collected and geo-coded precinct-level data for each of the Pennsylvania and Indiana postindustrial towns mentioned in my pre-election article.

In each of the towns, Clinton won majorities, while Trump won the surrounding suburbs and rural periphery.

The idea that the United States is divided into large blue cities and a vast red middle is inaccurate. The postindustrial counties of the Midwest are extremely heterogeneous. They are polarized between town and country in a way that is similar to the polarization between “urban” and “rural” counties.

[This is what we learned by counting the women’s marches]

Sometimes maps do not provide the full picture. To show this division more clearly, I plot Clinton’s vote share against each precinct’s population density. You can see that relatively dense downtown areas — with rental units and smaller single-family homes — are on the right side of each graph; suburban neighborhoods are in the middle; and the rural periphery of the county is on the left. The size of the data markers is in proportion to the population of each precinct.

In each case, the more densely populated a precinct is — and the stronger its industrial history — the more heavily it votes Democratic.

In smaller towns such as Johnstown and Williamsport, Clinton won majorities in only a handful of precincts, but in larger industrial towns she won many precincts, often by large margins.





A popular claim is that Trump’s populist anti-trade rhetoric resonated most in postindustrial towns with severe job losses. If so, we might expect that these towns suddenly started to vote more like their neighboring Republican precincts, with the graphs flattening in 2016.

To examine this possibility, I have collected and geo-coded data for recent presidential elections. For Pennsylvania’s counties, I am able to reach back to 2000, and in Ohio and Indiana, to 2008. Rather than presenting each scatter plot, I fit a curve to the precinct-level data using locally weighted regressions. We can see Clinton’s share of the two-party vote, captured with blue markers in the graphs above, as a blue curve. Al Gore’s 2000 share of the two-party vote is in green, and John F. Kerry’s in 2004 is in orange. Barack Obama’s 2008 vote share is in black, and his 2012 vote share is in red.

We can see that the blue line for the 2016 Democratic vote is no flatter than those for previous years. In fact, the relationship between population density and Democratic voting has only gotten steeper.

A big story of the 2016 election is that the blue line for Clinton’s vote is much lower than Obama’s red (2012) and black (2008) lines. But notice that in almost all of the graphs, the gap between Clinton’s vote share and Obama’s grew the most on the left side of the graphs — in the most rural places. Clinton lost fewer votes in the postindustrial towns than in the Republican-leaning surroundings.

In several counties, this decline in rural support for Democrats was foreshadowed by an asymmetric rural decline for Obama from 2008 to 2012.

Clinton lost crucial Midwestern swing states in large part because of a significant collapse of Democratic support outside of major city centers. But even in what look like “red” counties, Democrats maintain a significant base of support — despite Clinton’s historically poor performance — in the cities and towns that developed an industrial working class in the early part of the 2oth century.

The graphs also reveal something important about Obama’s victories in the Midwest. He was successful not only because he boosted turnout among young people and minorities in large cities. A closer look shows that he also won large majorities in low-income postindustrial towns, and almost half of the votes in the surrounding rural communities, where in 2016 Clinton won only 25 percent to 30 percent.

One of the clearest lessons from 2016 is that the Democrats cannot win the crucial swing states just by running up the score in the biggest cities. They will need to reinvest in understanding the heterogeneous areas beyond the city limits.

This is the first of two parts. Read the second part here.

“Religious exemptions to the protections of civil rights based upon classifications such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, and gender identity, when they are permissible, significantly infringe upon these civil rights,” the report said.

The chairman of the commission, Martin R. Castro, went to the hot spot of the debate with a separate statement in the report that uncloaks what often, but certainly not always, lurks behind protestations about freedom of religion.

“The phrases ‘religious liberty’ and ‘religious freedom’ will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy or any form of intolerance,” Castro wrote.

Castro headed his statement with a quote attributed to John Adams: “The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.” That language comes from the Treaty of Tripoli, signed by Adams in 1797.

For Roger Severino, director of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a particularly troubling aspect of the report is what he called “the attempt to discredit sincere religious believers as being motivated by hate instead of faith and the implied recommendation that religious groups should change their beliefs on sexual morality to conform with liberal norms for the good of the country. I would expect to see such a slanted and anti-religious report come out of China or France perhaps, but am disappointed to see it come from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.”

The report follows a meeting the commission held in March 2013 to explore “the uncertain boundaries of religious freedom.” Its findings and recommendations place the boundary at the point where religious freedom conflicts with civil rights.

Finding No. 1 makes it clear which set of rights should be on top: “Civil rights protections ensuring nondiscrimination, as embodied in the Constitution, laws, and policies, are of preeminent importance in American jurisprudence.”

The commission also said:

“Religious exemptions from nondiscrimination laws and policies must be weighed carefully and defined narrowly on a fact-specific basis”

“Third parties, such as employees, should not be forced to live under the religious doctrines of their employers”

“A basic right as important as the freedom to marry should not be subject to religious beliefs.”

The report was adopted by a majority vote of the eight-member commission, an equal number appointed by the president and Congress. No more than four can be members of the same political party. Yet, a vote for the report doesn’t necessarily mean agreement with it.

In a long statement in the report, Commissioner Peter Kirsanow, a Republican appointed by Congress, called the findings and recommendations “an alarm to liberty-loving Americans.” Nonetheless, he voted in favor “only because this report has already been delayed for over three years, and was concerned that a ‘no’ vote from me would be used as an excuse to further delay the report.”

Saying “the conflict between religious liberty and nondiscrimination principles is profound,” Kirsanow said the tension “appears most acute when religious liberty and sexual liberty conflict.”

Are those rights of equal importance?

Kirsanow says no: “In our constitutional order, the first reason that religious liberty takes precedence over sexual liberty is that this is enshrined in our Constitution.” He argues that the commission elevates “nondiscrimination laws, which with the exception of the Fourteenth Amendment are mere statutes, not constitutional provisions, over the provisions of the Constitution.

In practice, he added, this is “hostile to religion.”

Yet, in practice, religion has been used as hostile weapon against human and civil rights.

“In the past, religion was cited to justify Jim Crow laws, and oppose women’s suffrage,” Castro, appointed by President Obama, told The Washington Post. “Present day ‘religious liberty’ efforts are aimed at discriminating against the LGBTQ community … and now it’s used to deny the use of public school bathroom facilities by transgender youth. Some supporters of ‘religious freedom’ or ‘religious liberty’ oppose American Muslims building mosques in their communities. True religious liberty and religious freedom should be about allowing Americans to freely practice their faith, and it is not, and should never be about preventing others from living their lives freely and equally.”Doane Gregory/Universal Studios

This post contains spoilers for Fifty Shades Darker.

The title may say Fifty Shades Darker, but is the new BDSM-flavored romance from James Foley actually any darker than its prequel, Fifty Shades of Grey? Since nothing is hotter than a little statistical analysis, we ran the numbers to compare the amount of sex, kink, and overall darkness in both films. Below, you’ll find our results, in chart form.

Sex and Nudity

Since our main characters have already hooked up when Fifty Shades Darker begins (and because there's not nearly as much paperwork this time around), there’s also a lot less time to wait before the first sex scene.

Even so, the number of such scenes in each movie is about the same. Note: We’ve stretched the definition of a sex scene here to include some erotic scenes that don’t technically include any intercourse, like Ana’s first spanking, or when Christian introduces her to the Ben Wa balls. Still, both movies are remarkably consistent when it comes to the amount of doin’ it.

Amazingly, even the precentage of time Christian is seen shirtless is so reliable across both films that we can only conclude this is the result of a carefully calibrated formula designed to maximize the impact of Jamie Dornan’s naked torso.

BDSM

Okay, so we’ve established that there’s just about the same amount of sex in both movies. But how about the amount of BDSM? Surely to justify the sequel's title, there should at least be some darker tastes in play. And yet, when you run the numbers, there’s actually surprisingly less BDSM to be found throughout Fifty Shades Darker, which tends to favor some light exhibitionism over kinkier fare. For starters, there are fewer spankings—and only hand-administered blows in Darker, whereas Fifty Shades of Grey also makes use of the riding crop and a particuarly nasty belt.

There’s also less equipment being shown off, in general ...

... and significantly less time spent in Christian’s carefully color-coordinated sex dungeon.

General Darkness

Fine, so Darker isn’t all that much darker when it comes to sex. But what about outside of the bedroom (or in this case, the red room)? In Fifty Shades of Grey, the greatest threats Ana and Christian faced were broken hearts, sore bottoms, and, in one instance, a speeding cyclist. But in Fifty Shades Darker, they’re almost constantly in danger, whether Christian’s troubled ex is brandishing a weapon or Ana’s boss is being a world-class creep. There are not only more than triple the number of threats to the main characters' safety/well-being, those threats are also much more severe.In this edition of our members-only podcast digest, listen to the best segments of the week:A lot has happened between September 2016 and February 2017. A reality-TV bulldozer became president of the United States, sparking one of the largest protests in the country’s history. He instituted a travel ban against seven Muslim-majority nations that invited more wide-sweeping protests at the nation’s airports. He antagonized allies. Eighteen million stand to lose health-care coverage if he moves forward with his campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. People are scared, and yet the show must go on. Or shows.

We’re talking about New York Fashion Week, where, like creatives in other industries, designers were faced with the challenge of how to continue with business as usual under these circumstances. For many, the answer was a familiar one: T-shirts bearing political messages.

Take Prabal Gurung, who sent models down the runway in soft-knit tees that declared “The future is female,” “I am an immigrant,” “Our minds, our bodies, our power,” “Revolution has no borders,” “Stronger than fear,” “Nothing more, nothing less,” “Awake,” and more.

"In the good old days, fashion was an escape and a fantasy, and all of that is gone. The world we live in is so uncertain, people are really taking to action,” designer Gurung, who was raised in Nepal, told Vanity Fair this week. “I think what fashion has a responsibility to provide not an escape, but a reality. An optimistic reality.”

Gurung’s T-shirts were directly inspired by the Women’s March in New York, which he attended with hundreds of thousands of other people on January 21, less than a month before his runway show. “I feel like this country has given me an opportunity that no other country could do, and I owe it to this country,” he said, explaining the impetus for the shirts. “After creating this platform, that I speak up when I see there’s justice not being done, or when I feel like I can use my voice.”

Message tees are at least as old as 1948, when “Dew It for Dewey” decorated T-shirts for U.S. presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey. They have even grown in popularity on runways in recent seasons, but their messages have made a stark leap of late. Whereas last fall’s crop offered pointed, if vague (and possibly ironic) language—including “Futuresex” and “Canned Candies” at Peter Saville, “Hustler” and “Wench” at Hood by Air, “Thriving” at Baja East, and “Love” at Michael Kors—the post-Trump batch has left little to chance. (Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Dior tee from her September 2016 debut, which read, “We should all be feminists,” was something of an early harbinger of what was to come this season.) The tone has been one of inclusion and resistance—one that’s less cute, and more in line with protest tees of the 1970s and 1980s. Besides Gurung’s ad-hoc protest march, Christian Siriano sent a shirt that read “People are people” (a Depeche Mode song from 1984) down his runways. “We need leaders” and “Make America New York” proclaimed bomber jackets and red hats, respectively, at Public School. "We are all human beings” was the word at Creatures of Comfort.

So was this all just T-shirt activism, well, T-shirt activism? Possibly. But by and large, the designers who wore their statements on their sleeves (and chests and heads) tend have a track record of action. Gurung bristled at the general public’s tendency to look down at fashion as frivolous.

“We’re a multi-billion-dollar business,“ he said. “Not only is my position as a brand to make 90 percent of my clothes in New York, I’m an immigrant. I have a foundation back in Nepal that educates more than 200 children, from in-mates children to street-workers children. Yes, I make beautiful clothes and that brings me joy, but all these other things also bring me joy.”

His shirts pair well with action, or as he says, “I don't just do T-shirts. I don't just tweet. I do make an effort. I hope the next step is that people are actually getting their hands dirty and going to organizations that might need their help or the audience that they can share.”

Gurung says that the buyers of his T-shirts will eventually be able to choose between a couple different organizations as recipients of the proceeds, though nothing has been made final yet. Siriano, whose husband Brad Walsh designed the “People are people” shirt, has already begun donating all proceeds of the T-shirt to the A.C.L.U. The slogan was born out of frustration, said Siriano, who has made a point of casting different body types for his shows in the past.

“I’ve been doing this for awhile now, and it sometimes can be frustrating that people don't always see it until it’s literally in their face,” he said, explaining that his shirt was geared less toward out-right politics than some of the others from this season. “People keep asking about plus-size on the runway, why you keep dressing all these types of women, and I literally just want people to understand it as just that. ‘People are people.’ Why not? Why does it have to be a topic?”

He continued, “We only did one look because that‘s all you need. It was one powerful, great idea. Obviously there‘s a million things I‘d love to say but this encompassed all of them in one simple phrase.”

The message tee’s presence on fall 2017 runways is a testament to how quickly things can change, and how the fashion industry’s pace puts it in a unique position to react and reflect the sentiment of its consumers. While designers by-and-large have leaned on subtle tools like texture, cut, and color to signal their collection’s point (all-white as a hat tip to suffragettes, for example, or purple as a symbol of cross-party conciliation), outright messaging seems to be the order of the day in the placard and protest era. Against fashion’s more subtle backdrop, a message T-shirt might seem like it’s screaming. But the models were already walking anyhow—might as well talk too.

To back up anti-abortion omnibus bill HB 1411, which passed the state legislature earlier this month, conservative legislators have offered a list of places women can go for birth control, pap smears, and other reproductive services once Planned Parenthood is barred from taking Medicaid. That list includes dozens of elementary and middle schools, several dental practices, and at least one optometry center.

Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.



If Gov. Rick Scott signs HB 1411, the bill will, for all practical purposes, defund Planned Parenthood by prohibiting state-funded organizations from working with health centers that provide abortions in any cases other than rape, incest, or conditions that threaten the pregnant woman’s life. Women on Medicaid, for instance, will not be able to obtain contraception or any other medical services, abortion-related or not, from Planned Parenthood or any other abortion provider.

The Supreme Court has placed an ambiguous limit on states’ ability to restrict abortion. In order to maintain that the law does not impose an “undue burden” on women—a threshold established by 1992’s Planned Parenthood v. Casey—lawmakers must prove that women are still able to obtain an abortion in the state. Though that threshold doesn’t apply to publicly funded reproductive health care, Florida Democratic Rep. Lori Berman demanded that the bill’s co-sponsor, Colleen Burton, prove her claim that there will still be plenty of places for people, especially women in poverty, to get breast exams, contraception, and the like.

The list of federally qualified health centers that Burton claims provide “family planning services” is laughable, mainly because it’s half-populated by K-12 schools. Nevertheless, proponents of HB 1411 have used this list to pooh-pooh concerns for women’s health, claiming that there are 29 public health clinics for every Planned Parenthood in the state; therefore, the argument goes, no poor women will miss Planned Parenthood when it’s gone. The Guardian reports that in 2010, according to Guttmacher Institute data, there were just five public health clinics that offered family planning services for every Florida Planned Parenthood.

Anti-choice legislators in Ohio and Louisiana have pulled similar tricks, shrugging off warnings of a reproductive health care shortage by recommending that their states’ women get UTI treatment and STI screenings from food banks and ophthalmologists.ROME Facebook Inc. will not become a media company, its founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday, telling students the firm would remain a technology platform.

An increasing number of users are turning to social media networks, such as Facebook (FB.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N), to find their news, but Zuckerberg said his firm had no ambitions to become a content provider.

"No, we are a tech company, not a media company," said Zuckerberg, after a young Italian asked him whether Facebook intended to become a news editor.

While acknowledging the role Facebook has in supplying users with news through their connections and stressing the advantages of obtaining information from different parts of the world, Zuckerberg said Facebook was "a technology company, we build the tools, we do not produce any content".

"The world needs news companies, but also technology platforms, like what we do, and we take our role in this very seriously," he said, speaking from Rome's Luiss university.

Earlier on Monday, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan had a private audience with Pope Francis. It was the latest in a string of meetings the pontiff has held with Silicon Valley leaders, including Apple (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) boss Eric Schmidt.

Zuckerberg said he gave the Argentine pontiff a model of Aquila, Facebook's lightweight solar-powered drone aimed at beaming lasers to extend internet access to places that have yet to be connected.

"We ... discussed the importance of connecting people, especially in parts of the world without internet access," Zuckerberg posted on his personal Facebook profile after the meeting.

Zuckerberg also on Monday met Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who is pushing to upgrade Italy's limited internet infrastructure.On Monday, the Los Angeles Times published a bombshell article, outlining the details of a “confidential Federal Railroad Administration risk analysis,” in an attack on the competence and ethics of the California High Speed Rail Authority. Reporter Ralph Vartabedian claims the report shows cost overruns and delays, although the Times does not provide readers a chance to read the report for themselves.

The California High Speed Rail Authority is given little space in the story to defend itself. Much more is given to critics who have been seeking to kill the project for years.

The story went viral with conservative news websites that are read by decision makers in Washington, D.C. Breitbart, the news website that was once edited by incoming senior adviser to President-Elect Donald Trump, summarized the article with the headline “CA High-Speed Rail: Over Budget, Behind Schedule.” Even less-reputable website PJ Media took a harder swing in “Train Wreck: California High-Speed Rail in Worse Shape Than Anyone Thought” charging corruption and incompetence at the highest levels.

With today’s report at The Hill that the administration plans massive cuts to the Department of Transportation for unnamed programs, the timing of the piece couldn’t have come at a worse time for the High Speed Rail Authority. In a critique of the article at the pro-High Speed Rail website CAHSR Blog, Robert Cruickshank writes. “I will bet money that the Trump FRA finds a way to claim that the Authority missed this deadline and must repay that $220 million. I would not be surprised if they also make a play to try and clawback much more of that stimulus money, though I doubt it can go very far.

Of all the obstacles I described above that the Authority has weathered, they may be about to encounter the largest one yet: Donald Trump.”

Of course, if the article is true, that there are cost over-runs and major delays and the FRA did publish a secret report slamming the project, the Authority deserves whatever is coming next.

And that’s where things start to fall apart. The Times’ critique isn’t a fair one, using partial truths to create doubt. While it is factually true to state that the report is “confidential,” Vartabedian uses the term without providing any context, leaving readers to imagine why the report’s findings would be withheld from the public.

First, the FRA conducts risk assessments of every project that receives federal funding. In response to an email asking why the FRA completed this study, Deputy Director of Public Affairs Marc Willis responded somewhat cheekily, “Risk analysis is a standard oversight tool used on major capital projects—not just California.”

So why is the report marked “confidential?” Simply put, because the FRA and its local and regional partners want to be able to have a frank conversation about the status of the project without fear of the report being misunderstood by political opponents and the local press. The High Speed Rail Authority, in its response to the article in the legislature, outlines many complaints with the article, but seems especially exasperated about the characterization of the report.

“Risk analysis is an ongoing iterative process; factors are discussed, assessed for their potential impact, and determinations are made as to whether they are applicable and to what degree,” the letter states. “It was marked deliberative because it is just that – part of that ongoing work among staff to determine what risks might be applicable and how to manage them.”

So how about the damning critique Vartabedian outlines from the routine deliberative report draft? Turns out their are plenty of holes in the report as well.

First claim : The project could cost $3.6 billion more than the budget announced to the public. The Authority announced a $6.4 billion budget. It could now cost $10 billion.

The key word here is could. There are a lot of things that could increase the budget of the project. But at the moment, the budget for the project is $7.8 billion, not $6.4 billion. Why is that number higher than the $6.4 billion estimate? $900 million of the $1.4 billion difference is contingency funds should other parts of the project go over budget.

Second claim : The California High-Speed Rail Authority originally anticipated completing the Central Valley track by this year, but the federal risk analysis estimates that that won’t happen until 2024, placing the project seven years behind schedule.

This is true, but hardly news. The route for the Merced to Bakersfield wasn’t approved by the Board until last October. In fact, when the plan for the Initial Operating Segment was approved last year, the estimate for the opening date was 2025.

Third claim : The Federal Railroad Administration is tracking the project because it has extended $3.5 billion in two grants to help build the Central Valley segment. The administration has an obligation to ensure that the state complies with the terms, including a requirement that the state has the funding to match the federal grants.

This is true. This routine report is put together because the state received a federal grant. And good news, the Authority is on track to meet its goal, including the matching funds and the requirement that all funds be spent in the grant timeline. A statement released by the FRA, and quoted in the CAHSR article, clearly states, “Is California on track to spend the Recovery Act Funds at this moment? Yes. Will it? With continued focus and hard work, yes.”

Fourth claim : Staff morale is low.

I wonder why that is? Probably because the project is a political hot potato and is often pilloried in the local press, including the nation’s fourth largest newspaper?

Vartabedian clearly has an ax to grind with the Authority. Roger Rudick, now editor of Streetsblog SF, wrote a scathing takedown of his coverage in 2014. Perhaps that explains the many pieces of good news left out of his article, news that is outlined in the Authority’s response. Or maybe it explains why much of the background for Vartabedian’s article is from anonymous sources, without any context for who is providing the information and why anonymity was granted.

But the sad reality is that even though the Times’ article is sloppy and unprofessional, it could have negative consequences for the California High Speed Rail project. A hilariously terrible article by the Reason Foundation on the then newly-opened Phase I of the Expo Line, lamented that ridership for the completed Expo Line hadn’t reached it’s 30-year ridership projections–in its second week of being half-open.

Hardee’s workers in Pennsylvania were required to pay 10 cents per hour for the privilege of wearing a Hardee’s uniform.

Workers at a Georgia Hardee’s were told to clock out and sit in the parking lot when business slowed down. When it picked up again, they were told to clock back in and work.

Managers at a Hardee’s in Missouri had money deducted from their paychecks whenever the cash register came up short.

Adult workers at a Hardee’s restaurant in Iowa were paid a “sub-minimum wage” that was legal only for minors, while minors worked so late that their hours broke child labor law.

In each of those cases, Labor Department investigators found that Hardee’s restaurants had violated federal wage-and-hour regulations and workers were entitled to thousands of dollars in backpay. Throughout this time, the Hardee’s brand has been overseen by Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the next labor secretary.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Puzder would be responsible for enforcing the same worker protections that his company and its franchisees were caught violating, sometimes repeatedly.

Puzder’s nomination to head the Labor Department has galvanized Democrats and workplace watchdogs, who say his record at Hardee’s and his past statements about workers should disqualify him from the job.

Conservatives and business groups have rallied to his defense. They argue that any Hardee’s violations need to be put in context. There were roughly 2,000 Hardee’s locations as of 2012, and the restaurants highlighted in this story represent a small fraction of them.

The types of wage violations committed by these Hardee’s restaurants are endemic to the fast-food industry at large. All the big chains operate on a similar business model, and their franchisees run afoul of the same laws.

Wage theft is so prevalent in the fast-food industry that the Labor Department developed a targeted enforcement program to crack down on that one sector. During the 2016 fiscal year alone, the Labor Department found violations in 86 percent of fast-food cases investigated, with 10,300 workers owed more than $5.4 million, according to a department spokesman. President Barack Obama’s labor officials attributed the industry’s problems in part to a franchise model that blurs accountability.

Puzder has been a public booster of that model.

With one exception, all the Hardee’s wage theft cases reviewed by HuffPost involved restaurants that were run by franchisees, rather than by Puzder’s company, CKE Restaurants, which also owns the Carl’s Jr. brand. The franchise model allows companies like CKE to outsource restaurant operations ― and certain liabilities ― while retaining a portion of the profits.

Hardee’s workers in Pennsylvania were required to pay 10 cents per hour for the privilege of wearing a Hardee’s uniform.

But all the employees shorted on pay were working under the Hardee’s banner, to the benefit of Hardee’s and CKE, regardless of who was signing the paychecks. As a group of Labor Department officials explain in a petition on Puzder’s nomination that is now circulating, “our experience as the guardians of our nation’s employment laws has taught us that such violations often occur as the result of incentives or practices created by the franchisor.” That would be CKE.

A Hardee’s spokeswoman didn’t respond to questions about how CKE monitors its franchisees’ labor practices, particularly those of repeat violators of the law. The details in this story come from documents on wage theft investigations that The Huffington Post obtained through a public records request.

A common thread through many cases was how managers felt pressured to keep costs down and cut corners, driving them to stiff low-wage workers on pay. Some Hardee’s locations did not want to pay workers at all when the restaurants were not busy.

In a Tennessee case, managers had workers clock out late in the day when restaurant traffic would drop off, even though they had to continue serving the customers who did come in. This led to employees doing unpaid, off-the-clock work for periods of 30 minutes to three hours. “They are required to punch out to bring down labor costs,” the federal investigator wrote.

Sometimes, the workers were also forced to take an unscheduled lunch or break when not many customers were around. According to the investigator, the owner of the Hardee’s restaurant saw nothing wrong with the practice. “He stated that an employer could send their workers on as many breaks as they wanted,” the investigator wrote.

The franchisee agreed to pay a total of $7,600 in back wages to 29 workers.

A Hardee’s franchise in Georgia shaved labor costs in a similar manner. “Some employees indicated in their interview that managers send them out to the parking lot when the restaurant is not busy and ask them back in when it gets busy,” the investigator wrote. The off-the-clock work and other pay deductions ended up violating both minimum wage and overtime protections.

That franchisee agreed to pay $12,000 to an undisclosed number of employees.

In an Alabama case, a Hardee’s manager had an added incentive to make workers’ hours disappear. As an investigator put it, “this manager shaved hours for all employees in order to receive bonuses.” (Retail and food managers sometimes receive extra pay for hitting payroll targets.) The Labor Department found that 64 employees were shorted on pay when the manager fudged their timecards.

Including other violations, that franchisee agreed to pay $16,000 to the 64 workers.

In a Michigan case, a franchisee who owned two Hardee’s outlets avoided paying workers overtime by compensating them separately for their time at each restaurant. In a single week, for instance, one employee logged 40 hours at one store and 17 at the other. Under the law, she should have received time-and-a-half pay for the extra 17 hours, since all her work was for the same employer. Instead, she was paid “straight time” for it all.

The investigator determined the workers were owed $4,900 in back wages for the lost overtime pay.

Some Hardee’s locations did not want to pay workers at all when the restaurants were not busy.

In other cases, Hardee’s locations violated the law when they deducted money from workers’ pay for the uniforms they wore.

At a Pennsylvania restaurant, the company took out 10 cents for every hour an employee worked in order to cover the cost of providing Hardee’s clothing. Because of the deduction, workers did not receive their full federally mandated time-and-a-half pay when they labored overtime.

The franchisee agreed to hand over more than $2,000 in back pay.

At an Iowa restaurant, workers ponied up $9.80 for red polo shirts with a Hardee’s logo on them. This violated the law because it pushed some workers’ pay below the minimum wage. The franchisee had been reprimanded for the same exact practice five years earlier, the investigator noted.

“He said that his understanding was that the cost of a uniform could not be deducted from the paycheck, but that it was not a violation if the employee paid cash for the required uniform,” the investigator wrote.

The franchisee also broke the law by paying workers a “sub-minimum wage.” It was legal to compensate minors at such a rate in certain circumstances in Iowa, the investigator noted, but some of the people being paid the reduced wage at this Hardee’s were well into their twenties. The franchisee also had a practice of purging workers’ hours from the computer system after paying them.

This franchisee, which employed 12 workers under the age of 16, was cited for 17 child labor violations, many of them for how late the kids were toiling away. One 15-year-old girl told the investigator that she worked as late as 1 a.m. some shifts. The company was cited for $4,000 in back wages and another $14,000 in civil penalties.

But the franchisee ended up selling its Hardee’s locations shortly after the investigation and shut down its operations. According to records, neither the back wages nor the civil penalties were ever paid.

Ever since its disclosure in 2012, this vulnerability has been the attack vector of choice for exploitation by attackers who seek to hijack Microsoft Word or Excel and force these programs to execute malicious code.

In fact, according to SophosLabs research, as late as Q4 2015, CVE-2012-0158 was still used by 48% of exploits specifically targeting Office documents.

In this new research paper, Graham Chantry of SophosLabs provides a deep dive into several exploits found in the wild and how they work using CVE-2012-0158.

This paper also investigates why this vulnerability has been so persistent and popular for the past four years, and theorizes about its possible longevity. The good news for most of us is that the number of computers still vulnerable to this attack is dwindling worldwide, especially as Office releases new updates, and more computers are patched and upgraded to defend against this specific vulnerability.

Our researchers dissect all aspects of this vulnerability in this new research paper: how it works, why it’s been so popular, how it’s changed form, who it’s most commonly utilized against and what the future holds for it.

Alexander Acosta as his new choice for Labor secretary, less than a day after Andy Puzder dropped out of consideration for the Cabinet post.

Acosta is dean of Florida International University College of Law and was a member of the National Labor Relations Board. He also served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and as a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, meaning the Senate previously confirmed him for jobs three times. Acosta, who attended Harvard Law School, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito when the latter was an appeals judge.

Acosta "has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed, did very, very well," Trump said at a White House news conference. "And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be — I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of Labor."

Trump met with Acosta on Wednesday night, according to Bloomberg and Fox News.

Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, withdrew Wednesday ahead of his confirmation hearing amid mounting bipartisan opposition. In a statement, Puzder did not specify why he dropped out but noted that he made the decision "after careful consideration and discussions with my family."

Acosta would enter a bitter confirmation process in which Democrats have fought against many of Trump's nominees and Trump has blamed the Senate's minority party for obstruction. Puzder's withdrawal also came as the White House deals with the aftermath of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's resignation.

If confirmed, Acosta would come into Trump's Cabinet with more government experience than many of Trump's other nominees, some of whom had long private sector careers. He does have ties to the business world — he serves as the chairman of U.S. Century Bank, a community bank in Florida.The Office of Government Ethics is recommending that the White House take disciplinary action against Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to President Trump, for endorsing Ivanka Trump's products in a TV interview.

Walter Shaub, the director of the ethics office, wrote in a letter to the White House that there is "strong reason to believe" Conway violated ethics standards and that disciplinary action is warranted. He suggested that the White House open an investigation.

Shaub likened what Conway did to appearing in a TV commercial.

Conway gave the endorsement on Fox News Channel last week, one day after the president attacked the Nordstrom department store chain for treating his daughter unfairly. Nordstrom has said it dropped her line of clothing and accessories because they weren't selling well.

"Go buy Ivanka's stuff, is what I would tell you," Conway told Fox News. "It's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully -- I'm going to just, I'm going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online."

Shaub sent the letter to the White House after a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House Oversight Committee asked the agency to look into Conway.

Shaub asked for an answer from the White House by Feb. 28.

Federal ethics standards say public employees may not use their positions "for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity."

The ethics office itself has no enforcement power. Disciplinary action against federal employees who violate ethics standards is left to the individual agencies where they work -- in this case the White House.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said last week that Conway had been "counseled" but did not elaborate. Conway later said that Trump "supports me 100%."

"At some point, I hope American women work for a boss that treats them the way President Trump treated me today," Conway said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Shaub's letter was made public.

Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, called it a "textbook violation of federal ethics rules."

"The president should follow the independent advice of the Office of Government Ethics to impose discipline on Ms. Conway," he said in a statement.

The office of Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the committee chairman, said, "I appreciate the quick response from OGE and hope the White House heeds their recommendation."

Deal or, more likely, no deal: Remember how Donald Trump was the master of “making deals”? Remember how he was itching to get the Israelis and the Palestinians to the negotiating table so he could scale the Everest of deals? It’s not working out, writes Fred Kaplan, because he doesn’t know anything about the Middle East.

At least TV is good now: In HBO’s thrilling Big Little Lies, Reese Witherspoon is finally playing to her strengths, writes Willa Paskin. And Aisha Harris is cheered that shows about the black experience, such as Atlanta, Insecure, and Black-ish, are connecting with viewers who aren’t black.

Today in Trump: He picked a new nominee for labor secretary who, though conservative, “might bring a dose of professionalism and civic-mindedness to the Trump administration.” Then he gave a press conference that can charitably be described as “not entirely hinged.”

The resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn this week was a stunning development, even for an administration that has generated more chaos and upheaval than Washington has ever seen in the early weeks of a presidency. With breaking news arriving nearly every hour, and with American foreign policy in an uncertain state, I spoke on the phone with James Mann, a journalist, expert on foreign affairs, and author of The Obamians: The Struggle Inside the White House to Redefine American Power.

Isaac Chotiner Isaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer.

During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed what made Flynn such a unique national security adviser, whether the “deep state” is trying to undermine Trump, and the most boring part of the president’s job.

Isaac Chotiner: You wrote a piece for the New York Times in December arguing that Trump’s foreign policy team was built to fail. What has surprised even you about the past month?

James Mann: I have been surprised by the intensity of the fights over Flynn, and I have been surprised at what it produced within the administration, which is to say: intense skirmishing among high-level people at the White House. To be self-critical about that piece, probably what I had more in mind and sketched out was a clash between Flynn and the secretary of defense, James Mattis.

How different was Flynn’s brief tenure compared with people who have held his job?

Usually what happens is that a president-elect, early on, designates a national security adviser who then begins a fairly orderly process of putting together a staff. And actually, Flynn followed some of these precedents, staffing out a National Security Council. It was different in that it was heavily dominated by people from the military. But there were also three things that were different about Flynn.

The first was an intense regional focus on the Middle East and ISIS and terrorism. Flynn had no particular experience in dealing with other parts of American foreign policy or national security. Let’s remember that Flynn’s development of ties with Russia came from his efforts to work with Russia on the Middle East. Even Russia was seen through a Middle Eastern focus. That is very unusual, for a national security adviser to be that focused in a way that everything else is seen through that lens.

He has Muslims on the brain.

Yes. [Laughs.] The second was a bureaucratic animus. He had it in for the regular intelligence community. Whatever grievances he had, he wore them on his sleeve. There were two different grievances. One was in favor of the guys in field versus the people in Washington, and the other grievance was against the CIA. Those are old fights, and a national security adviser doesn’t usually bring those to his new job. The third is the matter of temperament, which isn’t totally unrelated to the bureaucratic animus. This is a guy who exuded anger in a way that past national security advisers didn’t. And fourth, I would add, is an almost cheerleader quality for the president-elect. There is really no precedent I can think of for a national security adviser having stood up at a political convention and suggesting that the opposing candidate should be locked up.

One of the surprises is that all of this is taking place without all that much input from the secretaries of state and defense. This is really a very narrow bureaucratic battle in which two or three of the leading figures in the bureaucracy seem to play little of a role. What I am used to, much more often, is a full-scale, all-out war between the leading Cabinet secretaries, which was true in the Reagan administration and under George W. Bush. Or a battle between the national security and the online policy makers.

What do you mean by that?

Meaning the people carrying out the policy with China or Russia day to day. What’s amazing is that Flynn never got to the questions that should have hit him about how operational he should be—should he be in what is normally called the Brent Scowcroft model, where the national security adviser is sort of the arbiter? As an aside, even Scowcroft didn’t follow that model, but it is the ideal that often gets put out there.

When have national security advisers departed from that ideal?

The first national security adviser to really break that mold was [Henry] Kissinger. In my mind, the single moment that was the most humiliating that you could possibly imagine for a secretary of state came as Kissinger was leaving on his secret trip to China, and they hadn’t even told Secretary of State [William] Rogers that he was going. First they told him a lie, which was that this came up quickly as he was leaving for Pakistan. Then someone felt guilty, and they sent Kissinger’s deputy, who was Alexander Haig, to inform Rogers that, oh yeah, Kissinger has been negotiating with the Chinese, and has also been conducting secret talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris, and talks on arms control.

Were you surprised by the amount of opposition Flynn and the president have faced from the bureaucracy?

Most people in bureaucratic policy areas have a body of knowledge, which Trump seems to mistrust. If there is a resentment of all expertise, then it is hard to get experts.

I guess I am not all that surprised. It would be one thing if Trump was just trying to change policy, but he is trying to change policy while belittling the motives and sincerity and patriotism of everyone before him. Flynn and Trump were impugning the motives of the entire U.S. intelligence community, and in the case of Flynn, he was telling untruths, which people in the intelligence community had access to. And they had legitimate access to it. I can’t believe the back-and-forth about monitoring these phone conversations. They weren’t monitoring Flynn; they were monitoring the Russian ambassador. And above all, you had the perception that Flynn’s untruths might be, in the view of some in the intelligence community, betraying the interests of the United States to an adversary.

Does the extent of the leaks worry you? People are using phrases like deep-state coup.

I find those fears overblown. This is a unique case in which someone at the level of the national security adviser was saying things that were not true about his conversations with the government of one of the United States’ two leading adversaries in the world. The fact that people within the bureaucracy wanted to come out—I don’t see that as all that worrisome. I certainly don’t see it as something like a deep-state coup, in your words.

How likely is it that Trump will make a major effort to staff multiple levels of the bureaucracy with allies, and how possible is that for him to pull off?

I think he is going to try. I think that is possible, if he is willing to find people who are willing to deal with Congress and the press and other governments in something other than an angry and conspiratorial way. Anything lower down requires experience with policy areas, whether it’s a country or region or an area like proliferation or counterterrorism. Most of the people in those policy areas have a body of knowledge, which Trump seems to mistrust. If there is a resentment of all expertise, then it is hard to get experts.

Why can’t he staff these positions with Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon types?

The problem is that those nonexperts are going to have trouble winning support from the congressional committees, which know a little bit about the areas they are working on; from foreign governments that may know about the Middle East or Asia a little more; from journalists who cover particular areas. You won’t have a policy if you don’t have people who can draw up a policy.

Along the lines of what you were saying earlier, it’s interesting that the person tapped to be the next national security adviser, Robert Harward, is supposed to be very close to Mattis.

Exactly, yes.

Maybe things will start running more smoothly.

It could hardly run less smoothly. Let me add on that: By the natural order of things, foreign policy is still moving forward. It has to. Like with [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe’s visit last weekend, you can envision a scenario—maybe for good reasons, more likely for ego reasons—where Trump begins to like having foreign leaders come either as supplicants or bringing money and investment. He might get into at least the summit aspect of it. You can envision things settling down and that he might somehow get some pleasure out of the routine aspects of high-level diplomacy.

On the other side of that, and I have heard this from Obama officials and in general, a good part of a president’s job is going to high-level multilateral meetings. There is a wonderful anecdote where during the Trump-Obama meeting, Obama just said he was going to go to APEC [the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum], and Trump asked what it was. Obama described it, and Trump said, “That sounds boring.” And in fact some of those meetings are. Obama himself used to get annoyed at some of those meetings he had to sit through, with four hours of speeches, while his top aides went off into bilateral meetings on topics that might be more interesting. He would be left there. It’s not clear to me how [Trump] is going to get out of those, but I don’t see him sitting through long meetings. But I can see him enjoying, eventually, well, I don’t know.

None of us really know, unfortunately.Story highlights Two female suspects were carrying passports from Indonesia and Vietnam

Agents of the Food and Drug Administration know better than anyone else just how bad scientific misbehavior can get. Reading the FDA’s inspection files feels almost like watching a highlights reel from a Scientists Gone Wild video. It’s a seemingly endless stream of lurid vignettes—each of which catches a medical researcher in an unguarded moment, succumbing to the temptation to do things he knows he really shouldn’t be doing. Faked X-ray reports. Forged retinal scans. Phony lab tests. Secretly amputated limbs. All done in the name of science when researchers thought that nobody was watching.

That misconduct happens isn’t shocking. What is: When the FDA finds scientific fraud or misconduct, the agency doesn’t notify the public, the medical establishment, or even the scientific community that the results of a medical experiment are not to be trusted. On the contrary. For more than a decade, the FDA has shown a pattern of burying the details of misconduct. As a result, nobody ever finds out which data is bogus, which experiments are tainted, and which drugs might be on the market under false pretenses. The FDA has repeatedly hidden evidence of scientific fraud not just from the public, but also from its most trusted scientific advisers, even as they were deciding whether or not a new drug should be allowed on the market. Even a congressional panel investigating a case of fraud regarding a dangerous drug couldn't get forthright answers. For an agency devoted to protecting the public from bogus medical science, the FDA seems to be spending an awful lot of effort protecting the perpetrators of bogus science from the public.

Much of my research has to do with follies, foibles, and fraud in science, and I knew that the FDA wasn’t exactly bending over backward to correct the scientific record when its inspectors found problems during clinical trials. So as part of my investigative reporting class at New York University, my students and I set out to find out just how bad the problem was—and how much important information the FDA was keeping under wraps.

The silence is unbroken even when the FDA itself seems shocked at the degree of fraud and misconduct.

We didn’t have to search very hard to find FDA burying evidence of research misconduct. Just look at any document related to an FDA inspection. As part of the new drug application process, or, more rarely, when the agency gets a tipoff of wrongdoing, the FDA sends a bunch of inspectors out to clinical sites to make sure that everything is done by the book. When there are problems, the FDA generates a lot of paperwork—what are called form 483s, Establishment Inspection Reports, and in the worst cases, what are known as Warning Letters. If you manage to get your hands on these documents, you’ll see that, most of the time, key portions are redacted: information that describes what drug the researcher was studying, the name of the study, and precisely how the misconduct affected the quality of the data are all blacked out. These redactions make it all but impossible to figure out which study is tainted. My students and I looked at FDA documents relating to roughly 600 clinical trials in which one of the researchers running the trial failed an FDA inspection. In only roughly 100 cases were we able to figure out which study, which drug, and which pharmaceutical company were involved. (We cracked a bunch of the redactions by cross-referencing the documents with clinical trials data, checking various other databases, and using carefully crafted Google searches.) For the other 500, the FDA was successfully able to shield the drugmaker (and the study sponsor) from public exposure.

Get Slate in your inbox.

It’s not just the public that’s in the dark. It’s researchers, too. And your doctor. As I describe in the current issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, my students and I were able to track down some 78 scientific publications resulting from a tainted study—a clinical trial in which FDA inspectors found significant problems with the conduct of the trial, up to and including fraud. In only three cases did we find any hint in the peer-reviewed literature of problems found by the FDA inspection. The other publications were not retracted, corrected, or highlighted in any way. In other words, the FDA knows about dozens of scientific papers floating about whose data are questionable—and has said nothing, leaving physicians and medical researchers completely unaware. The silence is unbroken even when the FDA itself seems shocked at the degree of fraud and misconduct in a clinical trial.

Such was the case with the so-called RECORD 4 study. RECORD 4 was one of four large clinical trials that involved thousands of patients who were recruited at scores of clinical sites in more than a dozen countries around the world. The trial was used as evidence that a new anti-blood-clotting agent, rivaroxaban, was safe and effective. The FDA inspected or had access to external audits of 16 of the RECORD 4 sites. The trial was a fiasco. At Dr. Craig Loucks’ site in Colorado, the FDA found falsified data. At Dr. Ricardo Esquivel’s site in Mexico, there was “systematic discarding of medical records” that made it impossible to tell whether the study drug was given to the patients. At half of the sites that drew FDA scrutiny—eight out of 16—there was misconduct, fraud, fishy behavior, or other practices so objectionable that the data had to be thrown out. The problems were so bad and so widespread that, contrary to its usual practice, the FDA declared the entire study to be “unreliable.” Yet if you look in the medical journals, the results from RECORD 4 sit quietly in The Lancet without any hint in the literature about falsification, misconduct, or chaos behind the scenes. This means that physicians around the world are basing life-and-death medical decisions on a study that the FDA knows is simply not credible.

It’s not just one study, either. The FDA found major problems with sites involved in the other three clinical trials that were used to demonstrate rivaroxaban’s safety and effectiveness. RECORD 2, for example, was nearly as awful as RECORD 4: Four out of 10 sites that the FDA inspected showed evidence of misconduct, or other issues grave enough to render the site’s data worthless—including clear evidence of data falsification at one site. In aggregate, these problems raise serious doubts about the quality of all four key rivaroxaban studies—and, by extension, doubts about how seriously we should take the claim that rivaroxaban is safe and effective. The FDA is keeping mum, even as wrongful-death lawsuits begin to multiply.

The FDA’s failure to notify the public is not merely a sin of omission. In March 2009, the FDA convened a committee of outside scientific experts to mull the “robustness and meaningfulness” of the results from the four rivaroxaban trials, RECORDs 1, 2, 3, and 4. (The agency regularly calls in advisers to get advice, or, more cynically, to get cover, about a decision the agency has to make.) When the agency briefed the committee, it was (to put it mildly) coy about the problems it was finding. It said only that inspectors had found “significant issues” at two clinical sites involved in the RECORD 4 study—and that data from one of them was included in the analysis. Inspections were still ongoing, so it’s not easy to say precisely what the agency knew at that point, but it’s clear that the FDA wasn’t admitting to everything it knew. A bunch of inspections had been completed a month prior to the meeting, and we know for certain that the agency was fully aware of major issues beyond the two it revealed to the advisory committee. In a memo dated three days before the advisory committee meeting convened, the FDA detailed “falsification of data by a subinvestigator” at a RECORD 2 site. The advisory committee was not told.

By itself, this might seem like a miscommunication or an oversight, but the FDA has a history of not notifying the public about the misconduct it finds. About a decade ago, the agency got into trouble over a newly approved antibiotic, Ketek. Inspectors had found extensive problems (including fraud) affecting key clinical trials of the drug. Yet the agency did its best to hide the problems from even its most trusted advisers. As David Ross, the FDA official in charge of reviewing Ketek’s safety, put it, “In January 2003, over reviewers’ protests, FDA managers hid the evidence of fraud and misconduct from the advisory committee, which was fooled into voting for approval.” However, when the reports of misconduct at one clinical site began appearing in the press—along with stories of liver damage and blurred vision associated with the new drug—Congress stepped in, demanding information from the agency about the fraud.

But even the Senate couldn’t wring key information about the misconduct out of the FDA. “Every excuse under the sun has been used to create roadblocks,” complained an indignant Sen. Charles Grassley, “even in the face of congressional subpoenas requesting information and access to FDA employees.” The head of the FDA, Andrew von Eschenbach, attempted to explain to Congress why the agency didn’t tell its advisory committee about the problems in the Ketek study: “After considering the fact that the investigation results were preliminary ... FDA decided to hold the Advisory Committee meeting as planned ...” without notifying the committee of the potential problems. But Rep. Bart Stupak quickly pointed to an email, which, he argued, contradicted von Eschenbach's testimony. “So either you are not being forthright with us, when I believe you are, but whoever is doing your work is trying to lead this committee down the wrong path.” And the correct path showed that site after site involved in study 3014, as well as other key Ketek studies, were tainted as well.

In the decade since the Ketek affair, it’s hard to see any change in behavior by the agency. On occasion, the FDA has even actively approved and promoted statements about drugs that, according to its own inspectors, are based upon falsehoods. At the end of 2011, the FDA learned that an audit of a Chinese site involved in a key clinical trial of a different anti-clotting agent, apixaban, had turned up evidence of fraud: Personnel had apparently been fiddling with patient records. Worse yet, the fraud appeared to invalidate one key finding of the study. Just three months earlier, the researchers running the trial proudly announced in the New England Journal of Medicine that there was a “significant reduction in mortality” among patients who took apixaban compared with those who took the old standby, warfarin. Alas, the moment you exclude the data from the Chinese fraud site, as per standard FDA procedure, that statement went out the window. Yet look at the label for apixaban—the one approved by the FDA after the fraud was discovered—and you read that “treatment resulted in a significantly lower rate of all-cause death ... than did treatment with warfarin,” backed up by the data set with the Chinese site included. In other words, the label is carrying a claim that the FDA knows is based upon fraud. In a written response to my questions on this subject, the FDA stated that, “The FDA extended the drug’s review period to address the concerns. However, the review team did conclude concluded [sic] that the data at that site and other sites in China did reflect meaningful clinical information; that was not what was considered unreliable.”

Again, this isn’t an isolated incident. I had previously encountered bogus data on FDA-approved labels when a colleague and I were looking into a massive case of scientific misconduct —a research firm named Cetero had been caught faking data from more than 1,400 drug trials. That suddenly worthless data had been used to establish the safety or effectiveness of roughly 100 drugs, mostly generics, that were being sold in the United States. But even after the agency exposed the problem, we found fraud-tainted data on FDA-approved drug labels. (The FDA still maintains its silence about the Cetero affair. To this day, the agency refuses to release the names of the 100-odd drugs whose approval data were undermined by fraud.)

And the FDA covers up drug-related misconduct in other, more subtle ways, too. For example, the agency publishes the canonical listing of generic drugs in the United States, known as the “Orange Book.” Prescription drugs in this book are often given what’s called a “therapeutic equivalence code.” This code is a two-letter designation that signals the quality of the scientific evidence that a generic is “bioequivalent” to the name-brand drug. The code “AB,” for example, tells pharmacists and physicians that there are solid scientific studies proving that bioequivalence. Another code, “BX,” signals that there isn’t sufficient data to prove the generic is bioequivalent to the name brand.

When the Cetero misconduct was uncovered, key bioequivalence studies for scores of generic drugs turned out to be worthless. By rights, some of those drugs should have had their designation downgraded from AB to BX. But even though the FDA updates the Orange Book monthly, there was no rash of drugs losing their AB rating in the months after the Cetero affair broke. In the year and a half after the Cetero fraud was first announced, I was able to identify a grand total of four generic drugs (in various dosages) that were downgraded to BX, none of which appeared to be linked to the Cetero problem. On the other hand, the one prescription generic drug that I knew for sure had been hit hard by the Cetero fraud—both key studies supporting its bioequivalence to the name brand were declared worthless—had no change in its designation. The FDA apparently allowed the drug to keep its AB badge for months without any valid data backing the drug’s bioequivalence. When asked, point blank, whether the agency had downgraded the bioequivalence code of any products due to the Cetero affair, officials promptly dodged the question. A written statement issued by the agency’s press office in response to my queries noted that the FDA requested additional data from the companies whose drugs were implicated in the Cetero affair and that “If the data were not provided within 6 months or the data provided did not support a finding of bioequivalence, FDA said it would consider changing the generic product’s therapeutic equivalence rating in the Orange Book from AB to BX.” Not a word about a single bioequivalence rating actually being changed.

Why does the FDA stay silent about fraud and misconduct in scientific studies of medicine?

This, too, is a pattern of behavior rather than a one-off. In the past few weeks, another major Cetero-type case began to emerge—this time, having to do with GVK Biosciences, a firm in Hyderabad, India. The European Medicines Agency, the European equivalent of the FDA, examined more than 1,000 drugs in various dosages affected by GVK’s “data manipulations” and has suggested pulling 700 off the market. You can find the full list on the EMA website; to their credit, the Europeans are being relatively transparent as the crisis develops. Not so much on this side of the pond, alas. So far from the FDA, we’ve heard precious little, even though there are drugs on the U.S. market that rely entirely on GVK’s tests. In a written statement, the FDA admitted that there were some 40-odd drugs whose approval depended upon GVK-run studies. Which ones? The agency is keeping mum, as it did with Cetero and with other similar cases. However, the agency assures us that it inspected GVK's facility and found nothing to be concerned about; if the situation changes, “FDA will take swift and appropriate action to ensure that the drug products available to American consumers are safe and effective.”

Why does the FDA stay silent about fraud and misconduct in scientific studies of pharmaceuticals? Why would the agency allow claims that have been undermined by fraud to appear on drug labels? And why on earth would it throw up roadblocks to prevent the public, the medical community, its advisory panels, and even Congress from finding out about the extent of medical misconduct? The answers the FDA gives are fascinating—they show how an agency full of well-meaning people can do intellectual backflips to try to justify secrecy.

The most common excuse the agency gives is that exposing the details about scientific wrongdoing—naming the trials that were undermined by research misconduct, or revealing which drugs’ approvals relied upon tainted data—would compromise “confidential commercial information” that would hurt drug companies if revealed. This claim falls apart under scrutiny. The courts have ruled that when information is provided by companies involuntarily, such as the information that an FDA inspector finds, “commercial confidential information” refers to proprietary material that causes substantial, specific harm when it falls into the hands of a competitor. It doesn’t cover embarrassing peccadilloes—or misconduct that might cause bad publicity when word gets out.

Another excuse I’ve heard from the FDA is that it doesn’t want to confuse the public by telling us about problems, especially when, in the FDA’s judgment, the misconduct doesn’t pose an immediate risk to public health. For example, when my colleague and I asked the director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research why the agency wouldn’t name the drugs affected by the Cetero fraud, she told us that the matter “did not rise to the level where the public should be notified. We felt it would result in misunderstanding and inappropriate actions.” But even the most paternalistic philosophy of public health can’t explain why the FDA would allow drug companies to put data on its labels that the agency knows are worthless, or to fail to flag bioequivalence problems in a publication that is specifically designed for the purpose of flagging those very problems.

The sworn purpose of the FDA is to protect the public health, to assure us that all the drugs on the market are proven safe and effective by reputable scientific trials. Yet, over and over again, the agency has proven itself willing to keep scientists, doctors, and the public in the dark about incidents when those scientific trials turn out to be less than reputable. It does so not only by passive silence, but by active deception. And despite being called out numerous times over the years for its bad behavior, including from some very pissed-off members of Congress, the agency is stubbornly resistant to change. It’s a sign that the FDA is deeply captured, drawn firmly into the orbit of the pharmaceutical industry that it’s supposed to regulate. We can no longer hope that the situation will get better without firm action from the legislature.Q. Baby talk?: About three months ago, I met a fabulous fella. He’s handsome, smart, funny, and I have a good feeling where things are going. His only flaw: He uses baby talk on occasion, usually when he’s feeling snuggly. It’s dangerously close to being a deal-breaker, but I like him so well that I am trying really hard to ignore it and chalk it up to being an imperfect person myself. Is there any way to broach this issue without sounding like I am trying to change who he is or hurt his feelings? I don't feel like there’s a nice way to say “I would rather eat glass than hear you say something in baby talk?” Any advice-y wicey?

A: The job of a host is to make a guest feel comfortable, within reason. The job of a host is not to expose a guest to certain aspects of “the real world” that he deems necessary. It is not necessary for you to dress differently for your guest’s sake, as her dress code is her own. If you can go to the supermarket or out to a restaurant without violating everyday social convention, then whatever you normally wear will be fine. If you decide to curb your swearing for a week to make your guest feel more at ease, that would be a kind and thoughtful thing to do. Think of it this way: If you eat meat and had a vegetarian guest over for dinner, you wouldn’t necessarily eat vegetarian food all day yourself, but you’d still want to provide them with something they could eat and a comfortable environment where they don’t feel scrutinized or unwelcome. You don’t have to make a big production out of self-correction if the occasional “damn hell ass kings” slips out, and you don’t have to monitor your husband’s speech either. Both of you should think of it as a courtesy, rather than an obligation. While you’re under no imperative to adopt her manners of speech or dress as your own, you shouldn’t go out of your way to demonstrate how different her lifestyle is from yours, either.A Note to Our Commenters Here’s your chance to ask us about the state of commenting on Slate.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding a high-profile hearing Wednesday about the Flint water crisis. Below, your guide to what the hell is going on.

What is wrong with the water in Flint, Michigan?

Advertisement



There’s too much lead in it, and exposure to lead can cause irreversible neurological damage to infants and children.

How did the lead get in the water?

The city began using the Flint River as a water source in April 2014. Flint had previously used water from Lake Huron that was treated in Detroit. The water from the Flint River was much more corrosive than the water that had been piped in from Detroit, and it caused lead found in plumbing materials to leach into tap water.

Why did the city switch to the Flint River in the first place?

Advertisement



To save money. Officials wanted to connect Flint to a new Lake Huron pipeline, which would save the city $4 million dollars a year. But it was going to take two years for that pipeline to be ready, so the Flint River was chosen as Flint’s water source in the meantime—and water from the river was processed at Flint’s treatment plant, which had previously only been used as an emergency backup.

Why was the Flint River so corrosive?

Because of its high chloride content. Per UC–Berkeley water expert Tim Pine, rivers can be high in chloride because of salt that drains into them from sources “both natural (leaching from soils) and man-made (road de-icing, airports, feedlots, and farming).”

Do other cities’ drinking water sources have that problem?

Advertisement



Yes—but other cities, like Detroit, that are concerned about possible corrosion treat their water with a substance called orthophosphate. Flint did not do this. (It’s possible, though, that the Flint River’s chloride levels are so high that even orthophosphate wouldn’t have helped.)

How widespread is the lead contamination?

Not all plumbing materials are made of lead, so levels can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood and home to home, and the complete results of a large-scale federal survey of thousands of Flint homes haven’t been released yet. But a team from Virginia Tech, assisted by residents themselves, did sample 252 homes in a study released in September 2015. The results of that study take some explaining, but it’s the most complete look available at the scope of the problem:

The Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule says lead levels are unacceptable if the 90 th percentile value of a set of lead measurements in homes that are at high risk of contamination is 15 parts per billion or higher. (Homes are at high risk if they contain or are served by plumbing materials in which lead is used.) The Virginia Tech team found a 90 th percentile value of 25 ppb in the samples it collected and found an average level of contamination of 10.6 ppb. Sixteen percent of the homes tested were above 15 ppb.

percentile value of a set of lead measurements in homes that are at high risk of contamination is 15 parts per billion or higher. (Homes are at high risk if they contain or are served by plumbing materials in which lead is used.) The Virginia Tech team found a 90 percentile value of 25 ppb in the samples it collected and found an average level of contamination of 10.6 ppb. Sixteen percent of the homes tested were above 15 ppb. A 2014 medical study cited by the Virginia Tech team found that 25 percent of infants drinking formula made from 10 ppb tap water would develop lead-in-blood levels considered “elevated” by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Virginia Tech tests were distributed to residents by a local activist group; neither the group nor the Virginia Tech team had access to data that would have helped it target high-risk homes.

In other words, an untargeted study found lead levels well over what the Environmental Protection Agency would consider dangerous in targeted high-risk areas—and found an average contamination level that, according to another study, would cause what the CDC defines as “elevated” lead levels in 1 out of 4 infants.

An official from the United States Public Health Services, meanwhile, recently told the New York Times that it had measured lead levels of 150 ppb or higher in 26 Flint water samples, which is a level at which even the water filters that have been distributed to residents can’t make the water safe to drink. Tap water in the home of a Flint woman named LeeAnne Walters has measured as high as 13,200 ppb.

How many children are going to be sick because of this?

The CDC defines an elevated blood lead level as 5 micrograms of lead in a deciliter of blood. A study released in September 2015 by Flint’s Hurley Medical Center found that the number of children 5 years and younger meeting that threshold had doubled since the city’s switch to the Flint River as a source of drinking water, and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said recently that a total of 200 cases of elevated levels have been documented since last fall.

But without data on each Flint home’s lead levels, it’s hard to say how many kids might have been ultimately exposed, and individuals’ blood lead levels recede quickly, so you can’t just go and measure every child in Flint at this point and know who might have been affected going back to April 2014.

What does lead do to kids?

Lead exposure in young children is associated with neurological damage like reductions in IQ and attention-deficit problems even at levels less than 5 micrograms per deciliter. There is no level of lead exposure greater than zero that is considered conclusively safe by public health authorities.

Does lead poisoning cause problems for adults?

Adults are not as vulnerable as young children to lead-related brain and nervous-system damage, but blood-lead levels of 40 micrograms per deciliter in adults have been associated with “neurotoxic effects” and cardiovascular problems. The EPA also considers lead a “probable human carcinogen.”

Was there anything else in the water besides lead?

Is Flint still using the Flint River?

No. The city switched back to water from Lake Huron (supplied once again via Detroit) in October 2015. But the corrosion was substantial enough that there are still dangerous amounts of lead in some of Flint’s tap water. It’s not clear how long it will take until the water is clean.

Who is responsible for all of this?

On the federal level, an EPA employee named Miguel Del Toral wrote an internal memo in June 2015 outlining concerns about Flint’s water. His memo, which became public when Flint resident LeeAnne Walters gave a copy of it to an investigative reporter at the Michigan American Civil Liberties Union, turns out to have been completely prescient. But at the time, the EPA publicly nay-sayed it as a set of “initial results” that others would have to “verify and assess,” and did not require Flint to take any action to improve water treatment.

Michigan officials also made a variety of public statements about the crisis that now seem dangerously unjustified. In July 2015, MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel (who has since resigned) said that “anyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax.” In September 2015 Wurfel called Miguel Del Toral a “rogue employee.” And in that same month Rick Snyder’s spokeswoman—Sara Wurfel, who is married to Brad Wurfel!—said that the Hurley Medical Center study of lead exposure was “spliced and diced” to exaggerate Flint’s problems. (She has since left the Snyder administration for the private sector.)

Basically almost everyone at a city, state, and federal level who had responsibility for Flint’s water quality—whether that responsibility was assigned to them by law or just by their job description—failed.

So Flint just went ahead and switched to using water from a river in an area of the country infamous for industrial pollution without doing anything to check to make sure it wasn’t poisoned?

Yes, that seems to be what happened. When Flint piped its water in from Detroit, the Flint treatment plant was only used for backup purposes and was only operated four times a year. It’s not clear whether Flint water department employees even considered the possibility of major corrosion and lead leaching before the switch was made.

Why do we use lead in plumbing equipment if it’s poison, by the way?

Per Upmanu Lall, the director of the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University, “lead is exceptionally malleable, resists small leaks and can be shaped easily, so it was commonly used for plumbing for a long time.” It wasn’t until 1986 that research into lead’s health effects led to a ban on its use in new plumbing materials, and it’s still present in many houses and in water-system infrastructure built before that time.

So who finally figured out what was going on? Just Del Toral and Virginia Tech?

If there’s a single hero in Flint, it’s LeeAnne Walters, the resident whose tap water has been found to contain stratospheric levels of lead. Walters personally contacted Del Toral and through his suggestion got in touch with Marc Edwards, who led the team from Virginia Tech. The objective data in the reports by Del Toral, Edwards, and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha of the Hurley Medical Center seems to have created the tipping point that convinced public officials to act and turned Flint into a major national story.* National publications like Slate then piggybacked on the excellent reporting done by outlets like MLive, Michigan Radio, and the Michigan ACLU, which had been covering the story since the Flint River switch was made.

But ultimately it’s Flint residents like Walters—the people who began showing up to community meetings to complain about the water almost as soon as the switch happened and who helped the Virginia Tech team by supplying samples of their own water—who got everyone else to finally pay attention and do something.

Has anything similar to this ever happened anywhere else in the U.S.?

Marc Edwards was actually involved in exposing a similar crisis in Washington, D.C., where tests began discovering widespread lead leaching—which was then downplayed by public authorities who only admitted the extent of the problem under heavy pressure from activists and experts—about 15 years ago.

Have any of the responsible parties named above lost their dang jobs?

The head of the MDEQ and the aforementioned MDEQ spokesman have resigned, as has the regional EPA administrator who was responsible for Michigan. Before the crisis became a major story, the emergency manager who implemented the Flint River switch, Darnell Earley, had left Flint and was appointed by Snyder to a similar job with the Detroit school system. His tenure there was also controversial, and it was announced on Tuesday that he is stepping down from that position as well.

Why did Flint have an “emergency manager” in the first place?

Because of a controversial Michigan law that allows the governor to supersede local elected officials by appointing someone to take complete control of cities in financial crisis. The cities that have been affected by the law have had disproportionately black populations—57 percent of Flint’s residents are black, for example—and some argue that it’s essentially a tool of disenfranchisement.

Speaking of the governor, what’s going to happen to him?

Whether there will be personal fallout for Rick Snyder is an open question. Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette announced an “independent” inquiry into the Flint crisis and Wednesday’s congressional hearings might lead to further investigation. But the Michigan inquiry is being led by a prosecutor who personally donated thousands of dollars to Schuette’s and Snyder’s campaigns , while the congressional hearing is controlled by Republicans who denied a Michigan representative’s request to call Snyder, also a Republican, to testify. For what it’s worth, the Detroit Free Press reports that Snyder has an approval rating of only 39 percent but that only 29 percent of Michigan residents believe he should resign.

The federal Justice Department has also said it’s investigating the Flint crisis, which could lead to criminal charges or a civil suit being filed, but there’s been no suggestion that Snyder would be targeted by such actions.

Is it possible Snyder covered up evidence that the water was bad?

The state government was certainly not proactive about investigating residents’ complaints about water problems, and the MDEQ and MDHHS seem to have ignored statistical indications of danger in summer 2015. But there’s no evidence that Snyder was personally involved in those failings.

Is anyone getting sued?

A number of class-action lawsuits have already been filed against city and state organizations and officials on behalf of Flint residents. It could be difficult for plaintiffs in these lawsuits to win money because governments and officeholders are typically immune from paying damages. But it’s possible that the plaintiffs will overcome the immunity problems with creative legal arguments and/or seek damages in the form of material water-system repairs.

What else is being done to fix the mess?

For the last month-plus, the Michigan National Guard, state police, and many volunteers have been distributing water testing kits, water filters (which don’t work on the most tainted water), and bottled water (which has been donated en masse by charities and celebrities) to residents. (A state police official told ABC that the state has both the capacity and the need for further bottled water donations.) The state has allocated $28 million for medical assessments and nurses’ visits for potentially lead-exposed children. The Obama administration has specifically linked an allocation of $80 million for Michigan infrastructure projects to the Flint crisis. And congressional representatives are seeking further funding to repair or replace all of Flint’s lead plumbing—a project that they say will cost $800 million. (Recall that the city switched to Flint River water in the hopes of ultimately saving $4 million a year.)

Are there any crucial questions about the Flint crisis that haven’t yet been answered?

Yes, here are a few:

Whose idea was it to switch to Flint River water? We know that a Snyder-appointed emergency manager formally approved the move and that a Snyder-appointed manager implemented it. But who was responsible for advocating for the switch? And how far up the chain did the state’s botched Flint decisions go?

Why didn’t anyone in the Flint water department prepare for the possibility that the Flint River water would be corrosive and contaminated with pathogens?

Were the summer 2015 city/state tests that erroneously found that everything was fine flawed because of incompetence or because of a coordinated cover-up? And why didn’t the Michigan DHHS do anything when it found evidence of elevated blood levels in July 2015?

What about how all of this incompetence and negligence will ultimately impact the well-being of all 8,657 of Flint’s children under the age of 6?

That’s the biggest question of all—and one that Flint will be answering for decades.jacoblund/Thinkstock

Divorce is rarely a sunny event, but so-called medical divorce is a particularly heartbreaking phenomenon. When one member of a couple under age 65 is diagnosed with a debilitating long-term illness, it can be financially responsible—even necessary—for them to divorce in order to push the sick partner’s assets below the threshold to qualify for Medicaid. Otherwise, the family’s retirement accounts and other savings could be consumed by health care bills, even if their income was relatively low. “A thousand little things have been ripped away from us,” said one Tennessee man who had separated from his epileptic wife in 2014 so she could qualify for the state Medicaid program. What a neat health care system we have here in America!

Ruth Graham Ruth Graham is a regular Slate contributor. She lives in New Hampshire.



A paper published this week suggests that the Affordable Care Act has kept many of these imperiled marriages intact. The “asset tests” that incentivized divorce were removed under the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid. As long as the sick partner had an income below 138 percent of the poverty line, he or she could tap into Medicaid, and the healthy spouse could hold onto his or her retirement accounts. In the new paper, researchers compared the divorce rates between 2000 and 2015 in states that opted in to Medicaid expansion and those that didn’t. As it turned out, a state’s decision to expand Medicaid led to a 5.6 percent decline in the divorce rate among people age 50 to 64—the cohort most likely to fall prey to medical divorce. The paper, by two economists at the University of Kansas, was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The researchers don’t claim to have conclusive proof that Medicaid expansion affected the divorce rate. For one thing, no one knows how common medical divorce was in the first place, in part because people who do it often feel compelled to keep their reasons secret in order to avoid punishment. But they write that their findings “strongly [suggest] that medical divorce was reduced in the first year of the Affordable Care Act.”

As a matter of fact, the Obama presidency was pretty great for marriage overall, and not just because the president himself made up half of the country’s most appealing married couple. The American divorce rate as a whole fell to a 40-year low in 2015, according to data released late last year. Meanwhile, marriage rates, which had been declining for decades, stabilized in 2010 and ticked upward in 2015. Oh, and by the way, marriage equality expanded access to the institution to millions of Americans for the first time.

Once you start looking around for ways in which traditionally progressive public policy is good for old-fashioned values, it can be hard to stop. Here’s another intriguing data point: The abortion rate has generally been sloping downward since 1980, but there is a remarkably consistent pattern within that larger trend. The most dramatic plunges have all come under Democratic presidents. Under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, the rate toggled between 24 and 23 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age. Under Bill Clinton, it plummeted from 23 to 16.2. Under George W. Bush, beloved by anti-choice activists as a champion of their cause, the rate essentially held steady. During Obama’s tenure in the White House, it dropped again, from 15 to 12.5 in 2013, the last year for which the CDC has issued data.On Thursday, President Trump announced the selection of Florida International University College of Law Dean Alexander Acosta as his new pick for labor secretary following the withdrawal of Andrew Puzder. Acosta is a former federal judge, U.S. attorney, and member of the National Labor Relations Board and passed Senate confirmation for those roles.

Acosta was also assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division in the Bush administration. In a 2011 Senate judiciary committee hearing, he recounted work he had done in that role on anti-Muslim bigotry, including an instance in which he had authorized the Justice Department to intervene in a case about a Muslim student in Oklahoma who had been asked by a teacher to remove her hijab on the anniversary of 9/11. “[S]hortly after we intervened to protect Nashala’s liberties,” he said, “the nation of France enacted legislation forbidding religious symbols and clothing in schools. France banned headscarves, kippahs, crosses and any other religious clothing or jewelry. Our government, by contrast, protected religious expression.”An undocumented transgender woman claiming to be a victim of domestic violence was arrested by immigration agents at the El Paso County Courthouse last week.

According to County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal, the woman received a protective order for the domestic violence claim. Judge Joe Gonzalez granted that protective order. The woman filed three police reports in total, and the last incident involved a weapon, Bernal said. The first report was filed in October of 2016. Bernal said the violence escalated from that point.

“This is a woman who had suffered serious abuse,” said Bernal.

After the hearing, ICE agents followed the woman into the hallway, where she was arrested, Bernal said.

“We were stunned that ICE would go to these lengths for someone that is not a violent criminal,” said Bernal.

Bernal said this has not happened in the over 20 years that she has been serving in the El Paso County Courthouse.

“I cannot recall an instance where ICE agents have gone into the domestic violence court, specifically looking for a victim of domestic violence,” Bernal said.

Bernal said there were no state court warrants out for the woman and she is not a violent criminal. She said it appears the arrest happened after ICE received a tip that the woman would be in court that day. “I’m suspicious that the tip may have come from the abuser, who knew precisely where the victim would be at that time and date since he had received notice to be in that courtroom as well.”

That information however, has not been confirmed.

“We hope that this is an isolated incident that will never happen again, and we call on ICE officials to do everything they can make sure this never happens again in our community,” said Bernal.

Bernal fears that this arrest could make undocumented immigrants hesitant of coming forward. “I think an unfortunate consequence of some of the recent immigration actions that we’ve seen is that victims of all sorts of crimes will be scared to report. People whose children might even be victimized might even be afraid to report it for fear that the parent could deported."

Bernal wants the community to know the El Paso County attorney’s office is committed to protecting crime victims and victims of domestic abuse regardless of immigration status.

“In our community everyone is protected,” said Bernal.

Bernal told CBS4 her office plans on reaching out to the federal government after an internal investigation is finished. She said she wants to establish a good relationship with local ICE officials and get assurance that this type of arrest will not happen again.

The county attorney's office said the woman who was arrested does not have a violent criminal past, but that she did come into the country multiple times.

CBS4 obtained documents filed in federal court which state Homeland Security Investigators (HSI) Border Enforcement Security Taskforce (BEST) agents received information that an individual who had been previously deported was in the United States. The information stated that the individual was residing at the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence. It also stated the individual had previously been arrested for possession of stolen mail and illegal re-entry into the United States and sentenced to 12 months and 1 day.

It also states his BEST agents conducted surveillance at the county courthouse in attempts to see the individual.

According to the affidavit filed by federal agents, the individual has been removed from the United States six times and voluntarily returned to Mexico one other time.

Her alleged criminal history includes convictions for false imprisonment in 2013; assault, probation violation, domestic violence in 2011 and false imprisonment-minor-parental in 2010.

The victim is currently being held at the El Paso County Jail under a federal ICE detainer.KROFT: You definitely have some impressive accomplishments.

OBAMA: Thank you, Steve.

KROFT: No, you do. And more than a lot of presidents who manage to get reelected. My question is, is it enough? Why do you think you deserve to be reelected?From music to movies, fashion and art, Black Americans have long played an important role in shaping popular culture in the U.S., and that influence remains strong. In fact, 73% of non-Hispanic whites and 67% of Hispanics believe that African-Americans influence mainstream culture. And this effect is clearly visible in the current TV season. According to a recent Nielsen analysis of TV viewership, several programs with a predominantly black cast or a main storyline focusing on a black character are drawing substantial non-black viewership.

While this isn’t the first time in history that a TV program with a black lead has drawn non-black audiences—think of “The Jeffersons,” “Sanford and Son” and “The Cosby Show”—what’s unusual now is the sheer number of such programs that are carrying cross-cultural appeal.

Looking at the 2016-2017 television season, severals shows stand out:

With 89% non-black viewership, “This Is Us,” NBC’s Golden Globe-nominated ensemble dramedy, includes Sterling K. Brown as a black businessman raised by white parents and tackles topics such as drug addiction, racism, homosexuality, alcoholism, adoption, obesity and cancer.

ABC’s hit sitcom “Black-ish” follows a father and husband (Anthony Anderson) who’s trying to create a sense of black cultural identity for his affluent family of four and has 79% non-black viewership. Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays his wife, won the best actress in a comedy series Golden Globe for her role.

Three-fourths of the viewers are non-black for “Secrets and Lies,” the ABC crime drama that revolves around the biracial heir (Michael Ealy) to a Charlotte, N.C., equity firm and the murder of his wife.

ABC’s “How to Get Away with Murder” is the Shonda Rhimes hit drama starring Academy Award winner Viola Davis as a criminal defense professor who gets entangled in a murder plot. Sixty-nine percent of the show’s viewership is non-black.

Sixty-eight percent* of viewership is non-black for ABC’s “Scandal,” another “Shondaland” thriller featuring Kerry Washington as a media consultant to the president.

With 63% non-black viewers, Fox’s “Pitch” is a dramedy about the first woman, a black woman, to play baseball in the Major Leagues.

“Insecure” is the HBO original comedy series co-created by Golden Globe-nominated Issa Rae. Inspired by Rae’s popular web series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,” viewership is 61% non-black.

Half of viewership for the newcomer “Atlanta” is non-black. The show, a Golden-Globe winning comedy-drama on FX created by and starring Donald Glover, centers on two black cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.

“Much of the American narrative lately has focused on a growing cultural divide. But Nielsen’s data on television programming show something different,” says Andrew McCaskill, senior vice president, Communications and Multicultural Marketing, at Nielsen. “Storylines with a strong black character or identity are crossing cultural boundaries to grab diverse audiences and start conversations. That insight is important for culture and content creators, as well as manufacturers and retailers looking to create engaging, high-impact advertising campaigns.”

Some of these programs wade into the real-world tensions of today. Episodes of “Black-ish” have included discussions on police brutality and political upsets, provoking debate on social media.

Though some shows with a strong black identity may not pull a majority non-black audience, many still have noteworthy non-black viewership. One of the most widely acclaimed programs of recent seasons, Fox’s “Empire,” which stars Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson as ex-spouses grappling over the future of a multimillion-dollar hiphop company, is one such example. “Empire” has commanded nearly 40% non-black viewers on average each week. Interestingly, both Fox’s STAR and Bravo’s Real Housewives of Atlanta pull comparable numbers.

It’s also noteworthy how a predominantly black audience—63% for Empire—can propel a show to Emmy-nominated, award-winning mainstream success. Henson took home a best actress Golden Globe last year for her portrayal of Cookie, and Cover Girl recently announced a makeup collection inspired by the hit show. These accolades offer further evidence of a cultural recalibration in which black voices increasingly are heard. That coincides with rising affluence and education levels, illuminated in the recently released report, “Young, Connected and Black: African-American Millennials Are Driving Social Change and Leading Digital Advancement.”

The report delves into the spending and viewing habits of African-Americans overall and quantifies their greater appetite for television content as one driver of the dramatic increase in diverse television programming. Between 2011 and 2015, broadcast network TV ad spend focused on black audiences (defined as ad dollars placed on programming with greater than 50% black viewers) also increased, by 255%.

METHODOLOGY

The insights from this article are derived from Nielsen NPOWER, Persons aged 2+, Broadcast and Cable, Live +7 Days, TV with Digital, TV with Video on Demand (VOD), Sept. 19, 2016-Jan. 1, 2017.Just weeks into Donald Trump’s presidency, you would think that everything had changed. The uproar over the president’s tweets grows louder by the day, as does concern over the erratic, haphazard and aggressive stance of the White House toward critics and those with different policy views. On Sunday, White House aide Stephen Miller bragged, “We have a president who has done more in three weeks than most presidents have done in an entire administration.”

But Miller was dead wrong about this. There is a wide gap, a chasm even, between what the administration has said and what it has done. There have been 45 executive orders or presidential memoranda signed, which may seem like a lot but lags President Barack Obama’s pace. More crucially, with the notable exception of the travel ban, almost none of these orders have mandated much action or clear change of current regulations. So far, Trump has behaved exactly like he has throughout his previous career: He has generated intense attention and sold himself as a man of action while doing little other than promote an image of himself as someone who gets things done.

Story Continued Below

It is the illusion of a presidency, not the real thing.

The key problem here is understanding Trump’s executive orders and presidential memoranda. Trump very quickly seized on the signing of these as media opportunities, and each new order and memo has been staged and announced as dramatic steps to alter the course of the country. Not accustomed to presidents whose words mean little when it comes to actual policy, opponents have seized on these as proof that Trump represents a malign force, while supporters have pointed to these as proof that Trump is actually fulfilling his campaign promises.

Neither is correct. The official documents have all the patina of “big deals” but when parsed and examined turn out to be far, far less than they appear. Take the order authorizing the construction of a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The relevant section of the January 25 order read: “It is the policy of the executive branch to … secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.” That sounds indeed like an order to fulfill a controversial campaign promise. The problem? Congress initially passed a Secure Fence Act in 2006 that required the construction of nearly 700 miles of fortified border. By 2011, under the Obama administration, most of that was completed, with a mix of pedestrian fencing and vehicle fortifications. Since then, there has only been minimal funding for further fortifications.

The result is that Trump issued an executive order mandating something that has in many respects already been done—with no congressional funding yet to redo the current fortified border with a larger, more expensive structure. The president does not have the budgetary discretion to build such a wall, and it remains to be seen whether Congress will authorize what promises to be a controversial and redundant project. This executive order, therefore, changes nothing, and only mandates something that has already been mandated, already been constructed and that the president lacks the spending authority to upgrade.

Then take things like the Keystone pipeline permits, the promise to deregulate and the most recently signed orders about crime. The January 24 order on infrastructure begins with a sentiment almost anyone could agree with: “Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American families and consumers. Too often, infrastructure projects in the United States have been routinely and excessively delayed by agency processes and procedures.” It then declares that the policy of the Executive Branch is to expedite the permitting of such projects. That was followed by two memoranda on the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines that had been denied permits during Obama’s tenure, which urges the companies to re-submit their permit applications for review.

That might seem like an order to have the pipelines built. But Keystone remains almost entirely an idea, and oil shipments and infrastructure from Canada have long since been routed elsewhere given the years and years of delay in ever authorizing it. The Dakota Access Pipeline is largely complete, with a major dispute over its passage through tribal lands, and here too, it is unlikely that a presidential memorandum has any legal bearing on how that issue is resolved given that it lies within the purview of the Army Corps of Engineers and cannot simply be countermanded by the White House.

Or take the orders of deregulation. Those were widely hailed as a rollback of Dodd-Frank, especially given that the morning that the order was issued, February 3, Trump met with bank CEOs and expressed his dislike for many of the legislation’s provisions. The actual order, however, delivers much less than it promises, merely directing the secretary of the Treasury to review existing regulations and report back on which ones might be refined to achieve better outcomes.

Or the crime orders signed on February 9, which were widely hailed as cracking down on “transnational criminal organizations” and “preventing violence against … law enforcement officers.” Nothing in the text of these orders is either objectionable or in any respect a departure from current law and policy. One order states plainly that it shall be the policy of the administration to “enforce all Federal laws in order to enhance the protection and safety of Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers, and thereby all Americans.” The other says that the administration will seek to use existing laws to crack down on trafficking. You would have known none of that from the headlines both supporting and denouncing the efforts. Breitbart claimed “Trump Signs Three Executive Orders to Restore Safety in America” while many took these orders as a sign that police will have new, expanded powers and protections. In truth, the orders changed the status quo not one whit.

On it goes: The recent crackdown on undocumented immigrants that followed Trump’s January 25 order on enforcement priorities may depart from Barack Obama’s post-2102 policies to de-emphasize deportation of undocumented immigrants who do not have criminal records, but it appears fully consistent with deportation actions during both Obama’s first term and during significant portions of George W. Bush’s administration. The orders on health care, on defeating ISIS, on rebuilding the armed forces—all were essentially statements of intent with no legal force and requiring no action except a mandate to relevant departments and agencies to study issues and report back.

The travel ban, of course, is different. It was an actual policy order that dramatically changed immigration and visa policies for seven Muslim-majority countries. It was swiftly rejected by the courts, however, which meant that the signature policy of the Trump administration is now not a policy at all—at least, unless and until the White House finds a different approach.

Yes, what the president says matters. Trump’s casual relationship with the truth and his carefree use of tweets set the public agenda and help determine how foreign countries relate to our government. Intent also matters, and clearly, the Trump administration is determined to do a variety of things—from border security to health care to trade to immigration—that many, many Americans find objectionable, wrong and against the best interests of the country.

And yet, words are not the same as actions. Trump can issue as many documents called executive orders and presidential memoranda as he wants. As the fate of the travel ban shows, however, that doesn’t mean that even the more meaningful ones are actionable, and the preponderance of the orders to date would in any other administration have been news releases stating broad policy goals that may or may not ever become actual policy.

But too many of us take these words as action. That confirms both the worst fears of what the Trump administration is and the greatest hopes of what Trump wants it to be: a White House that shoots first and asks question later, a White House of action and change that shakes the status quo to the core and charts a new path for America and Americans. To date, this White House has broken every convention and rule of tone and attitude, toward Washington and toward the truth. But in reality, it has done far less than most people think.

In the time ahead, as Congress turns to actual legislation and the White House presumably does normal things like propose a budget and specify its legislative ideas, there will be real actions for us to probe and debate. Distinguishing between words and action is essential: When senators say silly things about legislation, we know to separate those public statements from votes takes and laws passed. When leaders of other countries speak aggressively, we do not immediately act as if war is imminent; if that were the case, we’d have invaded Iran and North Korea years ago. Words should be taken as possible indicators of future action, but not as absolutes and not always.

Trump poses a challenge to decades of tradition and precedent. He is masterful as conflating words and actions in a way that enrages and alarms his opponents and exhilarates and excites his supporters. It’s more important than ever to distinguish what is from what isn’t. Understanding the difference between what this president says and what he does is one of the only things that will keep our public debate from plunging ever deeper into the hall of mirrors.

He is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine.NSO Group and the dozens of other commercial spyware outfits that have cropped up around the globe over the past decade operate in a largely unregulated market. Spyware makers like NSO Group, Hacking Team in Italy and Gamma Group in Britain insist they sell tools only to governments for criminal and terrorism investigations.

But it is left to government agents to decide whom they will and will not hack with spying tools that can trace a target’s every phone call, text message, email, keystroke, location, sound and sight.

The discovery of NSO’s spyware on the phones of Mexican nutrition policy makers, activists and even government employees, like Dr. Barquera, raises new questions about whether NSO’s tools are being used to advance the soda industry’s commercial interests in Mexico.

The soda industry has poured over $67 million into defeating state and local efforts to regulate soft drink sales in the United States since 2009, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. But the tax in Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — posed an exceptional threat. After the tax passed in 2014, Coca-Cola pledged $8.2 billion worth of investments in Mexico through 2020. And soda giants have lobbied against the tax through various industry groups, like ConMéxico, which represents Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.

Lorena Cerdán, director of ConMéxico, said the group had no knowledge of, or part in, the mobile hacking. “This is the first we’re hearing of it,” Ms. Cerdán said. “And frankly, it scares us, too.”

The timing of the hacking coincided with a planned effort by advocacy organizations and health researchers — including Dr. Barquera, Mr. Calvillo and Mr. Encarnación — to coordinate a mass media campaign to build support for doubling the soda tax, an effort that stalled in Mexico’s Congress in November. The three men also opposed a failed effort by Mexican legislators and soda lobbyists in 2015 to cut the tax in half.

One week after health researchers and advocates announced their campaign in a news conference last summer, their phones began to buzz with the spyware-laced messages.

“This is proof that surveillance in Mexico is out of control,” said Luis Fernando García, the director of the Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales, a Mexican digital rights nonprofit better known by the acronym R3D. “When we have proof that this surveillance is being used against nutritional activists, it’s clear Mexico should not be given these technologies.”

NSO Group’s motto is “Make the World a Safer Place.” But its spyware is increasingly turning up on the phones of journalists, dissidents and human rights activists.

NSO spyware was discovered on the phone of a human-rights activist in the United Arab Emirates and a prominent Mexican journalist in August. Researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs discovered NSO had exploited flaws in Apple software — since patched — to infiltrate the phones of the Emirati activist and the Mexican journalist, Rafael Cabrera.

In 2015, Mr. Cabrera reported that a luxury home that had been custom-built for President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and his wife was owned by the subsidiary of a Chinese company that had been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts. Mr. Cabrera’s report forced the presidential couple to forgo its stake in the home and the government to rescind contracts.

The discovery of spyware on Mr. Cabrera’s phone prompted digital rights activists to warn more journalists and activists in Mexico to look out for similarly suspicious text messages. In the process, they uncovered a new class of targets: nutrition policy makers and activists, some of whom were government employees.

Each had been targeted by NSO’s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, that could extract their text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and location. It turned their phones into recording devices and secretly captured live footage off their cameras. Its full range of capabilities was detailed in an NSO Group marketing proposal leaked to The Times last year.

In interviews and statements, NSO Group — whose headquarters are in Herzliya, Israel, but which sold a controlling stake in 2014 to Francisco Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm — claims to sell its spyware only to law enforcement agencies to track terrorists, criminals and drug lords. NSO executives point to technical safeguards that prevent clients from sharing its spy tools.

An NSO spokesman reiterated those restrictions in a statement on Thursday, and said the company had no knowledge of the tracking of health researchers and advocates inside Mexico.

It is not clear why any Mexican government agency would deploy the spyware to track those on the front lines of the fight to battle obesity in Mexico — where diabetes was recently declared a national emergency — nor is it clear which Mexican government agency could be behind the surveillance.

“Mexico’s intelligence systems are subject to federal relevant legislation and have legal authorization,” Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said in a statement. “They are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.”

The NSO emails leaked to The Times referred to multimillion-dollar, continuing NSO Group contracts with several government agencies inside Mexico, and the Mexican government has been an enthusiastic buyer of foreign spy tools.

Mexico was listed as the biggest client of Hacking Team, the Italian cyber-surveillance firm, which was itself hacked in 2015. Hacked internal documents published online showed that at least 14 Mexican states and government agencies had paid $6.3 million to Hacking Team for its spy tools since 2010.

Mexico’s Interior Ministry, which operates Cisen, the civil national security intelligence service, was listed as Hacking Team’s highest-paying client. Other clients included the Mexican Navy, federal police and attorney general’s office, as well as several Mexican states.

The leaked Hacking Team emails also revealed that the firm was increasingly facing competition from NSO Group to procure contracts with Cisen, the Mexican attorney general’s office and Sedena, an acronym for the office of Mexico’s secretary of national defense.

The health researchers did not discover their phones had been targeted with NSO spyware until August. That month, SocialTIC, a Mexican digital security nonprofit, and R3D warned its contacts to look for suspicious messages. A subsequent forensics investigation by Citizen Lab of the messages sent to Mr. Calvillo, Dr. Barquera, Mr. Encarnación and others confirmed that they were laced with NSO Group spyware.

NSO Group executives say they have a strict vetting process to determine the countries with which they will do business, which includes an ethics committee comprising employees and an outside counsel that vets potential government clients based on human rights rankings set by the World Bank and other bodies. Executives said they had pulled contracts when they uncovered human rights violations.

But it is unclear how the Mexican spy efforts made it through the vetting process.

“This is one of the most brazen cases of abuse we have ever seen,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab. “It points to a total breakdown of government oversight in Mexico, and a complete failure of due diligence by the NSO Group.”

The legal case for the use of spyware in Mexico is uncertain. Only the federal and justice authorities can lawfully intercept private communications in Mexico, but require a court order to do so. However, Mr. García and others argue that spyware is more invasive than traditional forms of interception, and they say it is not clear what case the government would have to monitor the communications of health researchers and activists.

“I doubt these intrusions were approved by any judge,” Mr. García, of R3D, said.

In interviews, Dr. Barquera, Mr. Encarnación and Mr. Calvillo all said they were not sure which government agency could be behind the hacking. Each said he was wary of using his phone for sensitive communications. And yet they insist they are undeterred.

“Suddenly, you are aware of everything you say,” Dr. Barquera said. “Everything you say feels like a potential threat, that it could come back to haunt you.”Mr. Spicer said the president asked Mr. McGahn to then determine whether Mr. Flynn had violated the law. In the end, he said, there was “a violation of trust,” not “a violation of law.”

“It was an evolving and eroding process,” Mr. Spicer said when asked why Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, could say that Mr. Flynn had the president’s full trust on Monday afternoon.

McCain hits Trump’s ‘intentions toward’ Putin

Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was the first elected Republican to hit hard on the turmoil in Mr. Trump’s White House, and the continuing questions about Russian influence.

“General Flynn’s resignation is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus,” said Mr. McCain, who has emerged as one of the few Republican antagonists that Mr. Trump has not silenced.

“General Flynn’s resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration’s intentions toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies and attempted interference in American elections,” he continued.

Conway responds to ‘the hapless haters’

Trump tries his best to deflect attention from Flynn

A day after Facebook posts came to light showing deliberations over North Korea in the public dining hall of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump is up in arms about loose national security controls.

Illegal leaks are, of course, a growing concern for Mr. Trump, since they portray him as running a White House that from the outside at least appears to be spinning out of control. For Mr. Trump, however, the imperative is to focus attention on anything but Russia.

Republicans largely silent

As scandal swirled around Mr. Trump’s new White House, Republicans in Congress beyond Mr. McCain were almost silent on the resignation of Mr. Flynn and its implications.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin chose to focus on Mr. Flynn’s decision to mislead Mr. Pence on the contents of his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak.

“You cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,” he told reporters on Tuesday.

But Mr. Ryan deflected when asked about calls for congressional inquiries into the episode. “I’m not going to prejudge circumstances surrounding this,” he said. “I think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this.”

He again praised Mr. Trump, without identifying Mr. Flynn by name. “As soon as this person lost the president’s trust, the president asked for his resignation,” Mr. Ryan said, “and that was the right thing to do.”

In fact, the Justice Department informed the White House a month ago that Mr. Flynn had not been truthful about his conversations with the ambassador.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes of California, a Trump loyalist, released one of the few statements from the Republican side of the aisle, and it offered no criticism:

“Michael Flynn served in the U.S. military for more than three decades. Washington, D.C., can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn — who has always been a soldier, not a politician — deserves America’s gratitude and respect for dedicating so much of his life to strengthening our national security. I thank him for his many years of distinguished service.”

Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, was no more forthcoming. “Mike Flynn served his country with distinction,” he said in a statement. “The president needs a national security adviser whom he can trust, and I defer to him to decide who best fills that role.”

One exception, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, who threw his not-very-heavy weight behind a bipartisan commission.

Amid turmoil, military leaders grow worried

Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, told a military conference on Tuesday that the upheavals in Washington are rippling through the American military.

“Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil,” he said. “I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war.”

General Thomas insisted Special Operations forces are “staying focused” despite all the controversy in Washington.

Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible.”

And you can speak up, too

Have feedback for the White House on Mr. Flynn or really any other matter? No need to hold your tongue.

Almost two months after the Obama administration temporarily closed it, Mr. Trump’s staff resuscitated the White House comment line on Monday, and volunteers will now take comments for the president on a routine basis.

The line’s closing, during a time of drastic change in the government, spawned consternation among those already wary about the new administration and its commitment to public accountability. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the closing had been merely a matter of staffing the office that maintains the line.

Flynn listened to ‘leader calls’ as recently as Monday, Conway says

Although the White House was warned a month ago that Mr. Flynn had been untruthful about the nature of his contacts with Moscow, he was allowed into security briefings as recently as Monday, Ms. Conway said on the “Today” show on Tuesday.

The Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Mr. Flynn’s dissembling put him at risk of blackmail from Russian intelligence, but he was kept by the president’s side.

“That’s one characterization,” Ms. Conway said when confronted with those circumstances.

The Kremlin washes its hands of Flynn

Mr. Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States are not in question, nor is his trip to Moscow to celebrate the Russian propaganda network RT — sitting next to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin — but Moscow said on Tuesday that his resignation was a domestic matter unconnected to the Kremlin.Universal

Zhang Yimou’s The Great Wall is roughly two-thirds great movie, one-third terrible one. I call it “Zhang Yimou’s” less out of auteurist principle than because it has up to this point been associated almost entirely with its star, Matt Damon. From the moment it was announced that Damon would be playing the lead in a fantasy story centered on the Great Wall of China, the movie was accused, incorrectly as it turns out, of whitewashing, and, more plausibly, of being a white-savior movie in which Damon’s character teaches Chinese troops how to repel the monsters the wall was built to keep out. Amid Damon’s tone-deaf public response to the issue and the controversy around his treatment of black producer Effie Brown on Project Greenlight, the fact that The Great Wall was also a film by one of the greatest of China’s Fifth Generation directors was reduced to a virtual footnote.

Let’s deal with the one-third first. I can’t claim to be a Matt Damon completist, but this is at the very least one of the worst performances of his career. Buried under a comically shaggy beard and wig for the first part of the movie, his character becomes no more distinct once the scruff is shorn away. An, I guess, Irish fortune-seeker (the accent, whatever it’s meant to be, comes and goes) who’s come to medieval China in search of “black powder” (i.e. gunpowder), he and comrade Pedro Pascal stumble upon the Great Wall by accident—you might think it’d be hard to miss, but, at least in this universe, you’d be wrong—and discover its true purpose: protecting China from the hordes of monsters known as the Tao Tei.

The pre-release criticism of The Great Wall, most forcefully raised by Fresh Off the Boat actress Constance Wu, was that the insertion of white characters—Willem Dafoe also plays a prominent role—into a fundamentally Chinese story was an unacceptable concession to the conventional wisdom that big-budget international productions cannot succeed without a Hollywood star, who is almost always a white man. You can make a movie about Native Americans or Japanese samurai, but you’d better find a way to center it on Kevin Costner or Tom Cruise. Given that The Great Wall is predicted to come in behind The Lego Batman Movie at the U.S. box office on its opening weekend, it’s not clear that’s even true in a pragmatic sense—it opened bigger in China, although it dwindled quickly thereafter—but that argument also ignores the political ramifications of casting a white European man as the salvation of not only the Chinese characters around him but, in this case, China itself.

Universal

As a filmmaker who has been making movies in the government-controlled Chinese film industry for decades, however, Zhang Yimou is adept at the art of subversion, or at least of simultaneously serving multiple masters. It’s true that we enter The Great Wall’s story through the eyes of Damon’s William, but he’s almost immediately sidelined once we meet the Nameless Order, the Chinese forces under the command of Jing Tian’s Commander Lin. Although they managed to talk their way out of being promptly executed, William and Pascal’s Tovar spend most of the Nameless Order’s first battle against the Tao Tei tied up on a parapet, looking on in silent awe as the order’s color-coded troops deploy a dazzling array of combat strategies against their mythological foe. There are undoubtedly more scenes devoted to William than any other single character, but it still feels like the material pertaining to him has been cut in half. (For an epic fantasy, The Great Wall is startlingly short, barely over 90 minutes without the closing credits.) There either needed to more scenes centering on William or, better yet, none. Even after six writers, including The Last Samurai’s Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, finished with the script, there’s no compelling reason for William to be at the center of this story, and Damon acts like he doesn’t know why he’s there, either.

About those combat scenes, though. It’s not hard to see what drew Zhang to this story, nor is it hard to see where most of its reported $150 million budget went. The lines of extras costumed in radiant primary-color outfits seem to stretch for miles; when they run across the wall’s battlements, it’s like watching surging rivers of paint. Female warriors in flowing blue uniforms leap from the wall and plunge hundreds of feet to stab at hellish monsters before being pulled back up by the cables around their waists. Flaming cannonballs trace plumes of smoke through the air before exploding in a 3-D cascade. (I haven’t even talked about the movie’s climax, which features a flotilla of diaphanous hot-air balloons and a chase through a stained-glass tower.) In terms of spectacle, The Great Wall may not measure up to Zhang’s early-aughts trilogy of Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Curse of the Golden Flower, but a decade after he closed that book, even an appendix is welcome.Ask Amy special: We're talking trash

Q. Are trash cans in the alley fair game? Can I throw a handful of candy wrappers in a stranger's bin? How about a bag of dog poop?

A. An episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" busted this issue wide open when Larry David tossed an apple core into a person's garbage can as he was walking past. The neighbor angrily confronted him, and hilarity ensued. Unfortunately, in real life, hilarity seldom ensues. While it is OK to toss a candy wrapper into a garbage can (make sure the coast is clear before tossing), it is not OK to toss your doggie business into a personal trash can.

Q. On the night before garbage pickup day, if our receptacles are full, I slip a bag of garbage or recyclables into my neighbors'. She lives alone and never fills her container. Is that ethical?

A. The garbage can, even when provided by the waste hauling company, sits on your neighbor's property and is intended for her use alone. Garbage cans (and the garbage in them) are the homeowner's property until the cans' contents are dumped into the truck and hauled away. If you want to piggyback onto your neighbor's receptacle, you really should ask first.

Q. Our neighbors have a backboard and rim nailed to their garage so their kids can play hoops. But the incessant dribbling and shouting make it feel as if I'm working in the United Center during NBA season. Is there a solution, or am I doomed to hoops hell?

A. You can ask your neighbors to create a reasonable curfew for their kids' hoops playing, mainly to let them know that the basketball playing is creating something of a disturbance for you. However, there is plenty that you can also do to block out this noise -- noise-canceling or iPod earphones, for instance. In the scheme of things, basketball bouncing, though annoying, should be appreciated as part of the soundtrack of your neighborhood. I would venture a guess that this noise might even be missed once it was gone.

Q. Our neighbors, the Relentless Green Couple, have a big compost heap next to the alley and we've seen critters scurrying in and out of it. What should we do?

A. Your neighbor could be causing a serious critter infestation, which would take heaps of poison to eradicate -- thus erasing the "green" effects of composting. No one in an urban area should have an open composting bin for this very reason. Closed composting systems are inexpensive, effective and faster than open systems. You should suggest this to your neighbor. If the problem continues, call the city.

Q. When someone puts up a basketball hoop, can anyone play there? Do you have to ask? What if you aren't a neighbor?

A. Anything attached to a person's house or garage or placed at the edge of a private lawn -- whether a basketball hoop, hammock or a clothesline-- is personal property. Would you lie in your neighbor's hammock or hang your clothes from his clothesline? (Hint: The answer is no.) The basketball hoop should be out of bounds to all but the family and invited guests.Norman B Leventhal Map Center, Boston Public Library

Urbanites vote Democratic, and it sometimes seems like they always have. Republicans left cities during the postwar suburban boom and dragged the party platform with them: Urban reform gave way to racial fearmongering and crude stereotypes that have long outlasted any basis in reality. Donald Trump, who lies to his supporters in claiming that the murder rate is at a 45-year high, may represent the culmination of a GOP movement to see its urban policy—to the extent such a thing exists—as a racially charged pitch to suburban and rural voters.

Henry Grabar Henry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate’s Moneybox.

The extinction of the big-city Republican has been underway for a few decades now, but a New York Times analysis of voting patterns by population density reveals the stark shift in the voter booth. Population density is now highly correlated with Democratic votes. In 2012, only one county with a population density of more than 1,000 persons per square mile—a low bar that includes many, many suburbs—voted for Mitt Romney. That was Orange County, that conservative bastion of Southern California (and President Obama still hit 45 percent there). The rest, cities and suburbs alike, all went blue.

The urban Democrat is everywhere now, but that link between geography and politics is relatively new: No such correlation between party and settlement patterns existed in the 1950s.

A metropolitan political party has emerged. Beginning with Bill Clinton, the Democrats assembled a coalition that has captured large swaths of the suburbs. Colorado is one of the clearest examples: Over the past 30 years, a blue lake of Dem counties has swelled in the Front Range around Denver. The same has happened in Northern Virginia. It’s partly thanks to Dems’ centrist economic policies, which appeal to suburbanites. It’s partly because of demographic change: A majority of blacks and Hispanics now live in the suburbs, and suburban America fell from 81 percent white in 1990 to 65 percent white in 2010. And it’s partly because the Republican Party has grown more extreme in its positions on virtually every issue, ceding suburban moderates to Democrats.

People who live closer together tend to be more Democratic at the local level, too, according to an intriguing analysis by Jonathan Rodden, a professor of political science at Stanford. His 2008 Election Atlas of precinct-level voting results shows a pattern of lingering Democratic votes in red, non-metropolitan counties in Midwestern states. Rodden’s analysis shows that those fat red, rural counties that make up the geographic bulk of the Rust Belt on election night actually display regular internal patterns around their small, urban centers. In hundreds of small cities and towns in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, Rodden shows, the Democratic vote clusters within one mile of city hall, and decreases as you move out past the last stop sign.

“Within two or three miles of the town center in any direction, one finds strong—even overwhelming—Democratic majorities,” Rodden writes in the Washington Post. “Only as one moves away from Main Street and downtown does one begin to find majority-Republican precincts in the newer single-family houses on the edge of town.”

Stanford Election Atlas

The electoral geography of the Midwest appears in fractals, where well-known city-suburb doughnuts are replicated at the local level.

But this election, there’s evidence that demographic change in such places, far from breeding tolerance, is correlated with support for Donald Trump. That’s the conclusion reporters from the Wall Street Journal came to after running U.S. counties through the diversity index, which measures the chance that two people in a county will be of a different race or ethnicity. Trump won about 71 percent of counties nationwide—but he won 80 percent of counties where the diversity index had increased by more than 150 percent. Many of those counties are Midwestern towns whose fading fortunes have been turned around by large influxes of Hispanic immigrants. Their unemployment rate is often lower than in the country at large. Their residents have traditionally voted Democratic. But anti-immigrant sentiment is growing: In 39 Iowa counties where the index doubled, Republican registration has more than twice outstripped Democratic registration. (Many of the immigrants are not citizens.) The fear of immigrants, in other words, may be overwhelming the big-D Democratic sympathies that have long pervaded small towns in the Midwest.5487321

A Christian florist violated state anti-discrimination laws when she declined to provide floral arrangements for a longtime customer’s same-sex wedding ceremony, the Washington state Supreme Court ruled Thursday, affirming a lower court’s ruling.

A gay couple, Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed, sued Arlene’s Flowers after the shop’s owner, Barronelle Stutzman, declined to provide flowers for the couple’s ceremony, citing her religious beliefs that marriage is between a man and a woman.

Stutzman’s lawyers, religious freedom law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), vowed to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“We are deeply disappointed with today’s court decision,” ADF senior counsel Kristin Waggoner said in a statement released after Thursday’s decision. “It’s unbelievable to think that Barronelle Stutzman, a small business owner and creative professional who loves and respects everyone who walks through her shop’s doors, stands to lose all that she owns – her retirement, her life savings, her home – simply for declining to create custom expression for one event that violated her conscience for a long-time friend and customer. All Americans should be free to peacefully live and act consistent with their convictions and faith without threat of government punishment.”

Stutzman had regularly provided flowers for Ingersoll for years, but her conscience wouldn’t let her participate in the actual wedding ceremony.

“Barronelle created custom floral arrangements for Rob dozens of times over the course of nearly 10 years. Many of those artistic arrangements were for his partner, Curt,” Waggoner said. “One time, in all those years, she declined to create a specific message that conflicted with her deeply held beliefs about marriage. And Rob and Curt had no trouble obtaining wedding flowers from two other local floral design artists. The only damages they claim are $8 in gas to go there instead.”

The gay couple celebrated their legal victory as proof that they are on the “right side of history” — a term favored by former President Obama and other prominent progressives.

“We’re thrilled that the Washington Supreme Court has ruled in our favor,” Ingersoll and Freed said in a statement released through the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which joined their lawsuit against Stutzman. “The Court affirmed that we are on the right side of the law and the right side of history. We felt it was so important that we stand up against discrimination because we don’t want what happened to us to happen to anyone else. We are so glad that we stood up for our rights.”

Waggoner disagrees.

“No one would expect a Muslim journalist to write a piece for a religious journal that attacked Mohammed; no one would expect an Orthodox Jewish artist to create a mural for a religious customer that contradicted the Torah’s teachings,” she said. “Nor should Barronelle be forced to create custom expression celebrating a same-sex wedding.”

No matter how secure your password is—even if you have a long, complex one created by a password manager—it is still a single point of failure. An attacker could crack it, steal it, or change it.

But take heart! To greatly improve the security of your login process, you can turn to multifactor authentication. It’s basically an extra security step—one more factor—that comes after entering your username and password. You may have encountered a version when, say, your bank or credit card company asks security questions (“Who was your third-grade teacher?”). Depending on the system, there may be multiple extra steps. Swipe a card. Scan your retina. Speak a phrase. All of these plus more.

But the second step that you’re most likely to encounter is a request to enter a numeric code.

Here’s what it looks like to use two-factor authentication in Gmail. You enter your username and password like always. Then, instead of being logged in, you get a screen asking for another code.

You get the verification code from an authentication-generating tool that’s connected to your account. Some sites send you the code via text. Some organizations issue people a keychain USB device (security key) with a little display that shows a code that changes frequently. Others use apps that run on your mobile device. Google Authenticator is very popular and is available for most mobile devices. Take this example:

You launch the authenticator app on your phone, and it shows a number like this:

Enter that code in the Gmail window, and you’re in. This is more secure than just using a password because the code changes every 30 seconds. That little Pac-Man–looking thing to the lower right of the code is actually a countdown timer. If hackers were to intercept a code you submitted, it would be no good to them at a later time. (That’s why I don’t feel nervous about showing an actual screenshot from the Authenticator app.) To get a valid code, they would need to physically steal your phone.

Now that you know what it is and how it works, the question is how to turn it on. This will vary from account to account, but it’s usually in a similar place. Go to your account settings and find the spot for security. It’s often near where you would change your password. If your service offers two-factor authentication, you will probably find it there. Here are links to the spot you can get it on popular sites:

Google, including Gmail and YouTube, uses Google Authenticator

Twitter offers it via text, under the section called Login Verification

Facebook has it, called Login Approval, and you can get the codes via text, through an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator), or using a physical security key if you have one.

Amazon can do it via text or through your authenticator app (like Google Authenticator).

If you turn on two-factor authentication and choose to receive your code via text, you will simply need to verify your phone number. Then, you will receive a text message from the service with your code every time you log in. If you use an app to generate codes, you need to link the app to your account. This is easy. When you turn on two-factor authentication and indicate you want to use an app, the site will show you a QR code. (I munged up this QR code and secret key so they aren’t actually usable.)

Advertisement



While that is on your computer screen, launch your authenticator app and click the button to add a new account. Then click the option to scan the barcode. Point your camera at the screen to scan the code, and you’re done. Your authenticator will instantly be set up to provide codes for that account

The benefit of using an authenticator app is that you have codes for all your accounts in the same place. And while it might seem like a pain to use two-factor authentication, you will find you rarely need to get those codes. Most people stay logged in to their accounts on the devices they use most often, so it is only an occasional nuisance.

The downsides: You have to have your phone or mobile device with you when you do log in. I admit to getting unreasonably frustrated when I’m just trying to log in to a different computer to get an urgent email and my phone is in the other room. Plus, if your phone is broken or offline for some reason, you can be stuck.

Fortunately, there is a backup plan for just that kind of situation. These services will all give you a list of one-time use codes that you can print out. I keep a photo of that on my phone in case I need to log in when my phone isn’t online (like when I’m overseas) and also keep a printout in my computer bag.

Overall, you get a lot more security for a little bit of effort. And when news breaks of the next massive password hack, you can smugly relax, knowing your password is useless without the second factor you have set up.

Daphne Merkin’s new book, This Close to Happy: A Reckoning With Depression, is at once an exploration of her own mental health and a memoir of her experiences growing up in an Orthodox Jewish family with a complicated, domineering mother. “My mother was only nice to me when I was sick,” Merkin writes, in one of many passages that take on added meaning as the book unfolds. (She also details the way in which her parents, who escaped Nazi Germany, ignored her and her siblings and allowed a nursemaid to abuse them.)

Isaac Chotiner Isaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer.

The book recounts her hospitalizations and the complex relationship she has with her own daughter, now 27. Depression, she writes, causes someone to lose “the thread that pulled the circumstances of your life together. Nothing adds up and all you can think about is the raw nerve of pain that your mind has become—and, once again, how merciful it would be to yourself and others to extinguish this pain.”

I spoke to Merkin, who has contributed to the New Yorker and the New York Times Magazine for many years, last week. During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed her attempts to parent differently than her own mother, how writing the book changed her outlook on her own life, and what lessons she has for those who feel despondent about Donald Trump.

Isaac Chotiner: What, if anything, about the act of writing the book changed the way you think about either your own depression or depression more generally?

Daphne Merkin: I went through different stages writing it. There were periods where I was depressed and didn’t write. Cumulatively, it gave me some kind of perspective on depression and its landscape. With rare cases, it completely remits, and people are never depressed again. But usually it does have a life of its own, and it is not all that predictable. It will taper off and then recur when it recurs.

I think one of the hardest things about being in a severe depression is that you don’t think it will end. I think most people who have been in one would say that. That’s undoubtedly what leads to suicide: the idea that you’re going to be stuck in this painful, in a way noisily painful yet also silent, illness forever. Writing the book, I became more aware that depressions don’t last. With or without medication, they have a lifespan. I don’t think they suddenly abate. They stop, and they recur. There were times when I was significantly not depressed. I think at the very end of the book I said the opposite of depression isn’t some state of great, extraordinary happiness. The opposite of depression is feeling moderately content.

In one passage, you write, “I have hurled all the charm and wits I have at my disposal against my proclivity to depression, such that it would be difficult for even close friends of mine to detect how low I am at any given time.” Was the act of writing the book, ironically, a conscious example of trying to throw your wits and charm at your depression?

I know that I wanted to write a readable, hopefully not too depressing book about depression, and in that way make it a seductive book in spite of the subject. That was my hope. I think of writing as yet another way in which I threw my wits and my charm, ostensible charm, at this subject of depression. And writing not ingratiatingly but seductively, compellingly so that you’d want to read about it. I think the real issue for me is depression is unbelievably isolating. I move in fairly, if you want to call them that, sophisticated circles. When I wrote this first piece about being hospitalized for depression when I was at the New Yorker, it wasn’t the kind of thing people talked about even if they were depressed.

What has been the response to the book from people you are close to?

The opposite of depression is feeling moderately content.

Some people said to me they didn’t realize I was depressed, and I guess they read it with a degree of dismay that they didn’t realize this. Even in a sophisticated place of employment like the New Yorker, it wasn’t like people talked about this kind of thing. I still don’t think functioning people talk about depression much. They talk about rehab. They talk about AA, but depression has another connotation. It remains somewhat more stigmatized partly because it’s elusive. You can’t say these are its symptoms, this is what it looks like. It both partakes of a serious illness and doesn’t look like a serious illness.

It’s also, in milder forms, something that everyone goes through. People say, “Oh, I read the newspaper today, and I got depressed,” which makes it seem more ordinary.

Yes, and that’s also what makes it problematic in its more severe forms. I think I quoted Diane Keaton saying, “Everyone’s a little depressed.” The word depressed is thrown around a lot, as you just said. There’s being made depressed by Donald Trump, as I expect many people are. That’s reactive depression, which the whole world suffers from, getting depressed in response to depressing circumstances, versus depression from within.

My guess would be that you are also pretty upset about what’s happening in the world.

Yes.

How would you compare your moments of bad depression internally versus what you feel now about the world? I am not asking you to quantify—

You can’t. I think the kind of severe depression I was trying to describe in the book comes with a lot of stuff. It’s essentially enervating. It’s hard to function, hard to focus. You don’t eat. You don’t talk much. You withdraw.

When I was very, very depressed, it was referred to as a vegetative depression. I didn’t read. I wouldn’t watch TV. With Donald Trump, it is disturbing and depressing, but not in so personal a way. It’s not you fighting yourself.

I don’t want to sound too glib or self-helpy, but are there any coping mechanisms that you would recommend for people who are dealing with situational depression right now?

Advertisement



Yeah. This is again going to maybe sound reductive, but when you’re really, really depressed, you’re sort of embattled in yourself. One thing you can do is coax yourself along in a form of self-talk. I think one thing that helps even in these times is to try and focus on meaningful work—that it’s not all for naught because there’s a mad king in the White House. I think the people who do best altogether in this whole period are people who take it in and then put it aside. They don’t walk around with this pervasive “the world has become Trumpified.” I don’t know. I’m going on about Trump because I’ve been thinking about him a lot today.

The one perverse thing that makes me feel weirdly better is that I sometimes say to myself, “ We could be living through the Khmer Rouge or the Holocaust or whatever.” And this in fact connects to your book.

I think about the experience that my parents went through, because my mother used it strangely. You can’t say about everything, “Well, it’s not Auschwitz,” and therefore it’s tolerable to a child. I mean, people’s experiences matter to them, and it doesn’t always help to say, “Think of the starving in India or China,” to a child who doesn’t want to finish her food. Bringing up an extreme, drastic, historical event of genocide didn’t make me feel any better when I was homesick in sleepaway camp. The use of it is too out of whack.

However, I will say that I think the fact of leaving Germany, particularly for my mother, having very close relatives on both my parents’ sides who perished in the Holocaust, my mother was enormously marked by it. Even though I said you can’t say to a child, “You’re not dying. You haven’t been bombed by napalm. You’re OK,” there’s a way in which I agree with you. Last time I happened to watch The Deer Hunter, I was watching those horrendous Viet Cong scenes. I was thinking to myself, “OK, Trump is here, but we’re not living in siege mentality in truth.”

Yet, Daphne, yet.

I agree. I was going to add “yet” myself. Another thing I’ve thought about is that depression, or a degree of it, is humanizing. This is my last reference to Trump for this conversation. If Donald Trump suffered from depression at all, as opposed to a variety of sociopathology including but certainly not limited to narcissism, he’d be a different man. It usually does come with a degree of empathy. I go nuts when people say he’s narcissistic like that’s the whole answer. I don’t know that many people who are inclined to depression who don’t also have a certain empathic mode. I mean, there’s a much wider range, if you ask me.

He seems unhappy but not depressed.

Correct.

How did writing the book change the way you thought about your mother?

Yes, I think of her as a victim of her time. At 16, she had to leave Frankfurt, which she very much loved. Her father was an upper-middle-class lawyer, and they went to what was then Palestine. Her life dramatically changed. They had very little money. The British mandate took over their house. She couldn’t finish school. I think things would have gone very differently for her had that not happened. She probably would have pursued some form of fuller career. As it was, she did become a teacher. … I think she had a lot of ambition. She also wrote.

You say very clearly that you don’t want to make the same mistakes with your daughter and that you hope that your daughter doesn’t struggle with depression. What does your daughter think of the book?

Let me hasten to say that my daughter makes it a habit to not read most of what I write, I think self-protectively. She knows little bits and pieces of the book, but she hasn’t read the whole book at all. I wrote a piece some years ago for the Times called “Is Depression Inherited?” attempting to clear up that depression is at best 50 percent genetic. You have biological predisposition, but then you need triggers in your life. I would say my daughter is complicated and moody, the word my mother used about me, but not particularly depressed, I’m happy to say.

You never worry that writing will make it difficult for her?

No, I do worry. It hasn’t stopped. ... I mean, there are things I don’t write. The thing about candid autobiographical writing is you never know what the writer didn’t say. Do you know what I mean?

I sensed that with your book, but you also talk about her drinking and things like that.

That part I read to her. I didn’t mean that she was a major alcoholic. I read her that scene actually because I was worried she wouldn’t like it. My daughter is a deeply, deeply independent-minded soul. I think she takes all this with an enormous grain of salt.

Have you ever talked to her up front recently about the mistakes that your mother made and whether she feels that you’re making them?

Yes, I have. We do talk. I feel she was burdened with witnessing some of my depression at its most severe. When she was very young, I would leave. The last time I was enormously depressed frankly wasn’t so, so long ago. It happened to have been when I tried going off medication last summer. It had horrendous results. She saw me very, very depressed. I do feel I wish I could have protected her against that.

I suppose though one difference would be that you’re able to talk to her in a more up-front way than your mother was able to talk to you about certain things, right?Highest total since 1999 comes as federal judges rule against state attempts to ban Syrian refugees.

Last month, World Relief nearly doubled the number of refugees it resettles in the United States in a typical month. In the past 12 months, the evangelical agency handled a caseload of 9,759 refugees—its largest total since 1999.

“The task set before us last month was nothing short of monumental,” stated president Scott Arbeiter. “But the work our dedicated staff and volunteers have accomplished has been equally impressive.”

The milestone comes at the same time as major setbacks to the effort to ban Syrian refugee resettlement in Indiana and Texas.

Earlier this month, a federal appeals court found the Syrian refugee ban by Indiana governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence was based on a “nightmare scenario” of Syrian terrorists posing as refugees to gain US entry. “No evidence of this belief has been presented,” wrote judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

Four days later, Texas’s attorney general dropped the state’s appeal of a federal court decision, preventing Texas from banning resettlement of refugees from Syria inside state borders.

Through its 26 offices and its local church networks, World Relief resettled 1,400 refugees in September. The agency supports federal plans to increase the rate of resettlement of refugees by nearly 30 percent next year.

“[We are] prepared to continue meeting the increased need into the next year by providing resettlement assistance to some of the world’s most vulnerable people,” Arbeiter stated.

The Obama administration’s 2017 plan calls for the resettlement of 110,000 refugees—including 13,000 Syrians—across all 50 states. The 1980 Refugee Act authorizes the president to set this annual goal.

World Relief is one of nine agencies approved for refugee resettlement. It partnered with 1,180 congregations this year to assist refugees.

“It’s a counter-cultural moment for the church. How could we sit out the greatest refugee crisis in history and still say that we love our neighbor?” Ed Stetzer told CT. In January, Stetzer helped to convene the GC2 summit, a new pro-refugee collaboration among evangelicals.

Stetzer said Christians should participate in the debates over vetting refugees and other issues. “And while debate goes on, the church abides by another policy—the one Jesus gave when he said, ‘Do to others as you would want them to do to you.’”

Across the board, religious groups are pressing hard for higher resettlement goals. Yet state and local opposition remains strong nearly one year after the Paris terrorism attacks that killed 130 people.

“We are hoping that Congress and states will embrace this, but we are seeing the opposite,” World Relief vice president for advocacy and policy Jenny Yang told CT.

Many who resist refugee resettlement are worried about terrorists posing as refugees. But recent research by the libertarian Cato Institute found that “the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year.”

Resettlement critics also base their opposition on the health risk of resettled refugees who might carry tuberculosis and HIV, and on the burden placed on local government as refugees exhaust federal benefits.

“Texas recently decided to pull out of the refugee resettlement programs, as did Kansas and Idaho,” Yang said. “The House of Representatives also recently had language in one of their bills to limit funding to only 70,000 refugees.”

This fall, Church World Service (CWS) called for much more ambitious goals for resettlement. “Anything short of a steadfast US commitment of admitting 200,000 refugees over the next fiscal year would betray the White House’s own call to redouble global resettlement efforts,” said CWS, which represents 37 Christian groups, in a statement.

According to the Pew Research Center, just under 85,000 refugees were resettled in the US by September 30, the end of the 2016 federal fiscal year.

More Muslim refugees (38,901) were admitted in 2016 than in any other year since the government started to release religious affiliations in 2002. By comparison, admission of Christians dipped to 37,521 in 2016, slightly below the 2015 total.

“During the past 15 years, the US has admitted 399,677 Christian refugees and 279,339 Muslim refugees, meaning that 46 percent of all refugees who have entered the US during this time have been Christian while 32 percent have been Muslim,” Pew stated.

CT has reported on why Syrian refugees are more Muslim than Christian, whether the Paris terrorist attack affected American attitudes toward asylum seekers, and how many pastors report that their congregation is fearful of refugees coming to the United States.

CT also visited eight refugee camps in Iraq and Greece to learn why evangelicals on the front lines of the refugee crisis still have hope.A Superior Court judge has ruled against Atherton and other plaintiffs that had tried to stop progress on Caltrain's electrification project by claiming the project's environmental report was flawed.

The lawsuit, filed in February 2015 by Atherton, the Transportation Solutions Defense and Education Fund (a transit advocacy nonprofit) and the Community Coalition on High-Speed Rail, argued that the electrification project and the state's high-speed-rail project were so closely tied that any environmental report needed to look at the possible impacts of both projects on the Peninsula.

Rail tracks run through the center of Atherton, just feet from town offices and residents' back yards, and the town has a long history of legal wrangles with Caltrain and against high-speed rail.

Most recently Atherton made part of the town a "quiet zone" where trains are not to blow their horns, something Caltrain had said for years was not possible.

Court ruling

Caltrain spokeswoman Jayme Ackemann said the judge's "ruling confirms what we already knew to be the case: Caltrain’s project is independent of the High Speed Rail project and therefore we have a valid, approved EIR (environmental impact report) that has fully investigated all of the electrification impacts and alternatives."

Ms. Ackemann, director of marketing and communications for Caltrain, said the agency did not make any concessions to Atherton as a result of the lawsuit.

She said construction activities for electrification will start in 2017 and by 2020 electric train service should be in operation.

The ruling by Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge Barry P. Goode said high-speed rail and the electrification projects are separate projects. The lawsuit had argued that the electrification project couldn't take place without high-speed rail because funding that makes the electrification project possible comes from the California High Speed Rail Authority, and that the ultimate plan is for Caltrain and high-speed rail to share the rail tracks that run from San Francisco to San Jose.

"The Electrification Project can be implemented successfully even if the HSR project never takes another step forward," Judge Goode wrote. "It is a project of independent utility that Caltrain has been seeking to implement for nearly twenty-five years. The fact that CHSRA is willing to fund it does not change that."

Atherton City Attorney Bill Conners said it will be up to the council to review the decision and decide if it wants to appeal.Spencer Platt/Getty Images

On Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo found himself in a familiar predicament: how to reconcile his progressive self-image with a pattern of governing that generates more opposition on the left than on the right.

Henry Grabar Henry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate’s Moneybox.

Confronted with the state Legislature’s pre-emption of a New York City rule to reduce plastic bag use, Cuomo signed away the city’s regulation. In doing so he joined a group of Republican governors—Arizona’s Doug Ducey, Idaho’s Butch Otter, Wisconsin’s Scott Walker, Vice President and former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, to name a few—who have approved bans on, well, bag bans. It’s a model law incubated by the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council, and a favored method of the plastics industry, which correctly sees local action against plastic bags as a precursor to wider prohibitions.

Most of those governors are happy to align themselves with the business interests of plastic bag manufacturers. But Cuomo has a reputation to uphold. And so he offered a long statement that, with the acrobatics of a plastic bag darting down a windy Manhattan avenue, argued that the city’s now-gutted law was actually too pro-business.

The city law would have placed a mandatory 5-cent fee on plastic bag sales, to be collected by merchants. (Such fees are common around the country and have been proven to reduce bag use in other cities.) Countermeasures and exceptions would have eased the burden on poor New Yorkers: the sanitation department planned to give out 400,000 reusable bags, customers using food stamps were exempted, and food carts and stands would not have been required to charge a fee.

Get Slate in your inbox.

The most objectionable part of the city’s bill, Cuomo argues, is that merchants keep the 5-cent fee on every plastic bag sold; the city council does not have the power to levy a tax. “A 100 million dollar bonus to private companies is beyond the absurd,” he said in his statement. “Legislation often requires compromise but not capitulation. There is no need to pass an overly compromised bill—we can and should promulgate the best policy in the country.”

The state-specific context here is that Cuomo and Bill de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City, have a long-running feud that extends to matters as trivial as the fate of a deer in a city park. But his windy, defensive statement suggests this was not the governor’s vindictive side on display, but something more timid.

Cuomo announced he would establish a statewide “task force” to develop a plan. But the odds of him pushing a more stringent anti–plastic bag measure through Albany are low. (Legislators’ concerns, sincere or otherwise, were not that the bill was a “capitulation” to business interests. Instead, they displayed the concern trolling for the poor that often cloaks opposition to health and environmental regulation.) Perhaps Cuomo foresees that when his task force’s recommendations are rejected, he will be able to assume his rightful role as environmental warrior martyred by reactionary state legislators.

Cuomo argues that because plastic bags pollute the entire state, a statewide remedy is the only effective course of action. This is dumb and disingenuous. Disingenuous because, if he thought that way, why would he have waited until now to form a task force on plastic bag pollution? (The city’s bag fee was approved nine months ago.) Dumb because plastic bags are so evidently more of a problem in densely populated areas, where littering pedestrians and overflowing public trash cans release bags into trees and waterways. The old GOP bromide about a "uniform regulatory environment" holds no sway here; there is no plausible scenario in which either businesses or consumers would cross city lines to operate in a Disposable Container Freedom Zone.

The truth is that laws discouraging the use of plastic bags start local. Hawaii’s de facto statewide plastic bag ban is actually a patchwork of county prohibitions. California’s would never have been possible had cities like San Francisco not proved its viability. That’s why the American Progressive Bag Alliance, which lobbies on behalf of bag manufacturers, lines up behind bills like the one Gov. Cuomo signed. They know that local case studies, evolving in fits and starts, eventually prove that life without plastic bags is possible. And evidently Cuomo knows it too: His statement cites the need to look at other cities that have tried to get a handle on plastic bags, such as D.C. and Chicago.México, 4 de enero 2017 (NOTIGODÍNEZ).- En su festín orgiástico de “información” sobre los presuntos “saqueos” a tiendas departamentales en varios puntos del país, principalmente del centro, a la gente de Grupo Fórmula se le pasó la mano y usó —¿deliberadamente?— una imagen de disturbios en medio oriente para ilustrar una de sus “noticias” sobre el tema.

“Jóvenes armados con tubos y cuchillos recorren calles de Tultepec, #Edomex”, se lee en el título de la nota que Radio Fórmula difundió en sus redes sociales. La imagen muestra a un grupo de sujetos en una escena de aparente violencia.

No obstante, al fondo de la imagen se aprecian letreros de negocios con caracteres árabes, revelando que la escena fue captada en medio oriente y no en Tultepec. El colectivo Anonymous Hispano, uno de los primeros en percatarse del “error”, ironizó sobre el gazapo de Radio Fórmula.

One of Donald Trump’s most consistent promises to the American people is that he will create jobs. This week, one of his policies destroyed them.

Ruth Graham Ruth Graham is a regular Slate contributor. She lives in New Hampshire.



On Wednesday, the large international relief and development organization World Relief announced that it will lay off more than 140 staff members in the United States. It will close offices in Columbus, Ohio; Miami; Nashville, Tennessee; Boise, Idaho; and Glen Burnie, Maryland. According to World Relief, those five offices have collectively resettled more than 25,000 refugees in the last 40 years.

Both the headline and first sentence of the organization’s announcement of the layoffs laid the blame squarely on the president’s shoulders. “As a direct result of the recent decision by the Trump Administration to dramatically reduce the number of refugees resettled in the U.S. throughout fiscal year 2017, World Relief has been forced to make the difficult decision to layoff 140+ staff members,” the press release began.

The refugee ban was met with significant and immediate opposition among religious leaders, among whom World Relief’s president, Scott Arbeiter, was one of the most vocal. “Some of the most vulnerable people in the world right now are Muslims,” he told CNN after Trump said that Christian refugees would be given priority over Muslims. “If we say no Muslim should be let in, we are denying the humanity and dignity of people made in the image of God.”

World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, is one of nine organizations authorized by the government to handle refugee resettlement. This week’s layoffs represent about 20 percent of the group’s U.S.-based employees. As the Syrian refugee crisis escalated last fall, the organization said it was handling its biggest case load since 1999, resettling 9,759 refugees in the previous 12 months. Contra Trump’s claims in 2015 that Syrians seeking asylum were “young, strong men,” 78 percent of Syrians admitted here were women and children, according to figures released last year by the State Department.

Even as Trump’s temporary ban winds it way through the legal system, it is having a devastating impact on other agencies that handle resettlement. The agencies are funded through a combination of federal money and private donations; most of the federal funds come in the form of one-off grants for each individual refugee the agencies resettle. The sudden cessation of refugees means a sudden cessation of funding. The International Rescue Committee launched an emergency appeal in January asking donors to help raise $5 million to keep open its 29 offices across the country, along with its field teams. Catholic Charities is asking for $8 million to save jobs in 80 locations. “It's a mess. It's just a mess,” Sister Donna Markham, the organization’s president and CEO, told Catholic News Service. “If we're talking about American jobs, this is laying off people in these public-private partnerships.” She said up to 700 employees could be affected by the order, with many of them losing their jobs.Photo by Sam Breach

Dear Prudence,

My boyfriend and I have been together for five years and started living together six months ago. He is amazing and I know that I want to spend the rest of my life with him. While shopping, I found the absolute perfect ring for him and have thought about proposing to him. I brought this up to my best friends thinking they would be excited and instead they told me not to. They said I would be “taking away his moment.” He’s not the type of guy to care about the woman proposing but now it has me rethinking things. Do I just continue to wait around for him to propose, or do I plan something nice and go along with my plans of proposing to him?

—On a Ring and a Prayer

Subscribe to Prudie!

Here my personal prejudice will show a little! In general I think it is much more sensible for a couple to agree to get married after discussing it than it is for one to ask the other to make a decision on the spot. Less exciting, maybe, but it also reduces your odds of hearing “Oh ... thank you so much, but ...” while you’re down on one knee with a ring in your hand. That said, you surely know your boyfriend better than your friends do. If you don’t think it’s important to him that he be the ring-pitcher and not the ring-catcher—and if you feel reasonably certain the answer will be yes—go ahead and propose! The point is not to care who flings a finger-circle at whom. The point is for you two to be happy together and want to get married, which is a lovely thing. Congratulations!

Dear Prudence,

At my last party, a very good friend of mine who is obese broke a chair as she sat in it. I played polite hostess and made sure she was OK. I’ve now taken it to get fixed and found out it’s broken beyond repair. It’s one of my favorite chairs and can’t be replaced. I’m frustrated! My friend doesn’t make a lot of money, so I don’t feel comfortable asking her to pay for it. She hasn’t mentioned it since. My girlfriend doesn’t want me to say anything. Is there any way to say, “I can’t fix the chair, I have to get a new set, I’m miffed, but ultimately, a chair is just a thing and I care more about you and your health. Can you please take care of yourself?”

–Chair Beyond Repair

I don’t believe there is! Your speech will not be giving her any new information. She knows how much she weighs. She knows she broke your chair. She has not brought it up since then because she is undoubtedly mortified. I understand it’s frustrating to lose a favorite piece of furniture, but imagine how painful it must have been for her in that moment, to fall and them to have all eyes trained on her. If someone falls in your house—no matter what size they are—you make sure they are OK not out of grudging obligation, but because you want to make sure they are OK. I believe that what you really want is to make sure she feels miserable, ashamed, and in your debt. You are angry about the loss of your chair and feel that she has not been embarrassed enough. Since she can’t pay to replace the chair, you would like her to pay you in humiliation. Let the chair go, and resist your desire to remind her of it.

Dear Prudence,

My first husband died after a long illness; for the last eight years of his life we were essentially co-parents and close friends. After he passed I began dating again; in the two years since I have gotten happily remarried. My daughter loves her stepdad and new relatives. My brother has never met my new husband and refuses to allow him in his house or meet his wife and children. Everyone who has met my husband (even my first husband’s relatives!) adore him. My brother and his wife think I and my daughter should still come over for their children’s birthdays (and bring presents). But they think I’m being unreasonable for refusing to set foot in their home until my husband is welcome. Should I suck it up and go see them without my husband? Or should I stand my ground?

—Punished for Remarrying

Stand your ground. Your brother and his wife are behaving outrageously. Forbidding your new husband from visiting their home won’t make your first husband come back. It won’t even make you any less married now. It’s a bizarre and deeply unloving choice of them to make, especially considering your first husband’s own family have already welcomed your new husband. Hopefully it won’t be too long before they realize how unreasonable they’re being, but until then, the loss is theirs, not yours.

Dear Prudence,

My long-distance boyfriend of seven years broke up with me this fall. I don’t want to get back together with him, but he handled the breakup badly (canceled a visit at the last minute, then ended things via text). We haven’t spoken since. However, I have a lot of things of his that I’d like to return; items he left in my care with the assumption that he would get them the next time we saw each other. Would it be rude to ship the items back to him? Do I include a note? I hate looking at that stuff in my closet and want to be rid of it, but he behaved terribly and we haven’t spoken in over two months. Is it time to just pack the box off to Goodwill?

–Stuck With Someone Else’s Baggage

Shipping his stuff back to him is the most generous possible thing you could do! No note necessary. Mailing painful trinkets back to a thoughtless ex is a horrible rite of passage, and one that will make you feel fantastic once you’ve gotten rid of them.

Dear Prudence,

My dad recently seems to have developed a hatred for overweight people that I can’t understand. He says things like “look at this fatty” when we’re out driving. My husband and I object when he says these things, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. What’s even worse is that my mother is overweight. He says these things around her, and she doesn’t say anything! I think my dad is trying to be funny, but no one laughs. When I came home from the hospital two days after my son’s birth last year, he made a comment about how I “still looked pregnant.” I’m not sure if I should bring it up or just let it be between my parents, but the whole thing really upsets me.

–Unfunny Father

“Look at this fatty” isn’t a joke. It’s barely an observation. I will never understand why so many grown people think the appropriate response to seeing someone fat is to say something cruel. How awful that your mother feels so defeated around your father that she stays quiet when he derides people who are similarly overweight, knowing full well that she will take the insult as intended for her. If you’re otherwise close with your father, consider pulling him aside and asking him why he’s taken to pointing out and insulting fat people. What’s he getting out of it? Why is it so important to him all of a sudden that he audibly passes judgment on how total strangers look? You and your husband are performing a valuable act by speaking up when your father disparages strangers’ appearances. Keep doing it.

Dear Prudence,

I have a good friend who struggles financially. He keeps his rent money in a PayPal account; every month, his sister withdraws the amount of his rent from her own account and delivers him the cash, and he sends her the PayPal amount. When his sister can’t for some unforeseen reason, I get calls asking me to do it. He says it’s to prevent his bills from being auto-withdrawn from his rent amount, but I find the whole situation weird. Once, he didn’t ask, he just sent the money via PayPal and begged me to get it to him that night. He has a habit of assuming I will do him favors without asking, which bugs me like crazy. But I don’t want to be responsible for him losing his housing (especially since he was homeless briefly this year).

–Last-Minute Banker

I have a lot of sympathy for anyone who lives in fear of homelessness, but I’m not quite sure I understand why your friend needs this strange system to pay his rent every month. If he didn’t have enough money to keep a checking account open, that’s one thing, but it sounds like he just doesn’t know how to turn off auto-pay. Tell him you care about him and you’re willing to help out when you can, but he can’t regularly expect you to drop everything in the middle of the night to deliver bundles of cash for him. It will be better for everyone if he can figure out a more reliable—and simpler!—method of paying his rent on time.

Dear Prudence,

The last time my husband’s brother and his family were visiting, my husband scraped his brother’s car with his, causing minimal paint damage. My brother-in-law asked us to get repair quotes; the bumper would have to be pulled off and repainted entirely for over $700. My husband wasn’t thrilled, but it was his fault, so we sent a check. My in-laws cashed the check but then decided not to fix their car, which is a work vehicle, since “it’ll probably just get more dings and dents.” My husband is furious and wants them to give us our money back. I don’t think that’s necessarily the right answer, but I’m at a loss.

–Twice Dinged

Your husband did the right thing paying for the cost to repair the scratch, which his brother took as an excuse to take advantage of him. If Bro had always planned to cash your husband’s check without getting his car fixed, odds are he won’t return the money even if you ask. But it’s worth asking. Your husband should tell his brother (as calmly as possible) that he gave him the check with the understanding that it would repair the car, not because he wanted his brother to have $700. If they still refuse to send back a check, you’ll know not to write them any more in the future (and to park on the other side of the street whenever you see them coming).

Dear Prudence,

After my mother’s recent death I received an email from my cousin “Jane” apologizing for how horribly she had treated me when we grew up together, and saying how wonderful and generous my mom had always been to her despite this. But in fact, when we learned she was dying, my mother apologized for how she’d stood by and let Jane bully me relentlessly. She said she hadn’t wanted to be “one of those parents” who always favored their own child.

Now my mom is gone. I forgave her, but I’m not sure what to do about Jane. Since college I have tried to comport myself around her with civility, but having her admit she knew how horrible she’d been has made things worse. We rarely see each other. I could easily ignore her for the rest of my life without creating any family tension (we have a very large family). Would that be wrong?

–Forgive, Can’t Forget

No. Jane may have apologized, but you’re under no obligation to accept. It’s a good thing for her own soul that she is sorry for what she did, but it does not necessarily follow that you must have a relationship with her. If you have no interest in revisiting your childhood with the woman who did her best to make it as painful as possible, don’t force yourself to. Do what will bring you the most peace. It took her many years to finally reach out to you; there’s no reason she can’t wait many more for a response.

More Dear Prudence Chat TranscriptsA survey from President Trump’s campaign team meant to gather antimedia answers has turned into an online proxy war between those who support the president and those against him.

On Thursday, moments after he completed an hour-plus press conference, in which much of the time was spent attacking reporters and “fake news,” Trump’s team emailed out a survey to all his supporters imploring them to help fight the mainstream media. Such surveys are a common way to collect supporters’ emails, which can later be used for fundraising pitches.

“You know that I don’t trust the media to report on anything we achieve,” read the email. “Instead, you — the American people — are our last line of defense against the media’s hit jobs. You are our greatest asset in helping our movement deliver the truth to the American people.”

The email then linked to a 25-question “Mainstream Media Accountability Survey,” asking about the levels of trust in different cable news networks and posing other questions such as:

Do you believe that political correctness has created biased news coverage on both illegal immigration and radical Islamic terrorism?

Do you believe that the media wrongly attributes gun violence to Second Amendment rights?

Do you believe that contrary to what the media says, raising taxes does not create jobs?

Do you agree with President Trump’s media strategy to cut through the media’s noise and deliver our message straight to the people?

While it’s possible Trump and his campaign get the answers they’re looking for to tout in the future, it’s not just supporters of the president who are spreading the link to the survey around. MTV News’ Jamil Smith’s tweet urging followers to take the “deranged” survey garnered over 7,000 retweets. It joins hundreds of similar messages with joke answers mocking the survey.

Another battleground was Reddit, the hub for a myriad of different communities with millions of daily users. The BlueMidterm2018 group — dedicated to helping Democrats win the 2018 midterm elections — rallied to vote the survey to the site’s front page, earning triple the activity of the pro-Trump community The_Donald’s top post.

“URGENT!!!!” read one of the many The_Donald posts linking to the survey. “The left is having people fill out this survey to taint the results. Please..If you support Trump make sure you fill it out. Let’s stop the left and their attempt to rig our survey!!!”

At the conclusion of the survey, the campaign is soliciting contributions, a quarter of which go to the Republican National Committee. The RNC posted the story on its Facebook page, but a number of the highest-rated comments are anti-Trump and anti-RNC.

You can read the survey in full below:Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows

Shirts proclaiming feminist slogans are standard issue for many college students, but who would have predicted that they would become a key trend on the runway? Woke couture sent out its first shoots last year, when Dior designer Maria Grazia Chiuri paired a flowing tulle skirt with a T-shirt that declared, "We Should All Be Feminists." The shirt, retailing for $700, was an immediate social media success and has since been worn by Natalie Portman and Rihanna.

Political T’s positively proliferated at this year’s New York Fashion Week: Jonathan Simkhai gifted front-row attendees to his show with “Feminist AF” shirts, and Prabal Gurung, citing January’s women’s marches as inspiration, debuted T-shirts decorated with messages including “The Future Is Female” and “Nevertheless She Persisted.”

It isn’t immediately clear how these shirts are different from others you could find on Etsy, eBay, or even Amazon, other than the 3,000-percent price difference. The novelty seems to be rooted in the notion that Dior is making a feminist statement. Suddenly, the fashion crowd has embraced political clothing. Some observers have suggested this might even make feminism more palatable to a new crowd. Britain’s Daily Telegraph said Chiuri was “reaching women who might not normally be receptive to any kind of socially progressive message.”

“Designer protest wear” is a bit of an oxymoron, but the positive impact shouldn’t be ignored. We’re all familiar with the cultural cachet luxury brands wield, not to mention the trickle-down effect of trends. Consequently, more brands will surely soon be producing clothes that affirm women’s rights. If Juicy Couture was able to create a whole market for tracksuits with degrading slogans printed on their derrieres, it seems certain that within six months discount stores will be packed to the rafters with knockoff T-shirts covered in Elizabeth Warren quotes.

Fashion editors seem simultaneously excited and terrified by this new trend: They want to join the revolution, but they’re afraid of becoming just another body among the unmanicured masses. Vogue writer Eviana Hartman took an informal survey of fashion editors’ feelings about dressing for the resistance, and it was clear that they’re not quite ready for the barricades. They prefer to make a statement by donning boldly tailored items or featuring a pop of bright color rather than by slapping a slogan on their shirts. Hartman confessed that though she had purchased some vintage political T-shirts on eBay, she was struggling to integrate them into her wardrobe. She declared this “a good old-fashioned fashion challenge.”

But isn't the way to incorporate a T-shirt into your wardrobe simply to wear it with a pair of jeans? Do you need special protest pants or to balance it with a conciliatory skirt?

Worrying over the right way to style garments that proclaim one’s feminism seems like a desire to qualify the statements they’re proclaiming. The message is, “We should all be feminists, but I also believe in lipstick and this season’s Gucci loafers.” Or “My feminism is semi-ironic, as betrayed by my Gloria Steinem-style tinted glasses.”To listen to the discussion, use the player below:

As recently as 15 years ago, many rural parts of Africa had few phone lines or major roads. There was no rapid way for residents to communicate with metropolitan centers or to access their many benefits, from education to medical care. So when cellphones started to make their way to large swaths of the continent, they were imbued with big hopes: The greater ease of communication, economists and political scientists predicted, would stimulate growth, improve health outcomes, and reduce ethnic tensions.

Yascha Mounk Yascha Mounk, a lecturer on government at Harvard and a fellow in the political reform program at New America, is the author of Stranger in My Own Country and host of The Good Fight podcast.

The truth, political scientists Jan Pierskalla and Florian Hollenbach recently found, is more complicated. The spread of cellphones did lead to some economic growth. But it also had some striking downsides. In particular, parts of the continent where cellphone coverage improved also experienced higher levels of political strife. “The availability of cell phone coverage,” Pierskalla and Hollenbach conclude, “significantly and substantially increases the probability of violent conflict.”

This cautionary tale about technological progress fits the spirit of our times. It’s difficult to remember now, but a few short years ago, it seemed obvious that social media would make the world a better place. In countries such as Iran or Syria, its evangelists claimed, it was already toppling dictators. Even at home, Facebook and Twitter would empower ordinary citizens and deepen democracy.

Thomas Friedman offered an especially pure distillation of this boosterish view:

As the I.T. revolution and globalization have been democratized and diffused — as we’ve gone from laptops for elites to smartphones for everyone, from networking for the lucky few at Davos to Facebook for all and from only the rich heard in the halls of power to everyone being able to talk back to their leaders on Twitter — a new global political force is aborning … I call them The Square People.

They are mostly young, aspiring to a higher standard of living and more liberty, seeking either reform or revolution (depending on their existing government), connected to one another either by massing in squares or through virtual squares or both, and united less by a common program and more by a shared direction they want their societies to go.

That received wisdom has (to put it mildly) not aged well. The mullahs still rule in Iran, and Syria lies in tatters. Social media may have helped to give rise to movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter that aspire to “more liberty.” But it has also spawned countermovements that seek to disenfranchise minorities—including the one that propelled Donald Trump into the White House. The breathless claims made on the internet’s behalf back in the halcyon days when nobody had heard of Pepe the Frog seem even more facile now than they did then.

Once people grew disenchanted with social media, the prevailing consensus flipped remarkably quickly. Facebook and Twitter are now routinely blamed for everything that is wrong with the world: They supposedly explain the chaos in Syria as well as the influence of Russia, the success of ISIS as well as the spread of homegrown terrorism.

Here at home in the United States, too, the blame game is in full swing: Doesn’t fake news spread via Facebook? And hasn’t the “alt-right” gone mainstream thanks to Twitter? As Farhad Manjoo wrote in the New York Times shortly after the presidential election, “we are now living through a kind of bizarro version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media.”

It’s for the best that we have (mostly) disabused ourselves of seeing digital technology as a panacea. But we are now in danger of simply standing the older consensus on its head: If it’s not our savior, social media must be the devil.

That’s far too simple. Just because social media isn’t as utopian a force as Friedman believed doesn’t mean that it must be a dystopian danger. Nor is social media, as some people like to say, merely a neutral means—one that can be directed, with equal ease, toward any number of ends. Instead, social media has a very specific impact: It weakens the power of insiders and strengthens the power of outsiders. As a result, it favors change over stability—and constitutes a big, new threat to political systems that have long seemed immutable.

Digital technology’s not a panacea. But we are now in danger of simply standing the older consensus on its head.

To understand why, it’s worth examining just how the rise of cellphones could increase incidents of violence in Africa. In essence, Pierskalla and Hollenbach suggest, the government used to have a monopoly over the technology you need to communicate effectively. This gave it two big advantages over rebel groups.

First, because they had access to military phones, army generals could check whether their soldiers were actually carrying out the dangerous jobs they were assigned. Rebel leaders in rural areas were unable to do the same, giving rise to a collective action problem: Foot soldiers in the rebellion had a strong incentive to avoid actual combat (which might prove deadly) while continuing to draw a salary (because their bosses didn’t know they weren’t putting their lives on the line).

Second, in combat situations, government troops could use their military radios to coordinate. Rebel groups could not communicate on the go, so even when forces were evenly matched, the greater tactical agility of official army units gave them an advantage.

The introduction of cellphones changed all of that. Suddenly, rebel leaders could check on the daily activities of followers in remote villages just as easily as army generals. And when the day of battle came, rebel groups could use those same cellphones in lieu of fancy radio equipment to coordinate attacks. The technological gap between government and rebels had shrunk rapidly. And since the government was no longer able to quash rebellions definitively, conflicts ended up being more deadly and protracted.

The same logic applies to more sophisticated technology. For much the same reasons that old-fashioned flip phones proved an important tool for African rebel leaders, Facebook and Twitter have given radicals in North America and Western Europe an important tool in their fight against the democratic consensus.

It used to be challenging to put together a protest, much less to start a campaign, without access to established political organizations and vast financial resources. Finding like-minded people and coordinating their efforts was simply too complicated. But thanks to the rise of new technologies, it has become much simpler and cheaper to build a base of supporters and to align what they do. The technological gap between establishment parties and fringe movements has rapidly narrowed—so, as a result, has the ability of outsider candidates to win elected office.

The same phenomenon is in the middle of transforming the media landscape. Until a few years ago, a small elite of writers, editors, producers, and news anchors effectively decided what views were mainstream enough to be given a hearing. This may sound sinister, but it served an important purpose. It allowed the journalistic class to contain false claims and to refuse to publish racist articles. It also meant that critics who rejected polite political discourse had trouble breaking in. Building a distribution network was expensive, so they couldn’t do much beyond writing angry letters to the editor (which those newspapers could decline to print).

Today, by contrast, just about any citizen can start tweeting, running a blog, or even building a big website like Breitbart. If he amasses enough of a following, he can quickly turn into a major purveyor of fake news. Little wonder, then, that establishment barriers against blatant lying or racist rhetoric in the press have seemingly fallen by the wayside.

Seen from this angle, there is nothing paradoxical about the fact that Facebook both helped to bring ordinary Egyptians out into the street to oppose Hosni Mubarak, a brutal autocrat, and helped to elect Donald Trump, a leader with an authoritarian aspiration or two. In dictatorships, where political elites have long used their power to punish people agitating for democracy, social media has made it easier to organize pro-democratic protests. Meanwhile, in democracies, where political elites have long used their power to marginalize opponents of democratic norms, social media has made it easier to spread anti-establishment views.

Historians liken the rise of social media to the invention of the printing press. That may sound grandiose, but to my mind, the comparison actually underplays the depth and the rapidity of the transformation. A dozen years after the invention of the printing press, the technology had not yet spread beyond the German city of Mainz, and a negligible fraction of the world population had held a printed book in their hands. A dozen years into the invention of Facebook, the technology is available around the globe, and nearly 2 billion people are actively using it.CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share An undocumented woman was detained by two agents as she exited a courtroom after asking for a protective order.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent (Photo: LM Otero/Associated Press file) Story Highlights See criminal complaint below

AUSTIN — Federal immigration agents went to the El Paso County Courthouse last week and arrested an undocumented woman who had just received a protective order alleging that she was a victim of domestic violence.

The agents apparently detained the woman Feb. 9 after receiving a tip, possibly from her alleged abuser, whom they already had in custody, El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal said.

The detention has alarmed Bernal and other county officials who fear that the arrest will scare undocumented victims of domestic abuse into staying with their abusers for fear of being deported and separated from their children or other family members.

However, a criminal complaint on file with the U.S. District Court in El Paso indicates that a person of the same name as the alleged victim might have a history of deportation and domestic violence.

Bernal was not aware of the complaint, filed by U.S. immigration officials, when she spoke about the arrest earlier in the day. She said, however, that her office cooperates with federal authorities when serious crimes are alleged.

“Our clients come to us at the lowest point in their lives. Many of them are so frightened of coming to us because of possible immigration concerns.” El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal

But she and other officials said protective-order courts are not the place for immigrant detentions.

“Our clients come to us at the lowest point in their lives,” said Bernal, whose office represents domestic abuse victims when they seek court orders against their abusers. “Many of them are so frightened of coming to us because of possible immigration concerns.”

Bernal said her office is taking steps to relieve those fears in the wake of last week’s arrest.

The alleged abuser, Mario Alberto De Avila, is jailed on a charge of forgery of a financial document, the criminal complaint states.

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to comment Wednesday to questions about the incident.

The criminal complaint states that on Feb. 2, Homeland Security Investigations Border Enforcement Security Taskforce agents received information that Irvin Gonzalez, who also is known as Ervin Gonzalez, was in the U.S. despite having been previously deported. The information received stated that Gonzalez was staying at the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence.

The complaint, filed Feb. 9, indicates that Gonzalez, whom Bernal identified as transgender, had been deported six times since 2010 — apparently after arrests for crimes including possession of stolen mail, false imprisonment and assault.

Its narrative differs, however, from what Bernal unearthed in her investigation in a key respect. The complaint says Gonzalez was arrested on the street, while investigators looking into the detention for Bernal said it happened inside the courthouse.

"There were six ICE agents on the 10th floor," Bernal said.

The arrest comes at a time of heightened concerns that under the administration of President Donald Trump, ICE is expanding who it tries to deport and how it goes about deporting them.

The woman is being held in the El Paso County Jail under a federal ICE detainer, Bernal said.

Her arrest comes to light along with news that ICE conducted an immigration raid in Las Cruces on Wednesday, rounded up 51 people in Austin since last week and conducted sweeps in numerous other states.

Bernal, whose office is conducting an investigation into the incident, said the ICE agents said they went to court after receiving a tip. Gonzalez's live-in boyfriend had earlier been detained by ICE, Bernal said.

“We suspect it’s the (alleged) abuser” who tipped off ICE about the woman, Bernal said.

El Paso County officials say they don't want ICE to get into the habit of going to the courthouse and acting on such tips.

It’s common for abusers to seek to control undocumented partners by threatening to refer them to immigration authorities, said 65th District Judge Yahara Lisa Gutierrez, who oversees the court that issued Gonzalez's protective order.

Whatever her own history, the woman made three police reports late last year, alleging that she had been punched, kicked and chased with a knife, Bernal said.

Judge Gutierrez said ICE agents should avoid effectively assisting domestic abusers by acting on their tips against their partners.

“There’s no place for that — especially in family court,” she said.

“It's certainly an underreported crime. If there's a fear they or their families will get deported, they won't come forward.” Stephanie Karr, executive director of El Paso's Center Against Sexual and Family Violence

Bernal said she’s doing all she can to reassure victims of abuse — especially if they're undocumented.

“We will do everything in our power to get them the protection they need,” she said, explaining that her office does not inquire about abuse victims' citizenship.

Bernal’s staff is also researching immigration law and is trying to communicate to ICE to make sure further arrests don't take place in or near family court.

“We are hopeful that this is an isolated incident and that this never happens again,” she said.

El Paso County Judge Veronica Escobar said she is worried that word about the woman's arrest is already spreading in the immigrant community — which is large in a border city such as El Paso.

The county judge said she is considering asking Bernal’s office to work with civil rights groups to put together a pamphlet explaining people’s rights when they’re approached by federal agents. She said similar pamphlets were distributed in the 1990s after agents started asking students’ immigration status near Bowie High School, which lies within shouting distance of the Mexican border.

It's possible that not only undocumented victims of abuse will be scared into the shadows, said Stephanie Karr, executive director of El Paso's Center Against Sexual and Family Violence. Victims are beaten down physically and emotionally and reluctant to come forward without the fear of arrest, she said.

"It's certainly an underreported crime," Karr said. "If there's a fear they or their families will get deported, they won't come forward."

The experience of one of those states  Vermont  suggests that highlighting the medical industry’s largesse may curb the payments.

This month, the attorney general of Vermont  one of three states to require gift disclosures  released data showing that total payments to physicians dropped 13 percent in fiscal 2009 to $2.6 million. The reporting requirement began in 2002.

Consumer advocates have complained that industry compensation can affect a doctor’s choice of drugs or treatment and that exposing the doctors will dissuade such behavior. But some consumer groups say that the new law is too narrow in its scope. And it has raised complaints among some doctors, who say the provision will unfairly stain legitimate work they do for industry.

The overall dollar value of gifts to Vermont physicians “has been going down steadily for the last three years,” says Wendy Morgan, chief of the state attorney general’s public protection division. “I think there are more health care providers who won’t accept gifts.”

Vermont lawmakers want to make sure of that. Last year they amended the law to ban most gifts outright, including food, which accounted for $800,000 of the 2009 total.

The other states with similar legislation, Massachusetts and Minnesota, have also outlawed many forms of corporate gift-giving, although they do allow doctors to accept speaking fees and most product samples. All three states allow research grants.

Yet even consumers in those three states will get more detailed information and easier access to the data under the new federal program, which is part of the health overhaul signed into law last month.

Database Will Be Available Sept. 30, 2013

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires companies to begin recording any physician payments that are worth more than $10 in 2012 and to report them on March 31, 2013. That includes stock options, research grants, knickknacks, consulting fees and travel to medical conferences at chi-chi hotels. The details will be posted in a searchable database starting Sept. 30, 2013.

The measure is based on a bill that was introduced more than two years ago by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis. The senators believe that physicians who receive benefits from drug and device makers are more inclined to prescribe the priciest products.

“We hope this lowers health care costs and strengthens patient-doctor relationships,” says Ashley Glacel, a spokeswoman for the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which spearheaded the original bill.

It’s not just states that are reporting physicians who are compensated by life-sciences companies. A growing number of pharmaceutical companies, feeling pressured by lawmakers expressing concerns about medical conflicts of interest, are also listing physician payments on the Internet. Most recently, Pfizer released details of $35 million in payments that it made to doctors in the second half of 2009.

Some industry critics gripe that the federal law has too many loopholes. It only applies to physicians and teaching hospitals, for example. Companies won’t have to report payments they make to nurses, physician assistants, and other medical professionals who might influence which products are prescribed.

“If any marketing avenue is not regulated, companies will find a way to exploit it,” predicts Dr. Daniel Carlat, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Tufts Medical School. Carlat was once a speaker for Wyeth but quit over concerns about how to deal with a depression drug’s side effects. “I expect we’ll see a lot more nurse practitioners giving hired-gun talks,” he says.

In Vermont, corporate payouts to nurses totaled $288,000 in 2009-almost triple the amount they received the previous year.

Some physicians opposed federal and state efforts to limit physician-industry relationships because they fear it will impede innovation.

Complaints From Doctors

“The use of the term ‘sunshine’ has an implicit aura of corruption,” says Dr. Thomas Stossel, a professor of medicine at Harvard. Last year, Stossel co-founded the Association of Clinical Researchers and Educators, which promotes collaboration between physicians and industry to create better products.

Stossel has accepted speaking and consulting fees from companies such as Merck and Pfizer, and he says he’s not opposed to his name appearing in corporate disclosures. But he does believe concerns about relationships between companies and doctors have been overblown. “What’s wrong with a company buying me lunch or giving me a tote bag?” he asks.

Other physicians acknowledge that donations from industry  even small ones  can create conflicts of interest. “There is extensive literature suggesting that gifts can influence behavior,” says Dr. Robert Steinbrook, adjunct professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School.

That evidence prompted the National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine to issue a report last year endorsing the elimination of all physician-industry relationships that might unduly influence prescribing behavior.

While the new federal law stops short of banning gifts, it does promise to increase the public’s understanding of how companies interact with physicians. Rather than simply listing names and dollar amounts, the federal database will include explanations of what services the physicians provided in return for the payments. And drop-down menus will make it simple for patients to parse the data by name, type of gift received, and other specifics.

As a result, “the legislation will allow us to analyze the data in ways that are meaningful,” says Jerome P. Kassirer, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine and author of “On the Take,” a book about physicians’ financial relationships with companies.

That will be especially useful for patients facing hip or knee replacements, or other procedures involving expensive medical devices, Kassirer adds. “They’ll be able to determine whether their doctors are heavily invested in the companies making the devices,” he says.

Research suggests that those details matter to some patients. Kevin P. Weinfurt, an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, has studied how patients participating in clinical trials react to physician disclosures. He found that patients were particularly troubled when doctors owned stock in the companies that were managing the clinical trials. “They felt somehow that this physician could do something in the trial that could make the company a lot of money, which would then make him a lot of money,” Weinfurt says.

Industry groups representing pharmaceutical and medical-device makers have supported the federal provisions on physician disclosures.

“This knowledge will give the public greater confidence in the nature of the relationships” between companies and physicians, says David Nexon, senior executive vice president of AdvaMed, a trade association of medical device makers. “We have nothing to hide.”Video Breast in Show A sly commentary on our obsession with women’s breasts.

The White House said in the statement that it was replacing Mr. Flynn with retired Lt. Gen. Joseph K. Kellogg Jr. of the Army, a Vietnam War veteran, as acting national security adviser.

Video

Mr. Flynn was an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and in his resignation he sought to praise the president. “In just three weeks,” Mr. Flynn said, the new president “has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America’s leadership position in the world.”

But in doing so, he inadvertently illustrated the brevity of his tumultuous run at the National Security Council, and the chaos that has gripped the White House in the first weeks of the Trump administration — and created a sense of uncertainty around the world.

Earlier Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that “the president is evaluating the situation” about Mr. Flynn’s future. By Monday evening, Mr. Flynn’s fortunes were rapidly shifting — his resignation came roughly seven hours after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in the retired general.

And when he did step down, it happened so quickly that his resignation does not appear to have been communicated to National Security Council staff members, two of whom said they learned about it from news reports.

Officials said Mr. Pence had told others in the White House that he believed Mr. Flynn lied to him by saying he had not discussed the topic of sanctions on a call with the Russian ambassador in late December. Even the mere discussion of policy — and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an American adversary before Mr. Trump took office — represented a remarkable breach of protocol.

The F.B.I. had been examining Mr. Flynn’s phone calls as he came under growing questions about his interactions with Russian officials and his management of the National Security Council. The blackmail risk envisioned by the Justice Department would have stemmed directly from Mr. Flynn’s attempt to cover his tracks with his bosses. The Russians knew what had been said on the call; thus, if they wanted Mr. Flynn to do something, they could have threatened to expose the lie if he refused.

The Justice Department’s warning to the White House was first reported on Monday night by The Washington Post.

In addition, the Army has been investigating whether Mr. Flynn received money from the Russian government during a trip he took to Moscow in 2015, according to two defense officials. Such a payment might violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits former military officers from receiving money from a foreign government without consent from Congress. The defense officials said there was no record that Mr. Flynn, a retired three-star Army general, filed the required paperwork for the trip.

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement late Monday that Mr. Flynn’s resignation would not close the question of his contact with Russian officials.

“General Flynn’s decision to step down as national security adviser was all but ordained the day he misled the country about his secret talks with the Russian ambassador,” said Mr. Schiff, noting that the matter is still under investigation by the House committee.

Two other Democratic lawmakers — Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland — called for an immediate briefing by the Justice Department and the F.B.I. over the “alarming new disclosures” that Mr. Flynn was a blackmail risk. “We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,” they said in a statement.

Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House intelligence committee, was supportive of Mr. Flynn until the end. “Washington, D.C., can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn — who has always been a soldier, not a politician — deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” Mr. Nunes said in a statement.

The White House had examined a transcript of a wiretapped conversation that Mr. Flynn had with Mr. Kislyak in December, according to administration officials. Mr. Flynn originally told Mr. Pence and others that the call was limited to small talk and holiday pleasantries.

But the conversation, according to officials who saw the transcript of the wiretap, also included a discussion about sanctions imposed on Russia after intelligence agencies determined that President Vladimir V. Putin’s government tried to interfere with the 2016 election on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Still, current and former administration officials familiar with the call said the transcript was ambiguous enough that Mr. Trump could have justified either firing or retaining Mr. Flynn.

Video

Mr. Trump, however, had become increasingly concerned about the continued fallout over Mr. Flynn’s behavior, according to people familiar with his thinking, and told aides that the media storm around Mr. Flynn would damage the president’s image on national security issues.

Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, asked for Mr. Flynn’s resignation — a move that he has been pushing for since Friday, when it became clear that the national security adviser had misled Mr. Pence.

Around 8:20 p.m. Monday, a sullen Mr. Flynn was seen in the Oval Office, just as preparations were being made for the swearing-in of newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. Soon after, Mr. Flynn’s resignation letter started making the rounds.

Administration officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Kellogg would be asked to stay on as Mr. Flynn’s permanent replacement. Mr. Flynn brought Mr. Kellogg into the Trump campaign, according to a former campaign adviser, and the two have remained close. K. T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser who also was brought on by Mr. Flynn, is expected to leave that role, a senior official said.

One person close to the administration, who was not authorized to discuss the personnel moves and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that retired Vice Admiral Robert S. Harward is the leading candidate to replace Mr. Flynn, although Mr. Kellogg and David H. Petraeus are being discussed. It was not clear whether Mr. Petraeus is still expected to appear at the White House this week, as initially discussed by advisers to the president.

Mr. Flynn’s concealment of the call’s content, combined with questions about his management of his agency and reports of a demoralized staff, put him in a precarious position less than a month into Mr. Trump’s presidency.

Few members of Mr. Trump’s team were more skeptical of Mr. Flynn than the vice president, numerous administration officials said. Mr. Pence, who used the false information provided by Mr. Flynn to defend him in a series of television appearances, was incensed at Mr. Flynn’s lack of contrition for repeatedly embarrassing him by withholding the information, according to three administration officials familiar with the situation.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Mr. Flynn and Mr. Pence spoke twice in the past few days about the matter, but administration officials said that rather than fully apologize and accept responsibility, the national security adviser blamed his faulty memory — which irked the typically slow-to-anger Mr. Pence.

The slight was compounded by an episode late last year when Mr. Pence went on television to deny that Mr. Flynn’s son, who had posted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton on social media, had been given a security clearance by the transition team. The younger Mr. Flynn had, indeed, been given such a clearance, even though his father had told Mr. Pence’s team that he had not.

Officials said classified information did not appear to have been discussed during the conversation between Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, which would have been a crime. The call was captured on a routine wiretap of diplomats’ calls, the officials said.

But current Trump administration officials and former Obama administration officials said that Mr. Flynn did appear to be reassuring the ambassador that Mr. Trump would adopt a more accommodating tone on Russia once in office.

Former and current administration officials said that Mr. Flynn urged Russia not to retaliate against any sanctions because an overreaction would make any future cooperation more complicated. He never explicitly promised sanctions relief, one former official said, but he appeared to leave the impression that it would be possible.

During his 2015 trip to Moscow, Mr. Flynn was paid to attend the anniversary celebration of Russia Today, a television network controlled by the Kremlin. At the banquet, he sat next to Mr. Putin.

Mr. Flynn had notified the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he once led, that he was taking the trip. He received a security briefing from agency officials before he left, which is customary for former top agency officials when they travel overseas.

Still, some senior agency officials were surprised when footage of the banquet appeared on RT, and believed that Mr. Flynn should have been more forthcoming with the agency about the nature of his trip to Russia.The first week of President Donald Trump’s new administration started with a lawsuit claiming he’s already violated the Constitution.

The lawsuit, filed by a collection of high-powered ethics experts and legal scholars, argues that because Trump has refused to give up ownership of his hotels and other businesses, he’s violating a clause of the Constitution that prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments.

This provision, known as the emoluments clause, is crucial to the debate about Trump’s conflicts of interest, because it’s one of the few available tools that might actually be able to force the president to give up his businesses or to hold him accountable if he doesn’t.

Some legal experts argue the lawsuit rests on shaky ground because it will be hard for the nonprofit that filed it, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, to prove that Trump’s actions have directly harmed them. But even if it fails, the lawsuit is important: It’s the first, and likely not the last, effort by an alliance of ethics experts and well-funded liberal groups to challenge Trump on constitutional grounds. A victory in court isn’t the only way these lawsuits can have an effect.

The case that Trump is violating the Constitution

Presidents aren’t legally required to give up their businesses and investments that could be a conflict of interest while they’re in office. But since Richard Nixon, all presidents have, both to try to ensure trust in government and to provide an example for their subordinates, who are legally required to eliminate conflicts of interest.

Trump is the exception. He’s claimed that he will put his two adult sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., in charge of his businesses while he’s in office. But he made clear that he’ll eventually be returning to them: “I hope at the end of eight years, I’ll come back and say, oh, you did a good job,” he said in January.

More important, Trump hasn’t given up ownership of the businesses. So if anybody wants to put some money in the president’s pocket, all they have to do is book a stay at the new Trump International hotel in downtown Washington, DC. The hotel, which has a sales position dedicated to diplomats, has successfully attracted foreign governments to book events and rooms: Azerbaijan celebrated Hanukkah and Bahrain marked its national day at the hotel in December, and Kuwait is scheduled to hold its own celebration there in February.

This is where the Constitution comes in. A section known as the emoluments clause prohibits any officeholder in the United States from accepting any “emolument, title, or office” from a foreign government. An “emolument” is usually defined as money or other benefits you get from a job or office you hold.

Until Trump was elected, the clause, originally a response to Benjamin Franklin accepting a snuffbox from the king of France, was pretty obscure. But the prospect of Trump making money off foreign governments’ bookings at his hotels or through his other businesses has made it a major issue at the start of his presidency.

Trump will continue to profit from his businesses while he’s in office. And many prominent scholars on the issue argue that as soon as that money starts coming in, he’ll violate the Constitution. The lawsuit provides a long list of potential emoluments clause violations, including bookings by diplomats at Trump hotels and leases in Trump Tower, global royalties from The Apprentice, which is shown on state-owned television networks in some countries, and permits issued by foreign governments for Trump-owned or -affiliated businesses in those countries.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare that Trump is in violation of the emoluments clause. Even if he is, though, it would be up to Congress to decide whether that merits impeaching him and removing him from office — and Republicans in Congress so far have been reluctant to look into Trump’s break with tradition on ethical issues.

Trump’s official position is that the emoluments clause does not apply to him. Sheri Dillon, a partner at the Washington law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius, laid this argument out at a January 11 press conference: “Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present, and it has nothing to do with an office. It’s not an emolument.”

Trump planned to avoid the issue, Dillon went on to say, by donating profits he made from foreign stays at his hotels to the federal government. But even if Trump follows through on this promise, it won’t alleviate concerns from former chief White House ethics lawyers and the head of the federal Office of Government Ethics, who maintain that the only ethical solution is for Trump to sell his businesses and let an outsider manage the proceeds.

The big question: Can CREW sue Trump at all?

The lawsuit alleging that Trump violated the emoluments clause was filed by some of the nation’s foremost experts on constitutional law, corruption, and government ethics, including Laurence Tribe, a Harvard professor of constitutional law who has also argued 35 cases before the Supreme Court; Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham University professor who studies corruption (and who has run for office twice in New York); and Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California Irvine school of law.

Still, it has a high bar to clear in court. It’s not just a question of proving Trump violated the Constitution. The lawyers must prove their client, the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, has been directly injured by what they argue are Trump’s unconstitutional actions.

To win a lawsuit, you first have to prove that you have “standing” — that whatever you’re suing about harmed you directly in a way that a court can remedy. If a judge decides you don’t have standing, your case will be dismissed. Historically, this has been a high hurdle for lawsuits against the president to clear, but not an impossible one.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the plaintiff in the case, argues that it has standing because Trump’s conflicts of interest and his possible violation of the emoluments clause have been very time-consuming for their organization. The lawsuit describes CREW as besieged by questions from the media about Trump’s business interests.

Answering those questions, according to the lawsuit, took time and resources away from the organization’s other work, including tracking potential violations of campaign finance law, filing comments on proposed regulations, and analyzing nonprofits’ tax forms.

The Supreme Court accepted this reasoning as standing enough to sue in a fair housing case in 1982, but some legal experts are skeptical. Jonathan Adler, a professor of law at Case Western Reserve University, explained his doubts on Twitter on Monday:

Standing claim in #CREWvTrump is quite a stretch. If CREW has standing here, Lujan would have come out the other way. — Jonathan H. Adler (@jadler1969) January 23, 2017

Other law professors, many of them who, like Adler, tend to be conservative, concurred. But lawsuits where the argument for standing was initially perceived as questionable at best have succeeded in the past.

When the House of Representatives sued President Obama over a provision in Obamacare in 2014, arguing that Obama broke the law by giving money to insurers that hadn’t been authorized by Congress, many legal experts gave it little chance of succeeding because they believed Speaker of the House John Boehner did not have standing to sue. But the US District Court for the District of Columbia disagreed and allowed the suit to proceed in 2015, and later ruled in Boehner’s favor. (The case is under appeal.)

When Texas sued over Obama’s executive action on immigration that would have protected the parents of US-born children from deportation, some legal observers, including two American University law professors and former New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse, argued that the state had no standing to sue. But Texas was allowed to proceed with its case, which it won in appellate courts. (The Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 in 2016, upholding the appellate court victory.)

Even if CREW isn’t found to have standing, though, the mere fact that it’s filing the lawsuit is significant.

The emoluments clause lawsuit could win without winning

CREW has already challenged the president on at least three fronts. Besides the emoluments clause lawsuit, the group sent a letter to the General Services Administration about the lease on Trump’s DC hotel, which bars elected officials from benefiting from the property. On Friday, the group sued the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for more information on the Trump transition team’s request for the names of scientists working on climate change.

And that’s just in the first three days of Trump’s presidency.

This isn’t a surprise. The chair and vice chair of CREW’s board have been two of the most outspoken critics of Trump’s conflicts of interest: Norm Eisen, who founded CREW in 2003, is the chair, and Richard Painter, George W. Bush’s former ethics lawyer, is the vice chair. Since the campaign, they’ve become a crusading odd couple of sorts, setting aside other political differences (Painter is a lifelong Republican, although he voted for Hillary Clinton) to forcefully and repeatedly decry Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests.

But there are also good political reasons for nonprofits that oppose Trump to sue him. Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Clintons since President Bill Clinton was in office. In 2015, the group filed more than 20 lawsuits over Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and also obtained emails from the State Department featuring exchanges between the Clinton Foundation and government officials. Both of those controversies turned out to be pivotal in the 2016 election.

In the aftermath of Election Day, when some Democrats argued that liberals needed their own version of Judicial Watch, CREW was suggested as one group that could step into the role, according to Politico’s Josh Gerstein. CREW was founded with a nonpartisan mission, but David Brock, a Clinton ally and Democratic donor, served as its chair for two years.

Brock spent inauguration weekend at a summit of Democratic donors in Florida and, according to Politico, described CREW as a group that’s likely to be particularly active as the Trump administration gets underway.

Even if CREW’s cases aren’t all winners in court, the legal process could force the Trump administration to divulge information it would rather keep secret. Eisen hopes the emoluments clause suit will force Trump to release his tax returns, which he’s refused to make public. A win in court isn’t the only way for the suit to score points.Photo

WASHINGTON — Weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, discussed American sanctions against Russia, as well as areas of possible cooperation, with that country’s ambassador to the United States, according to current and former American officials.

Throughout the discussions, the message Mr. Flynn conveyed to the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak — that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary and that relations with Russia would change under Mr. Trump — was unambiguous and highly inappropriate, the officials said.

The accounts of the conversations raise the prospect that Mr. Flynn violated a law against private citizens’ engaging in diplomacy, and directly contradict statements made by Trump advisers. They have said that Mr. Flynn spoke to Mr. Kislyak a few days after Christmas merely to arrange a phone call between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump after the inauguration.

But current and former American officials said that conversation — which took place the day before the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia over accusations that it used cyberattacks to help sway the election in Mr. Trump’s favor — ranged far beyond the logistics of a post-inauguration phone call. And they said it was only one in a series of contacts between the two men that began before the election and also included talk of cooperating in the fight against the Islamic State, along with other issues.

The officials said that Mr. Flynn had never made explicit promises of sanctions relief, but that he had appeared to leave the impression it would be possible.

Mr. Flynn could not immediately be reached for comment about the conversations, details of which were first reported by The Washington Post. Despite Mr. Flynn’s earlier denials, his spokesman told the Post that “while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

During the Christmas week conversation, he urged Mr. Kislyak to keep the Russian government from retaliating over the coming sanctions — it was an open secret in Washington that they were in the works — by telling him that whatever the Obama administration did could be undone, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified material.

Days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Vice President-elect Mike Pence also denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak. He said he had personally spoken to Mr. Flynn, who assured him that the conversation was an informal chat that began with Mr. Flynn extending Christmas wishes.

“They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Mr. Pence said on the CBS News program “Face the Nation.”

Some officials regarded the conversation as a potential violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in disputes involving the American government, according to one current and one former American official familiar with the case.

Federal officials who have read the transcript of the call were surprised by Mr. Flynn’s comments, since he would have known that American eavesdroppers closely monitor such calls. They were even more surprised that Mr. Trump’s team publicly denied that the topics of conversation included sanctions.

The call is the latest example of how Mr. Trump’s advisers have come under scrutiny from American counterintelligence officials. The F.B.I. is also investigating Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative.

Prosecutions in these types of cases are rare, and the law is murky, particularly around people involved in presidential transitions. The officials who had read the transcripts acknowledged that while the conversation warranted investigation, it was unlikely, by itself, to lead to charges against a sitting national security adviser.

But, at the very least, openly engaging in policy discussions with a foreign government during a presidential transition is a remarkable breach of protocol. The norm has been for the president-elect’s team to respect the sitting president, and to limit discussions with foreign governments to pleasantries. Any policy discussions, even with allies, would ordinarily be kept as vague as possible.

“It’s largely shunned, period. But one cannot rule it out with an ally like the U.K.,” said Derek Chollet, who was part of the Obama transition in 2008 and then served in senior roles at the State Department, White House and Pentagon.

“But it’s way out of bounds when the said country is an adversary, and one that has been judged to have meddled in the election,” he added. “It’s just hard to imagine anyone having a substantive discussion with an adversary, particularly if it’s about trying to be reassuring.”Photo illustration by Slate.

Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank is stepping up the effort to distance himself from comments he made praising President Donald Trump.

Plank published a full page ad in hometown newspaper The Baltimore Sun clarifying his previous remarks. The open letter never mentions President Trump by name, instead stating Under Armour's values in diversity, equal rights, job creation, and opposing Trump's executive order travel ban. "I personally believe that immigration is the foundation of our country’s exceptionalism," Plank wrote.

Plank also promised in the letter that Under Armour will take "other public positions on legislation around the country in support of the interests of our teammates whenever policy conflicts with human rights."

Plank had originally landed his company in hot water after praising Trump as "an asset" in a CNBC interview on February 7. The letter says that this choice of words did not "accurately reflect" his intent.

After Plank's interview, many customers said they planned to boycott Under Armour, prompting the company to release a pair of statements clarifying its values. Under Armour sponsored athletes, including Steph Curry, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, and Misty Copeland also released statements on social media condemning the comments, but emphasizing their commitment to the company.

Over the weekend, thousands of people hit the streets in New York City, marching from Union Square to Trump Tower in protest of the new president-elect. Among them was Jim Crocamo, a New York man whose red hat and darkly funny cardboard sign caught the attention of those around him, and subsequently caught the attention of the internet, where thousands of people have retweeted, liked, and shared photos of him marching. Today, Select All checked in with Crocamo to find out more about the origin story of his now meme-famous sign and what’s next for the viral protester.

Okay, first can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

I’m 39, married, a librarian, and have been living in NYC for 15 years. I lived in north Brooklyn until a few years ago, when we moved to Queens, which is THE BEST. I love it.

How are you feeling after the election?

Pretty devastated. I am not prone to being doom-and-gloomy, and even though I recognized that it was deeply disturbing that Donald Trump was actually the Republican nominee and continued to have support, despite, well, literally everything that’s ever come out of his mouth, I just really did not think he had a chance at winning. I was in shock.

Explain to me your “but geez” moment? What finally made you want to make a sign and protest?



My wife, Caralee, and a couple of our best friends, Caroline and Jessi, were like “we are going to this rally and we are making signs!” I’ve been to marches over the years, but I have to admit that a lot of protest signs make me cringe, even if I agree with the general gist of what they are saying. I just think it’s really important for all of the people the Trump campaign targeted — immigrants, women, Muslims, Mexicans, minorities, LGBTQ (sadly the list goes on) — to see the streets fill up with their fellow Americans who are not going to stand for the discrimination he promised and ran on. The election results said to those people that there are a lot of people in this country who don’t give a shit about them, so it’s necessary to go out and show that there are lots who do. It seemed like the wrong time to be like “ugh, signs.” So that’s what I was thinking about when it came to me. Plus, “geez” struck me as a perfect way to capture the fact that I truly do not even know what to say to people right now.

Can you tell me a little bit more about the photo itself? Who took it and where were you?

The person who took the photo that ended up going viral is Alex Leo (@AlexMLeo), who I guess works for the Daily Beast and has a lot of Twitter followers. I don’t remember her taking it, so I’m not totally sure where this is, but I think it’s Fifth Avenue in the upper 40s. A lot of people were taking pics of the sign the whole time, so I can’t say for sure. But the march was great and people’s spirits were high, all things considered.

So the responses were positive?

People loved it! Lots of people took pictures, I got high fives and fist bumps, one lady had her boyfriend take a picture of her with me — she must have sensed my impending memehood. Early on in the march I was noticing that people were really responding to it, and it seemed to be cheering people up, and that’s when it occurred to me that I was actually being useful in a way. People just had a truly messed-up week, so many of them are depressed or feel hopeless and scared. So making people laugh was nice.

Any thoughts on becoming a meme?

I feel truly fortunate that I became a meme for doing something funny on purpose and not for something like falling off of a stage while stomping on grapes and making a crazy noise. Also if anyone wants to make a GIF where sunglasses descend on me in that pic and make the sign say GEEZ WITH IT I wouldn’t be mad.

What is your action plan now that you are a officially a sign guy?

Guess I better start brainstorming? Although being a one-sign wonder wouldn’t be so bad. I would be okay with being the Baha Men of protest-sign guys.

Anything else we should know?

Just a preemptive “Yes, I voted,” and “No, George Soros is not paying me.”The March 2013 death of Hugo Chávez has unleashed chaos in Venezuela, with government officials and citizens alike struggling to come to grips with the uncertainties of the country’s political future. Currents of political instability have increased steadily since news of Chávez’s illness became public. But the political icon’s death and the recent election of his heir and VP, Nicolás Maduro (who won by a margin of less than two percentage points) have further stoked the ideological flames among those opposed to Chavismo.

Since the election, supporters of Maduro's opponent, Henrique Capriles, have staged massive demonstrations to demand a vote recount in Caracas and other major cities, despite efforts by the government and national guard to the block their actions. It has been reported that between six and eight people have died in these protests and several buildings have been set fire by extreme factions of the opposition, though these reports have not been confirmed.

All of these events have had adverse effects on citizen and social media users. In just six weeks since Chávez’s death, two social media users have been arrested on charges of posting information and images deemed “destabilizing” to the country. On election day, the Internet was briefly shut down throughout most of the country. And today, social network users are facing threats to their employment status, as authorities search profiles for signs of political affiliation that have, in several cases, resulted in users losing their jobs.

The fourteen-year mandate of President Chávez was marked by controversy and divergence of views between different sectors within and outside the country. The framework of a so-called “ideological battle,” has pitted government supporters and critics against one another, though it shows few signs of real, critical debate. As the battle has been waged in traditional media and on the streets, it also has moved to social networks.

In many ways, the use of social networks was a strong marker of the unique brand of socialism cultivated by Hugo Chávez. Although traditional and digital media alike were instrumental tools for his administration, Chávez was especially known for his use of Twitter (@ChavezCandanga) as a platform for political communication. Diosdado Cabello, one of Chávez’s aides, once commented on the power of the medium in the ideological battle:

The opposition believes itself to be the owner of social networking. They think Twitter and Facebook is theirs. We are fighting the battle and we are 7 million militants who will have Twitter.

Cabello noted that they would “assault social networks to counter the views expressed by [their] opponents.” Many government officials now have Twitter accounts and use them to communicate important information to citizens. Different political parties, candidates and NGOs also use Twitter to interact with followers. This has proven effective in Venezuela, which has high numbers of social network users relative to its neighbors, and globally ranks thirteenth for its number of Twitter users.

In April 2010, the government announced the creation of the “communicational guerrilla“, a group of citizens employed to “fight the ideological battle” in independent and mainstream media and on the Internet. So today, the battle is being fought in hashtags: keyword positioning in support of and against the government is a constant, and there are, on both sides, users dedicated to monitoring specific keywords to respond, often aggressively, to those expressing controversial opinions.

It is widely believed that the Chávez government was characterized by an “excessive” allowance of freedom of expression. Yet during the last six years of his tenure, at least five social network users were arrested, all under similar circumstances: Users with little or no influence on social networks were taken into custody for making politically controversial comments (usually on Twitter) and were charged with “spreading rumors” that caused “instability of the country.” They were held for short detentions, and then released on parole. Since Chávez’s death, there have been two similar arrests.

Curiously, none of these detentions has been based on the Law of Social Responsibility and its applications for electronic media. The law covers a wide range of online content:

[The law prohibits content that] uses anonymity, encourages and promotes hatred and intolerance for religious, political, gender, racism or xenophobic reasons; incites or promotes and/or justify the crime, constitutes war propaganda, promotes anxiety in the citizenry or alter public order; disowns legitimately constituted authorities; induces murder, incites or encourages disobedience of the existing law, or promotes, justifies or incites public disorder.

Passed by executive order and enacted in 2010, the law has not been applied in court thus far. The law also holds Internet Service Providers liable for such content. ISPs can face fines of “up to 4% of their gross income from fiscal year prior to the infringement.” But there is no evidence that the law is being applied; users report that censored websites are only being blocked by government-run ISP CANTV, but not by privately-owned providers.

A different formula has been used to push back against influential online critics of the government and party. A collective user group known as N33, allegedly comprised of government-supporter hackers (and by some accounts, promoted and financed directly by the government), has a long history of hacking into Twitter, Facebook and email accounts of journalists, activists, politicians, and other high profile figures from the opposition. The group has also been known to issue threats via electronic means and telephone to other well-known figures of digital activism.

During the country’s brief presidential campaign cycle this April, both candidates actively used social media and other online platforms, including a web TV channel, to promote their candidacy. Citizen journalists have played a key role in counter balancing the information transmitted through traditional channels. They have uncovered abuses and acts of violence in different parts of the country and established alternate spaces for public opinion.

Initiatives like UstedAbuso (You Abused) allowed users to report on violations of electoral law during the campaign. Personal accounts like that of Eugenio Martinez (@puzkas), a journalist specializing in electoral coverage, became essential to following the pulse of the country in recent months. Luis Carlos Diaz and Naky Soto created a “live feed” on YouTube (called simply “The Hangout“), where they broadcast several nights a week to discuss the political landscape. The channel has received nearly half a million views.

On election day, government power over telecommunications networks was brought to bear in a way that Venezuelans had never seen before: for somewhere between three and twenty minutes late in the day, nearly all Internet connections in the country were blocked. This was relatively easy. In 2010, the government attempted to create a single network access point through state-owned telecommunications company CANTV, which provides over 90% of Internet access in the country. The government’s nearly complete acquisition of CANTV has made it easier for authorities to censor websites deemed illegal (such as quelacreo.com or dollar.nu). When Internet access was blocked for all CANTV subscribersat the end of election day on April 14, the Ministry of Telecommunications explained that authorities blocked the network in an effort to “avoid hacks” to the website of the National Electoral Council. This website was also made ​​inaccessible from foreign IPs for the same reason.

Since election day, user profiles on social networks have begun to serve a new purpose: they are helping authorities to identify user political affiliations in order to “debug” public service and private enterprise. Countless complaints of public employees who have lost their jobs after authorities scanned their social network profiles and discovered their political support for the opposition. This has also happened to private sector employees, though for the opposite reasons. Citizens call this the “resurrection” of the Tascon List, an instrument used in order to filter out those citizens who had signed in 2004 in favor of a recall referendum against President Chávez, and to prevent their recruitment in the public service, which was allegedly eliminated by Chávez himself in 2005 [es].

The beginning of Nicolás Maduro's presidential term has been marked by a strong wave of protests, both online and offline, and rampant rumors and false information transmitted over the Internet. Maduro, Chávez's successor says he plans to follow in his predecessor’s footsteps in media strategy. He has created a Twitter account (@ NicolasMaduro, which was hacked by a Peruvian collective on election day) and has announced that his government will be “firm-handed” in media policy implementation. It remains to be seen whether this policy will affect how Venezuelan citizens make use of the Internet.CNN reported Wednesday afternoon that the Defense Department is, for the first time, considering making a proposal to send conventional American combat troops into northern Syria to fight ISIS. The network's Barbara Starr said that the Pentagon’s considerations were prompted by President Trump’s demand for the drafting of a plan to defeat ISIS by the end of February. The proposal has not yet been sent to Trump.

As on all issues, Trump has made conflicting statements on how he would like to tackle ISIS in Syria. In March 2016, he said during a debate that he would listen to the recommendations of "the generals" who he said had recommended 20,000 to 30,000 American troops on the ground. In July of the same year, though, he said he'd send "very few" troops into the fight. The U.S. has around 500 troops, tasked largely with assisting the Syrian opposition, in the country as of December.As of this writing, "brown noser" stands. As does a maybe-mitigating piece of Ryan-as-high-schooler trivia: that he was also voted prom king . But that equilibrium could change, again, in an instant.

But it's also a tension that will play out, repeatedly, in the most comprehensive narrative we have about Paul Ryan as a person and a politician and a policy-maker: his Wikipedia page . Late last night, Politico reports -- just as news of the Ryan choice leaked in the political press -- the first substantial edit to that page removed an extant "brown noser" mention:

In high school, Paul Ryan's classmates voted him as his class's "biggest 'brown noser.'" This little tidbit is a source of delight for political opponents of the Wisconsin representative-turned-Romney-running mate; to his supporters, in general, it's an irrelevant piece of youthful trivia.

Now that Ryan's confirmed, a flurry of such Wikipedia edits is to be expected as campaign operatives both professional and amateur try to define Paul Ryan through their preferred prisms. But today! Today is the glory day for the Paul Ryan Wikipedia page. It'll get tons of attention. It'll be totally popular. It'll be, in its way, prom king. Take the page's previous edit tally: On August 8, the Ryan entry saw just over 30 revisions. On August 9, it saw just under 30. Yesterday, it saw just 10. Today, however -- early on a Saturday morning, East Coast time -- it's already received hundreds of revisions. And the official news of the Ryan selection, of course, is just over an hour old.

Some of those edits, in different circumstances, might have been made much earlier. Traditionally -- which is to say, in the past two cycles -- the precarious stretch of time between Veepstakes and Veep Announcement would find campaign staffers cleaning up their choice's Wikipedia presence, ensuring that "the sum of all knowledge" is adequately celebratory of that choice.

As Micah Sifry recently noted:

Sarah Palin's Wikipedia page was updated at least 68 times the day before John McCain announced her selection, with another 54 changes made in the five previous days previous. Tim Pawlenty, another leading contender for McCain's favor, had 54 edits on August 28th, with just 12 in the five previous days. By contrast, the other likely picks -- Romney, Kay Bailey Hutchison -- saw far fewer changes.

This might have meant that Wikipedia's edit page would have made a good resource for campaign reporters and curious citizens who wanted to get early news of Romney's running mate choice. (And who didn't count a message from the "Mitt's VP" smartphone app as "early news.") But Wikipedia made all that edit-gaming a moot point. After Stephen Colbert mentioned the Sifry's edit edict in Tuesday night's show -- recommending that people "go on Wikipedia, and make as many edits as possible to your favorite VP contender!" -- Wikipedia locked down the pages of some of the most talked-about VP contenders. As Sifry put it: Game over.

Now, though, as one of those contenders has been confirmed as a candidate, the pages are unlocked again -- and ready to host debates about biographical details and their epistemological relevance. Ryan's Wikipedia page, like so many before it, will be a place of debate and dissent and derision. But it will also be a place where people can come together to discuss information and policy and the intersection between the two -- a town square for the digital age.Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images

Here are some restaurant etiquette rules in sushi and Japanese kitchens.

Say “good morning” at the beginning of the shift. No matter what time of the day your shift starts, you always greet by saying “ohayo gozai masu,” good morning in Japanese. This is common practice at restaurants in Japan, as well as in the entertainment industry. In the beginning, I felt weird saying “good morning” at 3 p.m., and after a while, I got used to it, and it just became natural. Why and when this rule started is unclear, though, some say the word “ohayo” signifies the beginning.

Arrive at least 10 to 15 minutes before your shift time. If your shift starts at 10 a.m., you are expected to be ready, fully dressed in your uniform, have all your knives and tools out, finished going to the bathroom, and start working at 10 a.m. sharp. Working in a kitchen is a battle against time. There is no room to sit around and spend time doing things you could have done before your shift. Every second counts. This leads to the third rule ...

Never sharpen your knife during your shift. Working in a kitchen is like going to a battle, and your knife is one of the most important weapons, like a gun to a soldier. How can you fight when your weapon is not ready? In a battlefield, that is a matter of life and death. In a kitchen, a dull knife means you are sacrificing the overall quality of the dishes and not performing at your optimum level, a sign other chefs see as a lack of discipline. Taking care of your tools is an important part and fundamental practice among all Japanese chefs. As such, you should sharpen your knife before or after—and never during—your shift. Also, you are expected to have your own sharpening stone(s) because of wear and tear from the usage, which greatly affects the end result.

There are some secret words among sushi chefs. Perhaps the need arose from as a courtesy to customers, and it may be that the Japanese culture is more about hiding than revealing. Sushi chefs have developed some secret words only used at a sushi bar. The word “aniki” (older brother) refers to older ingredients, and “otõto” (younger brother) means fresher ingredients. Be assured that aniki does not mean “old, bad, and not servable.” It’s older compared with other “fresh” fish.

Remove your apron upon entering the bathroom. As a gesture for cleanliness and hygiene, a Japanese chef is taught to remove his apron when entering the bathroom, either leaving it in the kitchen or some specified location away from the customers’ view, nicely folded, like a perfectly executed origami.Vice Admiral Robert Harward has rejected President Trump’s offer to be the new national security adviser, CBS News’ Major Garrett reports.

Sources close to the situation told Garrett Harward and the administration had a dispute over staffing the security council.

Two sources close to the situation confirm Harward demanded his own team, and the White House resisted.

Specifically, Mr. Trump told Deputy National Security Adviser K. T. McFarland that she could retain her post, even after the ouster of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Harward refused to keep McFarland as his deputy, and after a day of negotiations over this and other staffing matters, Harward declined to serve as Flynn’s replacement.

Harward, a 60-year-old former Navy SEAL, served as deputy commander of U.S. Central Command under now-Defense Secretary James Mattis. He previously served as deputy commanding general for operations of Joint Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.

Harward has also commanded troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan for six years after the 9/11 attacks. Under President George W. Bush, he served on the National Security Council as director of strategy and policy for the office of combating terrorism.

Flynn resigned from the post amid questions about his contacts with Russian officials.

The president announced early Friday via Twitter that retired Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg was now in the running to replace Flynn, along with “three others” that he could tap for the National Security Adviser post.

General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

Law enforcement sources confirmed earlier this week that FBI agents had interviewed former national security adviser Michael Flynn last month. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn’s security clearance has been suspended as investigators look into his ties to Russian officials.

At a press conference Thursday, Trump defended by attacking the press and members of the intelligence community for the “illegal process” of leaking information.

“Mike Flynn is a fine person,” he said. “He was just doing his job...I don’t think he did anything wrong.”

“He didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts and then he didn’t remember,” Trump said of Flynn, saying that was why he asked for Flynn’s resignation.

The real problem, Mr. Trump charged, was that “classified information that was given illegally.”Last Updated: October 19, 2015.

It is going to be practically impossible for Donald Trump to take office next Friday and stay on the right side of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause without divesting and placing his businesses in a blind trust. This fact is—with a clutch of dissenters—not in dispute. Ethics experts across the political spectrum have explained carefully what needed to be done to avoid the appearance that the president was benefiting financially from foreign gifts, payments, or favors. But Trump announced this week that he has no intention of creating a blind trust, arguing that voters don’t care about the issue and declaring that he would donate any hotel profits from foreign governments to the Treasury and let his sons manage his business for the duration of his presidency.

Dahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.



At his Wednesday announcement, Trump’s lawyer, Sheri Dillon, disputed claims that he even has any such constitutional obligations: “These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says, paying for a hotel is not a gift or present and has nothing to do with an office. It is not an emolument,” she said. She added that “President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,” meaning, I suppose, that the normal rules don’t apply to rich presidents. (Mitt Romney was willing to divest in 2012, so maybe it’s just that the normal rules don’t apply to Trump).

The director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, immediately dismissed the president-elect’s dramatic nonplan as “meaningless.” He was quoted this week as saying at an unprecedented press conference at the Brookings Institution, “It’s important to understand that the president is now entering the world of public service. He’s going to be asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don’t think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president.”

Most ethics experts have agreed with Shaub that the arrangement announced Wednesday is inadequate to address the conflict rules. Trump’s expectation and hope seems to be that—since the only fix for an Emoluments Clause violation is impeachment—Republicans will do as Trump has instructed and stop caring and that Democrats won’t have the nerve to raise the point that the president will—every day after next Friday—be violating the Constitution in a way that risks putting him in thrall to foreign powers. Republicans seem happy to oblige.

Indeed, to the extent that the GOP has a new mantra it’s that violations of ethics rules are not legal problems but political ones. That is code for the proposition that so long as Trump and the GOP are in alignment about what is legal or unconstitutional, there will be no such thing as illegal or unconstitutional anymore.

Of course, Republicans could have left it at that. But Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, has decided that not only are blatant ethics and constitutional violations now OK but also that criticizing blatant ethics and constitutional violations is not OK.

Of course, there is no shaming Jason Chaffetz.

On Thursday, Chaffetz opted to go full Salem on the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, attacking Shaub for having done his job. The Republican threatened to subpoena Shaub if he refuses to participate in an official transcribed behind-closed doors interview. The calculus here seems to be that if nobody sees this crooked behavior by supposed ethics guardians like Chaffetz, then it didn’t happen.

OGE, set up post-Watergate, is nonpartisan and advises executive branch officials on avoiding conflicts. Shaub’s five-year term expires in January 2018.

Chaffetz demanded in a letter that he appear before lawmakers in the aforementioned closed-door, transcribed interview, to answer questions in a deposition-style setting. Richard Painter, who served as the ethics lawyer for George W. Bush, told the New York Times that this was “political retaliation” by Republicans against nonpartisan ethics officers for doing their basic duty.

This comes just weeks after a massive public outcry led House Republicans to reverse an attempt to gut their own watchdog, the Office of Congressional Ethics. The attack on OGE has happened with a similar stealth move, accompanied by threats and bullying. Among other things, Chaffetz’s letter objects to a series of tweets by the OGE under Shaub’s direction in November. In the tweets, Shaub was sarcastically congratulating Trump for agreeing to divest from his business, which Trump has not done and will not be doing.

In an interview with me on Friday, Norm Eisen—who led ethics initiatives during President Obama’s first term—agreed with Painter’s assessment that this is simply retaliation:

Democrats and Republicans alike, Richard Painter and myself included, are outraged by the chairman’s demand for a closed, Star Chamber–style interrogation of Director Shaub simply because he said exactly what bipartisan experts agree upon: that Trump’s proposed conflicts solution is woefully inadequate. An even more chilling aspect of the chairman’s letter is the not-so-veiled threat to cut OGE’s funding. All of this is merely the latest salvo in all-out attack on ethics oversight. The effort to shut down OCE, the four [Cabinet] nominees who had no ethics vetting who the majority tried to ram through confirmation hearings, Trump’s flouting precedent and the Constitution in his own [conflicts of interest] plan, and now this bullying of Shaub and threat to close OGE.

“It’s open season on ethics in D.C.,” Eisen added.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement Friday morning that “the Oversight Committee is supposed to protect whistleblowers and independent government watchdogs like the Office of Government Ethics instead of retaliating against them for political reasons.” In a letter to Chaffetz, Cummings called for a public hearing with Shaub as the main witness, as opposed to the closed-door meeting Chaffetz is seeking.

But of course, there is no shaming Chaffetz, the guy who announced that he could never again look his daughter in the eye if he endorsed Trump in October, subsequently promised to vote for Trump, and now feels the need to carry Trump’s top secret manila folders around.

Eisen emphasized to me that OGE is not a partisan office and that for Republicans to turn this into a partisan fight would carry risks:

Walt is a talented, nonpartisan, career professional and he has been applying the same fair treatment to the Trump nominees he did to the Obama ones. Indeed, he praised [secretary of state nominee Rex] Tillerson and [senior adviser appointee and Trump son-in-law Jared] Kushner in his speech. He has cleared over 50 percent of the Trump [Cabinet] nominees who have presented paperwork at this point, versus 20 percent at this point in the Obama transition. He worked beautifully with Richard Painter and others in the Bush years, just as the Republican director of the office, Ric Cusick, worked beautifully with me when we came in.Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler have teamed up to run The House, a new studio comedy from first-time director Andrew J. Cohen (best known for co-writing the Neighbors franchise). The film centers on Will and Kate, parents of a college-bound high school graduate who start an underground casino in their basement to fund the tuition bill they secretly cannot afford. And, as these movies tend to go, things get a little wild.

The pairing of Ferrell and Poehler, who outside of Tina Fey projects Baby Mama and Sisters has yet to lead a studio film, appears inspired here, as does the supporting cast. Aboard The House as part of the impressive assembled ensemble are Jason Mantzoukas (Sleeping With Other People), Cedric Yarbrough (Speechless), Rob Huebel (Transparent), Allison Tolman (Fargo), Michaela Watkins (Casual), Lennon Parham (Playing House), Steve Zissis (Togetherness), and, perhaps most notably, Jeremy Renner. Even if Cohen’s transition to directing doesn’t exactly pan out, there might be enough talent here to make The House a worthwhile stopover anyway.(CNN) North Korea says it has successfully completed the launch of a new ballistic missile, according to state media.

The Pukguksong-2, previously unpublicized part of its arsenal which North Korean state media described as a medium long-range ballistic missile, was test fired on Sunday under the supervision of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, KCNA.

Kim was present at the site and personally gave the order for the launch, which was the first missile test by Pyongyang since US President Donald Trump took office, KCNA reported.

The agency described the missile as a "Korean style new type strategic weapon system."

South Korea and the United States confirmed the launch Sunday.

A US official said the missile traveled 500 kilometers (310 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, and that it was launched from North Pyongan province.

Intermediate-range ballistic missiles typically travel from 3,000 to 5,500 kilometers (1,864 to 3,417 miles).

The Pukguksong-2 is believed to have used a solid-fuel propelled engine which enables faster launch and increases the mobility of the launch process, according to a spokesman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman.

The Joint Chiefs also believe that Pyongyang employed a cold-launching system, in which the missile is lifted off the ground using pressure and then ignited mid-flight, as opposed to igniting it on the ground -- which is said to be less stable, the spokesman said.

This photo from North Korean state media shows the firing of the Pukguksong-2 on Sunday. The split image appears to show the cold-launching system in effect.

Emergency meetings

The United Nations Security Council said it plans to hold consultations on an "urgent basis" Monday afternoon regarding North Korea, according to the US Mission to the United Nations. The meeting was requested by the United States, South Korea and Japan -- whose Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, was visiting President Trump in the United States when the launch occurred.

"North Korea's most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable. North Korea must fully comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions," Abe told a news conference at Palm Beach, Florida.

North Korea is prohibited from carrying out ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions aimed in part at curbing the country's development of nuclear weapons.

Trump spoke after Abe and gave a one-sentence statement: "I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%."

Japan's chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the fact the launch came as Abe met with Trump made it "a clear provocation to Japan and the region."

Tokyo has already lodged protests against North Korea via its embassy in Beijing, he said.

'Punitive actions'

The KCNA said the missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and capable of "evading interception." The report by KCNA said Kim "expressed great satisfaction over the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means which adds to the tremendous might of the country."

They ruled out the possibility that it was a longer-range intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM -- which are usually designed to carry nuclear warheads -- based on the flight distance.

KCNA said the launch "was conducted by the high-angle launching method instead of firing range, taking the security of the neighboring countries into consideration."

Acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo-ahn said: "The South Korean government and the international community are working together to take punitive actions appropriate for this launch."

Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, spoke to his South Korean counterpart Kim Kwan Jin, according to the South Korean President's office. They condemned the launch and agreed "to seek all possible options" to deter Pyongyang in the future.

China, North Korea's neighbor and most important strategic partner, has not yet commented on the launch.

North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2016 and a satellite launch that experts said was a sign it has cleared significant hurdles toward ICBM technology. But until Sunday, it hadn't tested a ballistic missile since October 20.

Step toward missile that can hit US?

In January, US and South Korean officials told CNN that North Korea might be readying two ICBMs for a test launch in the near future, though some analysts dispute how close Pyongang actually is to testing such a missile.

Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said Sunday's test would help the North Koreans improve their missile technology, and could help in their development of an ICBM.

"That's the goal of the North Korean politicians," he said.

"This intermediate ballistic missile is certainly dangerous. It has a greater range than some of the Musudan missiles that they have been testing prior to that. And it's not only a concern for the United States to hit the mainland, but it also has concerns for all of our Asia partners."

Pyongyang has been steadily working to improve its missile and weapons capability, conducting a fifth nuclear test in September.

Many experts think North Korea is far off from being able to put a nuclear warhead on its missiles, which would make it a global threat. Still, US commanders say they need to be prepared for the possibility.I recently updated my book chapter, A Brief History of Information Privacy Law, which appears in the new edition of PLI’s Proskauer on Privacy.

SaveNebraska Agrees to Change Birth Certificates to Include Same-Sex Parents

Although officials aren't specifying how they will update the documents, they confirm a process to include both parents regardless of gender is under way.

A quiet change is in the works behind the scenes at the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which will soon list the names of both same-sex spouses on their children's birth certificates, reported the Associated Press.

State attorneys who are contesting a lawsuit by several same-sex couples who challenged Nebraska's marriage ban revealed the change in court documents filed Tuesday. The U.S. Supreme Court decided to make marriage equality the law of the land on June 26, but the American Civil Liberties Union is supporting the couples in their fight to force a Nebraska judge to officially strike down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage.

HHS spokeswoman Leah Bucco-White told the AP the state agency has begun the process to list both a child's biological parent and the parent's same-sex spouse on the child's birth certificate. However, for now she said HHS is sticking with the state's current birth certificate form, which does not include a place for same-sex spouses.

There is reason for concern, said ACLU Nebraska legal director Amy Miller. She said her office has received calls from family attorneys in the last two weeks who were told birth certificates issued to same-sex parents will list the nonbiological parent as "friend."

Bucco-White denied that the term "friend" would be listed on the form, but she declined to say how it might be worded.Ebolyukh/Thinkstock

Helena, Montana, does not often make global headlines, but in 2003 the small capital city became known for briefly achieving one of the most astounding public health triumphs ever recorded. In June of the previous year, Helena had implemented a comprehensive smoking ban in its workplaces, bars, restaurants, and casinos. In the first six months of the ban, the rate of heart attacks in the city plummeted by nearly 60 percent. Just as remarkably, when a judge struck down the smoking ban in November of that year, the rate of heart attacks shot right back up to its previous level.

For three anti-smoking advocates—local physicians Richard Sargent and Robert Shepard, and activist and researcher Stanton Glantz from the University of California at San Francisco—this sudden drop in heart attacks was proof that smoking bans usher in extraordinary benefits for public health. “This striking finding suggests that protecting people from the toxins in secondhand smoke not only makes life more pleasant; it immediately starts saving lives,” said Glantz in a press release sent out by UCSF.

Newspapers ran with the story, credulously assuming that the correlation had been truly caused by the smoking ban. “The bottom line of Helena’s plummeting, then soaring, heart attack rate is painfully obvious,” warned an op-ed in the New York Times. “Secondhand smoke kills.” The BBC projected that “[banning] smoking in public places could prevent hundreds of deaths from heart disease.” Wire services carried the result around the globe, and even the conservative Wall Street Journal cited the result as an important finding.

In the early 2000s, as jurisdictions across the country fought over expanding smoking bans to bars and restaurants, anti-smoking advocates seized on the Helena study and related research showing that secondhand smoke exposure can affect coronary functions to promote fear of secondhand smoke. Groups across the country stated that “even half an hour of secondhand smoke exposure causes heart damage similar to that of habitual smokers.” Not to be outdone, the Association for Nonsmokers in Minnesota wrote in a press release that just 30 seconds of exposure could “make coronary artery function of non-smokers indistinguishable from smokers.” The message to nonsmokers was clear: The briefest exposure to secondhand smoke can kill you.

A decade later, comprehensive smoking bans have proliferated globally. And now that the evidence has had time to accumulate, it’s also become clear that the extravagant promises made by anti-smoking groups—that implementing bans would bring about extraordinary improvements in cardiac health—never materialized. Newer, better studies with much larger sample sizes have found little to no correlation between smoking bans and short-term incidence of heart attacks, and certainly nothing remotely close to the 60 percent reduction that was claimed in Helena. The updated science debunks the alarmist fantasies that were used to sell smoking bans to the public, allowing for a more sober analysis suggesting that current restrictions on smoking are extreme from a risk-reduction standpoint.

By the time the Helena study was published in the British Medical Journal, the authors had lowered the observed reduction in heart attacks from 60 percent to 40 percent; still an impressive figure but a substantial drop from the claim they had prematurely publicized to press worldwide. Immediate responses to the paper from other scientists were harshly critical, noting the small size of the Helena population—about 68,000 residents at the time—and the medical implausibility of achieving such a massive effect in such a short period. It was impossible to know with certainty whether the drop was caused by the ban or was simply due to chance.

Nonetheless, the Helena paper spawned a wave of studies seeking to replicate the finding. Research observing similar reductions followed in places such as Pueblo, Colorado; Bowling Green, Ohio; and Monroe County, Indiana. One characteristic shared by these places was their low populations and correspondingly small sample sizes: The last of these studies covered only 22 heart attacks among nonsmokers over the course of nearly four years.

Updated science debunks the alarmist fantasies that were used to sell smoking bans to the public, allowing for a more sober analysis.

When studies sampling larger populations finally appeared, the reported declines in heart attacks began to shrink. A study of the Piedmont region of Italy found a much lower decline of 11 percent, though curiously only for residents under 60 years of age. England, which implemented a smoking ban nationwide, presented the first opportunity to study the matter on a national scale. Researchers there credited the ban with a heart attack reduction of just over 2 percent nationwide.

Critics noted that the rate of heart attacks in England had also been falling in the years prior to the ban and that the reason for the decline was still not clear. Regardless, the data there made it obvious that the miraculous reductions claimed in smaller studies were unrealistically high. Even so, despite acknowledging the wide variation in findings and the admitted methodological limitations of the studies, a 2009 meta-analysis conducted by the Institute of Medicine concluded that the impact of smoking bans on short-term heart attack rates was real and substantial: “Even a small amount of exposure to secondhand smoke… can cause a heart attack,” one member of the IOM panel informed the New York Times, urging that “smoking bans need to be put in place as quickly as possible.”

This report had, however, omitted one of the largest studies of secondhand smoke and heart attacks conducted to date. A 2008 study covering the entire country of New Zealand—a population smaller than England’s, but bigger than the American towns previously studied—found no significant effects on heart attacks or unstable angina in the year following implementation of a smoking ban; hospitalizations for the former had actually increased.

Contradictory research continued to come in. A clever study led by researchers at RAND Corp. in 2010 tested the possibility that the large reductions identified in small communities were due to chance. They assembled a massive data set that allowed them to essentially replicate studies like those in Helena, Pueblo, and Bowling Green, but on an unprecedented scale. Whereas those studies had compared just one small community to another, the RAND paper compared all possible pairings of communities affected by smoking bans to all possible controls, for a total of more than 15,000 pairings. They stratified results by age in case there were differential effects on the young, working age adults, or the elderly. And in an improvement on most other studies, they also controlled for existing trends in the rate of heart attacks.

The study found no statistically significant decrease in heart attacks among any age group. The data also suggested that fluctuations in heart attack rates were common, indicating that comparisons of small communities would frequently turn up dramatic reductions due purely to chance; large increases in heart attacks happened about as often. This explained the headline-grabbing dramatic results in places like Helena or Monroe County that eluded replication in larger jurisdictions. The conclusion of the study was blunt: “We find no evidence that legislated U.S. smoking bans were associated with short-term reductions in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction or other diseases in the elderly, children or working age adults.”

A 2012 study of six American states that had instituted smoking bans came to a similar conclusion. So did a 2014 study, which is notable for being co-authored by some of the same researchers who had previously published papers suggesting that the Colorado towns of Pueblo and Greeley had experienced reduced rates of heart attacks after implementing smoking bans. When Colorado enacted a statewide ban, the authors had an opportunity to see if their earlier results could be duplicated across the larger population of nearly 5 million people. No effect appeared. As an additional test, they re-examined the data excluding 11 jurisdictions that had already implemented comprehensive smoking bans: The statewide ban still showed no effect.

In the paper’s admirably honest commentary, the authors reflected on the reasons that earlier studies, including their own, had overstated the impact of smoking bans. The first is that small sample sizes allowed random variances in data to be mistaken for real effects. The second is that most previous studies failed to account for existing downward trends in the rate of heart attacks. And the third is publication bias: Since no one believes that smoking bans increase heart attacks, few would bother submitting or publishing studies that show a positive correlation or null effect. Thus the published record is likely unintentionally biased toward showing a larger effect than truly exists.

Where heart attacks did decline, it may not have even been because of secondhand smoke reductions.

The medical reasoning behind why secondhand smoke would cause heart attacks posited that short-term exposure reduces blood flow, increases platelet aggregation, and causes endothelial dysfunction—all of which could increase the risk of heart attack. But looking at the most well-conducted research suggests that the actual impact is not as significant as originally feared. And where heart attacks did decline, it may not have even been because of secondhand smoke reductions: A new paper published in August 2016 considered other factors that may have been overlooked. Drawing on data from 28 states from 2001–2008, lead author Vivian Ho, an economist at Rice University, compared rates of hospitalization for heart attacks in areas with and without smoking bans.

Following the methodology of previous studies, she and her coauthors found a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations for heart attacks and congestive heart failure following implementation of a smoking ban (though only among people older than 65). But when they went a step further, adjusting the analysis with county-by-county health data addressing variables such as access to hospitals and increases in cigarette taxes, the effect of the smoking bans disappeared. Ho and her co-authors suggest that modest improvements in cardiac health that were previously credited to smoking bans may actually be caused by differentials in access to medical care and people smoking less when cigarette taxes increase (smoking cigarettes does have a proven negative effect on cardiac health).

In the recent literature, the most notable study finding a correlation between smoking bans and rates of heart attack is a 2012 paper in Health Affairs. It is probably the strongest of the studies documenting a reduction, though it applies only to senior populations and did not make the adjustment for tobacco taxes noted above. Even those sympathetic to the claim that bans reduce heart attacks have had to concede that the larger the population studied, the smaller the alleged effect. A 2013 meta-analysis noted that “studies with smaller population in the United States usually reported larger reductions … while larger studies reported relatively modest reductions.” Or, to state things more accurately, the largest studies often report no reduction at all.

In a post on the blog he authors from the University of California San Francisco, Stanton Glantz disputes the finding in Vivian Ho’s recent paper, suggesting use of a different statistical model to make the calculation. But the reductions promised by Glantz and other smoking ban advocates were so massive that they ought to be evident under any plausible model. That in the time since the alleged Helena Miracle they have gone from claiming a 60 percent reduction in heart attacks to debating whether effects are illusory or just too small to be reliably detected says a lot about how far expectations have been lowered. As they say in the old cigarette ads, “You’ve come a long way, baby!”

Anti-smoking advocates often argue as if the existence of any effect on health, no matter how small, justifies any smoking ban no matter how extensive. If the size and certainty of alleged health risks are irrelevant, then of course the case for smoking bans is easy to make: Most nonsmokers find smoking inconvenient and have little regard for the smoking minority’s preferences. Setting such a low bar provides a convenient excuse for expanding the boundaries of the smoke-free world ever outward. The relevant question, however, should not be merely whether there are any dangers from secondhand smoke but also how big they are. If the alarmist claims made by anti-smoking groups were true, we’d be justified in avoiding secondhand smoke as if it were the plague. But we know now that those claims were exaggerated, so it’s worth asking whether contemporary bans have gone too far.

Rates of heart attack are not the only possible negative of secondhand smoke exposure, although most estimates consider improvements in coronary health to be the number one benefit of smoking bans. There are also potential impacts on respiratory health, and of course lung cancer, although the impact secondhand smoke exposure has on one’s risk of lung cancer is likely far lower than many would expect. The 2006 Surgeon General’s Report, the most definitive treatment of the topic, estimates the lung cancer risk of chronically exposed nonsmokers at just 1.12–1.43 times that of people without frequent exposure. (By comparison, smokers themselves take on a risk more than 12 times higher than that of nonsmokers.)

We know now that those claims were exaggerated, so it’s worth asking if contemporary bans have gone too far.

Now that’s not nothing, but other recent research may be even more surprising. “No clear link between passive smoking and lung cancer,” read a 2013 headline in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, hardly a pro-tobacco publication. That was a report on a cohort study tracking 76,000 women that failed to detect a link between the disease and secondhand smoke. The finding comports with existing literature suggesting that the effect is borderline and concentrated on long-term, high levels of exposure.

Despite the mounting evidence that transient exposure to secondhand smoke is more an annoyance than a mortal threat, smoking bans have become widespread and politically entrenched. According to the latest update from Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, which publishes quarterly reports on anti-smoking laws, more than 80 percent of the American population now lives under smoking bans covering workplaces, restaurants, or bars. An additional 3,400 jurisdictions ban smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, and stadiums. More than 400 cities and counties restrict smoking while dining outdoors. More than 1,700 college campuses are completely smoke-free. Nearly 600 jurisdictions include e-cigarettes under their smoke-free laws. Some jurisdictions make limited allowance for places such as cigar bars and hookah lounges, while in others these are completely forbidden or limited to businesses grandfathered in before ordinances took effect.

The cost of these policies falls almost entirely on people who smoke, an increasingly put-upon minority of the population. Rarely are their preferences consulted. An exception is a perceptive paper published in the journal Sociology of Health and Illness evocatively titled “Every Space is Claimed.” The paper stands out for the empathy with which its authors approach smokers affected by smoking bans. They note that most tobacco research ignores the perspective of actual smokers and that the lack of interest in their experiences “speaks to the ways in which tobacco research is increasingly expected to further the goals of tobacco control.”

The paper draws on interviews with a diverse selection of smokers in Vancouver, British Columbia. One consistent theme that emerges is that smokers increasingly find their habit viewed as on a par with use of illicit drugs. Smokers also report that judgments against them cut deeper than their outward behavior, extending to their identity as human beings. “Even if you can’t articulate it you probably intuitively feel it in the same way that if you’re black or a woman and you’re being discriminated against,” one subject told his interviewers. “Like even if you can’t articulate it or you certainly can’t prove it or you’d be at the Human Rights Commission, but you kind of know it’s happening.”

To some anti-smoking advocates, that stigmatization is useful if it encourages people to quit. The authors of this paper are skeptical, noting that such stigmatization could instead lead to feelings of powerlessness. They conclude:

Participants in our study highlighted the growing restrictions on their ability to smoke and several explicitly recognised that legislative measures went well beyond the goal of protecting non-smokers from exposure to the effects of secondhand smoke and that the right to smoke altogether was being steadily eroded. Thus, while many participants expressed the view that smoking restrictions themselves were not intrinsically problematic, they emphasised that tobacco denormalisation had created an environment in which every public space was ‘claimed’ by non-smokers, making it impossible to smoke in public at all without receiving judgement. Importantly, while study participants expressed considerable felt stigma in relation to their smoking, they also recounted numerous instances of overt censure and discrimination.

Smokers’ experiences in Vancouver raise important questions about the value and ethics of denormalisation strategies. Should a liberal state ever be complicit in shaming its citizens?

Early arguments for smoking bans at least paid lip service to the idea that restrictions were necessary to protect unwilling bystanders’ health. But as bans have grown ever more intrusive even as the case for expanding them has withered, that justification has been revealed as a polite fiction by which nonsmokers shunted smokers to the fringes of society. It was never just about saving lives.

When the Helena study and its heirs were originally published, a few scientists noted that the results were wildly implausible and the methodologies deeply flawed. So did a handful of journalists, including Jacob Sullum writing for Reason (to which I am also a contributor) and Christopher Snowdon in England. Yet their criticism was generally ignored. Studies reporting miraculous declines in heart attacks made global headlines; when better studies came along contradicting those results, they barely registered a blip in the media. As Jonathan Swift said in an apt aphorism, “Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it.” Too late to help smokers banished from public life.

There were good reasons from the beginning to doubt that smoking bans could really deliver the promised results, but anti-smoking advocacy groups eagerly embraced alarmism to shape public perception. Today’s tobacco control movement is guided by ideology as much as it is by science, prone to hyping politically convenient studies regardless of their merit and ostracizing detractors.

This has important implications for journalism. As health journalists take on topics such as outdoor smoking bans, discrimination against smokers in employment or adoption, and the ever-evolving regulation of e-cigarettes, they should consider that however well-intentioned the aims of the tobacco control movement are, its willingness to sacrifice the means of good science to the end of restricting behavior calls for skeptical scrutiny.

As for smoking bans, few people are eager to re-litigate the battles of the previous decade. We are unlikely to return to the days of smoking on airplanes, in hospital waiting rooms, or in the aisles of supermarkets. We can acknowledge that the shift in social norms against the presumption that one may light up just about anywhere is on the whole a good thing, even if the means of bringing it about has been more coercive than some of us would prefer. But smoking bans are not an all-or-nothing affair. Policy takes place at the margins and the margins have extended far beyond the goal of protecting people from chronic exposure to high concentrations of secondhand smoke.

To cite just a few recent examples: In Washington, the city council has passed legislation restricting e-cigarettes, which emit vapor, and chewing tobacco, which doesn’t emit anything. In England, health advocates argue for restricting outdoor smoking because children should not so much as see someone lighting up. “Smokers themselves are also contaminated… smokers actually emit toxins,” one Harvard researcher mused to Scientific American in 2009, warning against exposure to invisible “thirdhand smoke” wafting off of smokers’ clothing and hair. Writers at Vox have gone so far as to advocate banning smoking even in private homes. The list could go on endlessly. Is it any wonder smokers feel stigmatized?

While science can inform, though not fully determine, the boundaries of where people are allowed to smoke, the debunking of the previous decade’s heart miracles should provide some grounds for humility. It may be neither feasible nor desirable to set back the clock and permit smoking everywhere, but laws in a liberal society can accommodate the rights and preferences of smokers and business owners far better than they do now.

So relax those outdoor bans. Let people vape. Allow there to be at least some venues in which consenting adults can gather to light up indoors. Respect for self-ownership demands it. After years of closing doors on smokers, it is time to open a few back up.Joe Raedle/Getty Images

Florida’s attempt to regulate and defund abortion clinics out of existence has officially failed. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle permanently blocked a Florida law that would have prevented the distribution of state or local funds to any organization that provides abortions. (State and federal law already prohibit the use of public funds to finance abortion itself.) Hinkle also enjoined a provision of the law that would have vastly increased record inspection requirements for abortion clinics while offering no additional safety benefits for patients. As part of the order, Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott agreed to forego further litigation, meaning both measures are effectively dead in the water.

Hinkle’s decision is the latest in a series of rulings that proscribe states from cutting funding to women’s health organizations because they support abortion. Under the Supreme Court’s “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine, the government can’t deprive a group of funds simply because it exercises a fundamental right that the government doesn’t like. This punishment through the purse strings violates the group’s free association rights under the First Amendment, as well as its protected liberty interests under the 14th Amendment. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit recently reasoned, state efforts to defund organizations for contracting with abortion providers fit neatly into this doctrine by penalizing a group for its pro-choice associations in a manner that restricts the fundamental right to abortion.

Hinkle arrived at the same conclusion, writing that “a government cannot prohibit indirectly—by withholding otherwise-available public funds—conduct that the government could not constitutionally prohibit directly.” His ruling will prevent Florida from depriving Planned Parenthood of the $500,000 it expected to receive to fund health care screenings, as well as a school dropout prevention program. It’s also a considerable victory for medical privacy: The records inspection provision of the law that Hinkle enjoined would have allowed the state to access thousands of patient records at facilities that provide abortions, easily uncovering details about their HIV status, abortion history, and mental health treatments.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appears to have toned down his unexpectedly stern words on China’s actions in the disputed South China Sea made during his confirmation hearings, an apparently leaked document has shown.

The document, a series of written responses to questions by Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin during Tillerson’s confirmation hearing last month before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was posted to the websites of environmental advocacy groups earlier this month.

The document is authentic, a Foreign Relations Committee spokesman confirmed to The Japan Times on Tuesday.

The new document softened earlier comments by Tillerson in which he appeared to advocate a blockade of Beijing’s man-made islands in the South China Sea.

Analysts said such a move in the contentious waterway would be tantamount to an act of war.

“China cannot be allowed to use its artificial islands to coerce its neighbors or limit freedom of navigation or overflight in the South China Sea,” Tillerson wrote in response to the questions about China’s island-building program. “The United States will uphold freedom of navigation and overflight by continuing to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.”

Beijing reacted angrily to Tillerson’s insinuation that Washington might impose a naval blockade, with state-run media warning that the U.S. might have to “wage a large-scale war” to prevent Chinese access to the islands.

The Pentagon said last year that Beijing has added more than 3,200 acres (1,280 hectares) of land to seven features it occupies in the waters, mainly in the disputed Spratly Islands, giving it long-term “civil-military” outposts from which it can project power.

Recent reports have also pointed to the installation of weaponry on the man-made islets despite a September 2015 pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping not to militarize the outposts. The U.S. has conducted so-called freedom of navigation patrols near the islands, as part of a challenge to China’s territorial claims there.

China denies any intent to restrict freedom of navigation but has objected when the U.S. Navy has sailed close to the islands.

In the new document, Tillerson, who was confirmed by the Senate in a 56-43 vote on Feb. 1, also voiced the need for the United States and its allies to be able to prevent Chinese access to the islets in the event of a “contingency.”

“If a contingency occurs, the United States and its allies and partners must be capable of limiting China’s access to and use of its artificial islands to pose a threat to the United States or its allies and partners,” he wrote.

Tillerson also appeared to advocate for a more robust U.S. policy toward the contested waterway — and the increased risk associated with such a move.

“The United States must be willing to accept risk if it is to deter further destabilizing actions and reassure allies and partners that the United States will stand with them in upholding international rules and norms,” he wrote, adding that he would work with “interagency partners to develop a whole-of-government approach to deter further Chinese coercion and land reclamation” and “challenges to freedom of navigation or overflight” in the waters.

Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Tillerson’s original statement was poorly considered and appeared to emerge from an impulse to be tough in front of the committee.

Although the written answers could not completely neutralize Tillerson’s earlier remarks, Glaser called them “cleverly modified, removing the implication that the U.S. would challenge Chinese access to its artificial islands in peacetime.”

The newly emerged statements could also strike a balance, clearing up what some experts had criticized as amuddled approach to the issue under the Obama administration. “I think the Tillerson testimony is a bull’s-eye for what many have long advocated,” said James Kraska, a professor of oceans law and policy at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island.

“First, his point about limiting access during contingencies is simply the need for sea control, an important element of sea power during conflict,” Kraska said. “It is helpful for a U.S. leader to speak so plainly about the shared interests and equities of the regional states and the United States in maintaining the balance of power.”

Kraska also had words of praise for Tillerson’s “whole-of-government” approach, calling this “sorely needed.”

Tillerson’s answers were also seen as reining in Trump’s unprecedented take on U.S.-Taiwan relations.

In December, Trump broke with decades of diplomatic tradition by accepting a phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in what was believed to be the first time an American president or president-elect had publicly spoken with Taiwan’s leader since official diplomatic ties were switched to Beijing in 1979.

China considers Taiwan a “core interest,” and views the self-ruled island as a renegade province that must be brought back into the fold — by force, if necessary.

Trump has also raised the prospect of using Taiwan as a bargaining chip in Sino-U.S. relations, saying “everything is under negotiation,” including the so-called “One China” policy.

Asked about potential shifts and possible negotiations on “One China,” Tillerson said he backed the policy, adding that he would “continue these policies and work to ensure that the cross-strait military balance remains favorable to peace and stability.”

“I intend to support the One China policy,” Tillerson wrote. “The people of Taiwan are friends of the United States and should not be treated as a bargaining chip. The U.S. commitment to Taiwan is both a legal commitment and a moral imperative.”Story highlights A friend of Harward's said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic

Earlier this week, Trump fired Michael Flynn as national security adviser

(CNN) Ret. Vice Adm. Bob Harward turned down President Donald Trump's offer to be national security adviser Thursday, depriving the administration of a top candidate for a critical foreign policy post days after Trump fired Michael Flynn.

Trump has since named Ret. Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg, who worked under Flynn until the latter was asked to resign, as the acting national security adviser. Asked if there was a candidate for national security adviser in sight, a White House official told CNN, "Not that I'm aware of."

"Since retiring, I have the opportunity to address financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position," Harward said in a statement. "Like all service members understand, and live, this job requires 24 hours a day, 7 days a week focus and commitment to do it right. I currently could not make that commitment. My thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our country's national security concerns. God bless this great country of ours."

A friend of Harward's said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic. Harward called the offer a "s*** sandwich," the friend said.

A Republican official told CNN that Harward made it a condition of taking the job that he could form his own team. In the end, he didn't feel that was the case.

In 2005, Panda Software reported that a new strain of malware was discovered every 12 minutes. In 2016, the cybersecurity company McAfee says it found four every second.

And those were just the strains the companies could detect. For malware—the umbrella term for parasitic software like viruses, worms, and Trojans that infiltrate and interfere with computer functions—hasn’t only proliferated: It’s evolved to better evade detection.

Faced with this tsunami of sophisticated malware, antivirus software like McAfee, once practically synonymous with personal cybersecurity, has struggled to keep pace. In 2014, a senior vice president at Symantec (the company that created McAfee competitor Norton Antivirus) went so far as to publicly say he thought that antivirus software was “dead.” At the time, he estimated that the technology only caught about 45 percent of cyberattacks.

Antivirus software is struggling to keep up because the primary strategy on which it relies—signature detection—is based on the outdated assumption that the malware you saw yesterday will look the same today. Generally speaking, when a cybersecurity company sees a new type of malware, it will analyze and create a detection signature for that specific strain. Like the immune system recognizing a pathogen it has seen before, antivirus software uses these signatures to scan files for known threats. This strategy worked reasonably well when viruses were mostly made by amateur hackers. But in 2003, according to McAfee, we saw the first real for-profit malware and since then, the growth of organized cybercrime has brought forth a series of innovations that allow malware to rapidly change its appearance. If the viruses of the early 2000s were the common cold, sophisticated malware of today is like HIV, able to change its protein coatings to avoid detection.

Subscribe to Futurography!

One of these innovations is a process called “crypting,” which allows a developer to transform the appearance of a piece of malicious code using encryption tools and test it against antivirus software until it is undetectable. Similarly, developers can also use polymorphic code to turn malware into a chameleon, capable of changing its appearance every time it runs. One 2013 analysis found that 82 percent of malware disappears after an hour, and 70 percent of malware only exists once. This short lifespan means just a small percentage of antivirus detection signatures—0.34 percent in one analysis—catch active threats. The rest just hunt ghosts. Though some companies have introduced new strategies to combat these adaptations, they haven’t been enough to fully keep up with fast-moving threats.

Despite its diminishing effectiveness, a startling number of users still use antivirus software as their first, or only, line of defense. According to a 2015 Google study comparing digital practices of security experts and nonexperts, 42 percent of nonexperts said antivirus software was among the most important steps they took protect themselves online. The response topped the list of measures taken by nonexperts, even ahead of “using strong passwords.” But, tellingly, it didn’t even crack the top five among those who work in the cybersecurity field.

This knowledge gap is significant and worrying, because modern malware attacks can be devastating. One type of attack that has grown dramatically in recent years is ransomware, which encrypts one’s files and holds them for ransom. In 2016 alone there were 4,000 ransomware attacks a day, according to IBM. As we store more and more personal information on our computers—home videos, photos, financial information—the cost of infection only grows. So how can the typical user keep up their cyberhealth in a post-antivirus age?

While the staggering progress of malware is frightening, comparing digital threats to infectious diseases provides some context to the risk internet users face. Each day, we all encounter millions of germs. Yet most of us stay healthy most of the time thanks to a combination of our immune system and preventive health measures such as washing our hands, exercising, and getting plenty of sleep. To preserve your cyberhealth, you must similarly strengthen your defenses by supplementing antivirus software (think of it as your imperfect cyber immune system) with a diversity of preventive digital tools and habits that can help keep malware and hackers from reaching you in the first place.

First, antivirus software can still play an important role. No matter how much you wash your hands, some infection will inevitably get through. While other security practices can help you avoid malware and prevent hackers from breaching your online accounts, no other consumer tool will recognize malware in downloads and emails. In 2013, Microsoft said that unprotected computers are 5.5 times more likely to be infected than those that run real-time antivirus protection. Most well-known brands provide both real-time monitoring and malware removal.

Premium products like Norton Security Deluxe, McAfee Total Protection, and Kaspersky Total Security may provide a higher level of customer service, but free products from brands like AVG and Avira provide a similar level of overall protection. While Windows users can use Microsoft’s native antivirus software, Mac users will need to find a third-party product (although Macs are generally at lower risk of infection due to Apple’s smaller market share). Whatever solution you choose, it is essential to turn on automatic updates. According to a 2014 study by Microsoft, having expired or out-of-date antivirus software is nearly as bad as having none at all.

With all its flaws, however, people need to take other steps to ensure a robust digital defense. This is the wash your hands, eat nutritious foods, and get enough sleep part that, like a parent, cybersecurity experts (and Future Tensers) like to nag users about. Among them: Install updates for all of your software—not just antivirus programs. In 2016, a Sophos researcher reported that nearly half of malware attacks involving Microsoft Office target a vulnerability Microsoft patched in 2012. Get a password manager. (If you are on a budget, it is better to use your limited funds on a password manager than on premium antivirus software.) Set up two-factor authentication, use unique passwords for each account, encrypt your computers and phones, and please, please create backups of your devices. Though these tools alone won’t keep you safe from malware, they will help protect your personal data should a virus breach your defenses.

Healthy digital habits also make a big difference for individual protection. The simplest advice for online safety comes via cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs: First, if you didn’t go looking for it, don’t install it. Second, if you installed it, update it. Third, if you no longer need it, get rid of it! Mostly, use common sense: You wouldn’t eat a piece of candy off the ground. Yet in 2008, a U.S. soldier sparked one of the largest data breaches in military history by using a USB stick he found in the parking lot outside his base.

Antivirus may not be dead yet, but it’s probably time to call hospice. While this calls to mind the old joke that the best way to secure a computer is to pull the plug, giving up is not an option for most of us. If you haven’t previously taken your cybersecurity seriously, now is a great time to start. For the quantity and intimate quality of the information we trust to our devices is transforming our relationship to data. In some important ways, we no longer simply own our information. We are our information.President Donald Trump’s war against Muslims and immigrants has begun. The president is expected to sign an executive order suspending visas from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily halt the U.S. refugee program. The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations organized an emergency rally, and within hours, Washington Square Park in Manhattan was filled with shellshocked protesters supporting immigrants.Syrian refugee Amani al-Antar, 7, who fled with her family from the city of Deir al-Zour, Syria, drinks water at a Syrian refugee camp in the eastern Lebanese town of Saadnayel, Bekaa Valley, Lebanon.

In a November interview with Fox News, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had a question about the United States' effort to accept Syrian refugees.

“It’s a total disaster. The people are going to come in,” he told commentator Sean Hannity. “I talked to you about this two weeks ago, where we talked about the migration, how so many of the people in the migration were strong young men. You look at them. I’m saying, Where are the women? Where are the children?”

Now, as it appears the U.S. will meet President Obama’s goal of admitting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year, the makeup of this new refugee population is becoming more clear.

Of the more than 8,000 Syrian refugees admitted to the country so far, 78% are women or children, according figures released by the State Department this month. Fifty-eight percent are children, with a roughly even split between girls and boys.

Only a few months ago, refugee activists and experts were concerned that the US would not admit many of the almost 5 million Syrian refugees who have fled the country since civil war began there over five years ago. By April 2016, halfway through the fiscal year, only 1,285 people had been admitted. However, monthly totals have increased steadily, with over 2,000 arriving in July. The uptick came as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies working in tandem on the project expanded their capacity.

“We can now say that we’ve welcomed 8,000 Syrian refugees so far this year, and that we are very confident that we will welcome at least 10,000 refugees from Syria by the end of this fiscal year,” said Anne Richard, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, in a conference call Friday with reporters.

Richards said DHS had ramped up its staffing to interview and vet refugees in several key locations, including Jordan, where officers conducted interviews for about 12,000 applicants who had been initially screened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The State Department also restarted interviews of UNHCR-screened refugees in Beirut, Lebanon in February, and began processing cases in Erbil, Iraq in December.

“Our expectation from the beginning was that the rate of Syrian refugee admissions would increase over time as referrals from the UNHCR increased, as we added to capacity,” Richards said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director León Rodriguez emphasized that the increase in admittances did not mean that refugees were going through a less-rigorous screening process.

According to figures posted on the White House website, less than 1 percent of refugees make it through an initial UNHCR screening. They are then vetted by the US intelligence community — the FBI, DHS and State Department — in a process that can take up to two years.

The vetting process includes multiple interviews and database checks. Rodriguez said the officers who conduct the interviews undergo extensive training about legal definitions, country conditions, and interview techniques to detect credibility issues or security concerns. Syrian refugees go through an additional level of screening, which includes a more in-depth review of applicants’ histories, including their past social media postings. That screening occurs before the initial interview is conducted and can yield specific lines of questioning for each candidate.

“The interviews conducted by those officers are frequently extensive, probe credibility issues and probe particular bases of inadmissibility,” Rodriguez said.

Each applicant is also subject to cross-agency database checks, which can determine if they have been flagged by the FBI, the CIA or Department of Defense. The database checks occur before, during and after the application process.

“I believe this information is very critical because it really rebuts what is a widely held view that we do not have resources against which to vet these individuals,” Rodriguez said. “In fact, hundreds of individuals from different countries, including hundreds of individuals from Syria, have had their admission to the United States denied because of the information that was found in these databases.”

Richards said the U.S. should maintain its current pace of accepting Syrian refugees for the rest of the fiscal year, "so we may exceed 10,000."

"For next year, we will continue to welcome large numbers of Syrians, but it’s too soon to have a target figure established,” she said.

The U.S. government has also also set up a process to promote family reunification for Iraqi and Syrian refugees who have relatives in the country. The program, called “Priority 2” or P-2, allows refugee applicants with relatives in the U.S. to bypass the UNHCR screening. U.S.-based family members can start an application on behalf of their relatives abroad via an I-130 petition for reunification. If that request is approved, family members then go through the same screening by U.S. agencies as all other refugee applicants.

According to a State Department spokesperson, over 2,000 Syrians have been accepted for consideration via the I-130 program and are at various stages of processing. Only 20 individuals have been approved so far. None of them have arrived in the U.S. yet.

While the U.S. is now set to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, the total pales in comparison to the numbers accepted by other countries. Canada resettled 25,000 Syrian refugees between November and February, according to government figures. Germany received more than 300,000 asylum petitions since 2011, while Sweden has taken more than 100,000 in the same time period, according to the UNHCR.

And U.N. figures show that the biggest burden has been carried by Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Jordan has taken in more than 650,000 refugees and Lebanon has absorbed over 1 million. Turkey hosts more than 2.7 million Syrian refugees, more than any other country.

The U.S. has accepted more refugees in the past. In 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the US admitted 125,000 Vietnamese refugees.

It stands to reason that the sports folks will stay focused on Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, and the action on the field. Will our nation's finest culture minds keep their eyes on the game or will their attentions be directed elsewhere? Watch the columns below to find out.Mark Wilson/Getty Images

A daily roundup of the biggest stories in right-wing media.

On Wednesday evening and throughout Thursday, conservative media outlets continued their coverage of Donald Trump’s conflict with the intelligence community.

On the Daily Caller, an article titled “How the Nation’s Spooks Played the Game ‘Kill Mike Flynn’ ” claimed, “The talk within the tight-knit community of retired intelligence officers was that Flynn’s sacking was a result of intelligence insiders at the CIA, NSA and National Security Council using a sophisticated ‘disinformation campaign’ to create a crisis atmosphere.” Breitbart, meanwhile, aggregated reporting on the issue from the Wall Street Journal under the headline “Deep State #Resistance: Spies Withhold Intel From Trump, Says WSJ.”

Meanwhile, National Review stood largely alone on Thursday in proposing that Congress should investigate Trump’s relationship with Russia. In a formal editorial, it proposed that such an inquiry is necessary, whether or not “this matter is on the order of Watergate.” The editors wrote, “A steadier hand is in order. It’s time for the appropriate committees to conduct the oversight—of the executive branch, and of the intelligence services—for which they are responsible.”

Most publications turned their attention Thursday to other media outlets. Several sites featured posts mocking mainstream publications for worrying that Trump had primarily invited questions from conservative news organizations at his Wednesday joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Media Freakout Over Pecking Order Rages On,” read a representative LifeZette headline. The Daily Caller drew from eight years of Barack Obama’s interactions with the press to present “13 Hard-Hitting Questions Liberal Reporters Asked Obama,” including one from Jim Acosta of CNN, “who has been especially upset about conservative media access to the White House.”

Town Hall’s Guy Benson approached the issue somewhat more soberly, offering a four-point analysis. “It’s fair to say that if President Obama had exclusively called on explicitly left-leaning outlets over the course of multiple consecutive press conferences … conservatives would have melted down,” Benson acknowledged. He went on to write that he didn’t “think personal pique was the top driving factor of their grousing.” He proposed, however, that the mainstream press’s reaction was driven by a “deep-seated arrogance and ideological myopia,” which blinds its representatives to the journalistic chops of less-than-liberal reporters.

Continuing this trend, conservative publications zeroed in on the president’s bromides against the mainstream media during his Thursday afternoon press conference. On its home page, Breitbart quoted Trump’s assertion that the media “has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.” Town Hall described the event as “Round Two of his battle with CNN’s Jim Acosta,” writing, “Trump … asked CNN to do some self reflection. He told them to honestly consider not airing such anti-Trump news every night, and they’ll see their ratings rise.”

Sean Hannity presumably wasn’t surprised by all this rancor. “You’ve heard me saying since 2008: Journalism is dead. But what we’re seeing play out now is far worse,” he pronounced in his opening monologue.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comA federal judge has issued a permanent injunction striking down Nebraska's now-negated ban on gay marriage and civil unions.

The injunction issued Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon was largely a formality, as a Supreme Court ruling in late June legalized gay marriage across the county.

Bataillon's injunction orders state officials to treat same-sex couples the same as different-sex couples in everything from processing marriage certificates to issuing birth certificates.

State attorneys had argued that the injunction was not necessary because the state has complied with the Supreme Court's ruling since it was issued.

But several same-sex couples who challenged the state's ban in 2014 argued that the state's attempt last year to exclude same-sex spouses on their children's birth certificates showed that the injunction was necessary.Each day, Slate features an article from Atlas Obscura, the website dedicated to the world’s hidden wonders.

A skull resides in a glass reliquary in a small basilica in Rome, surrounded by flowers. Lettering painted across the forehead identify the owner as none other than of the patron saint of lovers, St. Valentine.

Knowing just exactly whose skull it is, though, is complicated. First off, there was more than one Catholic saint known as St. Valentine. Then there's the approximately 1,500 years between those martyr's deaths and the enthusiastic distribution and labeling of bodies in the Victorian era. Finally, and most troubling, there is the fact that no less than 10 places claim to house the relics, all around the world.

Little is really known of the real man (or men) behind the myth. What is known (more or less) is that at least two men by the name of Valentine (Valentinus) were known in Italy and died in the late 3rd century, and a third Valentine was located in North Africa around the same time. The two Italians were buried along Via Flaminia. As a saint, Valentine first gained real notoriety in 496 when Pope Gelasius I made Feb. 14 originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia, a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. The stories of the different men seem to have merged into one over time, with most of the mythology about Valentine being a patron of lovers, helping early Christian couples to marry in secret, only dating to the 14th century and the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer.

The church itself is very old, standing on the site of an ancient Roman temple dating to the second century B.C. Most of what you see today dates to the eighth and 12th centuries, including the crypt located beneath the altar.

The skull can be found in the side altar on the left side of the church. While you are at the Basilica of Santa Maria, stop by the portico to visit with the famous Bocca della Verità (mouth of truth).Mark Boal will write the project, intended to be a miniseries.

Mark Boal, who won an Oscar for writing The Hurt Locker, is teaming up with producer Megan Ellison to tell the tale of the 2016 presidential election.

The political drama will be in the longform format, a television event series that Boal and Ellison are aiming to be in the eight to 10-hour range.

The project is being developed through Boal’s Page 1 production banner, which is financed by Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures. Ellison was instrumental in the making of Zero Dark Thirty, the Boal-written, Kathryn Bigelow-directed Osama bin Laden thriller, acting as a producer on the 2012 movie, and is also producing Boal and Bigelow’s latest venture, a drama based on the Detroit race riots.

Former New York Times Magazine and The Hollywood Reporter editor Hugo Lindgren, who is president of page 1, is said to be assembling a group of journalists who will act as investigative reporters for the project, which Boal will write.

The 2016 election, which ultimately came down to the face-off of candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, remains a very contentious topic in America three months after it was held.WASHINGTON — Rep. David McKinley has sold his West Virginia engineering and architecture firm, but it still bears his name — and that earned the Republican congressman a rebuke from the House Ethics Committee.

President-elect Donald Trump has built an international property management, real estate and branding business around his name. There appears to be no consequence for that.

When it comes to ethics, not all government employees are regulated equally. What’s a serious matter for a second-term congressman with a small business has no equivalent for a president with a multibillion-dollar empire.

The government’s legislative and judicial branches are governed by well-established rules, but there’s far less clarity about what a president can and cannot do. Conflict of interest provisions are generally looser, though Democrat Jimmy Carter, Republican George W. Bush and many other recent presidents took care to separate themselves from their businesses.

Trump tweeted Wednesday that he would announce next week his plans to step back from his company while he is president. He wrote that “legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations.”

Many serious questions remain: Will he retain an ownership stake? Will, as top aide Kellyanne Conway suggested, his adult children own and operate the business? If they do take over the Trump Organization, will they continue to be involved in Trump’s administration, as they have been?

Spokesmen for Trump’s transition and the Trump Organization have not provided details.

While Trump develops his plan, ethics lawyers and good-government groups are reviewing laws, past cases and best practices — as well as issues of who would even have the standing to call out a president for possible conflict of interest violations.

When it comes to ethics, not all government employees are regulated equally.

As Danielle Brian, executive director of the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight, put it, “We’re researching things that hadn’t even been considered before.”

“We have never had a president with these enormous business conflicts domestically and globally,” said Norman Eisen, who served as President Barack Obama’s first White House ethics czar. “What’s more, we’ve never had a president who seems to insist on breaking the precedent set by every previous president for at least four decades of doing a true blind trust or its equivalent.”

Eisen and Richard Painter, who held an equivalent position under Bush, wrote in a joint statement Wednesday that it’s not enough for Trump to simply step away from company operations.

“Without an ethics firewall that is set up at once and continues into the administration, scandal is sure to follow,” they wrote.

Self-policing has been common in recent presidencies, as well as in the legislative and judicial branches.

Congress’ ethics rules — and the bodies that police them — all stem from its ability to regulate itself. That was the case with McKinley, who violated a provision that a fiduciary business such as an architecture firm is barred from using the name of a government employee such as a congressman.

Lawmakers “are attuned to views of the voters and perception of undue conflicts,” said Andrew Herman, a Washington attorney who specializes in congressional ethics. “That’s why they’ve tended to have stringent ethics rules and committees to enforce them.”

Trump has broadly asserted that he is not hemmed in by conflict of interest laws. “The law is totally on my side, meaning the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Trump told The New York Times last week.

Herman and other attorneys say that while the president and vice president are exempt from the federal conflict of interest statute, the country’s founders drew a bright line at accepting foreign gifts.

That ban is captured in an antique-sounding part of the Constitution called the emoluments clause.

It could pose a problem for Trump because he does business all over the world. Even his domestic operations, such as his new hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington, could trip him.

Arthur Hellman, an ethicist at the University of Pittsburgh, said he does not believe any U.S. court, much less the Supreme Court, has ever interpreted the emoluments clause. “There is nothing that sheds much light on questions raised by foreign officials giving something or engaging in activities that could be construed as emoluments to Trump or his businesses.”

However, a violation might be difficult to challenge in court, Hellman said. “It’s hard to imagine anyone would have standing,” he said. Other legal experts have said that perhaps a business competitor would have the right to litigate.

At Democrats’ request, the Congressional Research Service recently put out three pages of guidance on what rules “might technically” apply to the president.

Among them is the emoluments clause, a prohibition on employing relatives, and bribery provisions.

Another sticky issue: Trump’s potential conflicts haven’t been fully illuminated.

As a candidate, he filed financial disclosures as required by federal law, including assets of more than $1.4 billion and debt of at least $265 million. He has separately boasted that his net worth is $10 billion

But unlike all recent major party presidential candidates, he did not make public his tax returns, shielding from view the full scope of his business entanglements.

It’s also uncertain whether Trump will file a new disclosure of his wealth within the first year after he takes office in January, as previous presidents have done, or wait until required by law, in is May 2018.

Such quandaries thrust the Republican-led Congress into an important watchdog role.

Few Republicans have raised red flags. Rep. Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican and frequent Trump critic, tweeted last week that “it’s certainly a big deal” if Trump has contracts with foreign governments, but few others have offered that view.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said he wants to give Trump a chance to work things out. “He hasn’t even been sworn in yet, Chaffetz said Tuesday on Fox News.Drew Angerer/Getty Images

In the shadow of Trump Tower, protesters carried signs that read, “Gay Rights are Human Rights” and “This is the Best Protest, No Protest Has Ever Been Better,” (a sarcastic reversal of Trump’s signature superlatives). From among the throng, a young Asian woman, no more than 24 years old, no taller than 5 feet, pushes by me to photograph the protest. As she lifts her camera, the crowd roars with applause as if a celebrity just entered the barricaded area. A chant then begins: “I reject the president-elect.” After a few minutes, there is a lull. The young woman stops adjusting the lens on her camera and then, in a diffident voice that is barely audible, offers her own protest cry: “Climate change is real.” In the midst of catchy slogans and compelling chants, her somewhat tangential (if accurate) statement begins to be heard. She repeats it a few more times, though never raising her voice more than a decibel. Others begin screaming it. Within seconds, it can be heard down Fifth Avenue.

This is why protest matters.

Some Republicans have criticized the recent protests against Donald Trump’s election as rallies for crybabies. But they’re wrong. Protests have the stunning, almost magical ability to allow everyone’s voice to be heard.

While that may sound Pollyanna-ish, I can assure you, as someone who has spent my entire career teaching the history of protests, this is true. Protests have throughout history given people a voice even when they did not have the vote. In an era before suffrage, antebellum women in the North joined the abolitionist movement and gained prominence voicing their concern against an economic system that subordinated them. They spoke up in crowded lyceums, often the province of male speakers, and condemned the institution of slavery. They circulated petitions among their neighbors and then sent them to politicians in Washington, D.C. They stood up from their pews in church and told their congregations about the violence committed against enslaved people in the South. During the same time, in the mid-19th century, freed slaves with no more than the clothes on their backs organized one of the most profound political campaigns in world history. Born into slavery, with no political capital, they convinced the Republican Party to become their advocates and to join them in their fight for citizenship and suffrage. By voicing their political visions, first to each other and then to government officials who were stationed in the Reconstruction South, their voices eventually reached Washington, D.C., spurring the drafting of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

The Trump protests helpfully reveal the anatomy and power of coalition protest movements, particularly in how they amplify the political concerns of many other groups that, previously, were largely working on their own campaigns. At one point during Saturday’s protest in New York, white protestors began screaming “Black Lives Matter.” A few moments later, the men in the crowd began chanting, “Her body, her rights,” and the women responded, “My body, my rights.” Then someone began screaming, “Trans rights are human rights.” Within the span of no more than 20 minutes, the crowd articulated a call for antiracism, a safeguard to protect women’s reproductive rights, and the political recognition of transgender people.

The Left has often been accused of representing too many factions and of not speaking with a singular voice—unlike the conservatives, who in the last few decades developed their own slogans, “Family Values,” and “Make America Great Again,” that fused nostalgia with political action.

Yet, leftist protests have created vital spaces to articulate the many assaults on American freedom. Speaking truth to power, as the popular activist adage suggests—even among a crowd of allies—matters. It provides solidarity and a collective framework necessary for the advancement of political goals. Few social movements in history have succeeded without such support. The abolition of slavery emerged among a constellation of reform efforts that spanned from the temperance movement to the free produce movement to early forms of women’s rights and labor activism. A century later, in the 1970s, the gay liberation movement in the United States unfolded alongside of the black civil rights movement and the rise of feminism.

In order for the quietest, most unassuming voice to be heard, an audience must be available to receive it. It’s a lot like the famous philosophical question, “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” Just as someone needs to be standing in the forest to hear the thump of the tree hitting the ground, we need to protest to hear each other.

The protest against Donald Trump’s election is only part of a larger struggle that has been unfolding for decades. Black, gay, environmental, feminist, and transgender activists have been each waging their own campaigns but have often been, by both design and practice, separated from each other. Yet the organizations of protest against Trump have locked these activists arm-in-arm. This is not to romanticize these protests nor to overlook the tensions among some of these groups; but the fact remains that the American Radical Tradition succeeds when there is collective rallying.Nearly eight years after billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein got a "sweetheart deal" from the criminal justice system, a judge is preparing to rule on a rare civil lawsuit against the federal government that alleges prosecutors violated two teen girls' rights as crime victims.

Epstein, now 62, pleaded guilty to state charges in Palm Beach County in July 2008 and admitted he hired local underage girls for erotic massages and sex at his South Florida mansion. He was jailed for 13 months of an 18-month sentence and served a year of house arrest.

The leniency and unusual circumstances of his treatment raised many eyebrows because other sex offenders received much harsher punishments for comparable crimes. The maximum possible punishment for the offenses was 15 years.

Two adult women, who say Epstein sexually abused them when they were minors, filed a federal civil suit against the U.S. Department of Justice in July 2008, alleging federal prosecutors violated their rights as crime victims by not consulting with them before signing an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.

Lawyers for the women, referred to as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, say they were either not informed or were misled into thinking Epstein could face federal prosecution, after he pleaded guilty to two state charges of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution.

After years of legal wrangling between prosecutors and the women's lawyers, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra recently said he hopes the case will finally be decided within the next few months, possibly after a non-jury trial in federal court in West Palm Beach.

The civil lawsuit is so uncommon that the possible repercussions are still unclear.

The judge could rule the U.S. Attorney's Office and U.S. Department of Justice either consulted with the women to the extent required by law or that the women were not entitled to the level of consultation or notification their lawyers say they should have received.

Even if the judge rules that federal prosecutors did not adequately consult with the victims, legal experts say the women could not receive monetary damages from the government. And lawyers say there is no chance that Epstein's sentence, which he already served, could be altered or that he could face more criminal charges related to these allegations.

Epstein is suspected of sexually abusing 30 or more young women, courts record show. Now a registered sex offender for life, he has reached confidential financial settlements with many of his alleged victims.

Epstein made his fortune as a money manager and split his time between his Palm Beach mansion, his private Caribbean island Little Saint James, his upper East Side Manhattan home, and residences in Santa Fe, N.M., and Paris.

The case has spawned numerous lawsuits and feverish international media coverage, especially after other young women alleged they were abused by Epstein, Britain's Prince Andrew and well-known lawyer, Alan Dershowitz. Buckingham Palace issued a rare denial and Dershowitz has sued his accuser's lawyers alleging he was defamed after they sued him for defamation.

Former President Bill Clinton and presidential hopeful Donald Trump have also been criticized for socializing with Epstein, though neither was accused of any criminal activity.

The two women are represented by Fort Lauderdale lawyer Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell, a law professor and former federal judge from Utah who is a nationally known victims' rights advocate.

They want the judge to rule the women's rights, under the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act, were violated. Some of their proposed penalties include invalidating the non-prosecution agreement; forcing prosecutors to meet with them to discuss the case and possible prosecution of Epstein; forcing prosecutors to apologize; and forcing prosecutors to pay financial sanctions and the victims' legal fees. Victims are not entitled to be paid damages, according to court records.

"There is good reason to believe that if the prosecutors had exposed their dealings to scrutiny by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, they would not have reached such a sweetheart deal," Edwards wrote in court records.

Prosecutors "wanted the non-prosecution agreement kept from public view because of the intense public criticism that would have resulted from allowing a politically-connected billionaire who had sexually abused more than 30 minor girls to escape from federal prosecution with only a county jail sentence," Edwards also wrote in court filings.

Prosecutors filed court records revealing the federal investigation of Epstein began in 2006 at the request of the Town of Palm Beach police. The non-prosecution agreement was signed in September 2007, nine months before Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges. Among the reasons for the agreement, federal prosecutors wrote, were that Epstein was being prosecuted by the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office and the agreement preserved and protected the victims' rights to get financial restitution from Epstein.

Prosecutors wrote some victims were "hostile" to the prosecution of Epstein and some did not want to be identified by having to go trial.

A letter written in 2011 by former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who headed the office from 2005 to 2009 when the decision was made, said the negotiations were like "a year-long assault" on prosecutors and labeled the defense launched by Epstein's star-studded team of lawyers "more aggressive" than any Acosta and his prosecutors had encountered.

"Our judgment in this case, based on the evidence known at the time, was that it was better to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex offender and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial with a reduced likelihood of success," Acosta wrote.

Acosta conceded in the letter that the "highly unusual treatment" Epstein received while in jail on the state charges "undermined the purpose of a jail sentence." Convicts sentenced to more than a year are supposed to serve their time in state prison, not a local jail, and Epstein was allowed to leave the jail six days a week during the day to work at his West Palm Beach office for several hours on a work-release program.

State prosecutors said they had concerns about some of the victims' credibility when they made their decision to charge Epstein.

At a recent court hearing, federal prosecutors said — for the first time — they think the two women may have been "complicit" in Epstein's crimes, by receiving payments to recruit other girls for him.Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's assertion that the United States has "no choice" but to send 20,000 to 30,000 combat troops to fight ISIS in the Middle East raises a slew of complicated questions, military analysts said Friday.

It also represents an about-face.

In October, Trump spoke of potential perils.

"Everybody that's touched the Middle East, they've gotten bogged down," Trump said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I don't want to see the United States get bogged down. We've spent now $2 trillion in Iraq, probably a trillion in Afghanistan. We're destroying our country."

At the CNN-hosted debate Thursday night, the Republican presidential front-runner sounded a different note.

"We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS," he said. "I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000."

Ohio Gov. John Kasich took the same position on the fight against ISIS, saying, "You have to be on the ground."

And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz urged that "we need to put whatever ground power is needed."

But military analysts say sending U.S. troops to fight ISIS raises complex issues, some of them strategic, many political and others simply logistical.

More U.S. boots on the ground in Iraq would require Baghdad's openness to having them and a war-weary American public's willingness to send them. It would create the potential for confrontation with Iran-backed militias in Iraq or perhaps Russian troops in Syria.

It also would require complex decision-making about what exactly those 20,000 to 30,000 personnel would do and what kind of support they would need.

In the world of military planning, there's a 3-1 "tooth to tail" ratio -- for every soldier on the front lines, there are three people backing that fighter up with logistical and other support.

And then there's the question of whether sending U.S. troops would actually work.

"Unless the Iraqi government has the capacity to take the territory that's been liberated and govern the territory in a way that's acceptable to people living there, it won't last," said Michael Eisenstadt, director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

He pointed to the experience after the U.S. surged troops in Iraq in 2007 only to have the Shiite-dominated government's sectarian policies leave Sunni populations alienated and ripe for supporting militant groups.

"You can't send 20, 30 thousand people in, wrap it up in just a few months and live happily ever after, because the fundamental problems remain," Eisenstadt said.

Trump and other Republican candidates were responding to a question about comments that Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, made on Tuesday when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that more troops were needed to end the ISIS threat.

While that was interpreted to mean troops on the ground, CNN military analyst Mark Hertling said Austin's comments were consistent with the position U.S. military officials have long held -- that they would send added support for Iraqi troops entering the difficult battle to retake Mosul -- not combat troops.

"You're talking about battlefield enablers," Hertling said. "The intent is still for the Iraqi forces to lead the way on that."

Greater U.S. support for the Iraqis could come in the form of additional advisers, logistical help to move people and supplies, engineers to sustain roads ravaged by explosive devices and communications and aviation support.

"There will also be the need for increased intelligence operations to assist the Iraqi forces, to contribute to the targeting ability, overhead platforms like drones, which Iraqis don't have," Hertling said.

Austin told the senators that U.S. military personnel could help develop better intelligence on the ground, provide more advise-and-assist teams and help with logistics.

A crucial issue would be how much of that support the Iraqi government would be willing to accept. Iraq has opposed large numbers of U.S. combat troops on the ground and declined the support of Apache helicopters for a recent operation in Ramadi, according to Hertling, a retired Army general.

Another question is exactly how many troops would be enough.

U.S. intelligence has at times estimated the range of ISIS forces as up to 30,000 fighters. With that number, the United States would want to send 90,000 combat forces to defeat them -- and those troops would need the corresponding "tooth-to-tail" ratio of people supporting them.

If a President Trump, Cruz or Kasich were to send tens of thousands of U.S. troops back into battle in Iraq, a domino chain of those logistical and support quandaries would have to be thought through.

To take an airfield or city and hold it, a military has to develop supply lines they can hold. As troops move forward, they need fuel, ammunition, water, protection from munitions that run the gamut from crude improvised explosive devices to chemical or biological weapons.

Then there are geopolitical questions to grapple with, Eisenstadt said, first among them the close relationship between Iran and Iraq.

"As far as we can tell, Iran has indicated that the return of American troops would violate their red line," said Eisenstadt, adding that popular mobilization units affiliated with Iran could once again start to attack U.S. soldiers.

"It sets us up for a potential confrontation with Iran or its proxy," he said.

And any foray into Syria to tackle ISIS there risks the possibility of an accidental clash with Russia.

"There is always the potential for miscalculation," Eisenstadt said.Photo

WASHINGTON — Andrew F. Puzder, who as President Trump’s pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections, acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house.

The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder’s views on overtime pay, sick leave and automation. The confirmation of Mr. Puzder, a fast-food chain executive, has stalled as he tries to divest holdings.

“My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U.S.,” Mr. Puzder said in a statement. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status.”

Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I.R.S. and the state of California.

Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, whose holdings include the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s chains.

Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground, in part, because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation.

Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment. “It’s long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration,” Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said on Monday.

Mr. Puzder remains “all in” for the confirmation process, a spokesman said on Monday.

He is not the first cabinet nominee who has hired undocumented workers.

Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Commerce Department, Wilbur Ross, said last month that he had employed an undocumented household worker for several years. And Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and the nominee for White House budget director, said that he failed to pay taxes on a nanny that he and his wife employed after their children were born. They had to pay more than $15,000 in taxes and penalties to the I.R.S.HBO

Last December, I found myself at a very small holiday gathering of about 10 urban professionals in the gorgeous townhouse of a prominent couple in Gramercy Park in Manhattan. The evening was winding down, and there were several conversations going on in the cozy living room. While chatting with a few of the guests, I caught a snippet of what was being discussed by a few of the women on the couch across from me, all of them white and probably in their late 40s or early 50s. One of the women was gushing about Atlanta, Donald Glover’s idiosyncratic FX series, the show that he’s said he created to show white people that they “don’t know everything about black culture.” She loved it and encouraged the others to check it out. This show that featured a cameo from Migos before Migos had the No. 1 song in the country and inexplicably cast Justin Bieber with a black actor? It was then that I felt something about how black culture is being consumed on screen had fundamentally changed, perhaps for the better.

A recent report from Nielsen backs up my inkling. Several current TV series featuring predominantly black casts or black lead storylines have demonstrated appeal beyond black audiences, pulling in sizable numbers from other demographics. Black-ish, Insecure, Atlanta, and How to Get Away With Murder average more than 50 percent nonblack viewership, and in the case of Black-ish, a surprising 79 percent of its audience is not black. Past series featuring predominantly black casts that had significant appeal outside of black viewers tended to be middle-of-the-road fare: Your Fresh Prince of Bel-Airs and Cosby Shows that rarely waded into sharp political territory (though the former did so more often than the latter) and featured benign, ostensibly family-friendly funnymen at their center. Shows that presented a more specific and targeted brand of black culture and humor, like Martin or Living Single, did not cross over to nearly the same extent.

It says something that in 2017, shows like Atlanta, Black-ish, and Insecure—shows that wear their blackness proudly—are being made and embraced by those who don’t necessarily have those same experiences, or even fully understand all of the references and sensibilities. (I wonder how many people had to Google Juneteenth after an Atlanta episode last year or had no clue what an AKA is until Insecure’s Molly was revealed to be one.) In a sense, it’s real progress. But then, there’s a real fear that celebrating this demographic shift too much could reinforce the idea that black viewership isn’t as important or valuable as white viewership, even if black faces are at the forefront of future projects. Perhaps sensing how this data could be twisted, Nielsen also points out in its report that Empire still commands a predominantly black audience (though its nonblack viewership is still pretty high, at around 40 percent), and notes its Emmy nominations, star Taraji P. Henson’s Golden Globe win, and a Cover Girl makeup line inspired by the show.(CNN) Samantha Taylor was at Orlando's Jewish Community Center for a morning meeting when she heard reports of a bomb threat crackle from the director's walkie-talkie.

While police and bomb-sniffing dogs searched the building for several hours, the teachers kept the children calm and happy at a safe spot down the street, Taylor said. No explosives were found.

On the same day, January 4, an Orlando Chabad center also received a threatening call, marking the first trickle in what would soon swell to waves of calls menacing Jewish institutions across the country.

In all, 48 JCCs in 26 states and one Canadian province received nearly 60 bomb threats during January, according to the JCCA, an association of JCCs*. Most were made in rapid succession on three days: January 9, 18 and 31. A number of JCCs, including Orlando's, received multiple threats.

In a statement, the FBI said the bureau and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division are "investigating possible civil rights violations in connections with threats to Jewish Community Centers across the country."

The JTA, a Jewish news agency, says it has obtained a recording of one of the calls . On it, the caller says a C-4 bomb has been placed in the JCC and that "a large number of Jews are going to be slaughtered."

Several JCC sources said the FBI has told them it is investigating the calls as hate crimes. Online, another term has circulated: "telephone terrorism."

"I've been in the business for 20-plus years, and this is unprecedented," said Paul Goldenberg, national director of the Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish organizations on security. "It's more methodical than meets the eye."

No bombs have been found, but Jewish leaders hesitate to label the calls "hoaxes." The chaos and terror the calls have caused are real, as are more tangible consequences.

JCCs across the country are bolstering security and holding town halls to calm frightened parents. Still, several centers have seen students withdraw from their early childhood education programs, typically reliable sources of revenue. As a result, some are slashing budgets, cutting staff and holding emergency fundraisers.

In Orlando's JCC, 50 students have been withdrawn from its daycare and preschool. In Albany, New York, 12 families have removed their children.

"If we happen to be on the list again," said Adam Chaskin, director of Albany's JCC, "that number 12 is going to grow."

Meanwhile, JCC members are commiserating on social media, sharing poignant pictures of evacuation cribs left in frozen parking lots and teachers herding children to safety.

Some parents wonder why the threats haven't garnered more media attention and lament the spike in hate crimes seemingly incited by the divisive 2016 presidential campaign.

Others agonize about whether to withdraw their children from JCC schools and cringe when they hear a text message alert on their phones.

"Everywhere I went I had my phone out front and center," said Taylor, a 37-year-old mother of three. "It was like: OK, when is it going to happen again?"

A community on edge

Like YMCAs, Jewish Community Centers pride themselves on being open to all members of all faiths, and a fair number of their students are not Jewish.

But for many Jews, JCCs aren't just about schools and swimming lessons. They're hubs of Jewish social life: places where their children learn Jewish history, their families celebrate Purim parties, and one of the few spots where Jews of all denominations put aside their religious and political differences.

"So much of being Jewish is built around community," said Jordana Horn, a mother of six in New Jersey whose children and parents both frequent the local JCC. "Everything from prayer to mourning to celebration you need to have a community around you. You need to have a place where everyone can gather."

For secular Jews, the JCC may be one of the few institutional sources of knowledge about Jewish culture and tradition.

Daniel Mauser and Kristina Kasper, who live in San Diego with their two children, don't belong to a local synagogue but send their son to a JCC preschool. It's the best in the area, they said.

Still, they know that the school, which received a bomb threat on January 31, comes with risks.

"Even though it's a wonderful environment, I know that, in sending my son to a Jewish preschool, it's a target," said Kasper, a former New York City schoolteacher.

Not all of the threats against JCCs in recent memory have been empty.

In 2014, a white supremacist murdered two people outside a Jewish Community Center in Overland Park, Kansas. In 2006, a man fired shots at the Jewish Federation of Seattle, killing one woman and injuring five others. Five years before that, another man opened fire at the JCC in Granada Hills, California, wounding five people, including a 5-year-old boy.

In 2014 and 2015 the FBI tallied more than 1,270 hate crime incidents targeting Jews, far more than any other religious groups, and some Jewish leaders say the situation is getting worse.

In the past several months, synagogues and schools have been vandalized, swastikas have been scrawled in New York City subway cars and Jewish families have been harassed by neo-Nazis.

"We are in a volatile and fast-growing threat environment," said Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League. "The Jewish community has been on edge."

Asked on Wednesday whether his campaign rhetoric could have caused a spike in anti-Semitism, President Donald Trump demurred. He talked about his election victory , then mentioned his daughter, Ivanka -- who converted to Judaism -- her husband Jared Kushner and their children.

"I think that you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four, or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and you're going to see a lot of love."

Trump made no mention of the bomb threats, though they have frightened and befuddled many Jewish parents.

Little is known about the calls themselves. Goldenberg, the security adviser, says the caller uses sophisticated voice-masking technology. It's difficult to discern if it's a male or female voice, or how old the caller is.

"They could be 15 or 60 years old. These masking technologies are very effective."

Chillingly, the perpetrator also uses technology to make the calls seem as if they're coming from within the JCC itself.

'How serious is it?'

The photo of the worried woman pushing an evacuation crib outside the Albany JCC -- that's the image that roiled Kveller.com's Facebook group for mothers, said Deborah Kolben, editor of the Jewish parenting website.

Jewish Community Center evacuation

Since the threats began, Kveller has run at least five columns about them. Some of the writers are distraught. "Did the people who decided to call in a bomb threat wish it was real?" asked one mother . "Did they think about my babies and wish that they could really blow them up?"

Others columnists were more defiant. "I'm not scared to be a proud Jewish mother in the United States of America in 2017," wrote Jordana Horn , "and neither should you be."

Other Jewish mothers say they don't know what to make of the bomb threats, or how they should react.

"The question is: How serious is it?" said Elissa Strauss, a parenting columnist for Slate whose son attends a JCC preschool. "That's what I, as a Jew and a parent, am trying to work out. I don't think I have a clear understanding of what I'm supposed to do right now, besides not give in."

Strauss said the relative lack of media coverage about the threats adds to her perplexity. She's not alone: "48 U.S. Jewish Centers Received Bomb Threats in Past Month," ran a headline in Haaretz. "'Why Is No One Talking About This?'"

Parents are asking: Is it because no bombs have exploded? Because the protection of children is seen primarily as a "women's issue"? Because Trump's chaotic new administration dominates news cycles? Or because JCC leaders are trying to quiet the story for fear of panicking parents and losing students?

Ivy Harlev, director of the JCC in Wilmington, Delaware, which received two bomb threats last month, says she is "torn" about whether more media should have covered the threats.

"I don't want that kind of negative attention, but I want to make sure that people know that we are a secure place, and that we have the support of local law enforcement."

Like many JCCs that have received threats, Harlev's quickly assembled a town hall so parents could question administrators, local police and FBI representatives. Two families decided to withdraw their children from the JCC's early childhood education program, Harlev said.

In Albany, Orlando and elsewhere, JCC staffers have tried to bolster security -- and ease parents' peace of mind -- by closing entrances, blocking phone calls from unknown numbers and posting bollards to block vehicles from getting close to their buildings.

At least one family was satisfied by the changes.

For nearly four years, Melissa Braillard, a mother of two in Orlando, had sent her children to the JCC. She knew and liked the teachers, the administrators, the other parents and their children.

"I feel like I had a support system, and people cared for us."

But after the third bomb threat and weeks of worrying, Braillard removed her children from the JCC. "I need to keep my kids safe," she thought at the time.

A few weeks later, though, Braillard agreed to return to the Orlando JCC to see its security improvements. She came away impressed.

Because her son would be starting kindergarten soon at another school anyway, he is not returning to the JCC. But her daughter will be back in the classroom on Monday.

On March 8, the Orlando JCC is holding a fundraiser , where it hopes to raise $200,000 to help the center break even for the year. It has already found three donors to match donations, potentially quadrupling the windfall.

Meanwhile, parents like Taylor, the mother who witnessed the first bomb threat, are determined to keep the doors open. "Our JCC isn't going anywhere," she said, "and that's the most important message."

Justine Hunt / Boston Globe / Getty Images Facebook co-founders Dustin Moscovitz (left) and Mark Zuckerberg in Harvard Yard on September 12, 2004

Jenna Wortham of the New York Times wonders if Facebook is “fading.” She finds herself spending less time there, says that her younger relatives show little or no interest in it and notes that Facebook itself says that younger teens are spending less time on the service.

And among the people she turned to for insight is an academic who explains why Facebook may be growing less appealing:

But S. Shyam Sundar, a director of the Media Effects Research Lab at Pennsylvania State University, said that Facebook had become a utility, like a phone carrier. People go to Facebook to document the major events in their lives, he said, and keep track of those of others, not unlike a public, community scrapbook.

This is not exactly a revelation. Another authority on Facebook’s ambitions also says it’s a utility: Mark Zuckerberg himself. As he told the Atlantic’s James Bennet in September:

Maybe electricity was cool when it first came out, but pretty quickly people stopped talking about it because it’s not the new thing, the real question you want to track at that point is are fewer people turning on their lights because it’s less cool?

That sounds a little defensive. Is Zuck hastily re-positioning Facebook as a utility to deal with the notion that it’s no longer hip enough to command the full attention of young people?

Nope. He’s always called Facebook a utility. Here’s a quote from an article by Jeff Clavier on “The Facebook” from October 27, 2005, when the service had around 5,000,000 members and was open only to students in certain universities and invited high schoolers, and was pretty much the Snapchat of its time:

Mark said that he has not conceived the Facebook as a social network – which is a community application, it is a directory that he considers a utility that students use in order to find information which is socially relevant.

Zuckerberg’s vision has had its occasional blips, but for the most part it’s been remarkably consistent for almost a decade now, and he’s never wavered on the idea of Facebook being a utility. More than anything else, that might be the mantra which got the service to 1.19 billion monthly active users. It’s also helped make it into a real business. Among the lessons of the web: The fact that something is cool doesn’t mean that there’s any obvious way to make a lot of money from it, and the fact that something isn’t cool doesn’t mean that it’s doomed to failure.

Nor is it exactly news that teenagers see Facebook as a ho-hum obligation rather than the center of their social life– here’s a story from 2009 (“Official: Facebook is just not cool anymore”) which reads eerily like some of the pieces being published right now.

Which is not to say that Zuckerberg shouldn’t be rattled by any signs that a new generation might not be bonding emotionally with Facebook. Besides Snapchat, Wortham’s story mentions WhatsApp, Line and other social services that are growing rapidly and have plenty of cachet among teenagers. Another piece by Wortham and colleagues Vindu Goel and Nicole Perlroth digs deeper into the whole subject, including Facebook’s failed $3 billion bid for Snapchat.

On the web, the single biggest reason why giants collapse is because they don’t react quickly enough to indirect, emerging threats of this sort. If Facebook blithely dismissed them, it would be cause for alarm. But if the company is looking like a utility for the masses rather than a hot property for young people, it’s not a sign that the game has changed — it’s Facebook being what it’s been trying to be all along. And have you noticed? Utilities can be solid businesses. Maybe even better businesses than ones beloved by trendy teens.Story highlights The idea would significantly alter US military operations in Syria

Trump would need to approve the decision

Washington (CNN) The Defense Department might propose that the US send conventional ground combat forces into northern Syria for the first time to speed up the fight against ISIS, CNN has learned.

"It's possible that you may see conventional forces hit the ground in Syria for some period of time," one defense official told CNN.

But the official emphasized that any decision is ultimately up to President Donald Trump, who has ordered his defense secretary to come up with a proposal to combat ISIS before the end of the month.

The move would significantly alter US military operations in Syria if approved and could put troops on the ground within weeks.

Until now, only small teams made up largely of Special Operations forces have operated in Syria, providing training and assistance to anti-ISIS opposition groups on the ground.

Read MoreThe most pivotal scene in Moonlight, a dramatic film that just received six Golden Globe nominations, takes place in our favorite room of any building: the kitchen.

Moonlight is about Chiron, an African American man coming of age—and coming to understand his sexuality—in Reagan-era Miami. Whenever food appears throughout the almost two-hour film, viewers know that love is there, too.

“When you cook for someone, this is a deliberate act of nurturing,” says director Barry Jenkins in a phone call. “This very simple thing is the currency of genuine intimacy.”

There’s only one food-related scene, though, that slows down enough to let us into the kitchen.

Kevin is a childhood friend of Chiron’s, and the only man—the only person—who has ever touched him sexually. Chiron, now grown and toughened from years of drug dealing, drives from Atlanta, where he now lives, back to Florida to reconnect. Kevin is a chef at a diner there.

Arroz con pollo—garnished with freshly chopped cilantro—that’s the Chef’s Special tonight. As Kevin stirs, Jenkins removes the back-of-house clamor and sublimates the audio with a piece of score. Kevin forms a plateau of rice with a ring mold. And he watches Chiron as he sits in a brightly lit booth, a little shifty. Chiron removes gold grills from his upper and lower teeth.

“Rather than shooting it in a very realistic way, at 24 frames per second, we shot it in slow-motion,” says Jenkins. The scene isn’t more than 60 seconds.

The lives of the characters have slowed—for now, at least—along with the film speed. No more hustling today for Chiron; no more burger slinging for Kevin. It’s in this moment that we, the viewers, become aware that the door is open for something romantic to happen between these two men.

Kevin’s concentrated chopping of cilantro returns the sound, but only of the knife’s steel piercing the herb.

“It felt like the gesture was charged in some way,” Jenkins continues. “Something special was happening: Kevin was deliberately preparing this thing out of love. Plus, I’ve never seen a black man cook for another black man in a film or television or any kind of media.”

Isn’t this what cooking does for all of us? No more email…chop. No more ruminating over some misstep in a meeting…that butter’s about to brown. Put that down, heat this up, eat. Live.

As for Jenkins, he hasn’t spent much time in the kitchen while working on Moonlight for the past three years. But he does like to cook, and he hopes to find more time to do so in the near future.

“I want to own a house where I can put a couch in the kitchen,” he says. “That's my dream.”“The Lego Batman Movie” will once again try to fend off “Fifty Shades Darker” as the animated spinoff works to retain its box office crown over the Presidents Day weekend holiday. The two films should make quick work of a group of newcomers — “Fist Fight,” “The Great Wall,” and “A Cure for Wellness” — that lack the firepower to pull off a coup.

Of these, “Fist Fight,” a comedy with Ice Cube and Charlie Day as feuding teachers, should be the most profitable. The New Line comedy is expected to debut to roughly $17 million over the four-day period, a solid result given its $22 million budget. The studio is being a bit more conservative, projecting an opening of approximately $15 million across 3,200 locations.

Universal and Legendary’s “The Great Wall,” an elaborate action-adventure with Matt Damon and some monsters incongruously popping up in the midst of China’s Song Dynasty, has already grossed a hefty $171 million in the Middle Kingdom. North American audiences seem less enthused about spending the annual celebration of Lincoln and Washington’s birthdays watching Damon play China’s great white hope. “The Great Wall” should open to roughly $17 million from 3,200 locations, a lackluster result considering its $150 million production budget. It will also roll out in 21 additional markets, including Australia, Korea, Russia, and the U.K., which could help bolster revenues.

That leaves Fox’s “A Cure for Wellness” staring at a disappointing $6 million to $8 million when it bows across 2,703 locations. The horror film centers on a young executive (Dane DeHaan) whose trip to retrieve the company’s CEO from a shadowy spa in the Swiss Alps doesn’t end with a deep tissue massage. There, the treatments being administered are far more dangerous than even the most aggressive facial peel. New Regency produced the film with Gore Verbinski, of “Pirates of the Caribbean” fame and “The Lone Ranger” infamy, directing. “A Cure for Wellness” did manage to make headlines this week after reports surfaced that it had partnered with “fake news” providers to post dubious stories such as a fake meeting between President Donald Trump and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, at a resort, which made passing references to the film. The provocative ads do not appear to have bolstered interest in the film.Trump names Alexander Acosta as labor secretary nominee 'He’s had a tremendous career,' Trump said. 'I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor.'

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced his intent to nominate Alexander Acosta, a former Justice Department official and current dean of Florida International University College of Law, for labor secretary, just a day after his first pick, fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder, backed out.

“He’s had a tremendous career,” Trump said from the White House. “I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of Labor.”

Story Continued Below

Acosta, who was born to Cuban immigrants, would become the first Hispanic member of Trump's cabinet. He has been confirmed by the Senate for three prior positions, which could help smooth his path to the Labor Department.

Still, his background is not without some controversy, including allegations that, while a U.S. attorney in Miami, he cut a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls.

Acosta clerked for Justice Samuel Alito when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He also served on the National Labor Relations Board under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2003, then left the NLRB to become an assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights division between 2003 and 2005. He served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 to 2009, when he joined FIU.

Leonard Leo, who is currently on leave from a post as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, said that Acosta is "a brilliant nomination by the president, with indispensable support from [White House] Counsel Donald McGahn, who had his eye on him as early as the summer months.”

Wilma Liebman, a Democratic NLRB member who served with Acosta, also spoke positively about him.

“Even though we often came out differently on policy conclusions or the outcome of a case, he was a good colleague and he was always willing to talk and bounce around ideas,” Liebman said. “I would say he’s very smart and he’s an independent thinker.”

Liebman said that while unions may not “be thrilled with every decision he’ll make...they’ll get a good hearing.”

Acosta has strong backing from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) In a statement, Rubio said: “I know Alex Acosta well, and he is a phenomenal choice to lead the Department of Labor."

But he could receive scrutiny over the plea deal he cut with wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta’s prosecutors agreed not to file any federal charges against Epstein if he pleaded guilty to state charges involving soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution.

Epstein ultimately received an 18-month sentence in county jail and served about 13 months. Soon after the deal was cut in 2008, two women filed suit claiming that the decision to forgo federal prosecution violated a federal law — the Crime Victims Rights Act — because they and other teenagers Epstein paid for sex were never adequately consulted about the plea deal or given an opportunity to object to it.

Acosta is not a party in the suit, which names only the federal government as a defendant. In 2015, lawyers for the women demanded Acosta submit to a deposition in the case. The motion was withdrawn last year as settlement talks in the case went forward, but the case remains pending.

Acosta’s involvement in the saga could be awkward for Trump, drawing fresh attention to his ties to Epstein — including the financier’s tenure as a member at Trump’s Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago.

“I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York Magazine back in 2002. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

A Trump associate told POLITICO in 2015 that Trump and Epstein were not particularly close. “He was a member of one of Trump's clubs where he would visit with women and business associates, but there was no formal relationship," the source said.

Acosta’s nomination comes after myriad scandals scuttled Puzder’s confirmation. He withdrew his nomination on Wednesday, after POLITICO published a video in which his former wife leveled abuse allegations against him while appearing on Oprah's show in disguise in 1990. She later recanted the accusations.

Puzder also faced scrutiny for employing an undocumented worker and failing to pay taxes on her employment until after his nomination.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, which will hold Acosta's confirmation hearing, said, "Acosta’s nomination is off to a good start because he’s already been confirmed by the Senate three times."

Alexander said the committee "will schedule a hearing promptly after his nomination papers arrive in the Senate."

Madeline Conway, Josh Gerstein, Mel Leonor and Cogan Schneier contributed to this report.

Key Findings

A prominent scientist at the Mexican National Institute for Public Health (INSP) and two directors of Mexican NGOs working on obesity and soda consumption were targeted with government-exclusive spyware.

All of the targets have been active supporters of Mexico’s soda tax, a public health measure to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks.

The targets received messages with malicious links that would have installed NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware on their phones. NSO Group is an Israeli “cyber warfare” company.

NSO’s government surveillance tool may have been misused on behalf of special commercial interests, not for fighting crime or terrorism.

Summary

This report describes an espionage operation using government-exclusive spyware to target a Mexican government food scientists and two public health advocates. The operation used spyware made by the NSO Group, an Israeli company that sells intrusion tools to remotely compromise mobile phones. On August 25, 2016, the Citizen Lab published a report showing that NSO’s technology was used to target Ahmed Mansoor, a UAE-based human rights defender, as well as identifying targeting in Mexico. Mexico has previously confirmed that it is a purchaser of NSO Group’s spyware.

Mansoor was targeted with links sent via SMS. Had he clicked on the links, his iPhone would have been silently exploited with the Trident, a series of three zero-day exploits designed to install NSO’s Pegasus spyware on his phone.

This research presents evidence that NSO’s exploit infrastructure and spyware were used to target additional individuals in Mexico in July and August 2016, including Dr. Simon Barquera, a well-respected Mexican government health scientist, Alejandro Calvillo, the director of a consumer and health advocacy organization, and Luis Encarnación, the director of a coalition working on obesity prevention.

These individuals are neither criminals nor terrorists, but a prominent government scientist and two health campaigners who support a public health measure: Mexico’s soda tax on sugary drinks. They received the malicious links via SMS while campaigning to increase the soda tax rate, improve drink labelling, and raise awareness of health risks associated with sugary drinks.

This case suggests that NSO’s government-exclusive espionage tools may be being used by a government entity on behalf of commercial interests, and not for national security reasons or fighting crime.

Citizen Lab’s investigation was conducted with the assistance of Mexican non-governmental organizations (NGOs) R3D and SocialTIC.

Mexican Soda Tax Supporters Targeted with NSO Exploit Links

Following publication of the August 2016 report, researchers with Citizen Lab and Amnesty International were contacted by Access Now, which had received a request for assistance on its helpline from R3D and SocialTIC, two Mexican NGOs working on digital rights and security. These NGOs assisted Citizen Lab researchers in collecting suspicious messages from a range of Mexican targets.

Analysis of the text messages collected by R3D and SocialTIC revealed a campaign involving NSO exploit links active between at least April 20 and August 17, 2016.

This report describes a subset of these discoveries: SMS messages sent to three individuals—Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación—in July and August 2016 (See: Confirmed Targets of NSO Exploit Links). We are naming these individuals with their explicit consent.

Dr. Simon Barquera is a well-respected researcher at the Mexican Government’s Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (National Institute of Public Health).

Alejandro Calvillo is the Director of El Poder del Consumidor, a consumer rights and health advocacy organization.

Luis Encarnación is the Director of the Coalición ContraPESO, a coalition of more than 40 organizations that work on obesity prevention and reduction strategies. All three individuals work to support Mexico’s soda tax.

Obesity is Political: Mexico’s Soda Tax & Beyond

Facing an obesity epidemic, many Mexican organizations have campaigned to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks, especially sodas. The effort resulted in a tax on sugary drinks, passed in 2014. The tax slightly raises prices to encourage consumers—especially children—to seek healthier alternatives. The so-called “soda tax” has led to decreases in soda consumption and is projected to save over 18,000 lives from illnesses related to excess sugar consumption over 10 years.

Despite the positive effects on public health, efforts to promote healthier consumer habits have been met with resistance from the food and beverage industry. For example, the CEO of Coca Cola personally called Mexico’s president in 2013 to encourage him to oppose the soda tax, and some Mexican media companies refused to air advertising supporting the tax. After the tax bill was passed, the pressure continued.

In October 2015, legislators attempted to cut the tax in half, although a swift public backlash and accusations of influence by soft drink companies forced cancellation of the tax cut. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the industry continues to exert political pressure to block Mexico’s efforts efforts to curb soda consumption.

Context of the Bitter Sweet Targeting Period

In response to the political pressure against the soda tax, in mid-2016 public health groups and food scientists prepared a mass media campaign to build support for the tax, increase the tax rate, and call for accountability in how the tax revenue was being spent. Campaigners held a press conference on June 29, 2016, highlighting misleading and confusing product labelling standards promoted by the food and beverage industry and planned a full launch of their campaign in August 2016. Campaigners began receiving the spyware links one week after the press conference, and throughout the period that the campaign was being prepared (See Figure 1).

Bitter Sweet Bait Texts: Personalized, Profane

Social engineering is a common strategy for delivering even very sophisticated spyware. Operators rely on social engineering because it “just works.” Many instances of social engineering involve an operator sending a malicious attachment or link in a message specially crafted to appeal to a target. Messages may be designed to appear urgent, important, upsetting, or intriguing to targets, to convince the target to open the link or attachment.

Spyware operators sometimes develop bait content that is both personalized and capable of stirring strong emotions. The Bitter Sweet NSO spyware operators personalized the messages to the interests and work of the targets (See Figure 2), and actively escalated the emotional content of the messages over time (See Figure 3).

The messages used several deceptions to encourage targets to click on malicious links. For example:

Upsetting fake news updates suggesting personal scandals

Upsetting personal messages, like the news of the death of a relative, or injury of a child

Personal sexual taunts and allegations

Bitter Sweet Escalation: From “I saw you mentioned” to “I f*cked your old lady” to “your daughter was in a car accident”

In several cases, a single target received several kinds of messages, ranging from mundane to highly emotional and upsetting.

For example, the targeting of Dr. Simón Barquera (that we know of) began with the operators sending him a message on July 11, 2016 with a fake news story relevant to his work. The Bitter Sweet operators subsequently escalated the personal content and aggressiveness of the messages in two waves, ending on August 17 (See Figure 3).

On July 12, Dr. Barquera received a message saying that he was mentioned in a court case. The following day, he received a more emotionally charged message: someone’s father has died, the sender is devastated, and would Dr. Barquera check the dates of the funeral to see if he could attend?

On July 14, perhaps frustrated at a lack of success, the operators tried an even more upsetting theme: “While you are working I am fucking your old lady here is a photo.”

On August 9 he got a message hinting that a news article contained personal attacks against him. Then, a message on August 11 accused him of sleeping with the sender’s wife, continuing the theme. On August 12 a fake news update suggested that a place where he was affiliated was being investigated for corruption, and on August 15 he received an alarming message saying he was being accused of corruption in a national publication.

Finally, on August 17 he received an extremely upsetting message stating that his daughter had just been in an accident and was in “very serious condition.” The message included a link with information about the place where she was purportedly hospitalized.

Why So Many Messages?

The repeated messages and escalation of emotional content suggest a strong desire on the part of the operators to compromise Dr. Barquera’s device. The Bitter Sweet operators may have either failed to infect Dr. Barquera’s devices with NSO’s Pegasus or had trouble maintaining a stable infection on the target device (see: Figure 3).

The Other Targets

Alejandro Calvillo also received a message about a father’s funeral on July 8 and a message on July 11 stating that his name was mentioned in a news article that was “going viral.”

Luis Encarnación, meanwhile, received a message on July 12 suggesting that he was mentioned in a news article (See Figure 1). A full list of the texts and malicious links is included in Appendix A.

The Redirects

According to the targets, in several cases there were links that redirected to the website of a funeral home. These included messages about a funeral, but also bait messages that were on unrelated subjects. It is unclear whether this was a veiled threat, or a sloppiness by the operators. The more explicit taunts, meanwhile, reportedly redirected to pornography websites. Citizen Lab was not able to examine these redirects, as NSO’s entire exploit infrastructure was shut down around the time of our August 2016 report.

All three targets have taken steps to ensure the security of their devices following this incident.

Heavy Handed Targeting: Why such obvious lies?

Dr. Barquera could easily figure out that his daughter was not injured, just as Alejandro Calvillo could determine that there was no “viral” news article about him. This is telling about the style of the Bitter Sweet operators: they did not try very hard to avoid detection. They seem to have prioritized getting a target to click, rather than carefully concealing their targeting.

There are many factors that could explain the heavy-handed targeting, including a lack of professionalism, intense pressure for results, a lack of concern for the consequences of being caught. Whatever the reason, recklessness by the Bitter Sweet operators led to the compromise of their operation.

Bitter Sweet’s ‘noisy’ targeting also speaks to the issue of risk to other customers: if the NSO Group cannot stop its customers from recklessly using its tools, then it cannot guarantee other customers full secrecy. The NSO Group sells the same software and exploits to multiple government customers, and if one customer exposes their tools, all customers’ are impacted. This scenario came to pass when a different NSO client targeted Ahmed Mansoor, triggering to our original investigation, which led to the patching of hundreds of millions of Apple devices, and exposed NSO’s Pegasus software and Exploit infrastructure.

Connecting the Bitter Sweet SMSes to the NSO Exploit Infrastructure

The messages sent to Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación all contained links pointing to domains previously identified as part of our investigation into NSO’s infrastructure. The URLs in several text messages directly linked to the exploit infrastructure, while in others targets received exploit links that were shortened using the bit.ly link shortening service (See Appendix A for a full list, including all redirects).

Table 2. NSO Exploit Infrastructure Observed in This Operation

NSO Group Trident Exploit & Spyware Domain Target(s) smsmensaje[.]mx Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación unonoticias[.]net Dr. Simon Barquera

Based on the behavior of links received by human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, clicking on the link would have caused the phone to be silently and remotely jailbroken, and infected with NSO’s Pegasus spyware.

Our previous report mentioned a subset of the NSO exploit infrastructure domains that we discovered, including unonoticias[.]net. We also identified smsmensaje[.]mx as an NSO exploit infrastructure domain during the scanning period, although it was not listed in our report to protect ongoing investigations.

Bitter Sweet Attribution: The Mexican Nexus

While we do not conclusively demonstrate that elements of the Mexican government participated in the Bitter Sweet operation, circumstantial evidence suggests that this is a strong possibility.

Only a government can purchase NSO’s products: NSO Group explicitly limits the sales of its products to governments. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that a government’s NSO deployment was used in this attack.

The Mexican Government is a confirmed NSO User: The Mexican government reported that it signed a $ 20 million dollar deal with NSO Group in 2012. Thus, elements of the Mexican government likely had access to NSO products at the time of the Bitter Sweet operation.

The targets work on multiple domestic Mexican issues: The same infrastructure used for the Bitter Sweet operation (the unonoticias[.]net domain) was also used to target a Mexican journalist who wrote a story about government corruption involving the Mexican President’s wife and a high-speed rail contractor, among other domestic targeting.

The targets of the Bitter Sweet operation work on issues related to soft drink consumption and parties outside Mexico may object to their work. A large multinational food and beverage company could conceivably have sufficient influence to encourage a different government that has purchased NSO to target Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación. However, it is not clear that another government would be equally interested in all of the other targets we have identified.

Noisy targeting: The heavy handed targeting is also a factor suggesting that the Bitter Sweet operator is a Mexican governmental client: it is unlikely that a foreign country would use the NSO tool on Mexican soil so brazenly and so clearly risking discovery.

Conclusion: Government-Exclusive Spyware’s Many Misuses

The targets of the Bitter Sweet operation have not been accused by anyone of being criminals or terrorists. They are, instead, concerned scientists and public-health campaigners trying to limit the overconsumption of sugary drinks in Mexico. Yet, they have been targeted with a sophisticated piece of government-exclusive spyware.

Research by the Citizen Lab and others has consistently shown that some governments are willing to use “lawful intercept” tools like NSO Group’s Pegasus to recklessly target and harass journalists, activists, and human rights defenders. Prior Citizen Lab reporting on NSO Group spyware highlighted, for example, the targeting of a Mexican journalist who reported on a presidential scandal (See: Section 7.1. Mexico: Politically Motivated Targeting?). Governments may view these people, however incorrectly, as threats to the state.

The advocacy work of Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación cannot be construed as threats to the state. They have, however been critical of the influence of the soft drink industry in government, and supported measures that are projected to save over 18,000 lives from illness. These actions do threaten some interests: the revenues of companies selling sugary drinks, and the fortunes and reputations of their investors and allies in government.

This case suggests that NSO’s surveillance tool may have been misused for special commercial interests, not for fighting crime or terrorism. We hope that this report and the evidence that it includes will result in an urgent investigation by the Mexican government, as well as the Israeli government, which approves exports of NSO products.

This case also highlights that the current regulatory environment has been unsuccessful at preventing egregious misuses of spyware. As spyware companies continue to sell to customers who abuse their products, they invite stronger regulation by concerned governments and multilateral bodies. Their lack of due diligence and the brazen abuses of their products by government clients are potent arguments in favor of more effective regulation.

Dealing With Suspicious SMS Messages

This campaign relied on upsetting, personalized messages combined with highly sophisticated government-exclusive spyware. Even though the spyware that was delivered was sophisticated, the path to infection started by exploiting human emotions. A target needs to click on the link for the infection to happen, which means the first line of defense is being vigilant and mindful of our own behaviours.

Here are several basic suggestions for avoiding SMS-based spyware:

Do not click on SMS-links sent from people you do not know.

Be especially careful with upsetting, unsolicited messages that contain links

If you get an SMS from a service, like your phone company, visit their website rather than clicking on a link in the message.

If you believe you have been the victim of targeted spyware, you should consider sharing it with a trusted expert, or a helpline such as that of Access Now.

Citizen Lab strongly suspects that there may be other targets. If you suspect you have been the target of this particular operation, or have seen very similar text messages (same themes, same URLs, etc) please contact the Citizen Lab at bittersweet@citizenlab.ca.

The Importance of Documentation

The discovery that led to the findings in this report is the result of vigilance on the part of Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación. It is also the result of a careful documentation effort by R3D and SocialTIC, and their willingness to share the case with Access Now’s Help Line. Documentation of suspicious incidents is one of the most important practices civil society groups can adopt to raise awareness of and defenses against these kinds of espionage operations. Documentation can take the form of a simple set of notes with dates, times, and saved messages, or ideally be part of a more complete incident documentation process.

Appendix A

Messages containing NSO exploit infrastructure links sent to Dr Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis EncarnaciónA few days before the retreat, I met up with the man who, perhaps more than any other figure in the conservative movement, had maneuvered the party toward complete and unbending opposition to Obamacare: Michael Needham of the Heritage Foundation. Needham, 35, is the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, a feral cur of a lobbying organization established by the venerable conservative think tank in 2010 to (as its website puts it) “hold Congress accountable to conservative principles.” Though other organizations — among them the Club for Growth and Americans for Tax Reform — have vigorously opposed Obamacare from its inception, Heritage Action has spent the last six years almost monomaniacally focused on demanding that legislators abolish the hated law. It scores them on what it deems critical votes and loudly condemns any and all apostasies. It names names and, when necessary to its ends, is happy to defy the Republican leadership. In violating Reagan’s “11th Commandment” not to speak ill of others in his party, Needham has come to rival Ted Cruz as one of the least popular Republicans in Washington.

Needham would not seem an obvious choice for this distinction. Smooth-skinned and passively handsome in the manner of Mitt Romney, he grew up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. His youthful acquaintance with struggle was limited to being a Mets fan. After graduating from Williams College in 2004, Needham went straight to work for Heritage, where he was made its director of Asian studies, despite having never visited Asia. In 2007 he briefly left the think tank to become a policy aide for the presidential campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the most liberal of the dozen or so Republican candidates in that cycle. By the time Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010, Needham had again temporarily left Heritage, attending Stanford Business School and dating a Democrat whom he would later marry. There was little in the cards to prefigure his imminent future as the self-designated — and at times deeply reviled — lead driver in the Obamacare demolition derby.

Like virtually every Republican in Washington, Needham was not especially enamored of Trump during the primaries. “Donald Trump’s a clown,” he said on “Fox News Sunday” just a month after Trump announced his candidacy — adding, with evident distaste, “This is a guy who believes in socialized medicine.” Needham’s preferences ran more to Bobby Jindal, and of course to Cruz, whom Needham reflexively referred to by his first name. Still, Needham and his adopted cause had emerged as unambiguous winners of the 2016 election. On the first day of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order to “seek the prompt repeal” of Obamacare.

Thus had Trump and Needham — two men who had never met — become allies. “I think one of the big disagreements we’ve had with the party for a long time is that we think when you’re trying to win an argument, it can only happen when you start them,” the young C.E.O. said as he sat in his Capitol Hill office, looking somewhat fatigued from having spent the previous weekend toilet-training his child. “And this kind of maniacal focus on ‘governing’ ” — his voice taking on a mocking tone — “when all governing means is a bill-signing to get good press, instead of laying out a vision of where you want to take the country, was one of the big divides we had.”

But the long, and at times quixotic, struggle to repeal Obamacare in which Needham has been a lead combatant has more closely resembled a street fight than anything that could reasonably be termed an “argument.” And though it may appear otherwise in a dawning age of Republican near-monopoly on government, the argument is today far from over. According to a January Fox News poll, Obama’s signature program now enjoys a 50 percent approval rating. There is no guarantee that Republicans in the Senate will sign onto legislation that risks leaving millions of their constituents suddenly without health care coverage while alienating key donors — drug makers, insurance companies and doctor associations — who helped shape and support the law Trump now seeks to replace. “The joke around Washington,” the former Democratic congressman Jim McDermott told me, “is that the Republicans are going to repeal Obamacare — and they’ll replace it with the Affordable Care Act.”

The building that houses the Heritage Foundation, on Massachusetts Avenue near the Capitol, stands as an eight-story monument to plain-faced perversity. It was here, in 1989, that the intellectual framework was first developed for what would become the Affordable Care Act. And it is here where Needham has spent the last six years trying to exterminate what he sees as the Frankenstein’s Monster that Heritage inadvertently set loose upon the land.

The basic architecture of the bill that would eventually become the A.C.A. was conceived in 1989 by the Heritage Foundation policy analyst Stuart Butler as a conservative alternative to government-managed health care. It was first put into practice in 2006 by Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who devised his state’s health care policy with the help of two other Heritage health care specialists, Bob Moffit and Ed Haislmaier. But for many decades, conservatives had resisted increasing the federal government’s role in health care. That remained true in 2009, when the newly elected President Barack Obama undertook to pass legislation that would extend health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans.

What Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress ultimately settled on was a framework of health care exchanges — marketplaces where health insurance could be purchased, and had to be, if you weren’t already covered. This was the so-called “individual mandate” first advocated (albeit in the context of a private-sector health care system) by Butler and later embraced by Romney.

Obama opposed the concept as a candidate, in favor of an unspecified plan that he claimed would lower costs. What many Democrats on the Hill — “probably more than half of our caucus,” McDermott says — preferred was a single-payer system, in which health care costs are borne not by insurers but instead by a single fund, typically originating from taxpayers, as Medicare does. But half of the Democratic caucus wasn’t enough for a bill to pass the House, much less the Senate. When a congressional majority failed to materialize for a hybrid measure, known as the “public option,” in which consumers would be allowed to choose among government-run insurance plans as well as private ones, Democrats were left with the individual mandate.

The final 2,700-page legislative package would aim to “increase the quality, availability and affordability of private and public health insurance to over 44 million uninsured Americans,” as the administration put it. Applicants whose income was between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line would be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. Those with incomes at or below 138 percent would now qualify for Medicaid in states that chose to participate in the program. Young people up to the age of 26 were permitted to stay on their parents’ health insurance. Americans with pre-existing medical conditions could not be denied coverage. And a variety of other regulations, taxes, penalties and incentives would be set up to maximize participation on the part of insurers, recipients, physicians and health care centers.

Though the details of the Affordable Care Act, as the final bill came to be called, left plenty of room for disagreement, its fundamental reliance on taxpayer-subsidized health care overseen by the federal government was a concept anathema to most Republicans. In a 28-page memo written by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz in spring 2009, Republicans were urged to use the phrase “government takeover” when referring to the Democrats’ health care package. Less heeded was another admonition in Luntz’s memo: “It’s not enough to just say what you’re against. You have to tell them what you’re for.”

In the end, Republicans lacked the numbers necessary to block the bill. On March 21, 2010, the House finally passed on a party-line vote a version of the bill that was sure to be agreed to by the Democratic-controlled Senate. “We didn’t give in to mistrust or to cynicism or to fear,” Obama, announcing the bill’s passage that night in the East Room of the White House, said. “Instead, we proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.”

The day after Obama signed the bill into law, a four-term Republican backbencher from Iowa named Steve King drafted his own bill in the House to repeal it in its entirety. Since there was no hope of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s considering King’s bill, he had decided to try a rarely successful legislative tactic known as a discharge petition — which, if it gathered signatures from 218 of the 435 House members, would force Pelosi to bring King’s bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote.

A couple of days after King made his move, in mid-June 2010, the two newly minted leaders of Heritage Action — Needham, then 28, and the 32-year old chief operating officer, Tim Chapman — met in the Capitol with Barry Jackson, chief of staff to John Boehner, the House minority leader at the time. Though Jackson today says that he has no recollection of their visit, Needham and Chapman both say they remember it clearly. After explaining the general mission of their new organization, the young conservatives brought up the recently passed Affordable Care Act. Heritage Action, they informed Jackson, intended to push House members to sign King’s petition.

Jackson’s response surprised Chapman and Needham. “He was very clear,” Chapman recalls, “that if we pushed forward on it, we would probably not get all the Republicans on it, and it would be politically detrimental to a lot of Republicans to be on it. He said, ‘I’ve seen all the ads the unions have prepared to run on this stuff.’ I don’t know where he’d seen them. We let off on the gas. We said, ‘We’ll agree to disagree on this one.’ It was the ‘aha’ moment for us: We just don’t see the world the same way.”

As both Chapman and Needham today concede, Jackson might also have had his own “aha” moment, recognizing them as impudent young jerks. Still, their aggression had the full blessing of Ed Feulner, then Heritage’s president, who says fondly of Needham, “He reminded me of myself 40 years earlier.” As for Heritage Action, he said: “We knew we’d be breaking some china.”

Among Republican elected officials, the Heritage Foundation had long been regarded as a tweedy grandfather, revered but not feared. The think tank was proficient at spewing out white papers and keynote speeches. But because of its status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, it could not devote a substantial part of its activities to taking positions on congressional votes or campaigning against political foes. Heritage sat by helplessly in 2003 while President George W. Bush, dismaying conservative purists, promoted and then signed into law a new federal entitlement that used Medicare to extend prescription benefits to senior citizens. Two years later, Heritage could do nothing to rescue Bush’s Social Security privatization measure from defeat. Now, with Heritage Action as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare organization,” the foundation at last had its own squad in the fight. And in Needham, Feulner had a jut-jawed lieutenant whose job, as Feulner put it, would be “to run the flag up the flagpole and see who salutes.”

Steve King’s bill was Heritage Action’s first flag. It had not occurred to Needham and Chapman to see things Barry Jackson’s way — to consider that Republicans’ taking an unambiguous stand to completely repeal Obamacare could cost them House seats five months later. Jackson’s hesitancy to campaign on full repeal was in fact shared by many Republican leaders. One of them, Senator John Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of Obamacare in May: “There is noncontroversial stuff here, like the pre-existing conditions exclusion and those sorts of things. Now, we are not interested in repealing that. And that is frankly a distraction.”

To Needham, there was only one way to look at the matter. “What’s the point in having a conservative party if we’re not going to fight a massive federal intervention in health care?” he told me. “It’s one-sixth of our economy!”

Needham and Chapman knew there were risks in allying themselves with King, an inveterate bomb-thrower with a deep yearning for the spotlight. But King was also a tenacious conservative. On June 16, he introduced his discharge petition, and Heritage Action began sending out emails to the foundation’s 661,000 members, urging them to pressure representatives on both sides of the aisle to sign it — ominously adding in a news release that “those who fail to support this effort are responsible for Obamacare.” The petition soon picked up two highly influential signatories: Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon who was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the House’s internal conservative think tank; and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a staunch conservative and personal hero of Needham’s who refused to vote for Bush’s Medicare bill in 2003.

A month later, Heritage Action turned up the heat on the 34 Democrats — most of them so-called conservative Blue Dogs — who voted against Obamacare in March but had yet to sign King’s discharge petition. In a press statement, Needham declared, “I know their constituents, who will be attending town halls this August, are eager to hear why they do not support the repeal effort.” In September, a single Democrat, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, added his signature. The tally reached 173, well short of what it would take for King’s bill to make it to the House floor — much less to get it passed and then sent over to the Senate, where Republicans’ appetite for abolishing Obamacare altogether was less acute than it was in the House.

But though the discharge petition had stalled, King and Heritage Action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and, eventually, an I-told-you-so. Overall, those who pledged fealty to repealing Obamacare fared better that November than those who didn’t. As King told me recently: “The Barry Jacksons and the John Cornyns were clearly wrong. Look at what happened to the Blue Dogs in 2010. There were 53 of them when Obamacare passed. Now I don’t know if you can count three of them.” King was exaggerating, but not by much — there are 18 members of Congress’s Blue Dog Coalition today. “Pelosi made them walk the plank, and they fell like tenpins after that. Since then, I don’t think there’s been a freshman Republican who didn’t run on the full repeal of Obamacare.”

Bashing Obamacare instantly became a winning Republican message — an indictment of its polarizing namesake, of big-spending Democrats and of the boogeyman of creeping socialism all rolled into one. During the 2010 midterm election cycle, opponents of the A.C.A. spent $108 million on ads pillorying it. As a reward to the 87 Republican freshmen whose victories had enabled the party to retake the House, Eric Cantor devoted part of his first day as the House majority leader to introducing H.R. 2, the “Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act.” It would become the first of more than 50 bills that would pass the House over the ensuing four years designed to repeal, defund, restrict or delay implementation of Obamacare. None of them stood any chance of becoming a law — they were dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But to Heritage Action, they served a purpose: in the organization’s parlance, to “lock in” members, to “orient” the Republican Party to conservative principles so that it would “do the right thing.”

At times, however, what looked like the “right thing” was, from Needham’s vantage, in fact the wrong thing. In April 2011, for example, a bill dismantling part of Obamacare did clear the House and then the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama without hesitation. It was a measure to eliminate the requirement that small companies submit 1099 forms for all transactions exceeding $600, which essentially served as a tax to help pay for the program and which Heritage Action had condemned as “burdensome” and “onerous,” guaranteed to generate paperwork and high accounting fees.

But Heritage Action, because of its ironclad resistance to “partial repeal,” actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision. Yes, it would help small businesses — but then those same small businesses would no longer care to be part of Heritage Action’s crusade. As Needham later told me, “We felt that when anything less than full repeal becomes acceptable, you open the door for every lobbyist in town to say: ‘Hey, while we’re working on full repeal, let’s fix the 1099 issue. Or let’s fix the franchise-restaurant issue’ ” — the popular shorthand for an A.C.A. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week. “You eventually over time whittle off various constituencies that we want to keep as part of the full-repeal platform.” Partial repeal would be well and good if it got rid of what Needham called a “vital organ” of the law: the individual mandate, say, or Medicaid expansion. But “those vital organs were never going to go down if repeal was defined by Washington’s lobbying class. It would be 1099s and these heavily lobbied issues, and then we’ll be stuck with Obamacare.”

In mid-2011, Heritage Action declared that it would “key vote,” or place greater emphasis on, bills it deemed especially relevant as litmus tests of members’ conservative bona fides. Needham also began issuing scorecards on how frequently members of Congress were voting down spending bills. The notion of a 20-something former Giuliani aide grading veteran lawmakers on their principles did not go over well. Representative Rob Wittman of Virginia was taken to task in a Heritage Action analysis for casting only four of a potential 11 votes to cut spending during a series of roll calls; he had to inform Chapman that he had missed those votes because his father had died. (Chapman did not change Wittman’s score but did explain the reason for Wittman’s absence on the Heritage Action website.)

Representative Geoff Davis of Kentucky, a onetime target of Heritage Action’s grading system, fumed to me about the organization’s absolutist browbeating, which came as Republican members were doing their best to thwart Obama’s agenda. “If I’m trying to stop someone’s bleeding on the side of the road, I don’t need to also give them a lecture about how they need to do aerobics and lift weights three times a week,” he said. Echoing the opinion of many Republicans in Washington, Davis asserted that Needham’s operation was less about legislative results than its own fund-raising: “Very quickly, it became a conservative for-profit operation,” he said.

More than once, Chapman recalls, Republican leaders on the Hill called Feulner to say, “You’ve got to rein these guys in.” But Heritage Action had other defenders besides Feulner. The new Republican Study Committee chairman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, felt that Needham’s organization was instrumental in pushing the party rightward. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a rising star in the Tea Party class of 2010, characterized Heritage Action’s messaging as “invaluable.” Even the complaints were tacit acknowledgments of the organization’s growing clout. As a 501(c)(4), Heritage Action was not obliged to disclose its finances, but it was known to have received millions, including $500,000 from the Koch brothers. Rank-and-file-conservative House members pointed with pride to their high Heritage Action scores. Leadership aides saw no choice but to include Needham and Chapman in strategy meetings.

And Heritage Action’s relentless focus on its message — Obamacare is a disaster that must be repealed in full — was already taking its toll. Before the law had even gone fully into effect, polls consistently showed that most Americans disapproved of it. The A.C.A.’s unpopularity persisted despite a number of modifications meant to improve the program and thus quell discontent. As Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary at the time, told me: “The notion from Day 1 was to make this work and listen carefully to the feedback, and to help dampen anxiety without gutting key provisions in the law. What made things difficult was that most of the law wasn’t going to be implemented right away. There was this huge gap in time between designing the bill and actually having the benefits fully in place, which gave a lot of opportunity for the opposition to say, ‘This will kill jobs, pestilence will come, vermin will fall from the sky’ — and very little opportunity for us to say anything other than, ‘Wait and see.’ ”

On this point, if nothing else, Sebelius and Needham could agree: The war on Obamacare would become far more difficult for opponents to wage once the actual benefits became available. New enrollees would begin receiving health care coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. It was a glum axiom among conservatives that once Americans were handed a new entitlement — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance — they were loath to part with it. Moreover, once a gigantic program fully insinuates itself into the federal governing apparatus, disentangling it is a formidable task. “One of my political heroes in town is Don Rumsfeld,” Feulner told me. “And one of Rumsfeld’s rules is that you want to act as quickly and aggressively as you can, because every day someone in the bureaucracy is narrowing the options you’ll have two days later. That’s clearly what’s happening with Obamacare. Every day the options for full repeal get fewer and fewer.”

On Sept. 24, 2013, House Republicans, goaded by Heritage Action and Ted Cruz, drafted legislation in which they agreed to raise the debt ceiling if Obama agreed to a number of conditions, including delaying implementation of his health care law by one year. Senate Democrats objected, but House Republicans wouldn’t budge. As a consequence, the United States Treasury warned it would soon default on its obligations, and on Oct. 1 the government began shutting down. A couple of days later, Tim Chapman met with several senior Republican staff members and members of conservative activist groups in a House conference room.

The shutdown was the crisis point Heritage Action had hoped for — that cherished moment when Republicans finally took a bold, principled stand. The public would express outrage that the president was willing to hold America’s full faith and credit hostage over the much-disliked Obamacare. Democrats would go wobbly. Republicans in both the House and the Senate would stand firm. In the end, Obama would cave. Or so Needham and Chapman hoped. “Kudos to leadership for doing the right thing,” Chapman told the group. “Now let’s prosecute this case!”

His enthusiasm was met with a wall of silence. The others in the room stared at him with a welling resentment. Finally, a tax-policy analyst at Americans for Tax Reform said to Chapman: “You’ve been saying the Republicans need to be brave. Well, we’re doing that. We’ve shut the government down. But what does Heritage Action intend to do to put pressure on the Democrats? So far, the only money you’ve spent over the past few months has been a half-million dollars attacking Republicans.”

Chapman went visibly red-faced. Only a couple of days into the shutdown, it was now occurring to the chief operating officer of Heritage Action that he and Needham had been abandoned by conservative leaders. Within days, the Republicans in the Senate buckled and, with the House Republican leaders in tow, signed a debt-ceiling deal with Obama that said almost nothing about health care. Congress was blamed by the public for causing the shutdown, and its approval ratings plummeted.

Throughout the shutdown, Needham insisted that the public would eventually reward Republicans for standing up to Obamacare. “Look,” he told me at the time, “there’s more Americans who are aware right now of the fact that we have one political party that owns Obamacare and was willing to go to the great lengths of shutting down the World War II Memorial in order to preserve it, and another party that tried to stop it. And Americans deserve that type of clarity.”

This opinion was apparently not shared by Speaker Boehner. In December 2013, he told reporters that groups like Heritage Action had “lost all credibility.” A month later, on the “Tonight” show, he called the government shutdown a “predictable disaster.”

But the continuing intransigence of the repeal advocates was beginning to wear down the White House. Initially, Sebelius says, “we were more focused on the Republican attorneys general across the country who challenged the constitutionality of the law. Until that was resolved by the Supreme Court in June 2012, that was our focus. The congressional action was viewed more as sour grapes and not altogether realistic. Clearly the president wasn’t going to sign anything that would strike down his brand-new law.” By the time of the shutdown, though, the repealers appeared to have succeeded in getting inside the Obama administration’s collective head. As Oct. 1, 2013 — the date HealthCare.gov was to be open for enrollments — approached, little time was available to subject the website to tests that could expose its shortcomings. But “the one thing that wasn’t feasible, knowing how vehemently the Republicans were determined to stop it at any cost, was moving the deadline,” she said. “That would have mobilized the opposition to the point that we might never have been able to launch it at all.”

And so the White House rolled out a deeply flawed website. By this time, the Republican critique of Obamacare was already becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The A.C.A. had been passed with only about one-tenth of the funding that it would need to be fully operational, with the expectation that the rest would be portioned out by Congress annually, through the appropriations process that funds discretionary government programs. From 2011 through 2014, as the House Republicans played round after round of fiscal brinkmanship, Obama reluctantly signed last-minute budget deals that continually shortchanged Obamacare.

“They did a very effective job making sure there would never be enough to fund implementation,” Sebelius told me. “And they came after the budget over and over. Anything that looked like it could be used, they made sure was gone.” That was especially the case, Sebelius said, when it came to educating the public about the program’s benefits — funding that would have made a difference in the 19 states where governors and legislatures had refused to expand Medicaid and had no interest in promoting Obamacare. “Any effort to put in dollars for outreach on the federal level,” she said, “were immediately stripped out.”

It’s impossible to know for sure how much of a role the hobbling of Obamacare played in the outcome of the 2014 midterm elections, in which the Republicans captured the Senate and expanded their majority in the House. But Republicans uniformly campaigned against the program, while Democrats found themselves at pains to demonstrate its virtues. As a bonus for Needham and Chapman, Eric Cantor, the House majority leader had been drubbed in the primary by a Tea Party-backed Republican. In September 2015, Boehner would step down as well.

A month after Boehner resigned, the House considered yet another bill targeting Obamacare. But this one was different from its predecessors. Sponsored by Representative Tom Price, who in just over a year would be Trump’s pick as secretary of Health and Human Services, H.R. 3762 was a “reconciliation bill,” a budgetary measure to defund the health care program that would, in accordance with Senate rules, require only 51 votes to pass in the upper chamber. That threshold was attainable, now that the Republicans had 54 Senate seats. The bigger hurdle was a more arcane one: To qualify for this lower passage threshold as a reconciliation bill, every item in the legislation had to be deemed a budgetary fix, rather than an extraneous provision, by the Senate parliamentarian. Accordingly, it did not include repealing the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. Better to let the Senate legislative aides confer on those matters with the parliamentarian, one staff member who helped write the bill told me.

That approach was not good enough for Needham and Chapman. Heritage Action announced its strong disapproval of the reconciliation bill, instructed members to vote it down and warned that the measure would be key-voted. Insisting that it was “universally acknowledged” that the repeal of the exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion would qualify as reconcilable items, Heritage Action stated that it would be satisfied with nothing less.

The new speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, ignored Heritage Action. On Oct. 23, the reconciliation bill went to the House floor, where all but seven Republicans voted for it. Apoplectic, Needham termed the act a “charade” that “undermines the party’s longstanding position of full repeal.” He added, “We expect the Senate to do better.”

The Senate Republicans did. Their version of the bill included repeal of the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. The parliamentarian ruled that both provisions were extraneous and did not therefore qualify in their present form for a simple-majority vote.

A watered-down version of the bill, which kept the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion but stripped away the ability to enforce either, then passed the Senate and was reapproved by the House. It was sent over to President Obama. On Jan. 8, 2016, he vetoed it. Obama’s final defense of his namesake program would come almost exactly 10 months later, when he received President-elect Trump in the Oval Office and urged him not to eviscerate Obamacare.

Obama’s words, Trump said the following day to The Wall Street Journal, had made him reconsider abolishing the law in full. But 10 weeks later, as one of the very first acts of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order whose mission statement was the “prompt repeal” of Obamacare in its entirety.

The Affordable Care Act’s approval rating has rarely exceeded 50 percent. And over time, as it has strained under the multitude of compromises that were necessary for its passage, it has proved itself worthy of several of the criticisms aimed at it. Though for 80 percent of health care recipients (including those receiving health care from Medicare, Medicaid or their employers) annual rate increases are at historic lows, for the rest the story has been different. The premiums have been rising because of a variety of structural reasons, and because federal assistance to recipients to offset the costs has been in many cases inadequate. Or, as the health-policy analyst Robert Laszewski puts it, “They created a Cadillac with Chevrolet subsidies.” But it is also because unit costs have continued to soar — like the price of prescription drugs, thanks to the sweetheart deal that the pharmaceutical industry cut with the Democrats in exchange for being an early supporter of the law. Some rural states like Alaska have seen very little competition among insurers — something that a public option might have addressed, had the insurance lobby not spent a fortune to defeat that provision. Of the 23 nonprofit insurance co-ops set up by the Affordable Care Act to compete in such areas, only a handful remain — probably at least in part because the co-ops received from Congress only $2.4 billion of the $6 billion originally appropriated to establish them.

To make Obamacare economically feasible for insurers, the program needed to attract a large pool of young and healthy recipients to offset the costs of providing care for the older and less healthy. That ratio has yet to prove satisfactory for many insurance companies — one of which, Aetna, announced last year that it would be abandoning the program in several states. (Aetna publicly blamed Obamacare, saying that it was losing money participating in the exchanges, but a federal judge ruled that Aetna’s real motive was to escape scrutiny for its possibly illegal merger with Humana, and court documents have shown that the company was making money in some states where it was claiming not to.)

Then again, it was always the industry’s expectation that the law would prove flawed in places, and that those shortcomings would be addressed legislatively. As Karen Ignagni, the lead lobbyist for the health-insurance industry during the formation and passage of Obamacare and now president and C.E.O. of EmblemHealth, tactfully puts it: “On the Affordable Care Act, there was a strong difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans going back to the initial days of discussion. And so there was never a coming-together.”

In spite of all this, Obamacare has done far more good than its critics predicted it would. As of 2014, insurers cannot deny coverage to anyone based on their current health status — a meaningful protection for the 133 million Americans with chronic illnesses. Over 15 million poor or near-poor citizens are now receiving Medicaid benefits in the 31 states (as well as the District of Columbia) that have opted for this expansion. Another 3 million Americans under the age of 26 have been allowed to stay on their parents’ health care plans, thanks to the provision in the A.C.A. that Heritage Action warmly refers to as the “slacker mandate.” Meanwhile, during each month that Obamacare has been in existence, the private sector has grown. The bill has not proved to be the “job killer” apocalyptically described by its Republican opponents.

Now that the law is in place, trying to tinker with it in a measured fashion, deciding which parts to discard and which to keep, would be more complicated than simply determining what the public likes and what it doesn’t. As Jim McDermott says: “You can’t just reach in and pull out one thing. It’d be like a doctor doing surgery and saying, ‘Well, since you’re not using your spleen today, let’s take it out.’ It’s all wired together in a very complex way.”

That wiring represents, among other things, the compromises worked out with the various players in the health care ecosystem — doctors’ and nurses’ associations, hospital groups, insurers, drug companies — that enabled the passage of Obamacare in the first place. As Ignagni points out: “It was very unique that all of the different industries were willing to sit at the table and engage in problem-solving together. I don’t really recall any time when that has happened in our economy on any issue.” Collectively, those groups spent close to $273 million on lobbying during the height of the Obamacare debate. They will surely spend a similar sum haranguing Congress to pass a replacement that favors them.

Many conservative remedies have been floated over the years and have been consolidated into Speaker Paul Ryan’s 37-page “A Better Way” summation: expanded health savings accounts, assorted tax credits and refunds, medical-liability reform, portability of insurance from one job to the next and the ability to purchase insurance across state lines. But the problem for Republicans is that Obamacare’s sweeping coverage has changed the paradigm. Of the 31 states that have opted for expanded Medicaid coverage, 16 have Republican governors. None of these governors have expressed a desire to throw their states’ residents off the rolls. At the same time, the fitful and at times rhetorically muddled transition from the known (Obamacare) to the unknown (“something terrific”) has risked throwing the health care industry into turmoil. The aftershocks are likely to be not only economic but also political.

“If you take Obamacare as it looks right now,” says the policy analyst Robert Laszewski, a longtime critic of the legislation, about half of enrollees “don’t get a subsidy because their incomes are too high. They make $90,000 or $100,000 a year but are in the individual market. These tend to be Trump supporters. So if he further destabilizes this thing and there are 20-to-50-percent rate increases, he’ll be screwing his own people.”

Last month, Representative Steve King once again offered his full-repeal legislation, maintaining that in doing away with Obamacare, the country would immediately be “far better off,” even if nothing were done to replace it. To King and Heritage Action, failing to seize this moment of opportunity would constitute a grave betrayal. “It’s pretty clear that the conservative base is expecting Congress to do this,” Chapman told me. “If Congress goes back to the voters in 2018 and people are still enrolling in Obamacare, I think that’s going to be disastrous.” Speaking of the base, Chapman predicted, “They’re basically going to splinter off and create a third party.”

But it took more than the conservative base to elect Donald Trump, and it will take more than them to re-elect many Republican senators and representatives in 2018 and 2020. The rest of the public has begun a decided turn against King’s and Heritage Action’s position. The same Fox News poll last month that found Obamacare’s overall favorability to be 50 percent also found that only 23 percent of respondents favored fully repealing it — a new low since the law was signed nearly seven years ago.

After Trump remarked to The Washington Post on Jan. 15 that he planned to provide “insurance for everybody,” I thought I had better gauge Michael Needham’s reaction. Taken at face value, Trump did not sound much like a man hellbent on tilting health care policy rightward. “I’m concerned when I hear that kind of talk,” King had told me. “I don’t know how deeply he’s gone into the details.”

But Needham chuckled breezily when I brought up Trump’s statement. “I think right now there’s a lot of people who want to jump on words,” he said. “Everybody wants to ensure every American has access to high-quality health care. That is pretty clearly what Trump was saying. What’s the overused phrase? Trump supporters take him seriously, not literally.”

Nor did it seem to bother him that Republicans on the Hill were in a frenzy to develop a consensus for replacement legislation. Up to now, Needham reminded me, the goal had been to inculcate in the party a ceaseless lust for Obamacare repeal. “For the last eight years,” he said, “it hasn’t made sense to litigate the nuance of, Do you use a tax credit or a tax deduction, or what are your views of block-granting?” The Republicans might not end up with a single gargantuan replacement bill, and maybe that was as it should be. “We’re probably in an age where smaller, humbler pieces of legislation are easier to get consensus around.”

This struck me as sensible and, at the same time, somewhat naïve. If, as in Heritage Action’s dream scenario, Obamacare were to be immediately vaporized, it would leave a yawning vacuum — and the first thing to fill it would be anxiety. Every gruesome case of once-insured families now left to die would be duly chronicled by the media. Legislators would panic — but, if recent history is any judge, their reaction would be tame compared with that of the man who now thoroughly owned the post-Obamacare landscape. Was it really so hard, I asked Needham, to imagine Trump faltering under the specter of bad press and equally bad approval ratings and hastily offering up a Trumpcare that bore a suspicious resemblance to Obamacare?

Needham paused for a moment before saying, in a vaguely amazed voice: “I’m a little surprised by the question. Right now, I don’t see much evidence of that playing out.” Trump’s vice president was Mike Pence, “my first hero when I came to Washington.” Tom Price, the nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, and Mick Mulvaney, whom Trump tapped to run the Office of Management and Budget, were longtime supporters of Heritage Action. The former senator Jim DeMint, Ed Feulner’s replacement as president of the Heritage Foundation, was helping to shape the selection of Trump’s prospective Supreme Court nominees. Trump’s team was loaded with Heritage staff members. All this counted for as much as whatever the new president himself thought. “Richard Viguerie, one of the icons of the conservative movement, said to me that what was great about Reagan was that when he walked into the room, you saw your friends and allies walking with him,” Needham told me.

It was a pleasing image, conveying undying fellowship. Yet even Reagan, fierce inveigher against socialized medicine that he was, did not make a dent in Medicare, the program he so loathed, during his two terms in office. Quite the contrary, in fact: He briefly expanded its benefits to include catastrophic care for the elderly before Congress struck down the measure less than a year after Reagan left office.

Now came the president whom Needham once accused of embracing socialized medicine. Maybe he would somehow turn out to be a more reliable friend to the conservative movement than Reagan had been. Or maybe Washington would prove, hardly for the first time, that even the best of friends will let you down.HBO

Before Girls even began, feelings about Lena Dunham, its then 25-year-old creator, ran almost inconceivably hot. Heralded, decried, beloved, dismissed, Dunham was, depending on whom you asked, brilliant, unbearable, fearless, privileged, racist, fat, a product of nepotism, the voice of a generation, or some combination of all of the above. In the five years since, feelings about Dunham have not cooled, but they have stabilized, a roiling pot that has kept roiling—often swamping the television show that started it all and that begins its final, fantastic sixth season this Sunday.

Willa Paskin Willa Paskin is Slate’s television critic.

From the beginning there has been a conflation of Dunham and her alter ego, the monstrous, hilarious Hannah Horvath. Girls, when it first arrived, was praised and critiqued as a kind of millennial ethnography, a reaction encouraged by the realistic tone of the very early series, long since abandoned. Horvath was taken to be a thinly disguised, lost version of Dunham herself—an ambitious but directionless Oberlin graduate with artistic aspirations kicking around Greenpoint on her parents’ dime, having complicated sex and waiting for life to happen. Hannah’s (white) friends were based on Lena’s (white) friends, Hannah’s tattoos were Lena’s tattoos, Hannah’s body was Lena’s body, Hannah’s voice-of-a-generation joke was maybe a not-quite-joke about Lena’s own. Hannah was imperfect, but dancing to Robyn late at night after crafting the perfect elliptical tweet for her 26 followers, she was also recognizable and relatable. As often happens with work made by women, Girls was not received so much as fiction but as memoir.

Watching Girls has always been extra credit when it comes to being a member of the overenrolled Girls Think Piece Club.

Swiftly, Dunham and her co-writer and producer, Jenni Konner, began to write their way out of this particular corner with glorious malice, turning Girls into a blood-letting satire inhabited by enormously watchable characters who could never be mistaken for aspirational ones. Hannah and her friends broke free from the bonds of realism and the handcuffs of likability to became riotous grotesques, larger-than-life narcissists stomping around New York like self-harming Godzillas. Girls’ satire is grounded in familiar human traits—the self-obsession, the gnarly striving, the destructive sexual passion, the competitiveness, the unexpected dashes of love—but these qualities are twisted and amped up, ordinary seeds tended into wild, disfigured, possibly carnivorous jungle plants.

But actually watching Girls has always been extra credit when it comes to being a member of the overenrolled Girls Think Piece Club. Who has two thumbs and an opinion on Lena Dunham? And they say there’s nothing left that unites this country! In a time when many celebrities strive to be as inoffensive as possible, Dunham is, instead, indomitably herself. Having to make one public apology is usually enough to cow a celebrity into safe politesse, but Dunham is indefatigably, uncontrollably impolitic and political, racking up inadvertent controversies and their subsequent mea culpas like pinball points. As Girls’ Hannah Horvath has become a fully fleshed comedic creation, firmly controlled by Dunham and Konner, Dunham has become the more controversial figure of the two. If Hannah was once taken to be a thinly disguised Dunham, Dunham is now seen by some as a thinly disguised Hannah, a talking, tweeting aggravation, much more likely to put people off her show than the challenging heroine in her show is.

After all, the irony of Dunham’s persona is that there is nothing that redeems it quite like watching Girls, something that Dunham-haters are unlikely to do. On Girls, Dunham skewers exactly the kind of blind privilege she is accused of having and makes the case for exactly the sort of stumbling learning she is constantly doing, all contained within a funny, self-aware, prickly television show that has—over its six seasons—proven Dunham’s talent, not her knack for sticking her foot in her mouth.

The new season is shiny and sharp, a neon-colored candy with a puckish and puckering quality. Over the course of Girls’ run, the protagonists have occasionally tipped over from being cartoonish into ultra-horrendous beastly besties, behaving so badly they barely resemble humans. As the new season begins, there are thankfully no monsters on hand, only fools. Hannah has just published a Modern Love column in the New York Times, about Jessa (Jemima Kirke) and Adam’s (Adam Driver) relationship, and it has jump-started her career. Over breakfast with an assigning editor (Hannah eats breakfast, the editor has a coffee), Hannah blithely explains, “I feel like I’m perfect for the aesthetic of Slag Mag, because my persona is very witty and narcissistic … and the other thing about me is I give zero fucks about anything, yet I have a strong opinion about everything, even topics I’m not informed on.” And we’re off.

The first two episodes send Hannah out of the city on delirious adventures. For the aforementioned editor, she heads to Montauk surf camp. After some nice physical comedy involving spilled sunscreen and wetsuits, Hannah discovers she hates surfing. Her bad attitude is transformed by a chillaxed surf instructor (Riz Ahmed), who convinces Hannah it’s easier to love things than to hate them, sending her back to New York with a more positive outlook on life and the cheeseball anthem “She’s So High” ringing in her ears. In the second episode, Hannah takes a road trip with Marnie (Allison Williams) and Desi (Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who is so wonderfully awful as a self-dramatizing goofball that it’s hard to remember he was introduced as a dreamy, if self-obsessed, romantic lead) that turns into a laugh-out-loud send-up of a horror movie.

Peppered throughout these episodes are perfect, hilarious details: Elijah’s (Andrew Rannells) wardrobe, which includes an impeccable double-breasted white blazer and an “I survived season three of Ally McBeal” T-shirt, paired sans pants; Ray (Alex Karpovsky) and Marnie’s passive-aggressive exchanges of “baby”; an unbearable but accurate dissection of Paul Krugman; Adam and Jessa’s house of sexual horrors; naked yogurt-eating; and another contagiously energizing dance scene, a Girls specialty. All of this leads up to the excellent third installment, a bottle episode co-starring Matthew Rhys as a literary giant accused of sexual impropriety, that is a provocation to the think-piece economy, likely to be eye-rolling only to those who judge it merely by its premise.Story highlights Andy Puzder's confirmation process has been delayed because of an extensive background check

The head of the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. is Donald Trump's Labor secretary pick

(CNN) The ex-wife of Labor Secretary nominee Andy Puzder is privately telling senators that she made a mistake decades ago in leveling domestic abuse charges against him and appearing in disguise on Oprah Winfrey's TV show to talk about her situation.

In a deeply personal and emotional letter to senators and obtained by CNN, Puzder's ex-wife Lisa Fierstein said she regrets the decisions she made decades ago as the two struggled with their marriage. She contended that she received bad advice from an attorney with a political "vendetta" when she pressed charges in the 1980s -- and that she was a guest on Winfrey's show in part because she wanted to go on a trip to Chicago.

"What we should have handled in a mature and private way became a contentious and ugly public divorce," Fierstein said to members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, of her ex-husband, who heads the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr.

She did not elaborate on why the attorney would have a vendetta against Puzder, nor did she identify the attorney.

Dan Sokol, an attorney who represented Fierstein at the time, told Time Magazine in December that the allegations that Puzder physically abused his then-wife were "credible and believable." He added that it was described to him as an "ongoing pattern with several episodes of physical violence."

Read MoreUpdate, Feb. 17, 2017: A Clarification: On this edition of Trumpcast, Jacob Weisberg had a back-and-forth conversation with Bill Browder, the investor and author, about how the Trump administration may affect the United States' relationship with Russia. As part of that conversation, they discussed work done by the firm Fusion GPS and its co-founder Glenn Simpson on behalf of the company Prevezon, owned by the son of the vice president of Russian Railways. By that discussion, Trumpcast and Slate did not intend to imply that Fusion GPS or Simpson were directly working for the Russian government or Russian intelligence. Fusion GPS and Simpson state that they have never engaged in any lobbying on behalf of Russia or Russian agents, and they assert that their only work for a Russian entity was in the Prevezon litigation, at the request of the law firm Baker Hostetler. Because Fusion GPS and Simpson do not believe they were engaged in lobbying activity, they contend that they were not required to file under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Photo by Sam Breach

Dear Prudence,

We recently discovered our daughter is pregnant. She is 18 and mentally disabled, and there is a police investigation under way. My wife and I have decided to take her for an abortion, but I question whether this is the right choice to make on her behalf. My daughter knows the basics of what is happening and she keeps talking about her baby. We have the resources and family support to care for this child if it were born. I also know this may be the only chance we have at being grandparents. I need some outside perspective here.

—Maybe Baby

Subscribe to Prudie!

I think the perspective you need here is your daughter’s. The first question is a legal one: Even assuming you have medical conservatorship over your adult daughter (guardianship laws vary from state to state), from your description it does not sound to me as if she is clearly giving her consent to an abortion. Even if you did have guardianship, you would almost certainly need a court order before you were authorized by an abortion provider to give informed consent on her behalf. If you don’t already have a lawyer advising you, I suggest finding one through the Disability Rights Bar Association.

But the most important thing for you and your wife to bear in mind is that your daughter still deserves to have autonomy, whatever her limitations. It sounds as if your daughter was sexually assaulted; I hope you make sure she receives counseling and support for this trauma, regardless of what decision she ultimately makes about her pregnancy. The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, another excellent resource, reminds us that society still suffers from “notions that individuals with mental disabilities are inadequate parents and place their children at high risk of abuse or neglect.” Whether or not you want to have grandchildren should not enter into the decision-making process. You must put aside your own concerns and desires and act in your daughter’s best interest, taking her wishes very seriously into account.

If she does want to carry to term and you and your wife are willing and able to help raise a child, you should again consult a lawyer to consider what the best legal and financial arrangement might be. What if you and your wife become ill or unable to care for a child? Could you have a trust set up, or find additional co-parents who could assist your daughter, if need be? I know time is of the essence, but there are multiple conversations you need to have before you can move ahead either with securing an abortion or with preparing your family for another child. You sound like a deeply caring parent, and I wish you all the best in navigating this incredibly complex situation.

Dear Prudence,

My husband “John” and I are expecting our first child. John’s parents are devout Christians whose lives revolve around their church. They have no idea their son is an atheist, although they know I am. They are assuming that John and I will take our children to church. My husband is extremely nonconfrontational when it comes to his parents. I want him to tell his parents we have no plans to raise our children in a religious tradition, but he won’t do it. Whenever his parents are alone with me, they sneak in questions about my family’s religion and tell me they look forward to John going back to church once he has a family of his own. I don’t want to cause tension with my in-laws, but I don’t want to lie for my husband either. I’d rather have it all out before the baby is born.

I can understand your husband’s reluctance to make waves. He’s got a great setup going: You take all the heat as the identified atheist and he doesn’t have to go to church. But this situation is not tenable. Unless he’s planning on taking your children to church to please his parents and faking religious fervor for the rest of his life, sooner or later he’s going to have to do the unthinkable: be honest with them. You can’t force him into it, but you can tell him that you’re no longer going to lie on his behalf, and that the next time his parents ask you a direct question about their son’s beliefs or church attendance, you’re going to tell them the truth.

Dear Prudence,

An old high school acquaintance recently reached out to me after a volatile breakup with his girlfriend. I have been a sympathetic outlet for him, mostly through text messages. He has started to make unreasonable demands (call me right this minute, you need to move closer, etc.). I don’t respond and eventually he apologizes. After the fifth episode I told him not to contact me anymore. I feel very bad about this. No doubt he needs help (he says he’s in therapy), but I don’t want to put up with his verbal abuse. To be honest, I am worried that he might snap in a violent way. What is the best way to help someone like this? I don’t know anyone else in his life, and live several states away. It seems sad to write him off, but I’m not sure what else to do.

—Afraid to Help

You don’t live near him, and you didn’t have a pre-existing friendship with him. You are not in a position to help this troubled man. The best thing you can do for him (and yourself) is to lose his number. He needs professional help, and it sounds like he’s getting it. If he’s made a specific threat against himself or another person, report it to the local authorities; otherwise, resist the urge to get involved.

Dear Prudence,

My brother-in-law divorced his wife a few years ago. They have three children. After his marriage ended, he started seeing a much younger woman. They have been living together for a long time, and everyone in our family treats them as a married couple. Meanwhile, he has another girlfriend he’s been seeing for over a year now. The whole family knows about this other woman, but no one says anything. I expect you to tell me that it’s not my place to meddle, but I’m having a hard time pretending in front of the live-in girlfriend since I view the whole relationship as a joke on her.

—Can’t Hold My Tongue

I think you can meddle. Meddle cautiously, and with the knowledge that this might very well backfire, but meddle nonetheless. Your brother-in-law has already forced you to be involved in his deception by not even bothering to hide his mistress and then expecting you to lie for him. He’s the one who involved you in his business; you haven’t been following him around, trying to catch him cheating on his girlfriend. In the eternal rule of the playground, he started it.

Odds are decent that your brother-in-law’s girlfriend will resent you for being the bearer of bad news. (They may also be in an open relationship, and she might already know about girlfriend No. 2.) It’s also likely that your partner’s family will blame you for bringing his cheating to light. But if you feel prepared for the potential backlash, go ahead. Break it to her as gently as possible. It sounds like if circumstances were reversed and you were the one being cheated on, you would want to know, but knowing you acted out of principle can be cold comfort when everyone is angry with you for stirring the pot.

Dear Prudence,

I live overseas with a fellow ex-pat I recently married, and I’d like to host his daughter for her gap year. She is sweet, engaging, and wants to learn a third language. Her mother is quite lovely and reasonable. My sister—who wants me to host her daughter as well—is not. My sister makes horrid remarks about other races and expects me to pay for her daughter to come stay with us. She says it will be good for her, but my niece behaves rudely and ignorantly. How do I gracefully tell my sister there’s no way in hell?

—Not in My House

I don’t think it’s particularly important to be graceful in this situation. Your sister sounds like the type of person who thrives on making unreasonable demands of others, then blowing up at them when they “disappoint” her. Deny her that satisfaction. Tell her you’re already hosting your husband’s daughter and won’t be able to host hers, then stop talking. She will likely demand further explanation. Don’t give her any. Luckily for you, you live a continent away and can hang up on her with little fear of an angry knock on your door the next day.

Dear Prudence,

I’m a 31-year-old man who recently came out to his very traditional family after a long bout with depression. I’d been seriously contemplating suicide. The news went even worse than I had feared. My father took his own life out of the deep shame of having such an “irreparable stain upon the family name.” My siblings won’t talk to me. My mother can no longer look me in the face. Horrified and numb don’t even begin to describe what I’m feeling.

I have since opened up to friends about what happened, and even though I’ve been embraced with love, I still feel immense guilt and shame at what my loud mouth has caused. I really need some outside perspective, understanding, and comfort. Please help.

—Devastated

I have started and erased so many responses to your heartbreaking letter. I am so sorry you are in the middle of so much pain and bewilderment and isolation. You must understand that your father’s suicide, as painful and tragic as it is, is not your fault. I’m glad your friends are there to support you. But please also get counseling immediately. You need a mental health professional to guide you through this and to help remind you that you are not, and never could be, the “cause” of someone else’s response to your sexual orientation.

If you find yourself dealing with suicidal thoughts, the Trevor Project (888-488-7386) is a 24-hour national hotline for LGBT people that offers crisis intervention and suicide-prevention assistance. You are carrying an enormous burden right now. Please don’t carry it alone.

Dear Prudence,

Back in September, I had an informational interview over the phone with a well-known professional in my intended field (I’m a college student). It was a big deal that he took time to talk to me at all, and it quickly led to better things. I sent a thank you email immediately and promised to send him a handwritten note “soon,” but because of a variety of factors I still have not sent him the note. I am not generally a forgetful person. Since it’s the New Year, I figure now is the perfect time to get this done. I was planning to write him a letter thanking him for the conversation, then explaining how his advice led to my professional advancement, and perhaps include a small gift as well. Is it too late?

—Forget-Me-Not

I’m of the “better late than never” school. You already thanked him once over email, so it’s not as if you completely ignored him after your conversation. Let this be a reminder to you of the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering. I myself have often fallen prey to its temptations. It feels so good to tell someone “I’m going to do X” before actually having to, you know, do X. Write the note—no gift necessary—and be sure to pay the favor forward when you’re a big shot someday.

Dear Prudence,

So my husband has a best friend from the time they were in diapers. “Steve” was in the Army and served in Iraq but has serious issues that prevent him from holding a regular job. However, he is a delight with my toddler and his service dog. He lives in our guest room and takes care of my toddler while I am at class and my husband works. The house is clean, my son is happy, and we save so much money in child care. My mother says this situation is unnatural but I am happy. I have no problem with living like this for the next decade. Steve makes my husband happy and has nothing else but bad breaks in life (the VA is a joke). Is my mother right?

—Love My Second Husband

A lot of great things are unnatural. Wild bananas are chock full of seeds and taste terrible. People used to throw their waste out of bedroom windows into the street. Natural is overrated, and it sounds like the three of you have a wonderful arrangement. My only question is whether you and your husband are paying Steve for his child care and house-cleaning services. It doesn’t sound like you’re taking advantage of Steve, and all three of you seem happy with your situation, but I’d advise you to look into your state’s laws, especially if Steve is on some form of disability. Your relationship with Steve could be categorized as employment and might require a more official arrangement.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Slate and you, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us.

16. Location, Governing Law

You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. No software from these Services may be downloaded, exported or re-exported in violation of any law including, without limitation, to countries that are subject to U.S. export restrictions.

17. DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY—IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and Slate agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms of Use through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.

ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms of Use, the rules set forth in these Terms of Use will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or we must do the following things:

(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.

(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111

(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to the Commonwealth of Virginia is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in the Commonwealth of Virginia under Virginia law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Slate, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and these Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

NO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND SLATE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.

OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at slateoffice@slate.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1)Your Name; (2) the URL of Terms of Use; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms of Use. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms of Use by using the Services.

17. Separate Terms and Conditions

In connection with your use of the Services, you may be asked to consent to policies or terms and conditions in addition to these Terms, such as our Privacy Policy, available here. Please read these supplemental policies and terms carefully before making any use of such portions of the Services. Any supplemental terms will not vary or replace these Terms regarding any use of the Services, unless otherwise expressly stated.

Before the election, when Donald Trump was still just an unlikely presidential nominee, a conservative under the pseudonym “Publius Decius Mus,” wrote a remarkable essay in support of Trump. The pseudonym alone gave a glimpse into the writer’s thinking. The real-life Decius was a Roman consul who sacrificed himself to the gods for the sake of his embattled army. And in the same way, our internet Decius called on conservatives to embrace Trump—to back the vulgarian who mocked their ideals—for the sake of saving the country as they knew it. “The ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty means that the electorate grows more left, more Democratic, less Republican, less republican, and less traditionally American with every cycle,” he wrote, hailing the real estate mogul as the only figure who understood the stakes, who would beat back these “foreigners” and preserve America’s democratic tradition as Decius saw it. Not a tradition of pluralism, but one of exclusion, in which white Americans stand as the only legitimate players in political life. A dictatorship of the herrenvolk.

Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.

“Decius”—since revealed as Michael Anton, a former George W. Bush administration speechwriter—now works for President Trump. And he isn’t the only figure in the Trump circle who holds these views. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, his former aide Stephen Miller, and right-wing media mogul Stephen Bannon occupy prominent positions in the present administration. Like Anton, they hold deep antagonism to immigrants and immigration, opposition to their equality within American society, and nostalgia for a time when prosperity was the province of the native-born and a select few “assimilated” immigrants. But these aren’t just ideologues with jobs in a friendly administration. They are the architects of Trump’s policy, the executors of a frighteningly coherent political ideology.

What is that ideology? Most Americans think of “racism” in individualized terms. To call someone a “racist,” then, is to pass judgment on his or her character—a declaration that this person doesn’t belong in polite society. It’s why, when faced with the accusation, Americans often rush to deny any prejudice. I don’t have a racist bone in my body, goes the cliché. But individualized prejudice is just one way to think of racism. There’s also institutional bias or systemic outcomes—the things that lead critics to deem the criminal justice system as “racist.” And beyond the material, there’s racism as ideology—a structured worldview defined by support for race hierarchy and racial caste.

Racist ideology ebbs and flows through our history, changing with the shape of American society and the contours of American life. When the South was a vast archipelago of human bondage and labor camps, racist ideology took the form of a widespread belief in black inferiority and underlay the forceful defenses of slavery. When segregation was law and legislators defended lynching on the Senate floor—even though anti-racism had claimed a small foothold in the national consciousness—racist ideology was a virulent and violent “white supremacy.” America still has white supremacists, and they still terrorize nonwhites with harassment and violence. But now that most Americans share a nominal commitment to racial equality—such that the country celebrated at the election of its first black president, more than eight years ago—explicitly racist ideology has cloaked itself in a kind of “nationalism,” outside the mainstream, but not far from its borders.

This nationalism, white nationalism, was the ideology of Anton’s essay, driven by contempt for immigrants and foreigners of all stripes. A century ago, in the preface to Madison Grant’s The Passing of the Great Race, a then-popular work of scientific racism, American eugenicist Henry Fairfield Osborn ably summed up this worldview, which now holds the White House.

Thus conservation of that race which has given us the true spirit of Americanism is not a matter either of racial pride or of racial prejudice; it is a matter of love of country, of a true sentiment which is based upon knowledge and the lessons of history rather than upon the sentimentalism which is fostered by ignorance. If I were asked: What is the greatest danger which threatens the American republic to-day? I would certainly reply: The gradual dying out among our people of those hereditary traits through which the principles of our religious, political and social foundations were laid down and their insidious replacement by traits of less noble character.

This is Decius’ view. It was essentially the ideology behind Trump's campaign, defined by its hostility toward Muslims, marked by its reliance on racist stereotypes of Hispanic immigrants, and not so subtly contemptuous of black Americans. Now, it all but drives Trump’s administration, voiced by key figures and expressed through policy.

The ideological leader of the Trump movement is Sessions, hailed by Bannon for “developing populist nation-state policies” from his somewhat isolated perch in the Senate. Bannon, who avoids the spotlight, gives away the game in his praise of Sessions. “In America and Europe, working people are reasserting their right to control their own destinies,” he wrote in a recent statement to the Washington Post, blasting the “cosmopolitan elites in the media that live in a handful of our larger cities.” Given the demographics of Trump’s support—given the demographics of Europe—this definition of “working people” can mean only one thing: white people. And “cosmopolitan elites” has a long history as a euphemism for Jews and other minorities.

Sessions at least does us the service of being clear about his ideas and priorities. “In seven years we’ll have the highest percentage of Americans, non-native born, since the founding of the republic,” he said in a 2015 interview with Bannon. He continued:

Some people think we’ve always had these numbers, and it’s not so; it’s very unusual; it’s a radical change. When the numbers reached about this high in 1924, the president and Congress changed the policy, and it slowed down immigration significantly. We then assimilated through 1965 and created really the solid middle class of America, with assimilated immigrants, and it was good for America.

In 1924, Congress passed the Johnson–Reed Act, which placed strict limits on immigration. But these weren’t neutral limits, broadly applicable to migrants from all parts of the globe. They were national limits—racial limits. The stakes, for proponents of the law, were nothing less than the survival of an Anglo-Saxon America. In Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925, the late historian John Higham notes how lawmakers and legislators conceived of the project of immigration restriction. “Its champions now largely ignored the economic arguments they had advanced in behalf of the first quota law three years before,” he writes. “Instead, they talked about preserving a ‘distinct American type,’ about keeping America for Americans, or about saving the Nordic race from being swamped.”

To that end, the Johnson–Reed Act placed tight quotas on Southern and Eastern Europeans, particularly Italians and Jews, Africans, and Middle Easterners. It barred Asian immigration entirely. “Without offense, but with regard to the salvation of our own, let us shut the door and assimilate what we have, and let us breed pure American citizens and develop our own American resources,” declared South Carolina Sen. Ellison DuRant Smith during debates over the law. This, for Sessions, is the right approach. Or, as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said to the Post, “Sen. Sessions laid a bit of groundwork ... on matters like trade and illegal immigration. It was candidate Trump then who was able to elevate those twin pillars in a way that cast it through the lens of what’s good for the American worker.”

White nationalism ties the refugee ban to efforts to deny government benefits to legal residents and to Trump’s promise to protect entitlements for those who receive them.

That Sessions brings herrenvolk ideology to American politics is even more apparent from his history beyond the Senate. As the NAACP Legal Defense Fund details in its report on the Alabama lawmaker, “An unrelenting hostility toward civil rights and racial justice has been the defining feature of Jeff Sessions’ professional life.” As a federal prosecutor, Sessions went after black activists for voting rights; as a lawmaker, he praised the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County, which opened the door to laws that disproportionately disadvantage and discourage black voters. This mix of restrictive voting and restrictions on immigration is almost tailor-made to enhance the voting power of one group: white Americans.

As for Bannon, he’s not just an informal spokesperson for President Trump; he is the president’s chief ideologist, and along with Sessions and Stephen Miller, has had a huge hand in crafting the administration’s agenda. To lawmakers, observers, and ordinary Americans, the first two weeks of the Trump era were a blitzkrieg. In short order, and working entirely through executive authority, Trump has launched an ambitious plan to transform American policy toward immigrants, refugees, and the Islamic world, all shaped by someone who once called legal immigration “the beating heart” of the problem in the United States. Thus far, Trump has directed Customs and Border Patrol to “secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall”; he has directed the hiring of 5,000 more border officers, and cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities.

Trump has used his discretion over immigration enforcement to give those officers almost unlimited discretion in instituting deportation proceedings, to include any noncitizen who is deemed a “risk to public safety or national security,” whether they’ve committed a crime or not. And most infamously, he’s declared a ban on refugee admission to the United States and a moratorium on entry from seven majority-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. And in the days since that move, thousands of people—students, professionals, medical patients, and entire families—have been barred from the United States, held in administrative limbo, or sent back to their countries of origin, even if they have valid visas or legal permanent residence in the country.

These weren’t the only executive orders from the first weeks of Trump’s presidency, but they were the most visible—the most controversial. They fulfill key promises of the Trump campaign: a wall, a Muslim ban, and a general crackdown on immigrants and immigration. In keeping with the white-nationalist ideas of that campaign and of the president’s brain trust, they target the stated threats to white hegemony. And they advance the white-nationalist narrative: that America will be made “great again” by preserving the integrity of white America.

If this seems unfair, consider Bannon’s views of Islam. “Islam is not a religion of peace—Islam is a religion of submission,” he said on his Breitbart radio show. “To be brutally frank, Christianity is dying in Europe and Islam is on the rise.” Likewise, in a 2014 speech to a meeting at the Vatican, he declared that the “Judeo-Christian West” was in the midst of a civilizational war with the Muslim world. “There is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global,” he said. “Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act.” Despite the facts of history, which show a complicated and often symbiotic relationship between Islam and the West, Bannon sees nothing but conflict, defined in racial and religious terms.

He’s echoed in more virulent and racist terms by figures outside the White House with strong ties to the administration. Frank Gaffney Jr. is an anti-Muslim activist who, notes the New York Times, worked with Conway when she was a pollster for his organization, sat with Bannon as a frequent guest on his show, and appeared in public addresses by Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser. In an interview with the Times, Gaffney gave his view of Muslims. “They essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions,” he said, in starkly dehumanizing terms, “for the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed.”

Beyond these views is the simple fact that Bannon was once CEO of Breitbart, a media consortium that openly caters to anti-Semites, white nationalists, and various elements of the extreme right wing. The website once featured a “black crime” section and openly praises white supremacists. The website’s most visible contributor, Milo Yiannopoulos, is a racist and misogynist provocateur who delights in Nazi iconography and other fascist kitsch.

Stephen Miller has a lower profile than either Sessions or Bannon, but he’s made his mark as a staffer for the former. “You could not get where we are today with this movement if it didn’t have a center of gravity that was intellectually coherent,” said Bannon of Miller in an interview with Politico Magazine. “And I think a ton of that was done by Sen. Sessions’ staff, and Stephen Miller was at the cutting edge of that.” As a student at Duke University, the now–30-year-old Miller worked closely with Richard Spencer, then a graduate student who would leave the academy and become an intellectual leader for the “alt-right,” an online movement of white nationalists. And as a columnist for the campus paper, Miller worried that “immigrants from non-European countries were not assimilating.”

Last year, as a key member of Trump’s presidential team, Miller had a strong hand in guiding the Republican nominee’s rhetoric on Muslim immigration. My colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley notes that Miller likely wrote the Trump speech that “complained darkly that Muslim communities within the United States were sheltering terrorists.” “[I]mmigration is probably the most, in Stephen’s view, one of the most existential issues facing us right now,” says a former colleague of Miller in an interview with the Atlantic. He is just as instrumental to the direction of the Trump White House as Sessions and Bannon, just as committed to an ideology of exclusion and white hegemony.

We can’t know for certain how many Americans voted for these ideas and this approach. What we can say is that tens of millions experienced Donald Trump’s campaign, heard his racist appeals, and set them aside to take a chance on an “outsider.” Now we’re faced with the extraordinary: A White House whose chief thinkers and architects are white nationalists, keepers of a dangerous tradition in our history, with an unprecedented opportunity to pull the United States back a century to an era of unvarnished nativism and prejudice. The past three weeks are likely just the beginning; we are sure to see even more action against immigrants and Muslims, even more tolerance for the worst forces in American life.

In this usage, white nationalist isn’t a pejorative; it’s the best term we have for the ideology of the Trump administration, one that gives coherence to its actions and approach. White nationalist helps us see how the expansive refugee ban is tied to the efforts to deny government benefits to legal residents and is tied to the promise by Trump to protect entitlements for those who receive them. It helps us see how his “populism” excludes tens of millions of Americans, and why he seems more interested in narrow enthusiasm versus broad popularity. And it gives a sense of what might follow in a Trump administration: not just demonization of disfavored minorities but possible attempts to expand the welfare state for the “deserving,” defined by race—a kind of welfare chauvinism. As he did during the campaign, Trump may adopt slogans and ideas from the left and right, not because he’s really a conservative or really a liberal, but because white nationalism exists outside the familiar divide. It confounds the left-right spectrum as we understand it in the United States. Trumpish policy won’t fall neatly into our old categories of liberal and conservative. Instead, it will turn on the question of what strengthens this basic notion that ours is a white nation.

Democrats, liberals, leftists, and dissident conservatives can dissent and resist, but the only party with the power to challenge Trump and win is the Republican Party, which controls Congress and may soon (again) have a majority on the Supreme Court. But the GOP is too complacent and complicit in the rise of Trump, too willing in its past and present to tolerate or even encourage appeals to white racial tribalism and ethno-nationalism. Indeed, in some regards, Trump is the logical conclusion of a process that began when Barry Goldwater opened his arms to Southern segregationists in his crusade for “liberty.” Besides, Republican leaders like Paul Ryan have embraced Trump as a vehicle for their conservative ideological agenda, content to back the president’s agenda for racial exclusion as long as he cuts health care, cuts taxes, and delivers the federal judiciary.

Defenders of pluralism have a tremendous struggle ahead of them. But as they mobilize and defend, they must understand the stakes. This is a fight to protect our multiracial democracy. It’s the latest in an old fight, one that goes back to our Reconstruction, when freedmen, freemen, and their white allies tried to build true democracy in the former Confederacy. They lost that battle, beat back by reaction, by “redeemers.” A century later, with the civil rights movement, we thought we had won the war. Not quite.

“There is beauty in art, in literature, in science, and in every triumph of intelligence, all of which I covet for my country,” said Charles Sumner in his appeal for a national civil rights bill in the fall of 1871. “But there is a higher beauty still—in relieving the poor, in elevating the downtrodden, and being a succor to the oppressed. There is true grandeur in an example of justice, making the rights of all the same as our own, and beating down prejudice, like Satan, under our feet.” He continued: “Humbly do I pray that the republic may not lose this great prize, or postpone its enjoyment.”

We seem to have entered a time where, by choice, we have postponed the enjoyment of that higher beauty. Let us pray, like Sumner, that we do not lose the prize altogether.“Our show tapes at 6:30,” Seth Meyers explained as he began his “A Closer Look” segment on Thursday night. “Usually, we start writing ‘A Closer Look’ the night before; by 1:00 p.m. today, we had a draft about Republicans’ attempts to repeal Obamacare that we felt good about. And then Donald Trump held what can only be described as a batshit crazy press conference.”

Here’s Stephen Colbert making sense of Thursday’s horrifying events on the fly, to begin The Late Show: “I am your host Stephen Colbert, and wow. I am glad you could be here on this historic evening, because Donald Trump held his first solo press conference as president …. It just happened, actually. We’re recording this in the early afternoon. It literally just finished. What I’m saying is this is fresh. It must be fresh because you can smell it.”

And here’s a very grim, troubled Trevor Noah, echoing Meyers’ claims of a rewrite: “We had a really nice show planned for you. Very civil, very calm. And then, in the middle of the day, Hurricane Trump happened—again.”

Donald Trump’s bizarre, winding, frighteningly erratic press conference on Thursday had late-night comics scrambling as to adequately make sense of it. The amount of remarkable details—Trump’s “All Black People Must Be Friends” comment, his repeated lie about the size and historical significance of his victory, his stunning attacks on the media, his contradictory comments regarding “real leaks” and “fake news” and whether his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn did anything wrong, his demand that a Jewish reporter expressing concern about an uptick in anti-semitism “sit down” and “be quiet,” and on and on—rendered any cogent summation impossible. Noah and Meyers’ teams cut together highlight reels, making clear just how unsettling the whole charade was, while Colbert turned to news anchors’ bewildered, and in most cases disturbed, reactions. “Words fail me,” as Colbert admitted.

Noah probably came closest to capturing the essence of what we all bore witness to on Thursday, in channeling Trump’s performance: “I’m not drunk. You’re all drunk. You’re all drunk. This my motherfucking house. This my motherfucking house. Goony goo-goo. Goony goo-goo.”Patrick Harbron/CBS

The first voice you hear in The Good Fight belongs to Donald Trump. It wasn’t meant to be that way: Robert and Michelle King had conceived their CBS All Access spinoff of The Good Wife beginning with a victory lap for liberal law partner Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), whose office décor prominently featured a grip-and-grin photo of her and Hillary Clinton. But instead, thanks to some close-to-the-wire reshoots, we open on Diane’s face frozen in shock as she sits in a darkened room watching Trump take the oath of office.

The episode’s title, “Inauguration,” does double, and maybe triple, duty. It’s a new day in America, if an exceptionally gloomy one, and it’s a new era for Diane, who quits the firm she co-founded with plans to retire to the south of France, only to lose her life’s savings in a Madoff-like investment scheme. It’s also a new era for CBS, which is using the extension of its most acclaimed show—if far from its most popular—to break ground for original scripted programming on its subscription streaming service. (It was supposed to be joined by Star Trek Discovery, the franchise yang to The Good Wife’s yin, but that troubled production has already shed one showrunner and is now scheduled for later this year.) Although the original series was nominated for 42 Emmys and won five, including two for star Julianna Margulies and one for her (sometimes virtual) co-star Archie Panjabi, its frequent losses to shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones clearly stuck in the Kings’ craw. Towards the end of the show’s run, CBS took to running “For Your Consideration” ads highlighting the difference between The Good Wife’s 22-episode season and cable shows’ eight to 13, which is a little like an early primate complaining about the unfair advantage of opposable thumbs.

That being the case, you might expect The Good Fight to run with the advantages of its tidy 10-episode first season. But the two episodes available in advance of its February 19 premiere show the Kings and co-creator Phil Alden Robinson trying to balance the comforting familiarity of a broadcast show with the freedoms of nonlinear TV, and not immediately succeeding in either realm. Even the show’s distribution feels caught between two stools. The first episode will premiere simultaneously on CBS and CBS All Access, while subsequent streaming-only installments will arrive at a weekly clip. The staggered delivery of broadcast meets the additional cost of streaming: The worst of both worlds. Although The Good Fight’s images are letterboxed to give them an added veneer of class, it looks to be shot on a substantially smaller budget than its prestige predecessor. The pilot’s credit sequence, which features a succession of office furnishings exploding in slow motion to the Ren Faire strains of David Buckley’s theme song, reeks of a desperate attempt to seem “edgy,” like a recently divorced dad showing up with a fresh tattoo.

The Good Fight’s episodes are studded with f-bombs—FCC-safe alternate takes were shot for the pilot’s broadcast version—but the show thus far shows little inclination to run with the freedoms afforded by its medium. It’s not even as adventurous as The Good Wife, which regularly took advantage of its longer seasons to build episodes around innovative structural gimmicks. In its first two episodes, The Good Fight has its hands full moving Cush Jumbo’s Lucca Quinn to center stage and introducing Diane’s goddaughter Maia Rindell (Rose Leslie), a novice lawyer whose fledgling career is almost immediately torpedoed by her involvement in the same financial scandal that wiped out Diane’s retirement savings. Diane and Maia’s attachment to that Ponzi scheme makes them both toxic, especially among Diane’s former allies; like Madoff’s fund, this one purported to do good as well as turn a profit, and Diane vouched for it with liberal friends and organizations, all of whom are similarly devastated by the loss. But they find a home at Lucca’s new firm, a largely black concern run by Delroy Lindo’s Robert Boseman.

Dealing with race was never The Good Wife’s strong suit, but the Kings seem intent on attacking the issue full-bore here. In “Inauguration,” Diane defends the city of Chicago in a police brutality suit involving four white officers and a black victim; when Robert’s partner, played by Justified’s Erica Tazel, balks at bringing Diane on board, he quips that she’s a “diversity hire.” Tazel’s Barbara Kolstad takes an immediate dislike to Diane: It’s clear she sees her as a typical white liberal, a pre-intersectional feminist whose solidarity is only skin deep. And though we’re naturally in Diane’s corner, the show gives us some reason to agree with that assessment. In the second episode, “The First Week,” Diane needs to hire a new assistant, and she bypasses the black candidates Barbara has lined up in favor of a familiar white face: Sarah Steele’s Marissa Gold. Granted, Marissa’s also taken the initiative and provided critical assistance on a new case, but there’s still something slightly ugly about the way she uses her previous connections to jump the queue, and the show doesn’t shy away from it.

The Good Fight is timid in other ways, though. One of The Good Wife’s most distinctive features was its brutal realism about the amoral workings of the legal system: Sometimes our heroes were on the right side, sometimes the wrong, but in either case who won was solely the function of who played the better game. In The Good Fight, there’s a scene in the pilot where Diane explains to idealistic Maia that every client deserves vigorous representation, the kind of One-L civics lesson The Good Wife took for granted its viewers already understood. As the show’s most prominent new character, Maia ought to get the most real estate in its opening episodes, but there have been so many stories about naïve attorneys discovering what the law is really like, and Leslie’s wide-eyed anxiousness adds nothing new to the mxi.Riggs Bank was a Washington institution for over a hundred years. More than 20 U.S. Presidents—from Lincoln to Nixon—banked at Riggs, whose headquarters across the street from the Treasury Department was pictured on the back of the old $10 dollar bill.

In its golden age in the 19th century the bank financed Samuel Morse’s development, lent the federal government $16 million for the Mexican-American War, and supplied the funds to expand the capitol building and build the Washington Aqueduct system. Finally in 1865 it lent $7.2 million in gold to Secretary of State Sewell to purchase Alaska from Tsar Alexander II.

But this place at the center of power in Washington eventually led to some ugly business deals, which resulted in Riggs’ downfall in 2004.

Today, chances are that if you’re a native Washingtonian, you’ve walked by one of the former Riggs branches and not even known it. The iconic PNC banks in Dupont Circle and in Georgetown both used to be Riggs buildings. You can still faintly make out the outline of “Riggs National Bank” under the Dupont Branch Building’s brass lettering.

Trouble started brewing in the 1980s, when the CIA came to Riggs with a covert international affairs project. Working through the Saudi royal family (who banked at Riggs), the CIA provided funds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and the anti-Soviet Mujahideen in Afghanistan.

Riggs also had a more sinister relationship with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Senate hearings in 2004 shed light on to the ethically troubling story. Senator Carl Levin found that “In 1994, top Riggs officials traveled to Chile and asked General Pinochet, a notorious military leader accused of involvement with death squads, corruption, arms sales and drug trafficking if he would like to open an account at Riggs Bank here in Washington, DC. Mr. Pinochet said yes.”

Riggs was ultimately hit with $45 million in money laundering fines as a result of the scandal. Business went downhill quickly in the 2000s. The bank’s leadership was spending an inordinate amount of time pursuing embassy business that was prestigious, but “break even, or less,” according to PNC bank’s CFO. (At one point 95% of the foreign embassies in Washington banked with Riggs.)

The embassy business was high risk and had Riggs executives flying to client meetings around the world on an expensive corporate jet. The elegant Riggs buildings also became a liability, further adding to the bank’s high overhead. The scandals and debts continued to mount, and in 2004 Riggs was swallowed up by PNC Financial Services Group. The former Riggs Bank headquarters is now a publicly accessible Bank of America.Win McNamee/Getty Images

President Trump’s meeting on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed that he has no understanding of Middle East politics or of what a peace treaty with the Palestinians would require.

Trump believes that his desire for a deal puts him halfway toward achieving one and that his close friendship with Netanyahu moves him a bit closer still. He doesn’t get that Netanyahu doesn’t need or want a peace deal with the Palestinians at this point. Nor do the Palestinians; nor do the Sunni Arab countries—Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates—that Trump wants to drag along to the table.

Israel has improved its security in the past year by forming an alliance with the Sunni Arab leaders, who share a loathing for Iran and Shiite militias. This alliance is on the verge of strengthening its bonds by agreeing to a deal in which Israel would share intelligence about their common enemies. For that reason, though, the last thing that any of them wants is to start up talks with the Palestinians. The Arab leaders must maintain at least rhetorical support for the Palestinians, lest they spark protests by many of their own people. For the same reason, they can’t be seen as signing with Israel too openly. For them to take a seat at Israeli–Palestinian peace talks—as Trump wants them to do in an idea he calls an “outside-in” approach—would risk raising all the issues that they want to avoid discussing.

At the press conference, Netanyahu couldn’t have been clearer about his hesitance to get into the whole business. Trump, at one point, said excitedly, “I think we’re going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand, so that’s a possibility.”

Get Slate in your inbox.

He turned to Netanyahu, who said nothing. Trump went on: “So let’s see what we do!”

Netanyahu replied, almost inaudibly, “Let’s try.”

Trump laughed off the reticence. “That doesn’t sound too optimistic,” he said, adding, in his own optimistic spin, “Good negotiator.”

Netanyahu recited the longstanding preconditions for any kind of serious talks—that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and cede the security and control over the West Bank.* In an ideal world, those might be the final points of a peace negotiation. In the real world, no Palestinian would accept them as the first points.

Another sign of, let us say, Trump’s unfamiliarity with the region’s politics was his answer to a reporter who asked whether he supported a two-state solution—to which the last several U.S. presidents have paid allegiance or at least lip service. His reply:

So I’m looking at two states and one state. And I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one … To be honest, if Bibi and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians, are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best.

Trump may have thought that his answer was shrewd and pragmatic, but in fact it was neither. First, the Palestinians are not going to enter into any negotiations that don’t set their own state as a goal. Second, on the few occasions when these peace talks have borne fruit, they do so only because the United States—usually the president himself—has pushed both sides to a common position. The United States must do this because the two parties are incapable of doing it themselves. This means that the United States must have a strategic vision going into the talks. Trump clearly doesn’t have one. The fact that he’s indifferent about the outcome is proof of that.

There are several reasons Trump doesn’t have a strategic goal. First, he may not think he needs one. He seems to believe that, in general, international relations aren’t much different from the real-estate transactions that made him rich and famous; it’s all about the deal. He doesn’t recognize that in real-estate transactions the basic premises of the deal—the existence of a capitalist society, the body of statutes pertaining to property rights and contract law, the various city and state building codes—are accepted by all parties. Much about peace talks, especially Middle East peace talks, concerns wrangling over the basic premises.

The second reason he doesn’t have a strategic goal is that the National Security Council and its interagency bodies don’t yet exist. The NSC’s Deputies Committee tees up issues and lays out options, but Trump hasn’t yet appointed any of the officials who make up the Deputies Committee—the deputy or undersecretaries of the Departments of State, Defense, Treasury, and so forth. So far, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have spent much of their time assuring allies that Trump doesn’t mean some of the things he’s said and that America’s commitment to their security is rock-solid. They haven’t got around to making or discussing policy—not just about the Middle East but about much of anything.

Trump did say, at the press conference, that both Israel and the Palestinians would have to compromise, turning to Netanyahu and saying, “You know that, right?” He also told Netanyahu, “I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,” adding, “We’ll work something out.” Netanyahu looked a little nonplussed, though Palestinians aren’t likely to view the exchange with glee. To “hold back” for “a little bit” is vague, if not disingenuous, given Israel’s vast settlements, its new law legalizing even small confiscations of land, and Trump’s appointment as Israel envoy of David Friedman—his bankruptcy lawyer, whose views about settlements veer far to the right of even Netanyahu’s. Still, those looking for the slightest glimmer of light may find some in that line.

One curiosity of the Trump–Netanyahu press conference—their first meeting since Trump became president—was that it took place just after the Israeli leader’s car pulled up to the White House driveway, before any meeting between the two men. Usually, these sorts of press conferences take place after a meeting, so the two heads of state can say what they talked about.

But really the two had nothing to discuss at this point. Netanyahu came to Washington for one reason: to hear the new American president say, “I love you, I love you, I love you” and “I hate Iran, I hate Iran, I hate Iran.” Trump did all that, and Netanyahu beamed. But Trump is kidding himself if he sees this as a harbinger of peace. Netanyahu, who rarely kids himself, knows that it’s no such thing, and he beams all the more because of it.Slam Dunk: Michael Jordan Wins Trademark Dispute In China

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ng Han Guan/AP Ng Han Guan/AP

China's top court has handed basketball legend Michael Jordan a victory in a long-running trademark dispute over the use of his name by a Chinese company.

"Nothing is more important than protecting your own name, and today's decision shows the importance of that principle," Jordan said in a statement after the ruling. Here's more from Jordan:

"Over the past three decades, I have built my reputation and name into a globally recognized brand. From my earliest playing days in the NBA, through my trip to China last fall, millions of Chinese fans and consumers have always known me by my Chinese name, 'Qiaodan.' Today's decision ensures that my Chinese fans and all Chinese consumers know that Qiaodan Sports and its products have no connection to me."

The ruling by Supreme People's Court overturns a previous ruling from a lower court that favored Qiaodan Sports Co., which makes sportswear and shoes and had registered the name as its trademark. The company has no relationship to the Nike Air Jordan brand.

Jordan is widely known as Qiaodan in China, and he initially filed a lawsuit against the company in 2012.

The court "approved Jordan's appeal that the trademark of his name's translation in Chinese characters infringed on his right to own his name and violated the country's trademark law," according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.

This company is not subtle; according to Xinhua, it also used "Jordan's old jersey number 23, basketball player logo and even names of his children." As NPR's Becky Sullivan has reported, the company does hundreds of millions of dollars of business annually, with some 6,000 locations in China.

After the ruling, Qiaodan "defended its actions but said it would respect the court's decision," The Associated Press reported.

The court's chief judge Tao Kaiyuan "said there was an established link between Jordan and the Chinese characters for 'Qiaodan,' which are commonly used by the public when referring to the former basketball player, meaning that Jordan was entitled to protection under the Trademark Law," according to the wire service.

However, it's not a completely clear-cut victory: Xinhua added that court also "ruled that the former Chicago Bulls star does not own the right of name for Qiaodan, Chinese pinyin transcription of his surname Jordan."

That means the company can use the word "Qiaodan" in Roman letters, but not in Chinese characters. The court said "there was not sufficient evidence to show that Chinese consumers associated" this version with Jordan, according to The New York Times.

The case could have broad implications; the Times calls it a "landmark decision that lays out ground rules for protecting personal names in trademark cases."

In a country where foreign companies regularly come up against trademark disputes, lawyers tell the Times that this "establishes the scope of protection for personal names in trademark cases, indicating that foreign celebrities can successfully challenge third parties that use the Chinese characters of their names in China."Each day, Slate features an article from Atlas Obscura, the website dedicated to the world’s hidden wonders.

In the Tokyo metropolitan area, where nearly everything is crammed for space, about 40,000 square feet of land is designated for Nishi Rokugo Park, one of the strangest and most innovative playgrounds world-round—made nearly entirely out of tires.

Nishi Rokugo Park is filled with more than 3,000 rubber tires recycled from the nearby Kawasaki manufacturing plants. As you enter, an enormous, two-story Godzilla made from stacked tires will greet you with a cheesy set of canine teeth, a walk-through 66-foot tail, and human-sized hands at the end of its tire-studded arms.

After walking atop an endless row of half-submerged tires, playground-goers will find even more peculiar sculptures, including a 16-tier tire rocket and a quirky tire robot.

Naturally, there's a giant tire swing, which hovers in the middle of the park. Further along is climbable jungle gym of multicolored poles with—you guessed it—tires wedged in between. Perhaps the most fun (and adult-sized) activity at Nishi Rokugo is the tire slide, where sleds are replaced with stray tires that can be ridden down a concrete tire tubing hill.

Unlike most playgrounds, Nishi Rokugo Park is not used solely by children; elderly Japanese men and women often frequent the park to enjoy the scene and admire the tire sculptures. Free and open around the clock, Nishi Rokugo will never tire out your sense of fun.My drug-company habit started innocently enough—a pen here, a lunch there. But soon I hit the harder stuff: a trip to Italy in exchange for attending a symposium, tickets to a Mets game for my sons and me (and a chatty drug rep). Et cetera. There's a moment when each of us knows we have gone over the edge. For me, it was a trip to California where I met with a pharmacist for 30 minutes to talk about antifungal medication.

And so now I am in recovery. I have not taken money or meals or pens or trips or any of it for about a year. It is hard, but every day I wake up and tell myself, today I will not take money from a drug company. Today I will stay clean.

There remains one problem—I don't feel that much shame for my former behavior, at least the money-grubbing part. I just don't think that the financial hanky-panky between drug companies and doctors constitutes the central crisis in American medicine or, for that matter, the most corrosive aspect of the entire messy doctor-drug relationship. They need us; we need them. We do the studies they can't do because they aren't doctors. They invent the drugs that we can't invent because we aren't chemists. It's pretty straightforward, really. A symbiosis.

Which isn't to say either side is particularly admirable. Estimates are that pharma spends $8,000 to $13,000 per doctor marketing its various products. Most of the promoting is done in the name of physician education. Yet, like the trip to Italy, it is generally a faintly camouflaged bribe, offered with a wink and a promise of more to come. In exchange for the business-class tickets, the doctor indicates (unofficially, of course) that he will prescribe more of product A, which is made by the crowd that paid for the Italian adventure, than drug B, which is made by a company that hasn't ponied up (yet).

It's a sleazy proposition all the way around. But as Calvin Coolidge once said, the business of America is business. Successful businesses want to sell as much as they can, as fast as they can. So doctors end up with meals and pens and trips and bogus advisory-board positions and, of course, the hordes of fine-looking well-perfumed young men and women—some literally cheerleaders—who hustle their way through physicians' offices.

Despite its successes, the pharma business model does have a problem. The drug reps, foot soldiers in the mercantile crusade, don't know what they are talking about. Unlike a shoe salesman or the guy who sold you your laptop, the drug rep is 100 percent lost. Imagine buying a car from someone who's never had a driver's license—that's how the doctor-drug relationship plays out. None of the people trying to convince me to prescribe product A ever has prescribed product A—or product B or product C for that matter. None has ever experienced the elaborate mess that is routine patient care. The freebies seek to redress this imbalance by making the exchange seem worthwhile.

And so does the drug-company tactic that, unlike meals and frequent-flier miles, poses a real if subtle danger. In place of expertise, the drug reps offer flattery—and with it, a revival of the old cosmology that puts the doctor at the center of the universe, as infallible as he was in the good old days.

Alas, we doctors are easy targets. We feel unappreciated by our patients and by the public. The way we see it, we're just a bunch of blue-collar Joes with a degree, traveling through rain and sleet and snow trying to keep people healthy. Like the president, we think it's hard work and, also like Mr. Bush, we are genuinely shocked that everyone doesn't love us.

Enter the drug reps. Those guys love me; they really love me. I have my own personal troupe of professional grovelers who are paid to laugh at my jokes. You should join me when a few are in my office. It is a laugh riot. And you should hear the compliments I get after giving a paid lecture. My back is patted. I receive countless business cards and compliments.

All of this upsets the physician's internal balance. Doctors make countless decisions every day, and lots of them are wrong. Rethinking the errant judgment is a crucial private exercise. But once the tune of the drug-rep marching band gets going, it drums out reflection. The lonely, monotonous routine of doctoring gives way to the cheap thrill of low-grade celebrity.Spencer Platt/Getty Images

In the wake of President Trump’s nativist crackdown, mayors in left-leaning cities have defiantly proclaimed that their cities will remain “sanctuaries” where immigrants can find refuge. The definition of a sanctuary city is somewhat murky: At minimum, it is a locality that won’t hold suspects for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or allow their police officers or sheriffs’ deputies to do the work of federal immigration agents. But for many immigrants, such protections mean nothing at all.

It’s not just tough-on-crime Republicans that preside over a criminal justice system that today serves as the front door for a massive deportation pipeline. Every day, police and prosecutors in Democratic Party–controlled cities fuel mass incarceration by arresting and charging people for low-level nonviolent offenses. An arrest for jumping a turnstile or a minor drug charge could result in a person’s separation from his or her family forever.

America is the most incarceratory nation in the world—in 2015 alone, police made an estimated 11 million arrests. For undocumented immigrants, an arrest can trigger detention and deportation by ICE. And that’s true even if a self-described sanctuary city refuses to detain someone upon federal request. The fingerprints police collect when booking someone into custody are automatically shared with federal immigration authorities, whether that police department wants to share them or not. A fingerprint match alerts ICE that a suspected undocumented immigrant has been arrested. ICE agents can then find that person, detain them, and deport them. If ICE wants to detain someone, they can find and detain them anywhere in the United States regardless of whether local officials are cooperating.

Now, under Trump, a man who has declared that the Mexican government is coordinating the mass migration of rapists to the United States and that Muslims pose an existential threat to the West, things could get far worse. On Friday morning, the Associated Press reported the existence of a draft memo that indicates the Trump administration is considering the unprecedented step of deploying 100,000 National Guard troops “to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States.” As of last year, ICE employed roughly 5,800 deportation officers. (The White House has denied it is considering such a policy but did not deny the existence of such a memo.) With more boots on the ground, the imperative for local criminal justice officials is clearer than ever. As long as police and prosecutors continue to arrest and charge people for low-level offenses, sanctuary cities simply aren’t safe for undocumented immigrants.

Recently, the administration began an end run around self-proclaimed sanctuary cities. In Travis County, Texas—which includes Austin, the state’s liberal mecca—Sheriff Sally Hernandez promised recently to ignore most ICE detainers or requests to detain an immigrant. But according to a news report last week, immigration officials obtained federal arrest warrants for at least 42 immigrants, charging most with federal felonies for illegally re-entering the United States. By using judicial arrest warrants instead of detainers, ICE is now requiring rather than requesting that immigrants be detained—and Hernandez was thus compelled to turn them over to the feds.

ICE also identifies, detains, and deports immigrants after they have been convicted of a crime, including very minor ones. Even lawful permanent residents who have spent their entire cognizant lives in the United States can be deported as the result of a minor drug-dealing conviction. For undocumented immigrants, incarceration in state prison will also tip off the feds: If you’re locked up, they’ll know exactly where to find you.

Harsh and inhumane federal immigration laws are, of course, the fault of the federal government. But as long as local law enforcement shares information with ICE, everyday policing and prosecution are complicit in Trump’s crackdown. For decades, mainstream Republicans and Democrats have turned local criminal justice systems into the grease that smooths the federal deportation machine’s operation. It was legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996 that made it so easy to deport lawful permanent residents for minor crimes. And it was the Secure Communities program initiated under President George W. Bush and rolled out under President Obama that has rendered local police de facto immigration agents and made it virtually impossible for states or localities to opt out.

Trump undoubtedly poses a historic threat to immigrants. But local elected officials and prosecutors cannot just shrug their shoulders and blame mass deportations on Washington politicians. Local district attorneys are responsible for the vast majority of prosecutions that result in incarceration. These local prosecutors must also take responsibility for the massive deportation campaign that Trump has pledged to undertake. Simply ignoring federal detainer requests isn’t enough to make a city a real sanctuary.

Purportedly progressive mayors are offering a false sense of security.

Sanctuary cities were a critical victory won by activists. They were implemented because outraged immigrant communities—with assistance from federal courts that found detentions raised serious constitutional issues—successfully pressured cities to refuse to cooperate with federal detainer requests. In Washington, that pressure led Obama, who had carried out mass deportations, to more narrowly define which immigrants would be prioritized for removal, amongst other reforms. But Obama left the program’s basic information-sharing architecture in place and ready for full deployment by the most nativist administration in recent U.S. history.Photo: Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS

Beyoncé lost. Again.

By now, you know what happened. For the third time, Beyoncé Knowles lost the Grammy for Album of the Year. But this time, it seemed beyond disbelief, not because she happened to lose to Adele for 25, but because Beyoncé’s album Lemonade — the best and most important work of her career — still couldn’t find a way to win.

What more is Beyoncé supposed to do?

A recap: This year it was 25 over Lemonade. In 2016, Taylor Swift’s 1989 won AOTY over Kendrick’s To Pimp a Butterfly. In 2015, it was Beck’s Morning Phase over Beyoncé. In 2014, Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories beat Kendrick’s Good Kid, MAAD City. And 2013, Mumford & Sons’ Babel beat Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange.

It’s a pattern too blatant, too in your face to ignore.

In the history of the Grammy Awards, only ten black artists have won Album of the Year. That’s a stat that has been cited many times over the past two days, but simply stopping there drastically oversimplifies what it actually means. When you look at those ten artists (who accounted for 12 wins in total; Stevie Wonder won three times in four years), and understand who they were and what their albums represented, it’s a sobering reminder that the Grammys are just a metaphor for this country, and that even the richest and most celebrated black people still are very much black.

For starters, of those 12 albums, five have an asterisk. In 1991, Quincy Jones won for Back on the Block, an album featuring a who’s who in R&B and jazz, with some rap sprinkled in. It was a true flex for Quincy, showing how he was undeniably the connective tissue for three (or four) generations of black music. The next year, Natalie Cole won for Unforgettable … With Love. The album is gorgeous, and it is also primarily a covers album of songs performed by her father, Nat King Cole. In 1994, The Bodyguard soundtrack won, featuring one half Whitney Houston songs (including Dolly Parton cover turned Whitney classic “I Will Always Love You”) and another half songs by other artists, from Kenny G to Lisa Stansfield to Joe Cocker. In 2005, Ray Charles’s Genius Loves Company won, an album of duets with other popular singers (he won posthumously). And in 2007, Herbie Hancock won for River: The Joni Letters, a Joni Mitchell tribute album.

Those are all good albums. But none of them are forward facing. Three are basically lifetime achievement awards. Most of them celebrate yesteryear, with the majority defined by the term “Various Artists.” And a decent amount of the music on these black albums are performed by white artists. They live in a completely different category from something like Lemonade, a singular piece of work by a black solo artist.

If we ignore those, the number of black artists that have won Album of the Year is cut in half to five: Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Lauryn Hill, and Outkast.

Four of those five artists deserved to win Album of the Year. Lionel Richie’s win for Can’t Slow Down over Prince’s Purple Rain in 1985 was a glaring mistake. Lionel’s win is akin to 1989 beating To Pimp a Butterfly, or if Drake’s Views would have bested Lemonade for AOTY — both reminiscent of some of the mistakes of the past decade: a pop album with little weight triumphing over a classic album built to stand the test of time.

Removing Lionel from the list and there were four artists — six albums total — that you can say were albums by black artists that deserved to win Album of the Year — and did. What else do these albums have in common? They are among the most classic albums in the history of recorded music.

Stevie won in 1974, 1975 and, 1977 for Innvervisions, Fulfillingness’ First Finale, and Songs in the Key of Life. Those three albums are part of what’s commonly known as his “classic period” — 1972 to 1976 — when he made five consecutive classic albums. His first two, Music of My Mind and Talking Book, were not nominated for Album of the Year. Innervisions, his first nomination and win, was Stevie Wonder’s 16th album. The Grammys eventually got it right with Stevie, but it wasn’t just that he made the best albums of those years that he won — he had to release “Best Albums of All Time”–level material to finally be recognized.

Michael Jackson’s Thriller won in 1984, but his first classic, Off the Wall (a better album), wasn’t even nominated for Album of the Year. He lost twice more for the award, in 1988 for Bad and 1996 for HIStory: Past, Present, Future. The Grammys got it right once for Michael, but again, only after they missed a classic. In order for Michael Jackson to win, he had to make the highest-selling album of all time.

Do you see a trend? Does this trend feel familiar in your own black life? Oh, it does? Of course it does. But there’s more.

Lauryn Hill won in 1999 for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. This album, her solo debut, dominated the entire year leading up to the awards. It’s widely regarded as a classic, one of the great albums of the 1990s, finding the balance between R&B, hip-hop, and pop in a way very few have ever pulled off. It was a landmark year for the Album of the Year category: all five nominees were women, including Madonna, Shania Twain, Sheryl Crow, Lauryn Hill, and Garbage (fronted by Shirley Manson). Lauryn won, and she deserved to win, and again, another black artist won Album of the Year, with an Album of the Decade.

Finally, there’s Outkast. Similar to Stevie, Outkast made multiple classic albums that were ignored by the Grammys. Their fourth album, Stankonia, was nominated in 2002, but lost to the O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack. But then they finally — rightfully — won one, for Speakerboxxx/Love Below, an album that was too massive too ignore, even if it wasn’t their true masterwork as a duo.

But that album, a double-album consisting of (basically) an André solo album and a Big Boi solo album, changed hip-hop forever. Yes, it was the Album of the Year, but it was also a landmark moment for an entire genre of music, which is what it took for them to win — changing music forever.

And that’s it.

All of this is important to consider when attempting to answer the question of how Beyoncé could win.

Beyoncé and Lemonade are great, important works of art. It feels like we might look back on this time as the beginning of Beyoncé’s classic period, something very few artists have. The unfair, fucked-up part of it all, however, is that it’s actually going to take Beyoncé making an album as earth-shattering as Innervisions or Songs in the Key of Life to beat the next collection of Taylor Swift songs about road trips for the Album of the Year Grammy. In order to be celebrated as the artist that made the best album in one year, black artists have to make an album that stands up for 30 years.

The only reason the Grammys still matter is because they’re a reminder of surface-level progressions serving as a convenient smokescreen for one of the stories of America — the never-ending push to keep so many of us in our place. Beyoncé and Kendrick’s alternating losses for AOTY over the past four years stink of reminders of what happens when we don’t stay in our lane. And their losses serve as a reminder that making “important” music — art that mirrors the discomfort of our times, art that disrupts the status quo — is not what these Grammy gatekeepers hold at a premium, or to some degree, even appreciate.

It’s the plight of the nonwhite artist in the present day — responsible for critically carrying the load for an entire country while still not reaping the benefits of that hard work, of that self-induced trauma, beyond a pat on your sore, tired back.

Be it something as trivial as the Grammys or as relatable as getting a job, the gatekeepers still thrive on maintaining imbalance. And this will never change, until someone at the table finally steps up to the gatekeepers, risking their own comfort for the sake of others.

I truly thought that moment was coming, when Adele — appreciated for her genuine lack of a filter — won for Album of the Year. But, even in a speech thanking Beyoncé — a woman she clearly is inspired by and strives to be like — it wasn’t.

Adele’s win, which you can’t blame her for, is a Grammy issue, but Adele’s preparation for that moment is an indictment of the privilege of not understanding a world in which you, Adele, could probably beat Beyoncé. Yes, you can be shocked as hell, but to not understand why you may end up winning is to not understand this world you live in, and how your world differs. If you like Beyoncé, you cry, you salute her with pleasantries, you talk about how you don’t deserve it and you break your statue in half out of tribute to her. But if you love Beyoncé, you prepare yourself for a moment in which you could beat her, and if you do, you address the Grammys and tell them that they have been fucking up for a long time now. And that it wasn’t about her and that it wasn’t about Beyoncé, it was about the gatekeepers of the Grammys, using their power to keep people — and messages — in their place.

But loving Beyoncé is loving black people, because Beyoncé is black people. And that’s easier said than done, truly loving black people. It’s hard work, it’s uncomfortable, it’s challenging, it’s tiring. Which is why, when those big moments happen, and you’re looking for that white person in your life that likes you so much to just stand up for you — just to once take the emotional load off of you — instead of fighting, they’ll so often break you off a little something, cheer you on, pat you on the back, and then turn around and walk away.Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo.

The secret of good dancing has just been revealed—get this—by science! In a paper published last week in the journal Scientific Reports, a group of researchers in England has determined exactly which moves make a woman most attractive. It’s in the jiggle of her hips, these experts say, and in the asymmetric swinging of her arms and thighs.

Daniel Engber Daniel Engber is a columnist for Slate.



You may have come across a write-up of these findings in the tabloids or the straight-laced science press. It even got 14 paragraphs last Thursday in the New York Times—perhaps in accordance with the paper’s pledge, made in January, to run more “softer, buzzier, and funnier” material. Such viral spread should come as no surprise: This is just the sort of science story that shimmies to the top of newsfeeds. That is to say, it’s of little consequence, and it’s very likely wrong.

Those two traits aren’t unrelated. Indeed, they work like interlocking gears in the vast machine that churns out clicky science content on the web. If anything, a study’s silliness only serves as journalistic cover, by making it seem peevish to delve into the details. On other beats, reporters worry over facts that seem “too good to check,” but for the science press, a paper on the secret of good dancing—like one on how chocolate makes you thin—lands in an even more ignominious bracket. It’s not that it’s too good to check. It’s that it’s too dumb to deserve serious scrutiny.

For a great example of how this phenomenon works, let’s boogie back to six years ago, when the same lab, headed by psychologist Nick Neave of Northumbria University, put out its first investigation of sweet dance moves. Back then, the headline finding—one that ended up on ABC, NPR, the BBC, and many other places—referred to dancing men instead of women. A dude could maximize his sexiness, Neave’s paper argued, by varying the amplitude of his neck and trunk movements, and by speeding up the bending and twisting of his right knee.

Get Slate in your inbox.

Most coverage focused on the knee, since that was the surprise. Could one knee (and not the other) really work such magic? Well, no. Neave’s team had looked at only 19 dancing subjects (with 37 women rating them), while measuring dozens of variables that ranged from the variability in flexion of the left shoulder to the external rotation speed of the right ankle. With such a smorgasbord of data, drawn from such a paltry set of subjects, even random blips might appear to be significant. Indeed, when the same group produced a follow-up in 2013, this one involving 30 dancing men, it failed to replicate the first experiment’s results. Now it seemed as though the speed, variability, and amplitude of a man’s arm movements—not those of his neck or knee—mattered most.

Notwithstanding these obvious defects, the male dancing study went viral in the media multiple times. The second round of coverage, which began in 2014, seems to have come about when the U.K.’s Daily Mail—among the world’s most prolific fonts of bogus science news, by the way, so unreliable that it’s been banned from Wikipedia—decided to revive the story. From there the reanimated finding made its way to Business Insider, the Washington Post, and back onto network television.

I called up Neave two years ago to find out how and why this happened. “It seems to have a life of its own,” he told me then. “We’re not reporting a cure for cancer. It’s not that important, but it’s fun!”

What about the fact that its findings had by that time been cast in doubt? “It was a preliminary study,” said Neave. “We got some very interesting findings. We’ve built on that study, and 90 percent of what we’ve found since seems to corroborate what we found then.”

The problem was, the 90 percent that held up did not include the banner news about a dancer’s torso and his neck, let alone his knee. Neave acknowledged that when he’d done the same experiment with the larger set of subjects, the knee’s importance went away. “When you’ve run so many analyses with so many variables, you will get these ones that kind of crop up,” he said. I took that to mean that his finding on the knee had been a blip in his statistics—a false-positive result that had cropped up in an underpowered study involving dozens of comparisons.

To answer certain research questions, Neave continued, he’d learned that he would need to study 200 subjects at the very least. (Remember, that first study included just 19.) Still, he wasn’t willing to abandon what by 2015 looked to be a dubious finding. The effect of the knee, he told me, had been “nearly significant” in his failed replication. “I think it shouldn’t be discounted entirely, but it also should be treated with a little bit of caution.”

Well, then. There’s no such thing as “near significance” in science, and there are also no signs that Neave has been exercising any caution whatsoever in espousing his result. His paper on dancing women, for example, cites his previous research in saying “that male dance quality can be predicted by … the speed of movement of the right knee.” Another of his recent publications, from 2015, contends that “‘good’ dancers displayed … faster bending and twisting movements of their right knee.” And in the past few days, media accounts of the new study are re-reporting the same, debunked result.

I called Neave back this week to ask him why he still lingers on the empty claim about the knee. “My guess is that this was some kind of artifact in the first study,” he acknowledged once again, but he said that doesn’t make it unworthy of consideration. “That was a finding,” he said. “I mean, it was there, wasn’t it?”

“Well, sure, it was a finding,” I said, “but it was a finding that, through careful follow-up work, now appears to be invalid.”

“No, not necessarily,” he said. “We didn’t find it in one other study. But again, that might mean that it might not be there, or that it might be there. For the minute, it’s there, until we can conclusively prove that it’s not there.”

The evidence the paper provides is very weak. At best it suggests what researchers might want to study next.

I didn’t know quite what to say to this. “But you have good reason to believe that the finding on the knee, at least, might be wrong,” I tried. “And you don’t know about the neck and torso … ”

“I don’t think there’s a huge contradiction there,” he said. “But you’re right: Every time we do these studies we find ever-so-slightly different things because we’ve got different samples and different ways of looking at things. My guess is that if we ran the study again, something else might pop out.”

In that case, why not wait until he’s landed on a more reliable result? “That is a fair point,” he said. “In that case, we should never publish anything—but we’re under massive pressure to publish.” If he does end up getting to a solid answer, Neave continued, he’d be happy to put out corrected findings. “I’m not ashamed to say that we might have done something wrong or reported something that was an artifact or statistical blip. I have no problem with that as long as there’s still a story to tell—and I think there would be.”

Papers from Neave’s lab are indeed suffused with science storytelling. When we first talked in 2015, he told me that he’d noted in his original publication that the knee thing “seemed a bit odd.” In fact, the paper contains no such caveat. Rather, it tries to explain the odd result by noting (in what seems to me a non sequitur) that 80 percent of individuals have evolved to be right-footed. This sort of explanation shows up again in the new paper on women’s dance moves. Perhaps the swinging of the hips and thighs serve to signal reproductive fitness, Neave and his fellow authors write. The swinging of the hips and asynchronous thigh movements “might be an emphatically feminine trait,” while another sign of good dancing—mildly asynchronous arm movements—signifies a high degree of motor control. The paper says the latter requires a careful balance, though: If a woman swings her arms with too little synchronicity, then that could make her seem as though she had Huntington’s Disease or Tourette’s.

Let’s put aside the stories, though. Is there any reason to believe the main results of this new study on women and dancing? Like the experiment on men, this was not question-based research but rather something more like data-mining from a shallow quarry. The sample for the new study comprised 39 female dancers. Neave’s team had several hundred people rate their dancing skills, and then asked two experts to compare the moves of the five highest- and lowest-rated women. By eyeballing motion-captured videos, the experts picked out 3 of 22 recorded joint angles that struck them as being most indicative of good dancing: those that measured movements of the women’s hips, arms, and thighs. The researchers then selected a few variables related to those joint angles and ran statistical tests to see how they corresponded with ratings given to all the dancers in the study.

In a conventional experiment—one designed to test a clear hypothesis—scientists would state a research question at the start, plan out their analysis ahead of time, and then begin collecting data. Here, Neave and his colleagues recorded their data first, then reverse-engineered their questions and analysis. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, per se, so long as it’s understood to be exploratory. In the paper, Neave and his co-authors acknowledge that their work was “data-driven,” as opposed to being based on “a priori assumptions.” But given that, we should understand that the evidence the paper provides is very weak. At best it offers a suggestion as to what the researchers might want to study next, in more detail. As with the paper on male dancing, its findings may not replicate.

Yet Neave seems ready to press on with more elaborate, convoluted studies—for example, one that looks at how women dance at different stages of their menstrual cycles.

Again, I asked if it wouldn’t be a wise idea to wait, at least until he’d confirmed his findings with a fresh, hypothesis-driven experiment.

“As I said, we’re psychologists,” he said. “We haven’t wrongly reported a cure for cancer or anything like that. You know, it’s not that important, is it really?”

I was forced to agree.

“We’ve reported some interesting stuff,” he continued. “We don’t fully understand everything that we’ve found. … We’ve never, ever stood up and said, ‘We have proven this.’ You can’t say that in psychology. It’s not physics. So we have these situations where you report something, and you hope that it’s true, but it might not be true. Then you change your mind; you tweak things around. That’s the nature of the game.”It is proving difficult for hedge fund manager and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to avoid the glare of media scrutiny – British tabloids most recently cried foul over the shabby royal comportment of Prince Andrew in agreeing to be the guest of an acknowledged pedophile. But the larger mystery surrounding Epstein, who completed a 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2010, has remained unsolved: How did the hedge fund mogul manage to finesse the kinds of sex-crime allegations typically associated with a hefty prison sentence?

Documents obtained by The Daily Beast reveal how pedophile hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein escaped a hefty jail sentence despite overwhelming evidence of sex crimes with dozens of young girls. Conchita Sarnoff and Lee Aitken on how the fear and intimidation experienced by victims during pre-trial proceedings, combined with a ferocious, protracted campaign to undermine the prosecution, culminated in a set of charges that became a virtual slap on the wrist.

Some of the most shocking allegations against Epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an FBI probe, in civil suits brought by his victims: for example, the claim that three 12-year-old French girls were delivered to him as a birthday present. But the feds did identify roughly 40 young women, most of them underage at the time, who described being lured to Epstein’s Palm Beach home on the pretense of giving a “massage” for money, then pressured into various sex acts, as well as the “Balkan sex slave” Epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just 14. More recently, a big cash payment from Mail on Sunday coaxed one of Epstein’s main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy. This victim, Virginia Roberts, produced a photo of herself with Prince Andrew in 2001 and reported that Epstein paid her $15,000 to meet the prince. Then 17 years old, she claims that she was abused by Epstein and “loaned” to his friends from the age of 15.

For the first time, the U.S. attorney who oversaw the Epstein prosecution in Florida’s Southern District is commenting publicly on the case, in a letter released exclusively to The Daily Beast. This letter, along with other correspondence unearthed in our reporting, sheds new light on the no-holds-barred battle waged by Epstein’s lawyers to evade the full exercise of prosecutorial power.

Sex crimes of the kind Roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of 10 to 20 years in federal prison. Yet when all was said and done, Epstein served his scant year-plus-one-month in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail and was granted a 16-hour-per-day free pass to leave the premises for work. A Daily Beast examination into the inner workings of the Epstein defense strategy reveals how the fear and intimidation experienced by victims during pre-trial proceedings, combined with a ferocious, protracted campaign to undermine the prosecution – summed up as “the best defense is an all-star offense” – culminated in a set of charges that became a virtual slap on the wrist for the globe-trotting financier. Fear and intimidation experienced by victims during pre-trial proceedings, combined with a ferocious, protracted campaign to undermine the prosecution, culminated in a set of charges that became a virtual slap on the wrist.

Frustrated by the State Attorney’s decision, the police referred the case to the FBI, which handed it to the U.S. Attorney General’s office. After reviewing the charges, federal prosecutors “agreed that the state charge was insufficient,” Acosta writes. In a script that could have been lifted from Law and Order , his team gave Epstein two choices: “plead to more serious state felony charges…or else prepare for a federal felony trial.”

“Over the past weeks, I have read much regarding Mr. Jeffrey Epstein,” are words opening an extraordinary letter written by R. Alexander Acosta, who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida during Epstein’s criminal investigation. Mr. Acosta goes on to detail how, in 2005, a young girl first brought sex-crime allegations to the Palm Beach Police Department, which sought felony charges against Epstein. Subsequently, however, the State Attorney agreed to charge him “only with one count of aggravated assault with no intent to commit a felony,” Acosta writes. He notes that such a charge would have resulted in no jail time, no registration as a sexual offender, and no responsibility for restitution to Epstein’s underage victims.

The next passage is where things really get interesting: “What followed was a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors.” Epstein had assembled a world-class legal team, including Alan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, and Roy Black (best known for having defended William Kennedy Smith against rape charges in Palm Beach.) “One member of the defense team warned me that the office’s excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued,” Acosta writes. In his view, excessive zeal more aptly described the actions in Epstein’s camp: “Defense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families,” seeking to unearth personal issues that might lead to disqualification of members of Acosta’s team. The defense also “often failed to negotiate in good faith. They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only to change their minds, and appeal the office’s position to Washington.”

Undeterred, Acosta stuck to his position that Epstein must agree to the three criteria he had laid out: jail time, registration as a sex offender, and restitution to victims.

Acosta’s account is supported by a second document obtained by The Daily Beast – a five-page letter written by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ann Marie Villafana to another of Epstein’s lawyers, Jay Lefkowitz, during the period when both sides were hammering out the eventual plea agreement. “The indictment was postponed for more than five months to allow you and Mr. Epstein’s other attorneys to make presentations to the office to convince the office not to prosecute,” Villafana writes, conjuring the degree of pushback apparently central to the team’s strategy. “Those presentations were unsuccessful.” Villafana also mentions her efforts to insure that Epstein would serve time in a federal “prison camp” and not a state prison, which would be a far rougher environment, particularly for a child molester.

Villafana marshals these facts in the process of strenuously disputing apparent charges of misconduct by the defense: “I continued to work with you in a professional manner even after I learned that you had been proceeding in bad faith for several weeks – thinking that … you would 'fool' our office into letting Mr. Epstein plead to a non-registerable offense.”

At another point in her letter, Villafana refers to an apparent allegation of self-dealing in the selection of an outside attorney who would represent the 40-odd victims identified in the FBI probe. In a somewhat unusual arrangement, Epstein agreed not to contest his liability in any civil suits brought by these victims – and in fact to pay for lawyers to represent them. In her letter, Villafana denies any personal interest in the choice of attorney and goes on to say, “your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims’ best interests in the face of intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys.”

Responding to a request for comment on Acosta’s account of events, Roy Black wrote The Daily Beast on Thursday that, “I can’t reply to a letter I haven’t received…I can’t give a reasoned response without examining the files and being able to refresh my recollection of events that occurred years ago.” Black went on, “I do not believe any of the things you mention occurred except for the fact we did exercise our right to appeal to the Department of Justice to determine if a federal crime had been committed.” (Other Epstein attorneys contacted by The Daily Beast did not respond. The U.S Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida had no comment.)

Why did Acosta decide to voice his opinions now? In part, he clearly is reacting to ongoing criticism that Epstein’s puny punishment did not fit his crimes. “Some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher,” Acosta writes. “Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view. Many victims have since spoken out…physical evidence has since been discovered.”

Acosta may also have chosen to come forward now because, on Monday, attorneys for a number of those victims filed suit under the Victims Crimes Rights Act to challenge the “non-prosecution agreement” that ultimately resulted from all the wrangling, claiming that they were not consulted. The U.S. Attorney’s office, now led by Wifredo A. Ferrer, has indicated it will file a response to the suit on April 7.

In his letter, Acosta also takes issue with the way Epstein’s sentence was carried out: “Although the terms of confinement in a state prison are a matter appropriately left to the State of Florida…without doubt, the treatment that he received while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence.” Indeed, Epstein’s brief confinement likely reinforced a perception that he had merely succumbed to a nuisance suit. Such a gross misapprehension would help account for the apparent ease with which Epstein has rejoined the ranks of a social elite. Katie Couric, Woody Allen, and George Stephanopoulos, among others, attended a dinner party he hosted for Prince Andrew in December, and New York authorities seem to be either unaware or unconcerned that his Upper East Side home is within 1,000 feet of an Episcopal pre-school, in violation of sex-offender laws.

Yet a source tells The Daily Beast that Epstein’s legal troubles may not be over. It is possible that, as an outgrowth of the 2007 Florida investigation, federal investigators are now looking into allegations of money laundering and other financial misdeeds. Villafana notes at the end of her letter to Lefkowitz: “You accuse me of broadening the scope of the investigation without any foundation for doing so by adding charges of money laundering and violations of a money transmitting business to the investigation. Again, I consulted with the Justice Department’s Money Laundering Section about my analysis...the duty officer agreed with my analysis.”

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday hammered House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz over Donald Trump’s potential conflicts of interest, at one point reminding the Republican leader that his responsibility is to serve as a check-and-balance for the president.

Chaffetz responded to a question about conflicts inherent in the president’s sprawling business empire by insisting, “the president is exempt from conflicts of interest, so it’s kind of a non-issue,” adding Trump has promised to “wall … off” his business interests while president.

“What about the emolument clause of the U.S. Constitution,” Blitzer asked, referring to a clause some Constitutional scholars interpret to mean Trump is forbidden from taking any money from a foreign state.

“I know it’s surprising and frustrating to Democrats, but the president is exempt from these conflicts of interest,” Chaffetz repeated.

“But he’s not exempt from the emoluments clause, is he?” Blitzer pressed.

Chaffetz argued he refused to go on a “fishing expedition that the Democrats want us to go into,” adding the public understood what they were getting into when the “overwhelmingly” elected Trump into office.

“You’re the chairman of this Oversight Committee that’s looking at the executive branch of the U.S. government,” Blitzer reminded Chaffetz, adding “the President of the United States potentially could be in violation of the U.S. Constitution.”

“I just don’t see it like that Wolf,” Chaffetz replied. “I just don’t.”

Chaffetz argued that he never “did this type of investigation on Barack Obama, I never did it on Hillary Clinton,” adding there’s “nothing to suggest that [Trump] is profiteering in an unordinary way from the fact that he’s President of the United States.”

The House Oversight Committee chairman said he would probe any conflict that “rises to the surface.”

“I’m just not going to go on a fishing expedition,” he said before explaining what he believes to be the driving force behind concerns about Trump’s potential conflicts-of-interest.

“It’s Democrats with their heads exploding wanting to see this because they cant believe that Donald Trump is actually president of the United States,” Chaffetz opined, adding, “I know what their motivation is.”

“I think we’re going to leave it on that note,” Blitzer replied. “But I just want to point out that your committee is designed to be a sort of check and balance on the executive branch. The Oversight Committee, that’s what it’s called.”

Watch the video below, via CNN:Imagine getting from Baltimore to Washington in less than 15 minutes. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan certainly did Thursday when he hurtled through the Japanese countryside at 314 mph.

Hogan wants Maryland to get these “maglev” trains — short for magnetic levitation — and Japan wants to sell them.

“There is no question that this is the future of transportation,” Hogan, a pro-business Republican whose victory in November shocked his heavily Democratic state, said after taking four trips along the 26-mile test track near Mount Fuji.

If he’s right, it’s an expensive future — even many in Japan are balking at the multibillion-dollar cost of the fast new trains. And in the United States, such trains would face daunting questions concerning not only cost (and more importantly, who would bear it) but the need to find a right of way through the most congested and perhaps litigious part of the country. It would take an unusual amount of national willpower to make the idea a reality.

Japan is already renowned for its shinkansen bullet trains, which whiz between the main cities at speeds of up to 200 mph, are almost always perfectly on time and have not had a fatal accident in 50 years of operation.

Central Japan Railways says its magnetically levitating train has broken its previous world speed record in a test-run at a special track West of Tokyo, reaching a speed of more than 374 mph. (Reuters)

But the maglev is something else.

Visiting the test site Thursday, Hogan walked past departure screens showing imaginary journeys to Baltimore (“on time”) and boarded a train that still had that new-car smell. As the train picked up speed, screens inside the car showed the view from cameras on the front of the fully automated train, which doesn’t have a windshield because there’s no driver who needs to see out.

The train quickly hit 150 mph — the top speed of Amtrak’s Acela — and passed through 200, then 300 mph. It topped out at 314, well below the world record of

374 mph that the maglev hit during tests in April.

The point of Thursday’s runs was not to prove how fast these trains can go but rather to convince Hogan that Maryland needs them. And Hogan, who inherited the proposed maglev project when he took office in January, seemed convinced.

“It’s the most advanced technology in the world,” said the governor, who has focused much of his energy on giving Maryland’s business climate a boost. He said traveling from Baltimore to Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport in five minutes or from Washington in eight minutes could be “incredibly transformative” for the region.

The Japanese maglev trains start moving on wheels. When they hit a certain speed, magnets push the cars up almost four inches above the guideways and propel the train forward without the friction associated with traditional tracks. When it slows down to

200 mph, it feels like the train is barely moving. Then when it reverts to using its wheels, passengers feel a bump akin to a gentle airplane landing.

Japan Railways is already working on plans to build a maglev line between Tokyo and Nagoya, 200 miles away, to start running in 2027. The journey time, currently 100 minutes by shinkansen and just over four hours by car, would be cut to 40 minutes.

The problem, on both sides of the Pacific, is money.

In Japan, there are critics who say that the shinkansen is perfectly adequate and that the country does not need to spend the billions of dollars that would be needed to build a maglev system. The cost of building the line to Nagoya is estimated at almost $50 billion, largely because it would require tunneling through many mountains along the way.

For the United States, maglev technology is much more expensive than building a shinkansen line or any of the other high-speed options the Obama administration has been promoting.

A 40-mile maglev line between Baltimore and Washington would cost at least $10 billion.

Japanese media have reported that the government has offered $5 billion in financial backing for a Maryland line, while Central Japan Railway Co., the train operator, has said it will not charge any licensing fees for the technology.

The Northeast Maglev, a Washington-based company that is behind the project, would have to raise the remainder from public and private sources. In 2010, the Federal Railroad Administration turned down Maryland’s bid for $1.7 billion in funding for the maglev project, declaring it “not ready.” Maryland is now angling for grants to conduct new studies.

Hogan, who is at the end of a 12-day trip that also took him to South Korea and China, met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe before he went on the maglev, but he declined to comment on the specifics of any financing deal — including whether Maryland would be expected to cover part of the costs.

Hogan is expected to decide later this month whether to pull the plug on a different long-planned transit project, the light-rail Purple Line that would connect Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. As a candidate and since taking office, he has criticized the overall cost of the Purple Line and questioned whether it is a wise investment for the state.

But as for the maglev, the state government is “very interested in studying it further and taking it to the next level,” he said, and the Japanese government is “very interested in being involved in financing the project.”

The two leaders agreed on a “memorandum of cooperation” that addresses liquefied natural gas exports to Japan, scientific and cultural exchanges — and maglev rail.

Certainly, Japan is also desperate to sell the high-tech trains. Abe has been busy touting its rail technology as part of his plan to get the world’s third-largest economy back on track.

In addition to promoting maglev for the Northeast corridor, when he visited the United States in April, Abe tried to persuade California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) to choose Japanese companies to build a $68 billion high-speed non-maglev railway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. A separate project is underway to sell Japanese trains to Texas, linking Dallas and Houston.

But, as with so many things in Japan, this is also about China.

China is fast catching up with Japan when it comes to train technology, and its companies are also looking for export opportunities.

In a time of increasing concerns about China, Abe has suggested that the maglev could stand as a testament to the strong alliance between the United States and Japan. “I have just proposed to President Obama that this technology be introduced to the Northeast part of the United States as a symbol of Japan-U.S. cooperation,” he said last year on the 50th anniversary of the shinkansen, a train he said was “symbolic of safety and peace of mind.”

In the wake of the Amtrak accident near Philadelphia that killed eight people last month, Japan’s safety record could be its strongest selling point. Asked about the crash, Hogan said that “one of the beautiful things about this technology is that an accident like that couldn’t happen.”

“You can’t have driver error because there is no driver,” Hogan said.

For his part, Hogan seemed sold. As he left the maglev site on Thursday evening, he joked to his Japanese counterparts: “You had me at 314 miles per hour.”

VIDEO: The future of train travel in the U.S.UPDATE: Several weeks after this story published in October, Spencer gave a triumphant speech at a conference in Washington describing America as a "white country" and proclaiming, "Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!" He was met with cheers and Nazi salutes. Read more in our investigation of how the white nationalist movement capitalized on the Trump campaign.

Richard Spencer uses chopsticks to deftly pluck slivers of togarashi-crusted ahi from a rectangular plate. He is sitting in the Continental-style lounge of the Firebrand Hotel, near his home in the upscale resort town of Whitefish, Montana, discussing a subject not typically broached in polite company. "Race is something between a breed and an actual species," he says, likening the differences between whites and people of color to those between golden retrievers and basset hounds. "It's that powerful."

We are well into our third round of Arrogant Frog, a merlot that Spencer chose because its name reminds him of Pepe, the cartoon frog commandeered as a mascot by the "alt-right" movement that has been thrust from the shadows by Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Spencer says Pepe could also be seen as the reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian frog deity, Kek: "He is basically using the alt-right to unleash chaos and change the world," he says, looking slightly annoyed when I crack a smile. "You might say, 'Wow,' but this is literally how religions arise."

If Pepe is the alt-right's god, then Spencer is its self-styled prophet. A 38-year-old Duke Ph.D. dropout who sometimes resides in a Bavarian-style mansion at the edge of a ski slope, he has for years been quite literally shouting into the wilderness, proclaiming to anyone who will listen that the alt-right, whose name he coined in 2008, is the only political movement that really gives a damn about white Americans. In Spencer's view, if you aren't a white American, that's fine—but you should leave.

An articulate and well-dressed former football player with prom-king good looks and a "fashy" (as in fascism) haircut—long on top, buzzed on the sides—Spencer has managed to seize on an extraordinary presidential election to give overt racism a new veneer of radical chic. In some ways he resembles an older generation of "academic racists"—or "racialists," as he prefers to put it—who've long sought to professionalize a movement associated with Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. What sets him apart is his rock star status among a certain fringe that delights in making racist comments pseudonymously on the internet. They idolize Spencer for embracing life as a public heretic and appearing to lend an air of respectability to white nationalist views. You could call him the alt-right's outlaw version of William F. Buckley, if Buckley had been down with millennials and into shitlords and dank memes.

Spencer subscribes zealously to the idea that America's white population is endangered, thanks to multiculturalism and lax immigration policies that have gone unchallenged by mainstream conservatives—or, as Spencer and the alt-righters call them, "cuckservatives." He envisions a future for the United States along the lines of "a renewed Roman Empire," a dictatorship where the main criteria for citizenship would be whiteness. "You cannot view another white person as your enemy," he says.

When asked who would qualify as white, Spencer's reasoning quickly turns arcane, if not tortured—he invokes a mix of race, culture, and geography—but the answer definitely does not include blacks, Asians, Muslims, Jews, and most Hispanics. Spencer knows that a white ethnostate is at most a distant dream, but his more immediate desire is to shift the bounds of accepted political discourse. He hopes America's nonwhites can be made to agree that returning to the lands of their ancestors would be best for everyone: "It's like presenting to an African that this hasn't worked out," he says. "We haven't made each other happier. We are going to have to take part in this paradigmatic shift together."

Spencer and his dinner companions started riffing on the hijacking scene from the movie Captain Phillips: "Look at me! Look at me! I the GOP now!…I conservatism now!… I establishment now!”

For years, Spencer's "identitarian" movement barely flickered in the dark corners of the internet on sites such as Reddit and 4chan. But Trump's ascendancy was like kerosene dumped on a brushfire. From day one, the Republican insurgent sounded themes dear to the alt-right—his official campaign launch in the lobby of Trump Tower in June 2015, when he vowed to crack down on Mexican criminals and "rapists," was simply the first clarion call. Ever since, Trump's tacit embrace of the alt-right's favorite media outlets and shrillest online voices has emboldened the movement beyond Spencer's wildest dreams. (When Trump retweeted the user @WhiteGenocideTM this past January, Spencer responded, "Wow. Just wow.") Regardless of the election outcome, Spencer believes the alt-right's views will continue to seep into mainstream American politics, in the form of a renewed focus on deporting undocumented immigrants and perhaps even the establishment of a Congressional White Caucus.

In August, Hillary Clinton declared in a speech that "the emerging racist ideology known as the alt-right" had through Trump "effectively taken over the Republican Party." Watching that speech from a hotel room while on vacation in Tokyo, Spencer could hardly believe his good fortune. Suddenly his inbox was flooded with interview requests from national political reporters; in a hasty Skype call with Michelle Goldberg of Slate—a Jew, he figured, but "it's hard not to be" in the media—he confidently asserted that he'd "made it."

During our conversation over dinner, Spencer further recalled how he capitalized on his newfound fame. Back in the states soon after the Clinton speech, he found himself arguing over the phone with a representative from the National Press Club. He'd paid to hold a media event there on September 9, but the Press Club backed out citing security concerns, and then admitted, Spencer claims, that he made its employees uncomfortable. (The National Press Club declined to comment.) He arranged instead for reporters to meet at the entrance of the Old Ebbitt Grill, where an emissary in a charcoal suit and brown tie would direct them to an undisclosed location.

"The alt-right is in a way conservatives who don't have anything to conserve anymore," Spencer told the crowd of mostly DC reporters, now assembled in a nearby hotel lounge. Lamenting the decay and degeneracy of modern America, he decried as "total hokum nonsense" the idea that America's Founding Fathers thought all races were created equal. "Race is real, race matters, and race is the foundation of identity," he said, flanked by a vaguely Star Wars-looking alt-right logo of his own creation.

"I think if Trump wins we could really legitimately say that he was associated directly with us, with the 'R[acist]' word, all sorts of things. People will have to recognize us."

Later that evening, Spencer and a who's who of white nationalists met for dinner at the low-lit Tabard Inn, a classic Dupont Circle watering hole. The group included Jared Taylor, who runs the website American Renaissance and has been dubbed a "coat-and-tie racist" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Peter Brimelow, the white-haired founder of the anti-immigration website VDare. Amid the many rounds of toasts, someone recalled a scene from the movie Captain Phillips in which a Somali pirate wielding an assault rifle barges onto the bridge of Tom Hanks' cargo ship. "Look at me! Look at me!" says the wild-eyed pirate. "I'm the captain now!"

Spencer and his companions started riffing: "Look at me! Look at me! I the GOP now!…I conservatism now!…I establishment now!"

With his blandly named National Policy Institute, Spencer aspires to the stature of today's Heritage Foundation or Cato Institute. But his is not the only vision competing for the mantle of the alt-right; he believes the movement is being pulled in a more moderate direction—if you can call it that—by Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, formerly the executive chairman of Breitbart News, and Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos. Spencer says the Breitbart faction wants to jettison overt racial ideas and instead defend "Western values" and fight "political correctness." He dubs them "alt-light."

Nevertheless, Spencer feels he is on his way. "I think if Trump wins we could really legitimately say that he was associated directly with us, with the 'R[acist]' word, all sorts of things," Spencer says. "People will have to recognize us." (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)

Even with a Trump victory looking increasingly remote, Spencer sees a bright future: "I think white identity politics is inevitable. You can't become a minority and not understand yourself as in jeopardy in some way," he says. "Conservatism is going to be dead in my lifetime and the question is, who is going to define the right after that? I want to do that."



Growing up in a wealthy part of Dallas in the 1990s, Richard Bertrand Spencer attended St. Mark's School of Texas, an elite, all-boys prep school long associated with blue-blooded conservatism. (I was also a student there around the same time.) George W. Bush lived in the same neighborhood and sent his daughters to St. Mark's sister school, Hockaday. Spencer's father, an ophthalmologist, did not care much about politics but voted Republican out of habit. Spencer played varsity football and baseball and hung out with the popular crowd.

Every Thursday after school, Spencer, his mom, and his sister would order pizza from Domino's and watch Family Ties and The Cosby Show. Spencer was friends with the only African American student in his class, John Lewis, and once invited him for a sleepover. Lewis says he never thought of Spencer as racist, but another classmate who asked not to be identified recalls Spencer making "a bunch of conservative, racially laced comments" that were objectionable even in high school. Spencer says he has no memory of this and attributes the recollection to "backward projection," noting that he did not think much about race back then.

After graduating high school in 1997, Spencer went to the University of Virginia, where he double-majored in music and English and became deeply involved in avant-garde theater, trying out and discarding various radical ideologies like costume changes. The writings of Friedrich Nietzsche made a lasting impression; Spencer found his critiques of equality and democracy darkly compelling. He identified with the German philosopher's unapologetically elitist embrace of "great men" such as Napoleon Bonaparte and the composer Richard Wagner. Yet Spencer found little in Nietzsche about the organization of the state; it was only after entering the humanities master's program at the University of Chicago that he discovered Jared Taylor, a self-proclaimed "race realist" who argues that blacks and Hispanics are a genetic drag on Western society.

Spencer told me that a top Trump adviser once helped him with fundraising and promotion for an on-campus event featuring an influential white nationalist speaker.

Years later, Spencer would through his Radix Journal help spread a metaphor used to explain the jarring experience of waking up to a different worldview. In the 1999 movie The Matrix, the character Morpheus (who is black, incidentally) offers Keanu Reeves a choice between taking a blue pill—"the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe"—or a red pill, which shows "how deep the rabbit hole goes." In the alt-right's telling, the so-called "normies" swallow the blue pill, digesting the fiction of racial equality, while those who get "red pilled" are stripped of the virtual-reality cloak that blinds them, waking up to the shattering realization that liberalism is just a mirage designed to obscure the hard, ugly truths of a world programmed by genetics. "You're destroyed by it," Spencer says, "and put back together again."

After getting red pilled—foremost from his exposure to Taylor online, he says—Spencer began quietly pursuing related ideas through his academic work. He was attracted to the writings of the late University of Chicago professor Leo Strauss, a Jewish German-born philosopher who had been accused by some of supporting fascism. Spencer's master's thesis was an analysis of German philosopher Theodor Adorno, who he argued was afraid to admit how much he loved the music of Wagner because Wagner was an anti-Semite championed by the Nazis. "If you looked at what I was doing, there was a clear interest in radical traditionalist right-wing German philosophy, a semi-fascist type thing," Spencer says. "But there was always plausible deniability to it all."

By the time he entered Duke as a Ph.D. student in European intellectual history in 2005, his views were on his sleeve. Fellow students recall Spencer openly sharing his opinions on biological differences between races and endorsing books such as Harvard professor Samuel Huntington's Who Are We?, which argues that Hispanic immigrants are less suited than Europeans for assimilation. One Caucasian woman who was a student at the time recalls Spencer saying that people with her level of education needed to bear more children. Yet Spencer was charming enough to maintain collegial relations with his peers; an official graduate student party that he hosted at his spacious apartment was well attended. "Not many of us had ever come across as an out-and-out fascist," says a college professor who studied in the same history Ph.D. program as Spencer. "We didn't know how serious he was." (Spencer says he is not a fascist.)

Spencer was more explicit about his views on race and immigration with members of the Duke Conservative Union, where he says he clicked with a columnist for the campus newspaper and fellow DCU member named Stephen Miller. Miller—who would earn acclaim for standing up for white lacrosse players falsely accused of gang raping a black woman—is now a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.

Spencer also defended the Duke lacrosse players, writing about the case for The American Conservative—but that's not the only reason he and Miller hit it off. Spencer says Miller helped him with fundraising and promotion for an on-campus debate on immigration policy that Spencer organized in 2007 featuring influential white nationalist Peter Brimelow. Another former member of the DCU confirmed that Miller and Spencer worked together on the event. At DCU meetings, according to a past president for the group, Miller denounced multiculturalism and expressed concerns that immigrants from non-European countries were not assimilating.

"It's funny no one's picked up on the Stephen Miller connection," Spencer says. "I knew him very well when I was at Duke. But I am kind of glad no one's talked about this because I don't want to harm Trump."

Miller did not respond on the record to specific questions about his activities with the DCU or his views on immigration, but he denied being close to Spencer. "I have absolutely no relationship with Mr. Spencer," he wrote in an email to Mother Jones. "I completely repudiate his views, and his claims are 100 percent false."

After dropping out of Duke, Spencer remained preoccupied with race while at The American Conservative, where he became an editor in 2007. Since its founding in 2002 by the paleoconservative and erstwhile presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and others, TAC had given voice to a ragtag group of Iraq War opponents, protectionists, anti-immigration activists, and Ron Paul libertarians, but Spencer was "a bit extreme for us," recalls TAC editor Scott McConnell. After being fired, Spencer moved on to a new job as the sole editor of Taki's Magazine, the online vanity publication of Taki Theodoracopulos, the scion of a Greek shipping magnate who was notorious for his racist remarks.

"There is something about the Asian girls," Spencer said, after I told him that I'd discovered an interracial relationship from his past. "They are cute. They are smart. They have a kind of thing going on."

In Spencer's telling, he steadily evolved Taki's into a magazine aimed at white nationalists. By 2009 he'd published essays by Jared Taylor and was regularly using the term "alternative right" in its pages to describe his youthful brand of anti-war, anti-immigration, pro-white conservatism. In December 2009, Spencer left Taki's to start AlternativeRight.com. The site caught the attention of the conservative publisher William Regnery II, who'd tried to start a whites-only online dating service, and, more recently, funded the white nationalist National Policy Institute. (His grandfather, William Regnery I, had bankrolled the America First Committee's campaign against fighting Nazi Germany during World War II, and his uncle, Henry, founded the conservative Regnery Publishing, which is known for printing Ann Coulter's books). With Regnery's backing, Spencer took over NPI in 2011 and began championing its message.

But Spencer's evolution into a hardcore ethno-nationalist was perhaps not as seamless as he makes it seem. In late 2007, he dated a woman who is Asian American. The two met when she was working for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.

"I am not the only Asian girl he has dated," says Spencer's ex, who spoke to me on the condition that her name not be disclosed. She said she'd initially been turned off by his talk of race-based behavioral differences, but she eventually softened to the idea. They dated for four months, including a trip she took with him to Texas to attend his high school reunion. She says she eventually broke up with him, but not because he was too politically radical. "We all have inconsistencies," she said. "Especially with love. How can you control your heart?"

I asked Spencer about his Asian ex as he was digging into a bowl of Thai noodles at an eclectic restaurant in the quaint downtown of Whitefish. He seemed shocked that I'd brought it up, and peppered me with questions about how I'd found out. "I would rather you didn't write about that," he said, adding later: "You are probably going to nail me with this…I think some people in the movement would probably find that terrible." He confirmed that she was not the only Asian woman he'd been with, but he said the relationships predated his evolution into a white nationalist.

Though Spencer now opposes interracial relationships, white nationalists have long looked east for inspiration—Hitler regarded Chinese and Japanese history as "superior to our own." Jared Taylor and William Johnson, the leader of the white nationalist American Freedom Party, both speak fluent Japanese. "There is something about the Asian girls," Spencer said. "They are cute. They are smart. They have a kind of thing going on. If I am looking at my own life objectively, it really doesn't surprise me that much."



The town of Whitefish, where Spencer has lived since 2014, sits in a scenic river valley nestled in Montana's Flathead Range, some 40 miles from the Canadian border. Over three days there in late September, it was tough to spot nonwhites. The hotel maids were white, the busboys were white, and the landscapers were white. But while this is part of why Whitefish appeals to Spencer, the town is not particularly thrilled with his presence. Several local restaurants have refused to serve him. He was compelled to resign his membership from the exclusive Big Mountain Ski Club after he got into a chairlift argument about the Iraq War with the neocon Randy Scheunemann, a former adviser to US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and to John McCain in the 2008 election. In 2014, a local human rights group known as Love Lives Here urged the city to bar Spencer from conducting NPI business in town but settled for a resolution condemning hate groups.

A multicolored Love Lives Here poster hangs in the window of the Whitefish Hostel, near an apartment building recently erected by Spencer's mother (who also owns the Bavarian-style mansion Spencer has lived in). Hostel co-owner Kirtlye Lohof seemed amused by Spencer and his concept of racial boundaries, noting that she'd initially thought Spencer's wife, Nina Spencer, had a non-white ethnic background. "Then someone said no, she's just dark-haired Russian," Lohof said, taking a break from making organic smoothies.

Nina Spencer has translated the writings of Alexander Dugin, a prominent far-right Russian nationalist; she and Spencer have each appeared on Russia Today, the Kremlin's English-language news and propaganda network. Some commenters on white-nationalist blogs have speculated that Nina Spencer is part Tatar, a predominately Muslim ethnic group. (Spencer says his wife is not Tatar, but is one quarter Georgian, a predominately Christian ethnic minority in Russia that also spans into Greece, Turkey, and Iran. Nina Spencer declined to comment on the record for this story; the couple is currently undergoing a separation.) Spencer calls Russia "the most powerful white power in the world" and admires Vladimir Putin's authoritarianism—he would gladly admit most Russians into his ideal ethnostate.

Spencer's "racialism" did not become much clearer during one of our conversations in which he asked me about my own ethnic background. Had I done 23andMe to determine where my ancestors hailed from? The genealogy service has become popular on the alt-right, even though ancestry is hardly synonymous with race.

"I am 100 percent European," I told him, thinking it better not to mention that I'm also reportedly 6 percent Ashkenazi Jewish.

"I have 0.1 percent African," he confessed. "Or something like that."

Since Spencer appeared to be opening up, I decided to mention the Jewish thing.

"That's why you are a leftist," he quipped.

He seemed less amused by our lighthearted sparring when I pointed out that, according to the one-drop rule that dominated American law and culture for much of the 20th century, Spencer is technically black and would therefore be ruled out of a white ethnostate.

"Oh no, that's absurd!" he protested, no longer smiling. "No one in my family tree…" He trailed off. "I almost wonder if this is thrown in [by 23andMe] for shits and giggles. Like, 'We're all Africans.'"

Spencer later clarified that he is "not a puritan" about race and would accept in his ethnostate "someone from southern Italy who might have Moorish blood or African blood but has a sense of Catholicism, has a sense of being Italian." You have to look at culture and not just race, he further explained. But lighter skin color apparently matters more to Spencer than acculturation when it comes to Hispanics: He says he would let in Jorge Ramos but not George Lopez.

"Trump brought us from zero to 1. We were talking to ourselves, talking to our own ideas...Now we are still doing that, but we are connected with a campaign, connected with attacking liberals. We've come so far."

Spencer believes that Hispanics and African Americans have lower average IQs than whites and are more genetically predisposed to commit crimes, ideas that are not accepted by the vast majority of scientists. When pressed about what really sets whites apart, he waxes decidedly unscientific: "I think there is something within the European soul that we haven't been able to measure yet and maybe we never will," he says, "and that is a Faustian drive or spirit—a drive to explore, a drive to dominate, a drive to live one's life dangerously…a drive to explore outer space and the universe. I think there is something within us that we possess and that only we possess."

On my last afternoon in town, Spencer finally agreed to show me his office. "You might literally be the first non-family-member who is a visitor," he said, after ushering me through an unmarked door along a commercial strip downtown. On a bookshelf, titles such as IQ & Global Inequality and The Dispossessed Majority shared space with Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal. A framed poster for a James Bond movie, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, hung on one wall—Spencer sees Bond as a heroic example of whiteness who is "perpetuating English tradition in the 21st century." A whiteboard nearby outlined the table of contents for a forthcoming NPI book, a primer on the alt-right that Spencer is editing and wants to publish just in time for a conference the group is scheduled to hold in Washington, DC, less than two weeks after the election. The book is meant for people who may be familiar with alt-light—"someone who reads Milo or something"—but want to go deeper.

NPI's first conference, held in DC in 2011, drew about 85 people. Its second, in 2013, attracted a little over 100. The following year, Spencer attempted to hold a pan-European conference in Budapest, to be keynoted by Dugin, the right-wing Russian nationalist translated by his wife. But Hungarian officials effectively shut it down, declared Spencer a "national security threat," arrested him, and banned him for three years from most of the European Union. For this November's gathering in DC, more than 200 people have already signed up, according to Spencer.

A move to shut down other popular alt-right accounts has engendered a racist code language, with "skypes" and "googles" substituting for "kikes" and "niggers."

The alt-right's expansion has been far more dramatic online. Swastikas and Hitler references have long punctuated the irreverent banter on the message boards of Reddit and 4chan, but they are no longer just jokes as they're swept up in a tide of the alt-right's newer memes such as Pepe the Frog and Napoleon Trump. Racist trolling has likewise grown in profile and sophistication, as seen most recently with the intense harassment of Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones by an alt-right Twitter army egged on by Yiannopoulos (whom Twitter permanently suspended over the incident). A move to shut down other popular, often pseudonymous alt-right accounts has engendered a racist code language, with "skypes" and "googles" substituting for "kikes" and "niggers," for example. Every effort to beat back the trolls prompts denunciations on sites such as The Daily Stormer, The Right Stuff, and Breitbart News, in turn leading to debates in more mainstream publications over the limits of speech.

The crown jewel of the alt-right's media universe, Breitbart News now rivals the New York Post for traffic. The site often flirts with overt racism, as when it used a picture of Harambe the gorilla to illustrate a story about President Barack Obama and birtherism. Former executive chairman Stephen Bannon long championed anti-Muslim extremists on his daily radio show, and Yiannopoulos has portrayed alt-right figures as "dangerously bright." Breitbart News also connects to Spencer's media orbit: The home page editor of Breitbart News, Katie McHugh, until recently dated far-right blogger Kevin DeAnna, who has written articles and appeared in podcasts published by Spencer. ("My relationship was never 'secret' but it's pretty funny it's newsworthy to a shitlib, meaning you," McHugh wrote to me when I asked her for comment.) McHugh has drawn attention for her Twitter rants about Mexicans, Muslims, and "Third Worlders":

Funny how Europeans assimilated, unlike Third Worlders demanding welfare while raping, killing Americans. https://t.co/n1iqggqlwb — Deplorable Katie (@k_mcq) September 17, 2015

The anger fueling the alt-right can't be summarily dismissed; it is the product of a white working class left behind by automation, outsourcing, and the era of rising income inequality. "Mainstream conservatism was never able to rethink itself," says Spencer, who faults the GOP for clinging to an outdated free-market ideology and ignoring the country's massive demographic shifts. Despite the reality that blacks and Latinos still lag far behind whites in wealth and income, eight years of GOP-sanctioned demagoguery against America's first black president has made it easier for some working-class whites to be persuaded that the system is rigged against them. In Spencer's view, similar resentments have cropped up among younger, college-educated whites for whom "enforced multiculturalism" on college campuses is giving shape to a new kind of white identity politics. "The alt-right would not exist if it weren't for terrible immigration policies and social justice warriors and liberalism and maybe the Barack Obama presidency," Spencer says. "They made us."

Then came the real shot in the arm. "Trump brought us from zero to 1," Spencer says. "He brought us from a movement that was very interesting but ultimately marginal—ultimately disconnected from reality, you could even say. We were talking to ourselves, talking to our own ideas. Now we are still doing that, but we are connected with a campaign, connected with attacking liberals. We've come so far."



When something is bothering Spencer, he likes to go for a hike. At his suggestion, we leave the office and hit a trail just outside of town. The autumn sun hangs low in the sky, making mountain maples glow yellow like tea lanterns. We stop and sit on a bench overlooking a rugged valley, a tableau that reminds Spencer of a painting by the 19th-century German landscape artist Caspar David Friedrich.

"I still feel like we are faking it until we make it," he confesses. "I mean, in some ways, you've got to fucking fake it. You have to project success and project power and kind of make it a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I do have this fear that it's not going to ultimately get to that. We've gotten over the first hurdle, which is ignorance [of the alt-right], and now we need to get over the second hurdle, which is becoming a multimillion-dollar professional movement. I don't want to go back to paleoconservatism or some intellectual white nationalism that has no connection with politics and the scene. That would be tremendously depressing."

But he has faith in the Overton window: the idea that the range of acceptable political discourse gets defined by a safe distance between extremes. "If you want to radically shift the Overton window, you need that far-right flank for that to make sense," he says. "Clearly, we are working with Trump in this way."

Spencer laments that Trump may have shown up too late to win over an increasingly diverse country, but too early to fully benefit from the alt-right's emergence. A bigger, more organized alt-right could become an effective opposition movement that is catered to by politicians who need its votes to win elections. Spencer believes this may even coalesce around a more liberal set of economic ideas—nationalized health care, a higher minimum wage—but with those policies only held together by the glue of "white culture." "We weren't quite ready for Trump, but we need to get ready right now," Spencer says, reprising the case he says he has been making lately to potential donors, in hopes of acquiring prestigious office space for NPI in Washington. "We need a footprint that says, 'We're here, we're queer, get used to it.'"

He envisions a beachhead on K Street as part of an evolution toward nothing less than the collapse of the American political system as we know it. "In this weird way that Trump is trying to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to America, he's also, like, bringing America to an end in the sense that he is a first step to white identity politics, which will bring about fragmentation," Spencer says as we walk back through town. "This is where I am kind of a Hegelian. Whenever you see a phenomenon, you see its negative aspect. There is a dark side to something that is happening, and I think that is Trump's dark side, that he is reviving America and accelerating…"

He pauses, searching for how to put it.

"Accelerating the crumbling?" I ask, as we head back inside the Firebrand.

"Exactly," he laughs. "That's why I love him, yes."A federal judge blocked Kansas’ effort to cut off two regional Planned Parenthood affiliates’ Medicaid funding, ruling the move likely violates federal law.

In a 54-page decision handed down late Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson granted a preliminary injunction sought by Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri (now known as Planned Parenthood Great Plains) and by Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.

Robinson found that the plaintiffs would probably be able to show at trial that the grounds cited by the state for terminating their participation in the Medicaid program were inapplicable.

In a May 3 letter to the affiliates, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment cited three grounds for terminating their Medicaid funding: video evidence that other Planned Parenthood affiliates entered into illegal agreements to procure fetal tissue after abortions; an alleged failure to comply with solid waste disposal inspections; and concerns over Medicaid claims submitted by other Planned Parenthood affiliates in neighboring states.

Robinson said the Planned Parenthood affiliates were likely to prevail on all three claims.

“Medicaid patients have the explicit right to seek family planning services from the qualified provider of their choice,” she wrote. “It is uncontroverted that PPKM (Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri) and PPSLR (Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region) serve hundreds of underprivileged women in the State of Kansas. It is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the qualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending a trial on the merits in this case.”

The Kansas health department notified the affiliates of its intentions nearly four months after Gov. Sam Brownback vowed to defund them in his State of the State address. Brownback accused Planned Parenthood of trafficking in “baby body parts,” even though several days earlier the Kansas Board of Healing Arts had found no merit to the charge.

“We promised to fight Gov. Brownback’s fool’s errand in his attempt to cut funding to Planned Parenthood and today marks one more step forward in defending access for patients,” Laura McQuade, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement shortly after Robinson handed down her decision. “While Gov. Brownback continues touting baseless accusations and wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous lawsuits, Planned Parenthood refuses to allow politics to get in the way of access to health care.”

Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for Brownback, told KCUR that the administration will review today’s ruling and move forward with the case.

“The governor is going to continue the fight to make Kansas a pro-life state,” she said. “You know, this is a preliminary ruling. We need to look at the ruling more closely, but our intent is to move forward with the litigation.”

The two affiliates filed their lawsuit just a day after learning it was going to lose its Medicaid funding. The suit named the head of the agency, Susan Mosier, and alleged that the agency’s action was unlawful and based on spurious grounds. The affiliates were joined by 11 current and former medical providers at the two affiliates whose participation in Medicaid the agency also sought to terminate.

Kansas recently agreed to rescind its termination of the individual medical providers, leaving just the Planned Parenthood affiliates as plaintiffs.

Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri last year served nearly 450 Medicaid patients –adults with monthly income of no more than $768 who were pregnant, disabled or parents. The St. Louis affiliate operates a clinic in Joplin, just over the Kansas state line, and serves a small number of Kansas patients.

The state’s move to end Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid funding came just two weeks after the Obama administration warned all 50 states that they cannot cut funding to medical providers simply because they also offer abortion services.

Under federal law, Medicaid funds can’t be used to pay for abortions unless the mother’s life is in danger or she was the victim of rape or incest.

Kansas is one of several states, including Missouri, that have cut off or threatened to cut off Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid funding. Courts in several states – Kansas is now the latest – have blocked those moves.

Robinson’s decision, which was expected, comes just eight days after the U.S. Supreme Court found that two Texas restrictions on abortion clinics – requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and requiring clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers – placed an “undue burden” on the right to an abortion.

There are two things wrong with President Trump’s claim that Senate Democrats are delaying confirmation of his Cabinet picks. First, it’s not true; the pace of hearings, probes, and votes has been about the same as in previous administrations. Second, if Trump is suggesting that the delays are preventing his government from revving up, he’s the one to blame.

Three weeks into his presidency, Trump has not nominated any second-tier officials—the deputy, under, and assistant secretaries—in a major department. Whatever the merits of his various Cabinet secretaries, they are heading empty shells.

Yes, Secretary of Defense James Mattis flew to Asia to assure his counterparts in South Korea and Japan that America’s commitment to their defense is rock solid (despite some of Trump’s remarks to the contrary). Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reinforced that message with phone calls himself.

But then what? Traditionally, the appropriate underlings—the undersecretary of state for political affairs, the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, and various others—would follow up, in phone calls and face-to-face meetings, to discuss specific issues, allay specific concerns, reshape imperfect accords, untangle some misunderstandings. Asian allies in particular require almost daily hand-holding.

Get Slate in your inbox.

But none of this can happen, because there are no officials who can do it. Nor can the Trump administration do much to form new policies, assess new trends, or address new threats. Usually, the National Security Council’s Deputies Committee does the staff work—sometimes the initial analysis—on these sorts of issues. But it can’t be done now, because there are no deputy or undersecretaries to fill a Deputies Committee. There are acting deputy and undersecretaries, but they’re holdovers from the Obama administration, and so, they can’t pretend—or be trusted—to speak for the new crowd. They tend to be junior hangovers, at that, since most of Obama’s midlevel officials left on Inauguration Day, either by their own choice or at Team Trump’s insistence.

Officials at this level are presidential appointees, and the slots are usually filled—at least tentatively (for they, too, require Senate confirmation)—in the transition between the election and the start of the term. Some presidents give Cabinet secretaries leeway to pick their own underlings or to reject the ones offered, but only to a degree and sometimes barely that. Presidents don’t want a Cabinet that’s too independent; putting their own people in key positions is one way to maintain control. In this administration, Mattis has pushed back on several of Trump’s preferred undersecretaries, and he may be the only Cabinet secretary with the moxie and leverage to do so. The others are still waiting.

Ordinarily this delay in staffing wouldn’t much matter. New administrations take some time to find their footing; crises rarely occur so early on. But Trump has been spawning mini-crises almost daily. With nearly every phone call to a foreign head-of-state comes a tantrum, a faux pas, or at very least a storm of confusion that heightens tensions or foments new uncertainties. Usually, before presidents call a head of state, they’re briefed on the major issues concerning that country, the positions held by both sides, perhaps some personal peculiarities. For heads of particularly important countries, they’re given briefing folders to read in advance. Trump reads no such folders and hears no such briefings, except sometimes an informal point or two, delivered not by a State Department official, but by his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who, in some cases, has his own agenda and, in others, has little to say.

Several foreign leaders have shaken their heads in wonder at these phone calls, so hostile or, in any case, bewildering. French President François Hollande told aides that all Trump seemed to care about was the money that America spends on the rest of the world. Trump famously screamed at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a prior deal for the United States to receive 1,200 refugees—in part because Trump didn’t know about the deal and, on a broader level, had no knowledge of the critical role that Australia plays in Asian security or in the global U.S. intelligence network. In another phone call, when Russian President Vladimir Putin asked about extending the Obama-era New START nuclear-arms-reduction treaty, Trump scoffed at the treaty as a bad deal that gives Moscow an advantage—in part because he was unfamiliar with the treaty, which in fact requires both sides to cut their nuclear arsenals to equal levels and which, meanwhile, gives the United States unprecedented rights of inspection.

It’s not clear whether Trump would have wanted a State Department briefing on these subjects, had one of his own people been available to give it. But he had no such people, and there were no briefings.George Frey/Getty Images

First man out

It took less than a month—24 days to be exact—for President Donald Trump’s administration to suffer its first high-level resignation when Michael Flynn was pushed out from his post as national security adviser Monday night. The ouster, which had been anticipated for several days, has sparked fresh questions about the administration’s contacts with Moscow, which NBC News described as “arguably the biggest scandal involving a foreign government since Iran-Contra.”

The affair went into overdrive when the Washington Post reported that, contrary to White House statements, Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. before Trump’s inauguration. Flynn’s message to the ambassador was clear, according to the New York Times: Relations would be friendlier under Trump.

Democrats renewed demands for investigations and a full accounting of the Trump campaign’s contact with Russia, and some Republicans appear to be buckling under the pressure. That pressure is only bound to get stronger after CNN and the Times revealed Trump aides were in “constant” contact with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. Intelligence agents were apparently sufficiently alarmed by the contacts to talk anonymously to reporters, although they say there’s no evidence of collusion between Trump’s associates and Russia on the election hacking. Trump took to Twitter to dismiss the stories as Democratic sour grapes.

Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was moved from chief of staff of the White House National Security Council to serve as acting national security adviser.

Insecurity theater

The resignation came after a week filled with national security–related anxiety, as Trump appeared to flout security protocols by turning the crowded terrace of his Mar-a-Lago resort into what the Washington Post called an “open-air situation room.” After North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test on Sunday, Trump took the call at his table, where he was dining with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Waiters continued to serve Trump’s party dinner, and diners took photos of Trump at work (one photo in particular appeared to capture the very essence of the Trump administration). Aides lit up documents for Trump with flashlights on their cellphones. Trump later stopped by a wedding (of a donor’s son, of course) with Abe in tow.

In the midst of these questions came an explosive New York Times story that shed light on some of the turmoil within the National Security Council. Veteran staff are troubled by overt partisanship and an increased emphasis on military rather than diplomatic solutions. The piece also revealed Trump liked to receive one-page briefings “with lots of graphics and maps.” In one official’s words, “the president likes maps.”

Giving China what it wants

Trump has long seemed to relish needling China, but this week the president bent over backward for Beijing, assuring President Xi Jinping that the United States had no plans to abandon the “one China” policy, reversing an earlier suggestion that the decadeslong diplomatic understanding could be in doubt. Trump gave the message during an “extremely cordial” phone call with Xi, who had apparently explicitly requested the president’s reassurance on the issue. Reports credited Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for the shift; Tillerson had also toned down what seemed to be the threat of a naval blockade of China’s islands in the South China Sea.

Religious conservatives are enjoying a growing influence inside the White House, writes Jeremy Peters in the New York Times:

Mr. Trump, a profane, bombastic, thrice-married New Yorker, may not have been the candidate many religious conservatives prayed would win the White House. But the mutually beneficial arrangement he has nurtured with the Christian right is already starting to nudge the government in a more conservative direction.

…

A group that has felt shunted aside by the Republican establishment is finding doors open more quickly and willingly than it did even under friendly presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

Look past all the noise and you’ll quickly discover that Trump hasn’t actually done much in his first month in office, writes Zachary Karabell in Politico:

So far, Trump has behaved exactly like he has throughout his previous career: He has generated intense attention and sold himself as a man of action while doing little other than promote an image of himself as someone who gets things done.

Why does the White House continue to push false claims of voter fraud? Because it wants to strip away the right to vote for millions of Americans, warns Slate’s Jamelle Bouie:

Birtherism helped the set the stage for the rapid rise and success of a mass nativist movement. In the hands of Donald Trump, the voter fraud myth may do the same for the growing effort to make voting hard again—to make voting white again.

This Week in @realDonaldTrump

Last take

Trump’s weird handshakes, in which the president flails his hands about and jerks his handshake partner in and out, came under scrutiny this week. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was subjected to a painfully awkward 19-second-long handshake last week. GIFs of the event circulated on social media, and John Oliver covered it on Last Week Tonight.Pres.-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Andy Puzder for Labor Secretary alarmed immigration-reduction activists with his past support for the Gang of 8 amnesty bill that would have tripled the number of lifetime work permits issued over 10 years. But Puzder released a statement over the weekend declaring his commitment to Trump's campaign pledge to protect American workers and their wages from foreign worker competition.

Puzder serves as the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns both Carl's, Jr. and Hardee's. As CEO, he was a vocal supporter of immigration expansion and amnesty, writing several op-eds in support of the Gang of 8 legislation and working with the Partnership for a New American Economy, which pushes for an expansion of current immigration levels.

But on Saturday, Puzder issued the following statement:

My job as a business person is to maximize profits for my company, employees and shareholders. My job as the Secretary of Labor, if confirmed, is to serve U.S. citizen workers – that is my moral and constitutional duty. The public spoke loud and clear in this election, and delivered a mandate to protect American workers. It makes no economic sense to spend trillions on welfare and jobless benefits for out of work Americans while bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs in their place. As Secretary of Labor, I will fiercely defend American workers and implement my piece of the ten point plan the President-elect laid out. President-elect Trump’s plan to establish new immigration controls will boost wages and ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. Hire American and Buy American is our policy, and the one supported by voters in both parties. I will not provide guest worker visas to companies that break the rules, and will support reforms to raise wages for Americans — I know the system from the inside, and will be the best champion American workers have had. With 94 million Americans outside the labor force, and massive unemployment in our inner cities and among minority workers, my job will be to help these workers find jobs. We also have large unemployment in our immigrant communities, and these communities benefit the most from clamping down on guest worker programs that compete against them.

In his historic August immigration speech in Arizona, then-candidate Trump advanced 10 changes to the immigration system to increase enforcement and protect American workers. One point, which is still listed on his campaign website, includes "Reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, keeping immigration levels within historic norms."

Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s nominee for the vacancy on the Supreme Court, is a consistently conservative judge who’d enter the court at a critical moment for reproductive rights. Though Gorsuch, a federal judge on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has never ruled on an abortion rights case, his record shows him to be hostile to women’s health care and willing to give broad leeway to institutions that want to discriminate against women.

Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.



Women will be affected by every decision that comes out of the next iteration of the Supreme Court, of course, whether the cases deal with voting rights, labor issues, immigrant rights, civil liberties, criminal justice, or any other area of law. Because women make less money than men, shoulder the bulk of home and family responsibilities, and have less access to traditional spheres of power, they are in fact particularly dependent on legal protections, and they will likely be disproportionately impacted by any harm that comes from the court’s decisions.

Nowhere is that clearer than in the field of public health. Anti-abortion advocates believe Trump and his pick will lead their fight to overturn Roe v. Wade, a strong, if imperfect, safeguard of abortion rights. A recent report from the Center for Reproductive Rights found that 22 states would be likely to roll back abortion rights immediately if Roe were overturned. Some of these states already have anti-abortion laws on the books that predate Roe (that means they’re currently unenforceable but would become effective if Roe fell) or laws passed specifically to go into effect in the event that Roe gets axed.

Still, overturning Roe would probably require a state legislature willing to pass a blatantly unconstitutional ban, years of court battles, and five justices willing to undo clear Supreme Court precedent on an issue that hasn’t seen a broad shift in public opinion. More Americans currently support Roe than ever before.

That means there are other, less drastic battles for women’s health care access that will probably come up first. The anti-abortion set has its eyes on Roe, but conservative state legislatures are reliable incubators of laws that incrementally roll back rights and access to reproductive health care. These laws make the Supreme Court docket a whack-a-mole of restrictions that seek to make it more inconvenient, expensive, and degrading to get a constitutionally protected health care procedure. Gorsuch may end up ruling on laws that ban abortions after a certain pre-viability gestation threshold, force abortion providers to get admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, or require abortion clinics abide by unnecessary building codes. Several states already have laws like these percolating through the courts.

Justice Stephen Breyer’s June opinion in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a decision that struck down two Texas regulations on abortion providers, made a clear statement that these laws restricted women’s access to abortion care without solving any public health problem, as anti-abortion advocates claimed they did. Without Antonin Scalia, who died last February, the decision came down with a 5–3 split. It’s notable that another anti-abortion vote wouldn’t have changed the outcome of this case, which many hailed as the most significant abortion case set before the Supreme Court in decades. This is reason to hope for evidence-based decisions on women’s health care in the future court, no matter how Gorsuch ends up acting on abortion cases.

Gorsuch is also likely to face cases that put contraceptive access and insurance coverage on the chopping block. Whether or not Republicans follow through on their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they are likely to continue trying to make birth control and abortion care more expensive and difficult to get. Just last week, they passed a House bill that would discourage insurance providers from covering abortion in their plans.

Gorsuch, the son of perhaps the most corrupt head of the Environmental Protection Agency in its history, came down on the side of religious zealots in the notorious case of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby, Inc., in which the craft chain’s owners won the right to deny their employees contraception coverage despite the ACA’s mandate. In the 10th Circuit’s ruling, Gorsuch attributed to the company the capacity for spiritual reverie. The ACA forced Hobby Lobby to “violate their religious faith” by covering birth control, which “their religion teaches to be gravely wrong,” the ruling stated. Gorsuch described birth control drugs and devices as having the effect of “destroying a fertilized human egg”—a claim that is demonstrably false, even in most cases of emergency contraceptive use.

Gorsuch also joined a dissenting opinion when Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, another challenge to the ACA’s contraceptive mandate, came before the 10th Circuit. The dissent called the mandate a burden to the plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion. In a 1996 amicus brief in a case about physician-assisted suicide, Gorsuch wrote that requiring public hospitals to provide abortions was an instance of “the courts [feeling] free to override the conscience of health care providers.” In other words, Gorsuch believes that doctors, corporations, and individuals should be able to discriminate against women, preventing them from accessing necessary health care, on account of any personal whim they claim to the court.

More recently, Gorsuch wanted to rehear, and likely reverse, a 10th Circuit panel decision blocking Utah’s attempt to defund Planned Parenthood. The movement to defund Planned Parenthood by preventing patients from using Medicaid dollars on nonabortion services there has been based on false claims of illegal fetal tissue sales. Gorsuch gave credence to Utah Gov. Gary Herbert’s claims of such trafficking, which he proffered without any supporting evidence, instead of dismissing them as a political maneuver, as a majority of his fellow judges did.

The bad news is that Trump has nominated a judge who will join the conservative wing of the court and likely come down against women when their rights are presented for argument. The good news is that, if confirmed, Gorsuch will replace Antonin Scalia, a merciless and sanctimonious anti-abortion advocate who argued that sex discrimination against women was acceptable under the Constitution. As far as the health, safety, and civil rights of America’s women are concerned, it’s hard to imagine how the court could do worse.*The latter three countries all have unusually large numbers of Facebook, Twitter or YouTube users, or their Chinese equivalents, which together constitute a virtual square where they connect, promote change and challenge authority. The most popular Vietnamese blogger, Nguyen Quang Lap, has more followers than any government newspaper here. In Saudi Arabia, one of the most popular Twitter hash tags is “#If I met the King I would tell him.”

And The Square People are only getting more numerous and empowered. “Our goal is that, in three years, every Vietnamese will own a smartphone,” Nguyen Manh Hung, who leads the Viettel Group, a Vietnamese telecom, told me. “We are now manufacturing a smartphone for less than $40 and our goal is $35. We charge $2 a month for Internet connection for a P.C. and $2.50 for voice from a smartphone.” Because the Vietnamese media is tightly censored, it is no accident that 22 million of Vietnam’s 90 million people are on Facebook. Just two years ago there were only 8 million. Vietnam has about 100,000 students studying abroad; a decade ago it was a tenth of that. All future Square People.

To be sure, The Square People represent a diverse politics, including the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and ultranationalists in Kiev. But the dominant trend running through them all is this: “We now have the tools to see how everyone is living, including opportunities abroad and corrupt leaders at home, and we will not tolerate indefinitely living in a context where we can’t realize our full potential. And also we now have the tools to collaborate to do something about it.”

As a Vietnamese foreign policy expert put it, the Square People one way or another “are demanding a new social contract” with the old guards who’ve dominated politics. “The people want their voice to be heard in every major debate,” not to mention better schools, roads and rule of law. And they are quick to compare with others: “ ‘Why do those Thai get to go demonstrate and we can’t?’ ”

Ukraine’s Square People want to associate with the European Union — not only because they think that’s the key to prosperity, but because they think European rules, judicial norms, standards and transparency requirements will force the changes they want at home but cannot generate from above or below. Vietnamese reformers want to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership for the same reasons. Unlike Davos Men, The Square People want to use the global economy to reform their countries, not rise above them.

I gave a talk on globalization at the National University in Hanoi. Afterward I chatted with a young woman, Anh Nguyen, 19, a student who had asked several good questions. Her conversation was peppered with Square talk: “I feel empowered. ... I think Vietnam can change. ... Please tell the world about the big embezzlement case [at a state-owned shipping company] that was uncovered here. Before people would have been silent, but the verdict came out and they sentenced the [bosses] to death. ... It really surprised people. ... Now not every big boss is protected by the government. ... We get many different sources of information from the world. It opens eyes.” She has a much greater chance to achieve her potential than her parents, she added, “but not as much as I want.”

Some loyalists unhappy with pick; wanted Trump insider

Washington, D.C. (CNN) Crossroads Media founder Mike Dubke is expected to be named as White House Communications Director, two administration officials tell CNN.

The appointment is expected to be announced as early as Friday, the officials say.

The expected appointment is rankling some inside the White House, with longtime Trump loyalists inside and outside the West Wing saying they would have preferred a veteran from the campaign.

"Dubke and his Crossroads friends did everything they could to kill the Trump movement and failed," one loyalist said.

Former Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller was originally tapped to serve as communications director for the White House, but Miller stepped aside before Inauguration Day to spend more time with his family.

Dorie learned the recipe from Martine Collet, one of her oldest friends in Paris, and couldn’t quite believe it. There are only three ingredients: egg, almond, and sugar, simply stirred together—and in very un-cookie-like fashion, no flour or butter.

It’s not entirely clear how these three ingredients become a cookie, but between the handy glue of egg and sugar, the architectural advantages of sliced almonds, and the crispability of all of the above, they do. “It's a miracle of a recipe in that it's delicious, of course, beautiful, in a higgledy-piggledy never-perfect way, and a snap to make,” Dorie says.

But beyond the fact that this exercise in minimalism just happens to work, it tastes like so much more than just these three ingredients and this care-free technique—there are warm, toasty caramel notes, and a sweet vanilla-like scent.

There’s a wild array of textures—the shattering, airy crunch of meringue at the edges, and the softer one of toasted almonds, with rolling bubbles and pockets skittering across the surface. They’re more relaxed than a Florentine, more lightweight than a brittle. And they’re altogether really lovely over a cup of coffee with an old friend.

Beyond this come on over! scenario, Dorie also recommends these first for someone who’s never baked before. “They're an easy treat for anyone to share in an act of #cookiesandkindness. And who doesn't love—and need—a lot of cookies and a little kindness now?”

Once cooled, I’ve found they also travel and store extremely well (if it’s not too humid, that is)—I’m still taste-testing the last of a big batch I baked three weeks ago, just to explore their magical powers further. So bake and share them freely, with your Valentine, your office, your kids’ teachers, your mail carrier, your barista, your dentist.

House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to cut taxes. He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He wants to eliminate federal reimbursements for health services at Planned Parenthood. He wants to slash domestic discretionary spending. He wants to voucherize Medicare. This is just a modest sampling of the conservative policy agenda of Paul Ryan’s dreams that he is only now getting a realistic opportunity to enact into law. Doing so requires him to maintain good relations with the adult child he needs to trick into signing these bills. It means staying out of the baby’s way during his tantrums and sprees. It means, on days like Saturday, being a coward.

Donald Trump has temporarily shut the door on refugee admissions. He has indefinitely shut the door on Syrian refugee admissions. Lawful permanent residents of the United States and other visa holders coming from certain Muslim-majority countries are being denied entry into the U.S. right now, pending case-by-case evaluations or until the courts toss this junk out. Once refugee admissions resume, the government will “prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.” In other words, Trump has instructed the government to use religion as a means of prioritizing the processing of refugee applications. This, by Trump’s own admission, prioritizes Christians over Muslims coming from countries like Iraq or Yemen or Syria—if any Syrians are ever allowed—or other horrific lands from which someone might seek refuge. It effectively discriminates against Muslims on the basis of their religion. Call it whatever you’d like.

Most Republicans aren’t calling it anything. They’re keeping their mouths shut. Others, like Sen. Ben Sasse, find the order “too broad” even if it’s not “technically a Muslim ban.” The speaker of the House, however, is lauding Trump’s executive order, per his statement Friday night:

“Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it’s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process. This is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees. President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.”

The post-Paris legislation Ryan is referring to is the American SAFE Act. This 2015 bill basically required additional layers of signoffs on refugee applicants from Iraq and Syria. It would have ground refugee resettlement to a near halt, and 47 House Democrats did indeed vote for it. Senate Democrats successfully filibustered it, and it died.

One word that did not appear in the American SAFE Act, though, was religion.

Ryan made a big point of this in pitching the bill. “I also want to point out that we will not have a religious test,” he said in 2015. “Only a security test.”

Here is how AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, addressed the quite glaring religious component of Trump’s executive order on Saturday. “This is not a religious test,” she told the Washington Post, “and it is not a ban on people of any religion.”

This is exactly the legalese dodge that the authors of Trump’s order are trying to get away with: It doesn’t explicitly ban people by religion, therefore it’s not a religious test, so what’s to worry about? All it does is send people to second-class status because of their religion. This is an order that discriminates against Muslims. How savvy of Ryan’s office to locate the “out” that Trump’s people carved in.State AGs Can Enforce Emoluments Clause Against Trump

Law360, New York (February 10, 2017, 1:32 PM EST) -- The foreign emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution states, “no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.” Article I, Section 9, Cl. 8.



The compensation (or domestic emoluments) clause prohibits the president from receiving, on top of his salary, “any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.” Article II, Section 1, Cl. 7....

To view the full article, register now.In North Carolina, a husband left his house to start a car, only to be handcuffed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. In Los Angeles, a man was arrested at the Walmart where he worked. In Garden City, Kansas, whole apartments of people were fingerprinted and taken into custody.

They’re three of the more than 680 people that ICE agents around the country — from the Midwest to the Southeast, California to New York — have arrested in the past week. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, in a statement Monday, calls it “a series of targeted enforcement operations,” and maintains it’s no different from what ICE has done “for many years.” Critics call it a series of nationwide raids — and claim it’s the first step toward President Donald Trump fulfilling his promise to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants.

The reality is somewhere in the middle. Nothing that ICE did last week was unprecedented. But it feels different with President Trump in the White House — and that’s something that ICE agents and immigrants alike know all too well.

For the most part, last week’s raids wouldn’t have been out of place in the early years of the Obama administration. ICE agents didn’t (despite rumors to the contrary) set up street-level checkpoints to demand proof of citizenship of anyone in passing cars. They didn’t sweep through whole apartment buildings and arrest whole blocks’ worth of immigrants. They didn’t deliberately target immigrants simply for being in the country without papers.

What distinguished last week’s raids from the Obama era were three things: First, ICE agents broke with years of Obama-administration policy by making “collateral arrests” — arresting unauthorized immigrants who happened to be in the place they were raiding, even if they didn’t have a warrant for them. Second, the agency deliberately coordinated a series of nationwide raids, scooping up more people in less time than ICE raids typically do.

Finally, of course, President Obama — who spent much of his presidency attempting to reassure unauthorized immigrants that if they hadn’t committed crimes in the US, they were safe from deportation — isn’t in office anymore. In his place is a president who got elected promising a new, tougher era in immigration enforcement, one in which immigrants were more broadly targeted and ICE agents less restrained.

Last week’s raids don’t necessarily represent that new era yet. But it’s not surprising that they’re being seen that way.

What we know about last week’s raids

According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 680 immigrants were arrested in the past week — in regions spanning the country.

The New York Times reported Monday that 160 were arrested in the Los Angeles area, with another 40 or so arrested in the New York area. “An additional 200 were arrested last week in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina,” the Times reports, and “about 200 were arrested across Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin” (including Gardenville, Kansas).

Other enforcement sweeps were reported in the Baltimore and DC metro areas; in Austin, Dallas, and Pflugerville, Texas; in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; in Plant City, Florida; and elsewhere.

For the most part, the raids appear to have been targeted efforts to catch individual immigrants that ICE had gotten warrants to arrest. DHS’s statement claimed that “approximately 75%” of the immigrants arrested were “criminal aliens,” implying they had criminal convictions — though many of those convictions were almost certainly for minor crimes (or simply for reentering the country illegally).

Confusingly, another DHS official told the Washington Post that anyone who’d entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa counted as a “criminal alien” — but that definition would fit all 680 of the people arrested last week, not just 75 percent of them, so it doesn’t appear to be the definition used in the DHS statement.

Immigrants who had previously gotten orders of deportation also appeared to be targets in Los Angeles and Maryland.

But it’s also clear that when ICE agents encountered other unauthorized immigrants along with the person they were seeking — or when they didn’t find that person, but found other unauthorized immigrants instead — others were arrested too.

“They show you some sort of warrant and they go in and fingerprint everybody,” says Ambar Pinto, who manages a hotline for immigrants to report ICE activity to the advocacy network United We Dream. Anyone whose fingerprints reveal them to be unauthorized is arrested; “if there’s children in the house,” Pinto says, “they will leave the mother behind with an order to report to ICE for a check-in.”

In other cases, ICE agents have reportedly used aggressive tactics. Maria Fernanda Durand of the advocacy group CASA de Maryland reports that, instead of attempting to enter houses to serve warrants, ICE agents waited outside houses and arrested people when they left the house to go to work. In Maryland and elsewhere, ICE agents made arrests out of uniforms — or while wearing a vest that said ICE on the back, but, as Pinto says, “if they’re knocking on your door you can’t see that.”

The truth of the raids, however, has sometimes been overshadowed by rumors that sound much worse than anything that’s been documented — but that have ultimately been debunked.

There is no evidence of street-level “checkpoints” where ICE agents stop drivers to ask for proof of citizenship, though rumors of such checkpoints are ubiquitous. (The National Immigration Law Center, in a two-page document sent to its network warning them what to look for, didn’t include checkpoints in its list of “practices” in which ICE was engaging; advocates in Austin, where the checkpoints were most widely rumored, say they don’t exist.) Other, more specific rumors — like a widely-circulated Facebook post claiming that ICE agents in Kansas City planned to arrest immigrants on their way out of church — turned out to be baseless as well.

The current ICE raids may be more in line with the prior immigration policy than they seem

As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has claimed that his predecessors didn’t do anything to enforce immigration law. He’s wrong. He’s actually continuing an era of aggressive enforcement that started under George W. Bush and continued under Barack Obama.

One of the key tactics used by both the Bush and Obama administrations was the immigration raid. Often, under Obama in particular, targeted “surges” were used to track down individuals who met enforcement priorities: immigrants who’d been convicted of crimes, immigration “fugitives” who had already been given orders of deportation, or people who’d been deported and re-entered the United States. In Obama’s last year in office, ICE conducted 18 “surges” (according to press releases on the agency’s site). In the biggest, a month-long sweep of several Midwestern states, it arrested 331 people. A Los Angeles raid netted 112 immigrants in a week.

Obama used increased enforcement as a credibility-building tool with the public as he attempted to push Congress to enact an immigration overhaul that would have given millions of undocumented Americans a path to citizenship.

Trump, by contrast, appears to be using raids, and enforcement, as an end in themselves.

An executive order Trump signed in his first week in office redefined enforcement priorities to include, in practice, pretty much every unauthorized immigrant in the US.

But ICE is claiming that last week’s raids were in line with the old priorities issued by Obama — and that the raids were just a continuation of what the agency has been doing.

On a press call, ICE officials in Los Angeles claimed that, of the 161 arrests they made, “all but 5 would’ve been people we would’ve prioritized for enforcement previously.” Another ICE official told the Times, “The president has been clear in saying that D.H.S. should be focused on removing individuals who pose a threat to public safety, who have been charged with criminal offenses, who have committed multiple immigration violations or who have been deported and re-entered the country illegally.” This sounds like the “priorities” issued by President Obama circa 2011 — not the ones issued by President Trump in 2017.

ICE’s claims don’t exactly line up with the reports from advocacy groups on the ground — but they’re not that far off, either. Advocates claim that ICE is going after people that it could have deported in the past, but explicitly decided not to — like Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, who was deported from Arizona last week — or people who have years-old final orders of deportation.

Obama, in a November 2014 memo, told ICE agents to focus on people who’d been ordered deported since the beginning of 2014. Now, Pinto says, “they are going after anyone who has ever had a removal order.” That’s a shift from the most recent Obama administration policy — but it’s identical to the policy that the Obama administration carried out over its first term, in which any “fugitive,” no matter how long ago they were ordered deported, was a priority.

ICE agents are now free to make “collateral arrests” — something they’ve been demanding for years

When Kelly maintained in Monday’s statement that “The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE’s Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis,” he wasn’t necessarily wrong.

But he was only telling half the story. His department has changed its policy toward the immigrants it’s not explicitly “focusing” on — which make up the overwhelming majority of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. To millions of immigrants and their communities, last week’s raids represented a potential threat of the type they hadn’t seen in years: the threat of becoming a “collateral” victim of an ICE raid simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The immigrants caught up in “collateral arrests” last week aren’t authorized to be in the US, but have never had a criminal record or been deported or ordered deported. In some cases, they happened to be in the same apartment as someone ICE was looking for. In others, ICE had the wrong address but fingerprinted and arrested anyone who was there anyway.

Collateral arrests were known to happen under the Obama administration. But generally, ICE agents were under instructions to arrest people identified in advance, and only those people.

Many rank-and-file ICE agents hated this.

In 2011, the president of the ICE union, Chris Crane, testified to Congress that agents “were not permitted to arrest or even speak to confirmed or suspected illegal aliens encountered in the field during operations, and were prohibited from running standard criminal record checks for wants and warrants.”

Crane testified before Congress that the policies were prohibiting ICE from “enforcing many laws enacted by Congress; laws they took an oath to enforce.” He cited them as evidence that the agency’s policy was being controlled by “powerful special interest groups that advocate on behalf of illegal aliens.” When his union backed Donald Trump for president in the 2016 election, it was in large part based on Trump’s promise to take the “handcuffs” off ICE agents and allow them to do their jobs the way they saw fit.

The raids were designed to send a message — and the rumors that followed were inevitable

The United We Dream hotline for immigrants to report ICE activity —which has been up and running for over a year — has never seen anything like last week.

“For the past six months,” Pinto says, “our average of calls” to the enforcement hotline “is 30 to 50 calls a month.” In the first 11 days of February, “we have had more than 214 calls,” Pinto told Vox — and “most” of those came during a 9-day period from February 3rd to February 11.

But February 2017 doesn’t yet hold the record for monthly call volume. That record belongs to January 2016 — when unauthorized immigrants around the country were panicked by reports of household raids directed by the Obama administration.

Those raids were designed to target only Central Americans (mostly families) who’d been ordered deported in the past 2 years and hadn’t left. Most unauthorized immigrants didn’t fit that description, but the traumatic nature of raids — and the knowledge that, if ICE agents did make collateral arrests, there would be no legal recourse — sent the entire community of unauthorized immigrants and their neighbors into a panic spiral for several weeks.

The Trump administration has shown no interest in quelling the fears of otherwise law-abiding unauthorized immigrants. To the contrary, the purpose of Trump’s executive order broadening immigration priorities was to make it easier to deport unauthorized immigrants — to turn Trump’s campaign declaration “Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation” into government policy.

Last week’s raids were, indeed, designed to reinforce that message. They wouldn’t have been so big, or so coordinated, if they weren’t. One ICE spokesperson told reporters that “the fact that they coincided is not entirely a coincidence;” a different official told the New York Times that the coordinated action was in the works for several weeks, and “New York was late to the game.”

Under Obama, ICE conducted one “surge” larger than the one conducted by Trump last week — it arrested 2,000 people over only a few days. But most enforcement “surges” were more likely to net 200 people over the course of a month. And the combination of nationwide, coordinated raids and collateral arrests is something immigrants didn’t see in the Obama era.

High-profile raids are designed to affect not only the people who are physically being arrested, but anyone else who could be in a similar position. They’re supposed to serve as a deterrent to anyone who might be considering coming to the US without papers, and to increase the pressure on anyone who is currently here and could be persuaded to leave.

But raids are an extremely blunt instrument for this purpose. Inevitably, they inspire fear in many, many more people than those who are likely to be targets. And where there is fear, rumors about raids can easily spread, putting vulnerable people on high alert.

This is especially true if people already used to living in fear of deportation. For immigrant communities, what they are experiencing today is simply a return to what they felt under George W. Bush in 2005, or when Obama was setting deportation records in 2010 while claiming he wasn’t deporting law-abiding unauthorized immigrants.

Now, as then, there’s nothing concrete that local leaders and advocates can offer immigrants to ensure they won’t be deported. Indeed, they have little ability to dismiss the worst rumors — because under Trump, no one knows what is possible.

While ICE agents did not, in fact, arrest people going to or from church in Kansas City, they could have. There’s a 2011 memo that tells ICE agents not to conduct enforcement activities at “sensitive locations” like churches and schools, but it’s not clear whether ICE is following that memo under Trump. In most cases, ICE agents weren’t sweeping through whole neighborhoods or stopping drivers at random — but there wasn’t anything stopping them from doing so, and no indication they won’t start in future.

CORRECTION: This article originally referred to the nonexistent city of Gardenville, KS instead of the real city of Garden City, KS. The author apologizes for her carelessness.House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz had some harsh words for the protesters that packed the Republican’s Utah town hall Thursday.

Discussing the raucous gathering with constituents where he faced a chorus of boos and steady grilling, Chaffetz told the Deseret News that the protest crowd included people brought in from outside his district specifically to be disruptive.

“Absolutely. I know there were,” Chaffetz told the Salt Lake City-based paper. He added that the meeting, held at a high school auditorium, was “more of a paid attempt to bully and intimidate” rather than a true showcase of how voters in his Utah district felt.

The newspaper didn’t say how he supported his assertions.

On Thursday, demonstrators packed the town hall and shouted “Do your job! Do your job!” at Chaffetz. Others chanted “Vote him out” and carried signs reading “America is better than this.”

The congressman, who was confronted by questions on everything from environmental concerns to whether he would investigate President Trump’s tax returns, said he believed it was “important that people have an opportunity to voice their concerns.”

But, he told the Deseret News, “I think they should be somewhat embarrassed by how a lot of people handled themselves.”

“We’re better than that,” he continued. “That’s not what the average Utahn is like.”

Though he said he understood their frustrations, Chaffetz added: “It was hard to hear through all the shouting and yelling.”

The protest encountered by the Utah Republican, who represents the state’s 3rd District, was just one of several town halls across the country swarmed by angry constituents over issues with the new Trump administration and Congress, including GOP-backed policy proposals like repealing the Affordable Care Act. They include gatherings in California’s 4th District, in Colorado’s 6th District and in Grand Rapids, Michigan -- all Republican-held seats.

Chaffetz, who led investigations by the House on Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign season, pushed back against some of the protesters’ requests to keep Mr. Trump in check.

“People are asking me to use the power of Congress to do a full-on fishing expedition to investigate him personally on things that are not required by law,” Chaffetz said. “I think my doing that would be an abuse of power.”Photo illustration by Slate.

(Far from failing to enforce the law, the Obama administration deported more than 400,000 unauthorized immigrants a year, and Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival endorsed neither total amnesty nor open borders.) Rather, the statement is evidence of how openly these law enforcement officers have been chafing at the bit to do their jobs as they please.

And chafing for a long time: back in 2012, Mr. Crane was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Obama administration’s deferral of deportation for immigrants brought to the United States as children. The claim was that the program put agents in a position of either failing to enforce immigration law as written or suffering reprisals at work for not adhering to the new policy. The plaintiffs were represented by Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state. An anti-immigration activist who joined the Trump transition team as an adviser on immigration, Mr. Kobach is an originator of the false “massive voter fraud” rationale for voter ID requirements and has exported anti-immigrant legislation to states around the country, most notably Arizona.

A federal district judge in Dallas dismissed Mr. Crane’s lawsuit against the deferral program. Mr. Crane also showed his disdain for President Obama by refusing to allow members to participate in a course aimed at training immigration agents in carrying out the Obama administration’s policy that gave priority to deporting high-risk offenders rather than immigrants with clean records and deep roots in the country. Last month, after President Trump issued his immigration orders, Mr. Crane’s union and the union representing Border Patrol officers issued a joint statement declaring that, in case anyone asked, “morale among our agents and officers has increased exponentially” as a result of the president’s promised actions.

Why does any of this matter — aside from the irony of these public employee unions having achieved pride of place in the conservative firmament, while Republican governors and legislatures are moving quickly to disable public employee unions they find troublesome?

It matters because along with entrusting our immigration enforcers to keep us safe, in the president’s often-tweeted phrase, we also entrust them with the responsibility of treating unauthorized immigrants not as prey but as human beings entitled to dignity, even if only minimally to due process.

Not everyone shares that view. I get that, and I’m reminded of it every time I write about immigration. Reader comments on articles about immigration, including the gripping one last week about Guadalupe García de Rayos, the Phoenix woman and mother of two American children who was abruptly deported when she dutifully showed up for her routine check-in at the local ICE office, run to “if she wasn’t illegal in the first place, she wouldn’t have been deported.”

Right. I’d like to think we’re better than that. A month ago, we were.

In what may be an early warning of what’s to come, last Friday immigration agents in Seattle took a 23-year-old Mexican into custody despite his paperwork proving that he had been granted work authorization under the deferred-deportation program, which for now remains in effect.

“It doesn’t matter, because you weren’t born in this country,” one of the immigration enforcement agents told the man, Daniel Ramírez Medina, according to a petition for habeas corpus filed on his behalf in Federal District Court in Seattle. Mr. Ramírez was brought to this country at age 7 and twice qualified for the deferral program, most recently with a renewal last May. On Tuesday, a federal magistrate judge gave the federal government until Thursday to explain the basis for the detention.

This column is usually about the Supreme Court, and this one is, too. Next Tuesday, the justices’ first day back from a monthlong recess, the court will hear an important case on whether a Border Patrol officer can be required to pay damages to the family of a Mexican boy he killed with a bullet fired across the dry bed of the Rio Grande, the international border that separated the two by only yards. The facts of the case, Hernández v. Mesa, sound highly unusual, but they aren’t; there have been 10 cross-border shootings in recent years in addition to several dozen others along the border.

This case raises important questions about the extraterritorial reach both of the Constitution and the damages remedy that is available to United States citizens whose constitutional rights are violated on American soil by a federal official. Sergio Hernández, the unarmed 15-year-old killed seven years ago by the Border Patrol agent, Jesus Mesa Jr., was not an American citizen, and the bullet reached him in Mexico. He and his friends had been playing in a dry culvert, daring each other to run up the opposite bank and touch the barbed-wire fence on the American side. The F.B.I. report initially claimed that the boys were throwing rocks at the agent, but cellphone videos showed Sergio hiding under a railroad trestle in the last minutes of his life. He was shot when he stuck his head out from his hiding place.

The Justice Department investigated but declined to prosecute Mr. Mesa. Mexico charged the agent with murder, but the United States refused to extradite him. Sergio’s parents sued for damages, but lost when the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that even if Sergio had constitutional rights that were violated by the shooting, the existence of any right was sufficiently unclear as to entitle Mr. Mesa to “qualified immunity,” a legal shield extended to official defendants when the relevant law is deemed uncertain. Because the case has never gone to trial, the eventual Supreme Court decision won’t resolve the conflicting accounts or establish the motive for the agent’s fatal shot. But presumably the law will be clear, one way or another, the next time such an incident occurs.

On the chaotic night last month when Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, for refusing to defend his immigration order, he made another personnel change that got less attention. Without explanation, he replaced the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Daniel Ragsdale, with Thomas Homan, a career employee who had been serving in the agency’s top enforcement position. Last April, when Mr. Homan received the government’s highest Civil Service award, a profile in The Washington Post began: “Thomas Homan deports people. And he’s really good at it.”

In the Post profile, Mr. Homan declined to answer questions about policy, or whether he might be supporting Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy. “Sorry, I can’t say what I think,” he told the reporter.

The Roman poet Juvenal asked: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guardians? We need to ask that question now, urgently. I fear the answer.GOP 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump is staking his campaign on promises to bring jobs back to America, but a new analysis of U.S. Labor records shows that Trump’s business have imported more than 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas since 2000.

One of Mr. Trumps companies, the elite Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, applied to import 70 foreign workers to serve as cooks, wait staff and cleaners this month alone, Reuters reported Friday.

Nine companies that are majority-owned by Mr. Trump have sought to bring in foreign waitresses, cooks, vineyard workers and other laborers on temporary work-visa programs.

His companies also filed applications for an assistant golf-course superintendent, assistant hotel manager and a banquet manager, Reuters reported.

Two of his companies, Trump Model Management and Trump Management Group LLC, have sought visas for nearly 250 foreign fashion models, the records show.

The analysis of Mr. Trump’s foreign hires comes as he has positioned himself as a champion of American workers among the 2016 GOP field.

“I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” he said during his campaign launch speech on June 16. “I will bring back our jobs from China, Mexico and other places. I will bring back jobs and our money.”

During that same speech Mr. Trump made controversial remarks on immigration, saying Mexico isn’t sending its best people to the U.S.

“They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” he said.

Reuters‘ analysis examined records of applicants from three controversial categories of temporary work visas — the H-2A, H-2B and the H-1B programs.

The H-2B program brings in mostly Mexican workers. Mexicans made up more than 80 percent of the 104,993 admissions to the United States on H-2B visas in 2013. The Trump companies have sought at least 850 H-2B visa workers.

The program receives little oversight and federal watchdogs have criticized both the H-2B and H-2A programs for failing to protect foreign and American workers.

A recent report from the Government Accountability Office revealed that workers in the country on H-2A and H-2B visas have experienced abuse, including being charged illegal recruiting fees, substandard housing and low pay.

DisqusCaltrain has a problem.

Passenger numbers are exploding thanks to the Bay Area’s tech boom, and service has not kept up with demand. Peak trains are full, and it is difficult to find the capacity to run more. Service frequency is the same as it was in the late 2000s, but daily ridership has grown from 36,000 in 2009 to 62,000 in 2016.

Riding outside rush hour is no better: off-peak trains don’t come frequently enough, and take more than an hour and a half to go between San Francisco and San Jose.

All of Caltrain’s problems have solutions. These involve smart investments in better service and one of the keys is the Caltrain electrification project. For $2 billion, it would wire the line between San Francisco and San Jose and buy new high-performance electric trains, reducing local travel time by twenty minutes.

And yet, the Republican Party is threatening to cancel the project.

Caltrain is seeking $647 million in federal funds, but the state’s entire Republican Congressional delegation sent Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao a letter demanding that she freeze funding until California did a new audit of high-speed rail.

In effect, the Republican delegation wants the Trump administration to hold Caltrain hostage in order to force the state to cancel high-speed rail. Residents of the Bay Area and supporters of good government should be prepared to fight this move.

The Republicans do not have anything against Caltrain electrification. It is not as flashy as California High-Speed Rail, and up until now did not attract much attention from opponents of rail expansion. But it is a necessary step for bringing high-speed rail all the way to San Francisco since high-speed trains must be electric.

As a result, it is threatened with the chopping block. To the state’s Republican delegation, grandstanding about California High-Speed Rail is more important than solving the regional transportation woes of the Bay Area.

It is not just high-speed rail that requires Caltrain electrification. Two other regionally beneficial investments rely on the project as well.

The first is the Downtown Extension, which would bring trains from their current terminus at 4th and King to Transbay Terminal. Not many people work in Mission Bay near 4th and King; in contrast, based on analysis done by rail activist Clem Tillier, there are more than 100,000 middle- and high-income jobs within a half-mile radius of Transbay Terminal, more than within the same radius of every Caltrain station from 4th and King down to Gilroy, combined. The Downtown Extension tunnel would not be able to accommodate diesel trains because of the fumes.

Second, capacity upgrades require adding tracks. The Caltrain corridor has just two tracks, one in each direction. This means mixing express and local trains require carefully timing the schedules so that the fast trains don’t get stuck behind the slow ones. Electric trains accelerate much faster than diesel trains, which reduces the speed difference between trains that make all stops and trains that only stop at Baby Bullet stations.

Even then, some infrastructure for timed overtakes is required for additional capacity. High-speed rail includes money for such overtakes, which is useful for Caltrain as well. Electrification reduces the required scope of investment into overtakes.

In addition to capital investment, electrification is necessary for solving Caltrain’s problem of poor frequency. To run the Baby Bullet express trains, Caltrain had to cut service to the local stations. Several stations have only hourly service even at rush hour, even stations that are close to many suburban homes and jobs and had high ridership until the Baby Bullet came], such as California Avenue.

Because electrification reduces the speed difference between local and express trains, it would permit Caltrain to run frequent rush hour service to these stations, in both directions, for both traditional and reverse commuters.

All of these benefits together add up. Caltrain expects 100,000 passengers per weekday by 2040. If local trains go between San Francisco Transbay Terminal and San Jose in an hour and twenty minutes, and Baby Bullets in fifty, then this ridership level is not hard to reach. Ridership is already growing, and is limited by capacity and by poor service, both of which become easy to solve if Caltrain is electrified.

There is room for making Caltrain’s modernization project better. Its cost per mile is very high, for technical reasons some of which can be fixed. For example, the masts holding up the catenary wires are spaced more closely than is standard, and this raises the cost of installation. However, the high benefits of the project ensure that even at the current cost, it is worth it. Per rider, the cost is only about $20,000, one of the lowest costs of any rail project in the US today; the cheapest on President Trump’s wishlist is about $50,000.

The state’s Republican delegation is unlikely to be able to stop high-speed rail. Nor is it interested in reforming high-speed rail to be cheaper. The delegation’s request for an audit rings similar to rail cancellations in Ohio, Florida, and Wisconsin after the 2010 election brought Tea Party-supported Republican governors to this state—cancellations that led the federal government to divert more high-speed rail stimulus money to California. Even with its $3.3 billion in federal funds, California High-Speed Rail is increasingly relying on state money, from the cap-and-trade fund in addition to the Prop 1A ballot money.

Instead, the Republican delegation is going after a rail extension that is much smaller in scope than high-speed rail and has less room for future cost overruns or ridership shortfalls. Its attempt to force the state’s hand to shrink the role of government is leading to bad government. Instead of fighting off government waste, it is fighting off worthwhile public investments in order to make a political point.

To call your elected representatives in Congress, you may use the following script:

Hi, I am [say your name] from [say where you live]. I’m calling to urge you to voice your support of the Caltrain electrification project. It is more cost-effective than any mass transit project that the administration would like to fund, but California’s Republican delegation wants to choke federal funds to it, since it is a necessary component of California High-Speed Rail. Caltrain electrification has many benefits to local commuters who are stuck in traffic, regardless of what happens with high-speed rail, but the state Republicans want to hold it hostage until they get high-speed rail canceled. You owe it to your constituents to do what you can to make sure good public investments like Caltrain electrification get the funding that they need and are not held hostage to grandstanding.

Taking the mad ravings of children literally is a gag that never fails, especially if those children happen to be adorable. (Note that rule this doesn’t apply if you’re the head of a studio greenlighting your four-year-old’s movie idea, the way Paramount did with Monster Trucks.) Stephen Colbert is not the head of a studio, so this Late Show with Stephen Colbert clip, in which he has a group of kids pitch him a movie idea and then shoots a trailer for it, can be watched with no fears about CBS’s share price.

The kids are ultra-cute and their movie ideas are, as you’d expect, adorable nonsense, though Colbert does his best to shape the rambling into a narrative. There’s not too much he can do when he has to include German spies, high school dances, and robot monster pigs, though. Actually, Colbert has a notably good rapport with the kids; if he ever loses Late Night, he’s got a bright future in elementary schools.

Last week saw the publication of Slate columnist Rebecca Schuman’s Schadenfreude, A Love Story, a funny and winning account of the writer’s not-entirely-requited crush on German culture. Schuman’s bildungsroman channels the weltschmerz of a former wunderkind rejected by the professoriat and exiled to the creative lumpenproletariat. We spoke by email about Kafka, pretentiousness, and the Germans’ surprising inability to form an orderly line.

Your book is in a way the story of a persistent crush on German culture. You spend the book banging on doors trying to get in—to win over a Kafka-obsessed boy, to communicate with German-speakers, to find a spot in a university German department. Why did you keep banging? What was the romance of German culture for you?

That is the question I have had the hardest time answering. In a way, I wrote the book to answer that question. For years people at parties have asked me “Why German?” Especially when I was in a Ph.D. program, people would ask me why, and I’d just freeze up. I’d start to cry sometimes! I’d do anything I could to change the subject: “Did you know that Austrians market a special kind of tampon meant JUST for use during sexual intercourse?” If all else failed, I’d leave the room.

Since I can’t leave the room now, I’ll say that part of it was that German-language authors (mostly Austrians and Swiss!)—Kafka, Robert Walser—spoke to my own fears and insecurities in a primal way. But was it, in the end, a good idea to indulge and enable those insecurities? I often wonder, in Kafka-parable fashion, if my obsession with him made me prone to waiting outside doors meant not to let me in—or if I was drawn to him in the first place because I was already that way.

Kafka is the muse of the book. Does his work encapsulate the German character—even though, as you are reminded again and again in the book, he wasn’t German at all? Do Germans find it annoying that the German-language writer who’s most widely read in English wasn’t even German?

They find it SO annoying, and I actually think that particular arc—someone saying, “Oh, you’re German—I love Kafka!” and then the German getting an opportunity to be pedantic (Ektually, zet’s not right is the national phrase of Germany, and I say that with love)—is the single most German thing in the world.

His work, though, definitely encapsulates the Austrian character (Prague, where he lived, was nominally Austrian for a lot of his life) with its endless bureaucratic entanglements. When I lived in Vienna for a year—a chapter, by the way, that got cut from the book—I had such a hard time getting registered for the university. I had to wait in line for 5 hours, and then when I finally got to the front, the worker was just like, Oh, I forgot to move you from one column to the other one, like it was the most normal thing in the world to require someone to come in for five hours to ask for a minor clerical task they didn’t know needed to be done. I got back to my desk at the research institute where I was doing my Fulbright and I said to my Austrian colleague: “I just realized that Kafka wrote nonfiction.”

You write about beginning a Ph.D. program without any particular intent to become a German professor, even though that’s the one thing a Ph.D. in German qualifies you for. You never became a German professor. What did you hope you’d get from the program? Did you get it?

Well, as soon as I got to the program and started it, like less than a month into it, I realized I did want to become a German professor. My mind was completely blown by all the difficult reading I was doing, and by the fact that I could actually work through that reading and come up with interesting insights. After all those years, I found something I was actually really good at: reading the difficult texts, and also exposing students to them. I still sort of wish I was a German professor—though only esoterically! I want nothing to do with American academia, which our readers will be surprised to learn, I believe is a toxic morass of corporatization and poor social skills.

Do you have German friends who’ve read the book? What do they think of your portrait of their culture?

Just one so far, and he thinks it’s spot-on—but he’s very Americanized and has a great sense of humor about his mother culture. One of the most endearing things about Germans is that they neither understand nor enjoy exaggeration as humor. Given that hyperbole is my primary form of communication, I imagine many Germans will disagree with their culture’s portrayal. However, the second-most-endearing thing about Germans is that a sign of true friendship with a German is that you stay up all night screaming at each other in disagreement but still remain best friends. Germans don’t really believe in small talk and they don’t think that “certain subjects” are to be avoided in polite company, and they are pedantic as hell, but they don’t get offended easily. It’s one of the best things about them.

Is there a humor mechanism that replaces comic exaggeration, for the Germans? Or are they as humorless as some stereotypes suggest? (I grew up in England where the trope about Germans is that they always barge to the front of queues. I think this mostly speaks to the profound respect the English have for the queuing process.)

Oh, the queue thing is true. When I lived in Berlin I went to a Blur show in the dead of winter and had to check my coat. (It was a great show, by the way; Damon Albarn did an A-level in German and addressed the audience in German!) Afterward, I spent no less than 45 minutes in an obscene grinding mosh pit of German bodies, when a proper queue would have taken 5 tops. For a culture that prizes order so much that the idiom for “everything OK?” is Alles in Ordnung? the queuing habits are inexplicable.

As far as the humor thing—well, the stereotypes are true and they aren’t. The two most popular types of humor in German are slapstick and just bone-dry sarcasm. A great German “joke” is to say the meanest and most tragic thing possible and then follow it with a slight grimace. (Somehow it works.) Kafka, for example, was absolutely, rip-roaringly hilarious, obviously in a very dark way. Most people don’t know this about him, and early translations of his work (most of which are canonical) don’t play this up at all.

Foiled again: Vice Adm. Robert Harward added insult to injury when he rejected President Trump’s national security adviser job offer, writes Fred Kaplan.

Power of discretion: President Trump’s vow to defund sanctuary cities has left progressive activists and undocumented immigrants profoundly anxious. But these designated areas have long been “offering a false sense of security,” according to Daniel Denvir. The only way to make cities safer for immigrants, Denvir argues, is to arrest and prosecute fewer people.

Fans of American Horror Story fans love a good twist, and before Season 6 of the show even arrives, they’ve got one. On Sunday, FX dropped yet another teaser for the new season of Ryan Murphy’s horror series—that makes it the 11th promo the studio has released over the past few weeks. The twist? Most of these teasers aren’t even real; they’re misdirects meant to keep fans guessing what the new season’s theme will be.

After the first six teasers debuted July, FX CEO John Landgraf revealed that most aren’t even relevant to the upcoming season. “There are many more trailers than you've actually seen for hypothetical seasons of American Horror Story—different genres, different places,” Landgraf reportedly told critics during the Television Critics Association summer press tour. “One of them is accurate; the others are all misdirects.”

So which one is the real teaser? We still don’t know, and since Landgraf’s bombshell, FX has continued to release even more promos (though which, if any, are relevant to the upcoming season is anybody’s guess). Each spot seems to point to a totally different possible theme—past seasons of the show have been subtitled Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, and Hotel.

The newest clue in this mystery is “Blind Date,” which emulates the camp of horror B-movies as a young woman is dragged into a lake by a scaly hand, only to emerge with the two contentedly entwined. The teaser feels way more Scream Queens than American Horror Story, but Bustle lays out a compelling case for a possible Hollywood theme, as past seasons have been linked to Los Angeles and to the film industry in particular.Attorneys for two same-sex couples want the U.S. Supreme Court to review an Arkansas ruling preventing married gay couples from getting the names of both spouses on their children's birth certificates without a court order.

Attorneys for the couples and for the National Center for Lesbian Rights argue that a ruling late last year from the Arkansas Supreme Court undermines the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide. They say it could invite similar moves across the country against gay married couples.

"Allowing the decision below to stand would open the door for other courts to pursue a similarly blatant path of denying same-sex couples important marital rights and protections on equally specious grounds," the attorneys said in a court filing Monday.

The Arkansas Supreme Court in December sided with state officials who say Arkansas has a vested interest in listing parents on birth certificates. The state's highest court overturned a lower judge's ruling that struck down part of the state's birth certificate law that defines parents by gender.

Republican Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge's office said Wednesday that she is reviewing the attorneys' request to the U.S. Supreme Court and would respond in court.

"She remains confident in the State Supreme Court's decision, which upheld the rule of law when it found that the lower court far exceeded its authority by unilaterally re-writing major sections of Arkansas code," spokesman Judd Deere said in an email.

The three couples who had sued the state were allowed to amend their children's birth certificates in 2015 under a ruling issued by Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox. Two of the three couples asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision.

Two of the couples were married out of state before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and a third was married in Arkansas days after the decision. The couples' children were conceived through anonymous sperm donors.

Monday's petition was filed by Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, who argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2015 case that led to the decision legalizing gay marriage. The filing said Arkansas' case would likely affect birth certificate laws in other states that haven't been updated since gay marriage was legalized and still use gendered terms.

"The issue is of critical importance to families across the country," the filing said. "Arkansas' discriminatory birth certificate law is far from an outlier."

Mark Zuckerberg woke up on Christmas morning and posted his status on Facebook. The Facebook CEO was “celebrating Christmas,” he reported, adding a message so anodyne it would make a Hallmark card look edgy in comparison. Yet there was a revelation coming.

“But aren’t you atheist?” a Facebook user asked in a comment on Zuckerberg’s post. Here was the tech mogul’s reply:

He went on to spend the next half-hour replying to various other comments, apparently from random strangers who were spending part of their holiday in much the same fashion. To one who wished him and his family Happy Hanukkah, he responded with a gif of a menorah.

Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter.

More recently, though, Zuckerberg’s ambitions appear to have taken a political turn that his idol's never did. This past summer, he responded to claims of liberal bias in Facebook’s trending news section by convening a summit with conservative leaders from across the country. Pressed in November on Facebook’s role in spreading “fake news” about the U.S. election, he pivoted to lecturing his liberal critics on the importance of political empathy. This week, Zuckerberg announced on Facebook his latest annual self-improvement project: a 30-state listening tour of the United States. From his post:

Going into this challenge, it seems we are at a turning point in history. For decades, technology and globalization have made us more productive and connected. This has created many benefits, but for a lot of people it has also made life more challenging. This has contributed to a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime. We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone.

The rumor that Zuckerberg might harbor political ambitions is not a new one. But word of a barnstorming tour, on the heels of his apparent religious conversion (to what religion, one cannot say), has turned the whispers into shouts. “Is Mark Zuckerberg Eyeing the White House?”, Newsweek wondered. “President Mark Zuckerberg? It May Not Be as Crazy as It Sounds,” the Telegraph mused. Others jumped straight to debating his fitness for the job. “The country does not need President Mark Zuckerberg,” the New Republic’s Sarah Jones contended.

It’s fair to say that Zuckerberg is acting like a politician, at least in certain familiar ways. And it’s conceivable that he really would like to run for office someday. If there are two things American voters loathe, it’s atheists and out-of-touch coastal elites. A few weeks ago, as far as we knew, he was both; soon he might be able to claim he is neither.

We needn't assume Zuckerberg is running for office to make sense of his actions.

But one needn’t assume Zuckerberg actually wants to go into government in order to make sense of his actions. His job as CEO and dictator-for-life of Facebook already entails as much power and responsibility as that of almost any political leader. Over the years he has come to realize that it entails a lot of politicking, as well.

Facebook’s business, now valued at some $350 billion, is built on its near-universal appeal. Yet as it grows ever more influential as a source of news and a platform for political movements, it risks alienating various interest groups if it’s perceived as biased. The biggest threat to its business has always been that another social network would come along and siphon people away, just as it once did to MySpace.

Its success, then, depends on heading off such threats before they become viable. It can do that by buying them, as with Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR. But it can also do that by being careful not to encourage them in the first place, as it appeared to have done with Ello—a network that arose largely as a protest to Facebook’s perceived discrimination against LGBT users. Facebook moved quickly to head off Ello by introducing exceptions to its real-name policy. Zuckerberg’s recent political maneuvering could be viewed as a preemptive strike against any effort to start a “conservative Facebook”—a Fox News or Breitbart to its CNN.NBC

Tuesday morning, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway went on TV to explain why National Security Adviser Mike Flynn had resigned overnight. Flynn’s undoing came in a sequence of four events. First, in a Dec. 29 phone call, Flynn secretly hinted to Russia’s ambassador that sanctions imposed by President Obama—to punish Russia for intervening in the presidential election—might be relaxed once Donald Trump took office. Later, Flynn told Vice President Mike Pence and others in the administration that in that phone call, he hadn’t discussed sanctions with the ambassador. Then, on Jan. 26, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates presented evidence of Flynn’s deception—based on U.S. intelligence transcripts of Flynn’s calls—to Trump’s White House counsel, Don McGahn. Finally, on Thursday, a day after firmly denying he had discussed sanctions with the ambassador, Flynn conceded that he “couldn’t be certain.”

That sequence raises questions about who knew what in the White House, when they knew it, and why Flynn stayed in his job for three weeks after Yates went to McGahn—only to be brought down once the Washington Post, on Monday night, revealed the Yates warning.

So how did Conway answer those questions? She minimized and excused the scandal. In doing so, she clarified the Trump administration’s four fundamental psychopathologies.

1. Loyalty within Trump’s circle is more important than loyalty to country. Conway emphasized that Trump had continued to support Flynn because “the president is very loyal.” This puzzled NBC’s Matt Lauer. He pointed out that Flynn had misled Pence and that Pence, in turn, had misled the country. Lauer reminded Conway that despite this, “You said late yesterday afternoon that the president had full confidence in Gen. Flynn. How could that be true?” Conway brushed aside this appeal to Trump’s duty to the public, focusing instead on Trump’s duty to Flynn. “The president’s very loyal,” she repeated.

2. The only information that matters is what comes from Trump’s circle. Lauer brought up the account of Flynn’s call, which was delivered to McGahn by the Justice Department based on a recording by the intelligence community. Conway indicated that she didn’t buy it: “That’s one characterization.” When George Stephanopoulos cited the same account on Good Morning America, Conway dismissed it as “printed reports.” Evidence presented by the intelligence community and the Justice Department wasn’t enough to make Trump fire Flynn. Nor did the administration accept media reports about that evidence. According to Conway, what forced Flynn to leave was his public admission “over the weekend” that his assurances had been unreliable. The administration accepts only one arbiter of truth and falsehood: itself.

3. The only standard of right and wrong is what Trump thinks. Conway batted away complaints about Flynn’s deception, noting that he had continued to enjoy Trump’s support. She told Lauer: “The fact is that Gen. Flynn continued in that position and was in the presidential daily briefings, was part of the leader calls as recently as yesterday, was there for the prime minister’s visit from Canada yesterday.” Conway seemed to be asking viewers to believe that Trump’s decision to stick with Flynn reflected well on Flynn rather than badly on Trump. To Lauer, that was nuts: Flynn had been exposed as objectively unfit. But to Conway, there’s no such thing as objective unfitness. The only index of fitness is what her boss thinks. “Was Gen. Flynn the right pick?” Lauer asked. Conway gave the only answer she could comprehend: “The president chose him, and he was very loyal.”

4. Trump’s secrets are as sacred as the country’s secrets. Conway refused to tell Stephanopoulos what anyone in Trump’s circle had known about Flynn’s calls: “I can’t reveal what the White House knew or didn’t know, and who in White House knew or didn’t know.” Stephanopoulos responded with dismay:

Three weeks ago, the Justice Department told the White House that Gen. Flynn was misleading the vice president, was misleading the public, about his contacts with the Russians. You had that information. The White House had that information, chose to keep Gen. Flynn in his job, chose not to correct the record, chose not to tell the public what they knew about Gen. Flynn’s phone calls. How could that be?

Conway stiffed the question. “I’m not here to say who knew what when, because first of all, that would be divulging information that is highly sensitive,” she said. Highly sensitive? That’s a phrase reserved for protecting national security, which in this case was jeopardized by Flynn’s back-channel contacts and his deception about them. But Conway can’t tell the difference. To her, anything that threatens Trump, including exposure of collusion with Russia, must be squelched as a threat to the United States.

By afternoon, the White House had come up with yet another story. Conway’s spin on Monday (that Flynn still had Trump’s confidence) and her spin on Tuesday morning (that Flynn had lost Trump’s confidence but was still a stand-up guy) had been replaced by a third account from Press Secretary Sean Spicer: that Trump had been “reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to Gen. Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth.” The tale of Trump’s heroism in standing by Flynn had evolved into a tale of Trump’s heroism in investigating Flynn. Maybe Conway will tell this story in her next round of interviews. Or maybe, by then, she’ll have come up with another.Kevin Lamarque/Reuters

CNN, according to President Donald Trump, is “fake news.” Any polls that reflect poorly on his executive orders on immigration and refugees are also “fake news,” according to the president. On Monday, his press secretary Sean Spicer dismissed a deeply reported New York Times story on power struggles within Trump’s White House as not just fake news, but “literally the epitome of fake news.”

That’s literally the epitome of a gross mischaracterization. You might even call it a lie. But some revealing recent statements by Trump officials suggest that’s the wrong way to look at it. In treating the Trump administration’s accusations of “fake news” as falsehoods, worthy of rebutting and debunking with evidence, the media may be playing into the administration’s hands.

It should go without saying that a co-bylined, 2,000-word, front-page New York Times story on the first weeks in Trump’s White House, headlined “Trump and Staff Rethink Tactics After Stumbles,” is not fake news, let alone the literal epitome of fake news. (The epitome of fake news would be something more like “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President,” a fictional article published by a self-proclaimed “fantasy news website” that fooled hundreds of thousands of readers during the presidential campaign.) It is possible that the Times’ story contains inaccuracies, although neither Trump nor Spicer have pointed to any in particular. It would be fair to question the credibility of the many anonymous sources the Times relied on to flesh out its reporting. There are plenty of ways to criticize the New York Times, in other words—or CNN, or established polling organizations—that don’t involve calling them fake news, which is itself a patently false claim. So why are Trump and his deputies so stuck on that term?

An exchange between a conservative radio host and a Trump adviser this week—highlighted by CNN on Tuesday—yielded an interesting answer. Trump and his team of course know that CNN, the New York Times, and the rest aren’t actually fabricating news stories. What’s more, they aren’t actually trying to convince anyone otherwise. Rather, they’re hurling the term fake news as an insult to get under the media’s skin—and to distract from the substance of the stories themselves.

Get Slate in your inbox.

The surprisingly candid explanation came from Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Trump, in an interview with radio host Michael Medved. A former Breitbart editor, Gorka is no doubt familiar with the murky territory between fact, fiction, and propaganda on the internet. Pressed by Medved on why the Trump administration feels the need to label negative polls as fiction, rather than simply pointing to their fallibility, here is what Gorka said:

There is a monumental desire on behalf of the majority of the media—not just the pollsters, the majority of the media—to attack a duly elected president in the second week of his term. That’s how unhealthy the situation is. And until the media understands how wrong that attitude is, and how it hurts their credibility, we are going to continue to say “fake news.” I’m sorry, Michael. That’s the reality.

In other words, when Trump calls CNN or the New York Times “fake news,” he knows that what he’s saying isn’t true. It is, by at least some definitions, a lie. But I’ll stop short of calling it the literal epitome of a lie, because more careful definitions of the word require that a falsehood be made with the intent to deceive. I suppose it’s possible that Trump and his deputies hope to hoodwink some portion of the voting population into believing CNN and the New York Times actually make up news stories out of whole cloth. But it’s telling that Gorka and other Trump officials never actually try to make that case.

Every minute that CNN spends defending itself is a minute spent away from the original reporting that caused the administration to throw a hissy fit in the first place.

When Trump calls something “fake news,” he’s not making a claim about reality, or even his own perception of reality; he’s simply trolling the media. Like any good insult, fake news is a slur carefully selected to inflict maximum damage on its target. At a time when CNN and the New York Times are struggling to distinguish themselves from a flood of online competitors on the strength of their reporting and editorial standards, Trump is denying that they differ in any meaningful way from the lowest of tabloids. By jabbing the credibility of their reporting, he’s hitting them where it hurts.

Further insight came from Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway in an appearance Tuesday afternoon on Jake Tapper’s CNN show The Lead. After challenging Conway on Trump’s false claim that the media have failed to cover numerous terrorist attacks, Tapper asked her outright: “Are we fake news, Kellyanne? Is CNN fake news?” Conway’s response: “No, I don’t think CNN is fake news.” She then pivoted to specific examples of media reports that she found to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise unfair to Trump.

.@jaketapper: “Are we fake news?”

Kellyanne Conway: “No, I don’t think CNN is fake news.” https://t.co/JiEA0SPrXj https://t.co/WnHV3ty6LL — CNN (@CNN) February 7, 2017

Conway’s response, and Gorka’s, seem to expose the president and his spokespeople as hypocrites, calling others liars even as they lie themselves. But once we see fake news for a slur rather than a diagnosis, the administration’s constant use of the phrase makes much more sense. It’s akin to Trump’s spluttering response to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage: “You’re the puppet.”

Insults are the last refuge of the rhetorical loser; they’re what’s left when you run out of logic and evidence. And yet they can be highly effective if their target rises to the bait, because they derail the conversation and distract from the topic at hand. Witness how much ink and airtime the media devoted Tuesday to proving that they covered the terrorist attacks the White House said on Monday that they never covered. When Sean Spicer calls CNN “fake news,” he’s changing the subject from Trump’s credibility to the media’s. Every minute that CNN spends defending its newsgathering operation is a minute spent away from the kind of original reporting that caused the administration to throw a hissy fit in the first place. It’s like if someone called you an asshole, and you responded by earnestly lecturing them on anatomy.Maybe, just maybe: If you put together a stellar cast of big-name (and social-media savvy) actors to tell a previously unsung story of the kind many people have long clamored to see and do so in a compelling and easily accessible way while marketing it smartly and vigorously—you’ll discover that white faces and narratives aren’t the only ones that can appeal to a mass audience. And then you’ve got something like Hidden Figures, which is inspiring little girls everywhere, racking up major Oscar nods, and bringing in bank. Over this past weekend, Hidden Figures brought its box-office total to $119.4 million, surpassing La La Land ($118.3 million) as this year’s highest grossing Best Picture nominee. However it does on Oscar night, the effect of the movie’s influence both within the industry and popular culture will (hopefully) linger on long after.The Democrats and the media are once again peddling their potions of fear, suggesting there is Russian influence over President Donald Trump.

The Russian fear-mongering is a narrative that journalists just can’t quit. The catalyst this time was a mistake apparently made by Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser.

Flynn came into the Trump administration on Jan. 20 with a huge target on his back. Flynn wanted to scuttle the Iran nuclear deal.

Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador on Dec. 29, the same day former President Obama installed new sanctions against Russia for alleged hacking into Democratic campaign email accounts.

Legal experts have told LifeZette that there was nothing improper about Flynn speaking to his foreign counterparts during the transition period. An incoming national security adviser should work the phones.

Of course, in the Dec. 29 communications, the sanctions came up, but it is unclear what Flynn said. The real misstep for Flynn was to tell Vice President Mike Pence that sanctions were not discussed. So on Jan. 15, Pence told journalists the issue never came up in the talks between Flynn and the Russian ambassador.

When several people began leaking Flynn’s transcripts to the media — a move described by intelligence committee members and staff on Capitol Hill and by lawyers as illegal — it became clear Flynn had misled Pence. Late Monday night, Flynn resigned.

Normally, when a troubled official resigns, that ends most of the story. But not this time. Liberals, Democrats, the media and Trump-bashers had Russian red-scare fever long before the election.

Rather Hysterical

Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post compared the last few days to a dumpster fire. “Donald Trump’s White House is on the verge of a raging fire over Russia allegations,” Cillizza tweeted alongside an image of a raging garbage inferno.

And being completely serious, retired CBS News anchorman Dan Rather posted a long-winded diatribe on Facebook, suggesting the whole Russian issue (now revived against Trump for the fourth or fifth time) could be bigger than Watergate.

"Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now," Rather wrote on Tuesday. "It was the closest we came to a debilitating constitutional crisis, until maybe now. On a 10 scale of Armageddon for our form of government, I would put Watergate at a 9. This Russia scandal is currently somewhere around a 5 or 6, in my opinion, but it is cascading in intensity seemingly by the hour. And we may look back and see, in the end, that it is at least as big as Watergate. It may become the measure by which all future scandals are judged. It has all the necessary ingredients, and that is chilling."

But then Rather indicates what the attacks and criticisms of Flynn and Trump are likely about.

"We can all remember the Gen. Michael Flynn's speech from the Republican National Convention — 'Lock her up!' in regards to Hillary Clinton," Rather wrote. "If Hillary Clinton had done one-tenth of what Mr. Flynn had done, she likely would be in jail. And it isn't just Mr. Flynn, how far does this go?"

It's an amazing claim. No one has claimed there is definitely an underlying illegality to the Flynn issue.

Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, said on Tuesday that in the first step of the White House investigation into Flynn's Dec. 29 call, the White House found no legal issue at all.

But Clinton's use of a private email server — through which classified material flowed — was definitely illegal. Had a lesser federal employee used such a server at the State Department, that person would be in prison. Clinton escaped legal woes thanks to a pliant Democratic attorney general, with whom her husband met with while on a Phoenix airport tarmac days before the Justice Department ended the investigation.

Of course, Rather, in his partisan screed, has less credibility than he had in the 1970s and 1980s. He famously ran an investigation into former President George W. Bush in 2004, right before the presidential election, which suggested Bush had gone AWOL while in the Texas Air Guard.

The resulting fallout from that bogus claim and the associated fake documents led to Rather leaving CBS in 2005.

Also emboldened is The New York Times, which published an unsourced story on Wednesday alleging that Trump's advisers, during the 2016 campaign, had contacts with Russian intelligence officers. The Times explained that even their anonymous sources suggested no wrongdoing, as Russian spies often double as businessmen.

The Real Target

Flynn came into the Trump administration on Jan. 20 with a huge target on his back.

Flynn wanted to scuttle the Iran nuclear deal, and make it as public as possible. Remnants of the Obama administration may have been behind the illegal leaks, according to the Washington Free Beacon, in attempt to destroy Flynn and send a message to Trump.

The message is likely: Don't touch the Iran deal.

And while the media is busy spreading stories that the White House is in "chaos" and disarray, Trump himself seems ready to fight. Indeed, as in the past, he seems to savor the fights — to a degree.

"This Russian connection nonsense is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign," Trump tweeted Wednesday.

And not surprisingly, Trump took a Wednesday morning dig at the carpers: "The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. MSNBC & CNN are unwatchable. Fox and Friends is great!"Crossroads Media has done work for Karl Rove super PAC American Crossroads. Rove was vocally opposed to Trump’s candidacy early in the 2016 Republican primary race, a fact that has upset some in Trump’s circle. "Dubke and his Crossroads friends did everything they could to kill the Trump movement and failed," an anonymous Trump “loyalist” told CNN. The generally pro-Trump Breitbart has already derided Dubke as a “Rove acolyte.”Photo: Courtesy of Hardee's

On Thursday, Donald Trump announced that his pick for Labor secretary is Andy Puzder, a fast-food executive who heads the company that owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. The choice is a slap in the face of working-class voters who were Trump’s primary base of support, but it’s also a fun opportunity to revisit Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s ads of the past.

There’s the one starring Top Chef’s Padma Lakshmi, in which she eats a hamburger in a low-cut dress on some stairs. And there’s the 2009 ad starring Kim Kardashian that featured salad dressing dripping down her chin and — for some reason — a bubble bath. And of course, there’s the 2012 ad starring Kate Upton in which she strips down while scarfing a burger in the back of a vintage car. More recently, Hardee’s ran this ad for its “bacon three-way” burger:

You can guess where we went with this. The #Bacon3Way, with @tweetEmilySears @GenevieveMorton and Elena Belle.https://t.co/hh58xFDgSV — Hardee's (@Hardees) July 26, 2016

Entrepreneur asked Puzder about the ads in a feature that ran last year with the headline “The CEO of Carl’s Jr. Doesn’t Care If You’re Offended by the Chain’s Sexy Ads.” And he answers, more or less, that he doesn’t care if viewers are offended by the chain’s ads.

“I like our ads,” he said. “I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American. I used to hear, brands take on the personality of the CEO. And I rarely thought that was true, but I think this one, in this case, it kind of did take on my personality.”

A market research firm found that viewers were particularly turned off by Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. ads; more than half found the ads to be annoying and offensive. But Puzder said he’d be concerned if viewers didn’t complain: “If you don’t complain, I go to the head of marketing and say, ‘What’s wrong with our ads?’” he told the magazine.

As Labor secretary, Puzder will be in charge of enforcing anti-discrimination laws among any company that interacts with the federal government. As ThinkProgress points out, he’ll also oversee the Women’s Bureau — a federal agency that enforces paid maternity leave, protects mothers as they navigate the workforce, and works to eliminate the wage gap. But when it comes to women’s equality, Puzder’s nomination makes about as much sense as Ben Carson’s.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

In the catalog of horror and national humiliation that constitutes the first 20 days of Donald Trump’s presidency, Kellyanne Conway’s squalid shilling for Ivanka Trump merchandise is a fairly small thing. It pales beside the stories of families torn apart by Trump’s executive order on immigration; the botched raid in Yemen; Trump’s refusal to extricate himself from his labyrinthine conflicts of interests; his ostensibly “lighthearted” threat to invade Mexico; his idiotic feud with the prime minister of Australia; his elevation of conspiracy-obsessed white-nationalist cranks to the highest levels of government power; and the numbing fusillade of lies about matters both grave and petty that issue from his administration every day. Nevertheless, it is rare—even, so far, under Trump—for a high official to unambiguously violate the law on national television. Conway’s transgression may not be terribly serious, but the urgency of holding her to account is.

Michelle Goldberg Michelle Goldberg is a columnist for Slate and the author, most recently, of The Goddess Pose.

Let’s recap. This is day two of the Trump administration’s dispute with Nordstrom, the department-store chain that has stopped carrying Ivanka Trump’s clothing line because of poor sales. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted an attack on Nordstrom from his personal Twitter account, then retweeted it from his @POTUS account. His hapless press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended Trump’s conduct, saying that Nordstrom’s refusal to sell the president’s daughter’s fashion line was “a direct attack on his policies and her name.” Thursday morning, Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox and Friends and urged viewers: “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff … I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody; you can find it online.”

All of this was a shameful farce, but only Conway’s comments appear to be illegal. Federal ethics law for administrative employees says this:

An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations.

There is simply no question that Conway was endorsing Ivanka Trump’s product.

Usually, demonstrating official misconduct is more complicated than this. There are paper trails to examine and explain, or narrative ambiguities that allow sufficiently motivated partisans to at least argue that nothing untoward happened. Conway’s statement was so clearly and frankly egregious that it even earned a rebuke from Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash and a close associate of Trump aide Steve Bannon. “To encourage Americans to buy goods from companies owned by the first family is totally out of bounds and needs to stop,” he told the Washington Post. Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, tells me: “This reminds me a little bit of Donald Trump’s statement during the campaign that he could shoot somebody, and nobody could do anything about it. It’s pretty blatant.”

It’s so blatant, in fact, that House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, told the Associated Press on Thursday afternoon that Conway’s behavior was “wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.” He said that he and Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings were sending a letter to the White House and the Office of Government Ethics asking for an investigation.

Ultimately, though, unless Congress wants to open an investigation itself, disciplinary action against Conway would have to come from the White House or the Department of Justice, and it’s not clear that either would put the law above loyalty to the Trump family. The Office of Government Ethics can write a letter recommending some sort of sanction, but according to Noble, it doesn’t see itself as an enforcement agency. “The system is based on the assumption that people are going to want to follow the law or enforce it,” he says. In 20 days, this administration has exploded that assumption. “They are stress-testing our democracy,” says Noble. “What happens if the administration just refuses to follow the laws and Congress doesn’t want to do anything about it?” We might be about to find out.

Update, Feb. 9, 6:40 p.m.: Chaffetz and Cummings have sent a letter to the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter M. Shaub Jr., requesting a review of Conway’s “unacceptable” statements.According to Panda Software, in 2005 over 123 new malware threats were discovered every day. The company said that in total over 45,000 thousand new malware threats were discovered last year. The figures represent a 240% increase over 2004, where some 13,000 new threats were recorded by the company. Panda thinks there's a specific reason for the trends.



"2005 stands out for two reasons: The huge increase in the number of malware specimens and the lack of visible epidemics," said Luis Corrons, director of PandaLabs. "The combination of these two factors leads us to think that the cybercrime world intends to use this situation as a smoke screen to keep us busy while they carry out lucrative activities, like \[industrial espionage and creating highly targted malware\]."



Corrons thinks that rapid release of particular variants, such as 350 new Sober worm variations that appeared within a matter of hours in November 2005, demonstrate his theory.



Panda also pointed out that over 10,000 of the threats discovered in 2005 were new "bots" - robotic agents that assimilate computers into networks which are then used for criminal purposes, such as fraud and extorsion.



This year's trends make this all seem like the good news, comparitively speaking, because so far in 2006 Panda Software is recording over 300 new threats a day, which means we're on track to see at least 100,000 new forms of malware in 2006 if the trends continue.



The US national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned late Monday amid a flow of intelligence leaks that he had secretly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington and then tried to cover up the conversations. In light of his departure, we revisit Flynn’s fiery speech at last year’s Republican national convention in which he led anti-Hillary Clinton chants (‘Lock her up’) and chided the Democratic presidential nominee over her handling of top secret informationWhat is this page?

For security reasons this page cannot be displayed.The three weeks that have passed since Trump’s inauguration have been a chaotic blur. An administration that many knew would be characterized by incompetence and scandal has outdone expectations with a kaleidoscope of controversies large and small. But how has the Donald himself been taking it?

A few reports, including a New York Times article from last Sunday that graced us with the image of Trump aimlessly wandering the halls of the White House in a robe, have believably suggested that Trump has been frustrated and bewildered by the scale of his new job, his administration’s early failures, and the rolling laugh track that has accompanied and will continue to accompany this presidency. But surely, Trump must still enjoy being the center of attention.

How else to explain his decision, as CNN reported on Sunday, to hold high-level strategic talks on North Korea’s weekend missile launch with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, not in a secured space, but in the dining terrace of his Mar-a-Lago club within full view of gawking guests?

The launch, which wasn't expected, presented Trump with one of the first breaking national security incidents of his presidency. It also noisily disrupted what was meant to be an easygoing weekend of high-level male bonding with the more sobering aspects of global diplomacy.

Sitting alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom he'd spent most of the day golfing, Trump took the call on a mobile phone at his table, which was set squarely in the middle of the private club's dining area.

As Mar-a-Lago's wealthy members looked on from their tables, and with a keyboard player crooning in the background, Trump and Abe's evening meal quickly morphed into a strategy session, the decision-making on full view to fellow diners, who described it in detail to CNN.

One of those diners was Erika Bain, an employee at a furniture design firm and a former Juicy Couture sales associate who had the good fortune to take a photograph that so perfectly captures this moment in American politics and American life that it ought to be Pulitzer-eligible:

This photo proves that this setup posed a security risk—someone close enough to take it could have, with presumably minimal effort, gotten close enough to capture audio of use to the North Koreans. But we should be at least a little glad Erika was there.

Update Feb. 13, 1:21 PM: Multiple outlets have picked up on additional photos taken of President Trump's pow-wow with the Japanese Prime Minister by one Richard DeAgazio. DeAgazio posted roughly 20 photos from the scene to Facebook, including a picture of himself posing with a man reportedly responsible for carrying the President's nuclear codes and another photo that seems to show the “nuclear football” itself being carried. The pictures have been removed from Facebook.

Here are some key moments from that briefing. (Reuters)

Vice President Pence first learned that former national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled him about the nature of his contact with a Russian official on Feb. 9, a full two weeks after other White House officials were briefed on the matter, an aide to Pence said on Tuesday.

The timing indicates that Pence would have become aware of the controversy around the same time that a Washington Post report was published, detailing the degree to which Flynn had been in contact with the Russian ambassador to the United States on the issue of sanctions, Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said.

“What I would tell you is that the vice president became aware of incomplete information that he had received on Feb. 9, last Thursday night, based on media accounts,” Lotter said. “He did an inquiry based on those media accounts.”

In a January television interview, Pence said that Flynn had told him the issue of sanctions did not come up in his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

The revelation adds a new layer to the confusion within the White House as it seeks to explain why it took more than two weeks for Flynn to resign his post, even though senior officials, including the president, were aware that he had not told Pence the truth.

President Trump had been aware for “weeks” that Flynn had misled Pence and other officials, but did not act until Monday night, forcing the national security adviser to resign, the White House said on Tuesday.

White House counsel Don McGahn told Trump in a briefing late last month that Flynn, despite his claims to the contrary, had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. Trump was briefed “immediately” after the Justice Department informed McGahn about the discrepancy, Spicer told reporters Tuesday.

Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general at the time, and a senior career national security official at the Justice Department had informed McGahn at his office about their concerns on Jan. 26, according to a person familiar with the briefing. Spicer said the president and a small group of senior aides were briefed by McGahn about Flynn that same day.

“We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth,” Spicer said.

[Justice Department warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, officials say]

The comments contrast with the impression Trump gave Friday aboard Air Force One that he was not familiar with a Washington Post report that revealed that Flynn had not told the truth about the calls.

“I don't know about that. I haven't seen it. What report is that? I haven't seen that. I'll look into that,” Trump told reporters on the plane.

Spicer said Tuesday that Trump was responding only to a question about The Post report and was not speaking about the overall issue of Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador.

The White House Counsel's Office conducted a “review” of the legal issues and determined that “there was not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,” Spicer said. “The president was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others. The president must have complete and unwavering trust of the person in that position.”

At the start of the daily White House briefing, Feb. 14, press secretary Sean Spicer spoke about the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. (Reuters)

[Michael Flynn resigns as national security adviser]

Spicer said that “the evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of a series of other issues is what led the president to ask for General Flynn's resignation.” He added that the president had an “instinctive” belief that Flynn had not broken any laws, which was later “confirmed” by an inquiry led by the White House Counsel's Office.

But the scrutiny of Flynn's contacts with Russian officials promises to continue despite his resignation.

In the first days of the new Trump administration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his communications with Kislyak, according to current and former officials.

The interview, which was first reported by the New York Times, could expose Flynn to possible charges if he denied to the agents, as he had earlier to Pence and other incoming Trump officials, that he had discussed with Kislyak sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for what it said was Russia’s interference in the November elections.

Lying to the FBI is a felony offense, and the agents were presumably in possession of a transcript of Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak when they questioned him.

In an interview with the Daily Caller, which he granted before his resignation, Flynn said he did not discuss anything inappropriate with the Russian ambassador. “If I did, believe me, the FBI would be down my throat, my clearances would be pulled,” he said. “There were no lines crossed.”

Flynn told the Daily Caller: “It wasn’t about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out.” He was referring to the expulsion by the Obama administration of 35 Russians it said were intelligence operatives using diplomatic cover.

“It was basically, ‘Look, I know this happened. We’ll review everything.’ I never said anything such as, ‘We’re going to review sanctions,’ or anything like that,” Flynn said.

For Obama officials at the time, even the promise to review the expulsions would have raised a red flag.

The White House has offered conflicting accounts over the past day about whether Flynn's decision to resign was his own or done at the request of the president, adding to the confusion over how the administration viewed Flynn's actions. Senior officials told reporters Monday night that Flynn offered his resignation voluntarily. And White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on the “Today” show Tuesday morning that Flynn “had resigned” and was not forced to quit.

“The president is very loyal. He’s a very loyal person,” Conway said. “And by nighttime, Mike Flynn had decided it was best to resign. He knew he became a lightning rod, and he made that decision.”

Spicer, however, said repeatedly at Tuesday's briefing that Trump asked Flynn to leave.

Spicer also said that Trump was not concerned with the nature of the conversations that Flynn had with the Russian ambassador but that the lack of trust created an “unsustainable” situation. “The president has no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be,” Spicer said.

National security officials monitored the calls of the Russian ambassador as part of routine surveillance of foreign officials in the United States. Spicer declined to say whether the president would declassify and release transcripts of Flynn's call with Kislyak.

“It is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time,” Spicer said. “It is not an issue that has come up.”

President Trump said Friday he has a four-person short list for his national security adviser after retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward turned down the job.

In a Twitter post, Trump mentioned retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who is currently serving as acting national security adviser, as "very much in play" for the job. Trump did not note the three others under consideration. Kellogg was also a foreign policy adviser for Trump during the presidential campaign.

Trump gave no indication on how soon a decision could be made, but he is expected to move quickly even as questions grow over contacts with Russia by the former security adviser, Michael Flynn.

Harward would have replaced Flynn, who announced his resignation late Monday amid allegations that he discussed U.S. sanctions with a Russian official before Trump took office and then misrepresented the content of that conversation to Vice President Pence and other administration officials.

One factor in Harward's decision was that he couldn't get a guarantee that he could select his own staff, according to a person close to Trump with knowledge of the discussions.

Other officials said his decision was motivated by financial concerns about leaving his job at aerospace firm Lockheed Martin, where he is a senior executive, and the impact it would have on his family.

One senior U.S. official said that “family considerations changed his mind.” A friend of Harward's added that he was also not fully comfortable with the quickly moving process. All requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

The news of Harward's decision was first reported by the Financial Times.

The administration had hoped to name Harward to the position this week, in an effort to soothe the turmoil rolling through the White House. Even before Flynn resigned, the administration was wooing Harward. The hard-charging former Navy SEAL was at the White House on Feb. 8 and then again this week, according to an administration official. Harward commanded high-risk operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and later parachuted into his own retirement ceremony from high altitude.

Trump suggested at a news conference Thursday that one of the reasons he felt he could let Flynn go was because he had a good replacement in mind, without naming that person.

“I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position,” he said. “And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.”

Harward's decision not to take the job leaves the White House scrambling to find a leader for the National Security Council, which is struggling to get its bearings.

Most National Security Council staffers are traditionally on temporary duty from the Defense and State departments and the intelligence agencies, but as many as 60 of those slots are vacant, according to senior officials who denied reports that the White House was having trouble recruiting to fill them. They said the vacancies are due to rotational and turnover delays in what are normally two-year assignments.

The White House hires about 75 of a total of more than 200 staffers on the council. The staff chosen by Flynn is heavily weighted toward the small world of military intelligence officials and strategists who rotated through Iraq and Afghanistan with him over the past decade.

House Democrats came to Baltimore last week to do the excruciating work of hashing out a “messaging” plan. This would be tedious stuff even if the Democrats were a cohesive entity and not what they actually are, which is a diverse federation of often contradictory interests fond of interminable argument. But messaging is all they have right now, and so here they were for their winter retreat, toiling away on the second floor of an Inner Harbor Hyatt, making occasional trips downstairs in groups to try and convince skeptical reporters that everything was going fine, just fine, and that everyone was on the same page.

Jim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer.

And here, on Thursday morning, was Nancy Pelosi, longtime leader of the House Democrats, pooh-poohing rumors that some progressive members had walked out during a presentation from the centrist think tank Third Way the previous day. She was sharp and lively and not in any mood to entertain questions she considered stupid.

“I didn’t notice that,” she said. “Members walk out over a variety of reasons. Some of them relate to personal hygiene. Some of them relate to, ‘I’ve got to call my mother, I’ve got to call my daughter.’ People just walk out.”

A reporter followed up: Are you saying that there are not real, deep divisions within the party?

“Yeah. That’s what I’m saying.”

She mentioned the Republican grassroots’ tendency in recent years to primary anyone who cast a stray vote, a purity putsch against members who dared work with the Democratic president or against conservative ideology. She sounded a little too confident that this was a “them” problem and not an “us” problem, with tempers already aboil on the left over any perceived collaboration with Donald Trump. I asked if there was any fear among the House Democratic caucus that the party’s base will do to Democrats what the Tea Party did to certain Republicans over any breaks from orthodoxy.

“We don’t have a party orthodoxy,” she said. “They are ideological.”

This was the challenge facing the folks upstairs who were trying to craft a cohesive message: this lingering and longstanding conviction that the Democratic Party comprises a set of nonideological interests, with the party serving as a glorified moderator. But is that really still the case? What was odd in Baltimore was watching elected Democrats struggle to do what has happened organically in the days since Donald Trump’s inauguration. Among wide swaths of the Democratic coalition, there is an orthodoxy forming: The party’s purpose is to block and resist Trump at every turn—and through that process reinforce their own priorities. The question that seemed to hang over the Inner Harbor last week, during both the House Democrats’ retreat and a Democratic National Committee forum on Saturday, was whether the Democrats realized that a message had already been made for them—not in hotel ballrooms, but in town halls around the country and quite literally in the streets.

The House Democratic caucus does not like being called irrelevant.

“There’s so much buzz in the press, ‘Oh, you’re Democrats, you don’t have any power in the House of Representatives, you’re gonna be irrelevant,’ ” Rep. Steny Hoyer said Wednesday in Baltimore. “We’re not irrelevant, not at all.”

The Democrats’ best messaging weapon is in not allowing Republicans to operate independently of the madness radiating from the White House.

Let us try to understand why some members of the press might have this impression, which the House minority whip categorizes as false. To be in the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, during a period of unified Republican control of the federal government and during a broader era of near total political polarization, is to have near-negligible control over the ship of state. Senate Democrats still have some leverage, for now, with what remains of the filibuster. Democrats in the House can stop nothing that hits the floor from passing—only Republicans’ internal divisions can achieve that. There may be some crucial bills coming down the pike for which Speaker Ryan turns to Democrats to make up for votes the Freedom Caucus won’t supply. Those bills have yet to materialize. The legislative efforts that have materialized are the push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and tax reform, congressional Republicans’ two stated goals for the year, which they’ll pursue via the party-line reconciliation process. They’ve shut the door on Democrats, and there’s not much that Democrats can do about it.

What, then, is the House Democrats’ role in the resistance? How are they to spend their time? “It is up to us to make sure that the public knows what is happening here, and how it affects them,” Pelosi said Wednesday.

In other words, all they’ve got is messaging.

That means cutting through the daily frenzy of Donald Trump’s early morning agenda-setting and score-settling on Twitter. “It’s an ancient Chinese, and even more modern, theory of war that one of the things you do in order to win a war is to make sure the other side cannot make its case,” Pelosi said. “So, as soon as they’re doing something—and if it’s not going well, and we’re succeeding in pointing that out, they change the subject. He’s an illusionist.”

Messaging on the Hill also mean sending a crisp signal to Republicans that Democrats will not bail them out with any votes if they go through with a risky escapade such as, say, repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement lined up. Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking Democratic member on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, said his party had a “tremendous” amount of leverage—enough to hold their ground against Republicans.

“If they go ahead and just repeal this thing, and even if they delay it but they have no replacement, then the danger is that the insurance marketplace starts to collapse,” Pallone said. “And I think what they’re envisioning is that if they do that, and it collapses, they would come back to us and say, ‘OK, we want your votes for replacement, because this is a disaster.’ But what they’re realizing is that disaster, that marketplace chaos which would result from repeal and no replacement, is going be blamed on them.”

The minority’s most powerful messaging weapon, though, is in not allowing congressional Republicans to operate independently of the madness radiating from the White House. Consider, to use an example from the week past, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley’s effort to see if Republicans would avoid consideration of a resolution affirming that the Holocaust targeted Jews. He succeeded: Republicans blocked the resolution.

“We want our Republican colleagues to understand that what the White House does, [House Republicans] either have to answer for, or they have to condemn,” a satisfied Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, said on Wednesday. “They can’t have it both ways. That’s another tool by which we will continue to use procedural votes on the floor to hold them accountable. It’s not just about the White House. It’s also about our Republican colleagues.”

“At the end of the day, 2018 will be more a referendum on what it is the House Republicans are going to allow him to do,” Rep. Denny Heck, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s recruitment chair, said Thursday. “He can only do those things that they allow him to do, and he cannot do those things that they choose to stop him from doing. This is a referendum on them.”

If there’s problem with this theory, it’s in the premise that Trump’s insanity and poor approval ratings will drag down the rest of the party. The Republican base, which reliably turns out to vote in midterm elections, quite likes Trump. The question of whether congressional Republicans will provide a check on Trump has a much more obvious answer: of course not.

But messaging against Donald Trump and the congressional Republican agenda is all House Democrats can do right now, and Senate Democrats can’t do much more either. More importantly, it is all they should do. They need not concern themselves with what their platform ahead of the 2018 elections will be, because even if they pick up seats or even a chamber in Congress, they will still not be able to enact any of their agenda. Their goal is to stop Trump and the Republicans from doing bad things. It’s all their base is asking them to do.

Millions of people marched against Donald Trump the day after he was inaugurated. Republican members of Congress can’t hold town halls without being set upon by protesters hassling them about their agenda or the blind eye they turn to Trump. Resistance groups are gathering massive support online; the ACLU will never want for money again; the courts have blocked Trump’s order restricting travel into the United States. As Republicans put the Affordable Care Act on the chopping block, regular people are mustering a moral language for defending it that Democratic politicians have been loath to employ. Constituents have a powerful ability to find the right defense for something dear to them when someone is trying to take that thing away. Maybe the job of Democrats at the top isn’t to draw up a message in a focus group. Maybe it’s to follow those people on the ground expressing it already.

That seems to be the conclusion of several candidates vying for the chair of the DNC. The road to that process is now less than two weeks from its culmination at the DNC election on Feb. 25 in Atlanta. This past weekend, the race stopped in Baltimore—across the street from where the House Democrats had just met—for the final regional forum before the election.

“The job of the next DNC chair is to make sure the party is positioned as an ally.”

The third floor of the Baltimore Convention Center on Saturday, one flight up from an international auto show, was rife with dozens of signs and assorted other literature for the candidates, of whom there are many. Ten people are running for chair, nine for vice chair, and four for secretary. Outside the main ballroom, supporters of various candidates were huddled opposite each other, as if preparing to begin a dance-off. They took turns loudly chanting for their candidates. Each candidate had a table from which to distribute information and, more welcomingly, free food. Henry Muñoz, the party’s national finance chair who’s running unopposed for re-election, set platters of Baltimore crab cakes on his table to distribute to all comers. No wonder the competition was scared off.

The race for DNC chair has receded into the background since Nov. 9, when liberal anger over the election manifested itself as an unprecedented interest in who would fill the role of unofficial tribune of both the party and the Trump resistance. The diminishing interest is telling: It turns out that the role has been more than ably filled by the millions of people who’ve taken to the streets and town halls to demonstrate against Trump and the anticipated predations of a unified Republican government.

But the DNC election still matters, including as a bellwether for how closely the party is listening to the howls of the people it purports to represent. The state of the race is difficult to ascertain. The chair of the Democratic Party will be determined by the votes of its 447 members, whose priorities don’t necessarily align with those of outside activists.

It appears to be a race, though, between former Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. The horserace drama, such as it is, is that of a silly proxy war between the emboldened Bernie Sanders wing of the party (Ellison) and its establishment (Perez). “Silly” not because the proxy war isn’t real—it’s definitely real, as Sanders’ post-campaign political organization, Our Revolution, has aggressively thrown its weight behind Ellison, while Perez is running at the urging of President Obama and his allies. “Silly” because Perez and Ellison are both capable, charismatic, progressive organizers who would serve the party well. They’re not so different.

The 11-person field has other appealing and capable options in the rising-star mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg; South Carolina Democratic Party chair and former House majority whip aide Jaime Harrison; New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair and current DNC Vice Chair Ray Buckley; the deeply credentialed party operative, organizer, and activist Jehmu Greene, and others.

The national party operation under the stewardship of any of these candidates would be a marked improvement over the torn and tattered DNC left behind by the last elected party chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, an incompetent and widely disliked Florida centrist who went so deep in the tank for Hillary Clinton during the primary that she didn’t dry off until Trump’s inauguration. Candidates weren’t shy about expressing their frustration with what the DNC had become, and how it had allowed local and state parties to atrophy. Mitch Caesar, chair of the Broward County Democratic Party and a candidate for vice chair, lamented the deterioration of the DNC into little more than a “federal pass-through for presidential elections.” Buckley described the DNC in recent years as being “the chair and a few staff.”

“For the last eight years, I’ve been a vice chair,” Buckley said, “and I don’t know what the hell is going on in this party any more than you.”

The DNC race of today has changed in scope even in the past month. Candidates entered this race thinking about how they could counter Trump. Now they’re thinking about how they can assist those who are already doing it.

“What I think we’re seeing is the broader organizational movement activity is welling up with or without us,” Buttigieg said Saturday, a few hours before the forum. “And the job of the next Democratic chair of the party is not cramming all of this into the party and try to run it from Washington. It’s to make sure the party is positioned as an ally and sees where it fits within the broader texture of the progressive movement, rather than the other way around.

“You go from the model of the airport protests and the women’s march, to the town hall meetings, where we watch this taken to the feet of the Republican Congress,” he continued. “If we keep guiding it that way, then it’s not such a long walk, a year from now, to start channeling this into working in electoral campaigns. But we can’t just be passive observers until September of next year, and then just suddenly call these people up when we need them to say, alright, time for you to [join] our movement. We have to be a part of theirs.”

Over the past few weeks, the grassroots-level interest in contributing to the resistance has spiked in a way that overloads the creaky local, state, and national Democratic Party infrastructure that’s still low on cash following the 2016 cycle.

“One of the things that’s core, and that’s very, very critical … is about building capacity,” Jaime Harrison said Friday. “I’m really concerned that if 500 or 1,000 of these people go to Democratic offices tomorrow, the question is, what do they do? Are the parties equipped to train them? And that’s what we need to make sure happens here in this race. I want this race to be done, and done soon, so whoever—if it’s me, or whomever the chair is—can make sure that the state parties, and that the DNC, have the capacity to be able to work with all of these groups.”

The Democratic Party will already have to play catchup with the growing sector of outside groups sopping up the overflow energy. Indivisible, over the course of a couple of months, has blossomed from a PDF dumped onto Twitter one night into a go-to hub for finding local meet-ups and organizing protest activity. (If a member of Congress finds himself or herself bombarded by rowdy town hall attendees, a lot of those attendees probably found their way there via Indivisible.) Groups such as SwingLeft and the Sister District Project offer residents of safe districts opportunities to help in other competitive races. The volunteers behind these groups talk to each other. While the Democratic Party has been debating its future leadership, these groups have been doing the early organizing work for them.

Liz Jaff, vice president for business development at Crowdpac and candidate for DNC vice chair, wants to bring this apparatus under the wing of the party.* “This is the DNC. It should happen here,” she said in her fired-up Saturday pitch in Baltimore. “What I’m asking, very simply, is to build this. To bring in these engineers to make this happen. To connect you with the movements.

“We shouldn’t see these groups as a threat,” she said later. “We need to embrace them.”

There was some debate among the candidates about whether the DNC should partner with these and other groups as outside vendors, or cut them out and build a proprietary operation within. That’s a narrow question for the newly elected DNC leadership to figure out. There was very little debate, though, about whether the party needs to plug into these outside movements the way groups such as Indivisible are, and serve as a clearinghouse for the energetic resistance to Trump.

It is much easier to harness energy than it is to be tasked with mustering energy where there is none. The DNC isn’t going to come up with “the message” any more than House Democrats are, or any more than Chuck Schumer is. The message is going to be determined on the ground and filter up to its politicians, and some of the best messaging in years is coming out from these packed town halls. The video of Jessi Bohon’s Christian defense of universal health coverage at a Tennessee town hall for Republican Rep. Diane Black has exploded. The clip of a Republican official in Florida being instantly jeered to silence after saying “death panel” was the most effective rejection of that lie since Sarah Palin first invented it eight years ago. Official Democrats don’t need to come up the message. They just need to get out of the message’s way.

In his entry to Alain Locke’s 1925 The New Negro anthology, Arthur Schomburg described the black American past as a patch of untilled soil that the “Old Negro” had been content to stand upon rather than cultivate. Titled “The Negro Digs Up His Past,” Schomburg’s essay argued that black America’s arrival as a modern people—and a new generation’s decisive break from the stereotypes associated with its forefathers—depended upon a new relationship to the past. The past should no longer be thought of as an inert, constricting burden, but a malleable resource.

Near the end of Raoul Peck’s new documentary I Am Not Your Negro, James Baldwin (via the voice of actor Samuel L. Jackson) also speaks of the past, intoning that history “is not the past. History is the present. We carry our history with us. To think otherwise is criminal.” Speaking as he does through Jackson, we might think that Baldwin is describing history’s inescapable purchase upon black life. We wouldn’t be wrong, but I suspect that Baldwin intended that statement in the same spirit that moved Schomburg: History is not immutable, a fate to which we must all eventually succumb. Rather, it is a practice we always conduct in the present tense, reshaping the past in order to imagine desired futures.

I had the sense, while watching I Am Not Your Negro—based on notes that James Baldwin prepared for an unfinished memoir titled Remember This House—that Peck had borrowed Baldwin’s stance. He stages an encounter between the past and present, an exchange between two voices that produces something new. The film interweaves archival footage of the Civil Rights Movement and Baldwin’s television appearances, contemporary images of protests and police violence in Ferguson, and original material into a volatile collage. But rather than erasing distinctions between the past and present, I Am Not Your Negro gestures toward a disjunction between Baldwin’s moment and our own. Peck’s decision to have Samuel L. Jackson narrate the movie, for example, points to an antiphonal ethos: It structures its relationship with Baldwin as a conversation that might produce new knowledge. We hear Jackson reading Baldwin’s unfinished project, as if Jackson and Peck were helping the dead writer finish a thought he couldn’t quite complete. In finishing that thought, Peck also allows a new, composite voice to come to the fore. The film asks us to ponder what we can know about our contemporary moment when we stop ventriloquizing our ancestors, and begin to speak in our own voices.

This idea challenges a thesis that writers such as Michelle Alexander have made into a commonplace in contemporary analyses of black life: Black people are merely living through endless repetitions of slavery and Jim Crow, which white supremacists massaged into subtler forms of control. According to this thesis, black Americans exist in a moment of foundational violence—slavery—that repeats ad infinitum. This is a traumatic model of black history whose hallmark is a deadening, Oedipal regularity. Each moment fundamentally resembles our forefathers’, and historical change amounts to window dressing. The past and present are drawn into such a claustrophobic embrace that it seems pointless to draw distinctions between the two.

Peck isn’t alone in disputing this theory. With Baldwin as the centerpiece of their inquiry, a generation of black thinkers are contesting this assumption. A proliferation of recent essays, films, and books haunted by Baldwin—from Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Between the World and Me to Jesmyn Ward’s recent essay collection The Fire This Time—attests not only to his renewed relevance, but also to his particular usefulness for challenging the logic of perpetual trauma.

But much of the criticism that’s been written about this cohort of contemporary black writers illustrates a general tendency to mischaracterize Baldwin’s influence. Reviewers greeted Between the World and Me, for example, with an Oedipal wave hellbent on adjudicating whether or not Coates is Baldwin’s legitimate heir. Toni Morrison—whose classic novel Beloved popularized the notion of a traumatic black history—unambiguously cast Coates as Baldwin’s literary son. Cornel West, contrarian as ever, wrote that Coates is merely a “clever wordsmith with journalistic talent” who doesn’t live up to Baldwin’s revolutionary legacy. Taking, perhaps, another chance to needle West, Michael Eric Dyson delivered a precise analysis of Coates and Baldwin’s prose styles, concluding that “if Baldwin couldn’t be Baldwin now, he’d more than likely be Coates, or somebody like him.” Meanwhile, Vinson Cunningham marshaled eloquent close readings and a strong command of American literary history to argue that Baldwin and Coates diverge over their investment in religion, with Baldwin playing the committed Christian preacher to Coates’ clear-eyed atheist rapper.

No matter what particular arguments they were making, they were all operating on the premise that Coates’ formal proximity to Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time demands an answer to the question of literary genealogy. Such writings amount to well-written paternity tests concerned with a single, tabloid-worthy question: Who’s the father?

The problem here is that Baldwin—a gay man who had no children—is the last writer one should turn to for an answer to that question. He launched his career via literary patricide, turning on forefather Richard Wright in a cold-blooded (and unfair) display of literary bravura, and his oeuvre betrays a singular skepticism at the very idea of familial lineage. Baldwin’s writing often looks askance at biological family ties, with language that figures generational bonds as a problem, laden as they are with oppressive histories. These bonds always threaten to become chains for Baldwin, and lineage seems coextensive with numbing repetition.

His essays propose a queered definition of reproduction, one loosed from the Oedipal rhythm embedded in the question of lineage. In “My Dungeon Shook,” the first essay from The Fire Next Time, Baldwin pens a letter to his nephew and namesake James. “I keep seeing your face, which is also the face of your father and my brother,” he writes. “Like him, you are tough, dark, vulnerable, moody … You may be like your grandfather in this, I don’t know, but certainly both you and your father resemble him very much.” From the essay’s beginning, Baldwin weights his language with a sense that the paternal relationship means incessant reiteration.

Critics have committed the exact mistake that these writers struggle to avoid—collapsing distinct historical moments into one.

His letter is an interruption in this line of descent, a familial relation not premised on the paternal. It’s certainly intended to disrupt James’ otherwise inevitable inheritance of his forefathers’ passive acceptance of received roles. If the grandfather “was defeated long before he died because, at the bottom of his heart, he really believed what white people said about him,” Baldwin arrives on the scene to teach his namesake that he must craft an identity separate from the caricature—the nigger—that white America has reserved for him. Baldwin insinuates that there’s a queer aspect to the very act of writing, a self-fashioning that cuts against history’s necessities. The younger James—named, crucially, after his writer uncle rather than his father—must shirk Oedipal logic if he is to slip white supremacy’s grip. Surviving as a black boy in America means shedding your father’s assumptions and taking up the burden of self-fashioning.

If some contemporary black writers are drawn like moths to The Fire Next Time, it’s because they sense something important in this exit from repetition, this call to fashion the black self anew. This is what is missing from the attempts to verify Coates’ status as Baldwin’s heir: The turn to Baldwin is not an act of reverence or restatement of knowledge that Baldwin already gave us. For writers like Coates, Ward, and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, Baldwin is a specter that elicits an ambivalent mix of veneration and trepidation. This ambivalence is an occasion to strain against a traumatic model of history. Rather than taking that thesis as a given, they interrogate it, forcing us to consider how black people can learn from the past without uncritically accepting our ancestors’ fears, assumptions, and intellectual legacies. They want to acknowledge the long shadows that slavery and Jim Crow cast on our present without standing in them. We might think of these writers as among a school of black nonfiction writers for which Baldwin is a problem as much as an interlocutor, a specter to which they return cyclically—almost compulsively—to both honor and decline. But by discussing these texts mostly in terms of how similar they are to Baldwin, or whether or not they’re deserving of Baldwin’s mantle, certain critics have committed the exact mistake that these works struggle to avoid—collapsing distinct historical moments into one.

If we’re just talking literary form, such criticism ignores these texts’ striking aesthetic feats. These feats enact a tortured ambivalence toward Baldwin that simultaneously instantiates and interrogates the history he represents. In her introduction to The Fire This Time, for example, Jesmyn Ward describes the experience of Trayvon Martin’s death as the latest episode of a recurrent nightmare. “Replace ropes with bullets,” she says. “Hound dogs with German shepherds. A gray uniform with a bulletproof vest. Nothing is new.” For Ward, every aspect of contemporary life has a corollary in the Jim Crow past. Her litany of substitutions creates a time warp, casting the reader into a perpetual moment of oppression. White supremacy might have swapped guises, but its power remains interminable and total.

It’s no surprise that, in the aftermath of Martin’s death, Ward returns to Baldwin with an eye toward the same cyclical regularity of racist violence. Reading The Fire Next Time’s first essay, “My Dungeon Shook,” she finds such solace that she inserts Baldwin into her family tree, literalizing his status as a literary ancestor: “It was as if I sat on my porch steps with a wise father, a kind, present uncle, who … told me I was worthy of love. Told me I was something in the world. Told me I was a human being. I saw Trayvon Martin’s face, and all the words blurred on the page.” On the one hand, Ward’s citation of Baldwin’s enduring prescience becomes a measure of America’s static racial politics. He continues to be necessary because the conditions he describes still exist, and his writings become immutable truths.

But Ward’s fantasy of Baldwin as father throws a bit of a wrinkle into her explicit pessimism. What does it mean to claim a man who disdains the very notion of descent as a father? To write in Baldwin’s wake means to displace the father-teacher in a Whitmanesque act of parricide—not to dutifully shoulder the same historical burdens, but to comprehend one’s own historical moment more clearly. Perhaps this is why, even as Ward honors Baldwin, his words must recede into the background, blurring on the page as Trayvon Martin’s face takes precedence. It’s this blurring that informs Ward’s act of writing and her impulse to gather a generation of writers in whom readers might find not fathers, but “a wise aunt [or a] more present mother.” This is an exit from Oedipal logic, a break in the chain, and Ward goes to Baldwin because he allows for this. As Ghansah writes in her contribution to Ward’s collection, “The Weight,” Baldwin left no heirs—only spares, people who might one day take his place.

The same acknowledgement motivates Coates’ use of the letter conceit in Between the World and Me. The very act of writing the letter to his son Samori represents a conscious break from the past, or at least an attempt to feel for possibilities beyond it. Coates is not just repurposing an old literary conceit; he’s also employing the skepticism toward lineage that the conceit implies.

Reflecting on his time in Paris (Baldwin’s echo abounds), Coates recalls a “wholly alien” sense that he is finally “far outside of someone else’s dream.” This experience awakens him to a state of flux that he recognizes as life’s defining fact, a fact that he realizes only when he leaves America behind—and begins to glimpse a life that isn’t shot through with the perpetual sense of anxiety, fear, and anger that white supremacy has imparted to him. Though Coates knows that he is too close to America’s racist past to ever move beyond the behaviors it has instilled in him, the literary form of the letter becomes a space wherein this interruption in racist violence’s damage might persist—and be passed on to his son in lieu of a traumatic inheritance.

Coates later returns to Paris, this time with his son in tow. “I wanted you to have your own life, apart from fear—even apart from me,” he tells Samori. “I am wounded. I am marked by old codes, which shielded me in one world and chained me in the next.” This is the threat that Coates strains against throughout this book: not only the threat of being chained to outmoded and myopic assumptions, but also of passing his own wounds on to his son. Reading this sentence, it’s easy to be reminded of Baldwin’s letter to his nephew. Baldwin intervened in the Oedipal cycle because he feared that generational bonds would become mental chains, and Coates has learned the lesson. Having a life apart from history’s wounds necessarily entails a life apart from the father and his assumptions, and while Samori might take up the fight against white supremacy, his fight will not be Coates’.It was Saturday night, and Palm Beach’s tony Mar-a-Lago Club was packed. There was a wedding reception in the ballroom. There was a full house for dinner on the terrace.

And at one table on the terrace, there was the president and the leader of a major U.S. ally, hashing out a national security problem in the open air.

“Someone opened up a laptop, and at the table . . . a group of Japanese people stood around the prime minister and Donald, and they were all looking at the laptop,” said Jay Weitzman, a member of President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club and founder of the Pennsylvania-based parking management company Park America. He was sitting three tables away from Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday evening.

“Whoa,” Weitzman remembered thinking. “What’s going on?”

“Turns out, it was a missile launch,” he said Monday.

Richard DeAgazio's post on Facebook.

As Weitzman and other patrons watched Saturday evening, Trump and Abe remained at the table and discussed their response to a ballistic missile test by North Korea. While waiters came and went — and while one club member snapped photos — the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aide’s cellphone.

That strange scene — in which Trump turned his table into an al fresco situation room — astounded White House veterans, who were used to presidents retiring to private, secured settings to hash out such an event.

Trump became president, in part, because of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s neglect of information security. During the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly called for Clinton to be jailed — and his crowds at rallies often chanted “Lock her up!” — for her use of a private email server to handle government business while she was secretary of state.

Now, Trump is drawing fire from Democrats for his own seemingly loose attitude toward information security. He has continued to use an insecure cellphone, according to the New York Times. He may have left a key to classified information on his desk while visitors were in the Oval Office, according to a tweet from a Democratic senator.

And now, Trump has used his bustling club in Palm Beach, Fla., as a “winter White House,” except that, unlike the actual White House, the club is full of other people.

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters Monday that “no classified material” was shared at the table at Mar-a-Lago and that Trump had been briefed in a secure location both before and after dinner.

The scene was first described by CNN. On Monday, Democrats blasted Trump for his handling of the moment.

“There’s no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like dinner theater,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), the leader of House Democrats, wrote in a tweet.

Separately, two Senate Democrats from the Homeland Security Committee, Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Thomas R. Carper (Del.), wrote to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who oversees the agency that protects the president’s communications. McCaskill and Carper said they were concerned about media reports that Trump is still using his old Android phone to send Twitter messages.

McCaskill and Carper said that if a foreign power was able to hack that phone, it could be turned into an always-on listening post in the president’s pocket.

“The national security risks of compromising a smartphone used by [the president] are considerable,” the senators wrote.

Last week, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) tweeted an Associated Press photo showing Trump with the chief executive of Intel standing by a stack of papers on Trump’s desk along with a black bag and a key in sight. “Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people,” Heinrich wrote.

It is hard to recall any other instance in recent U.S. history when the president seemed to handle an urgent national security matter in a public place.

On Sept. 11, 2001, of course, President George W. Bush learned of that day’s terrorist attacks while he was reading a book to children at a Florida elementary school. Bush continued reading for at least five minutes before being whisked away on Air Force One to a secure location.

In Barack Obama’s White House, two former aides said, a situation like the North Korean missile test might have been handled similarly: the president would be given a note with the news, then taken to a secure room to discuss a response.

Pete Souza, who was Obama’s White House photographer, posted a photo Monday that showed Obama huddling with national security advisers in a private space during a 2011 trip to El Salvador.

“When we were on the road, national security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private, secure location set up on-site. Everyone had to leave their Blackberry outside the area,” Souza wrote.

The Mar-a-Lago Club, which Trump has run since 1995, includes tennis and beach facilities for its members and rents its ballroom out for weddings and galas open to nonmembers.

Trump has an apartment at the club. Club members said that the president seems at ease there, among people who have known him for years — and away from the protests and stresses of his new job. “He’s in a safe space,” said Mar-a-Lago member Robin Bernstein, an insurance executive.

Saturday night, as guests streamed into Mar-a-Lago for dinner and the wedding reception, a parking lot near the club had been converted into a ­security-check area for vehicles entering the estate. A string of BMWs, Mercedes and other high-end vehicles were backed up waiting to get through the checkpoint, which was staffed by Secret Service agents and officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.

Inside the club, Trump and Abe entered the dining terrace to a standing ovation, club members told The Washington Post. The two leaders and their wives sat down on the noisy terrace, among other diners.

Richard DeAgazio, a retired investor and club member from the Boston area, was about six tables away. Already that day, his status as a Mar-a-Lago member had given him unprecedented access to the president: He had snapped pictures of Trump and Abe golfing and taken a photo with White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon.

During dinner, DeAgazio got a text: a friend asking him if he was aware of the North Korean missile test.

He looked over at the president’s table.

“That’s when I saw things changing, you know,” DeAgazio recalled in a telephone interview. DeAgazio said a group of staffers surrounded the two world leaders: “The prime minister’s staff sort of surrounded him, and they had a little powwow.”

As Trump and Abe turned their dinner table into an impromptu situation room, DeAgazio continued taking pictures, and he posted them on Facebook that night.

[Should President Trump be spending weekends at Mar-a-Lago?]

“The President receiving the news about the Missile incident from North Korea on Japan with the Prime Minister sitting next to him,” DeAgazio wrote as the caption for a photo he posted on Facebook at 9:07 p.m. Eastern time Saturday.

“HOLY MOLY !!!” De Agazio wrote later, posting more photos of the scene. “Wow . . . the center of the action!!!”

DeAgazio told The Post that after Trump and Abe had spoken for a few minutes, they left the open terrace and spent about 10 minutes in private before conducting a joint news conference at about 10:30 p.m. Later, he said, Trump and first lady Melania Trump returned to listen to music on the terrace, which faces the Intracoastal Waterway, and shake hands and schmooze with members and guests at the club — all of whom had paid Trump’s business to be there (or been paid-for by their hosts).

DeAgazio said he was impressed with how the president handled the situation.

“There wasn’t any panicked look. Most of the people [on the terrace] didn’t even realize what was happening,” DeAgazio said. “I thought he handled it very calmly, and very presidentially.”

[Trump ran a campaign based on intelligence security. That’s not how he’s governing.]

Weitzman, the parking garage entrepreneur, said he didn’t notice any weariness or concern in the president’s face, even after the news from North Korea. He said Trump was jovial: The president, for instance, complimented Weitzman’s son-in-law on his recent weight loss.

“It’s amazing,” Weitzman said. “You know, the president of the United States comes over and says, ‘You lost a little weight. How ya doing?’ ”

DeAgazio, the Boston retiree, said he was impressed that Trump had not gotten up from the table immediately when the North Korean news broke.

“He chooses to be out on the terrace, with the members. It just shows that he’s a man of the people,” DeAgazio said.

Membership at the Mar-a-Lago Club now requires a $200,000 initiation fee — a fee that increased by $100,000 after Trump was elected.

DeAgazio said he wasn’t worried about the national security implications of Trump’s al fresco discussion with Abe. He said he was sure they had not been overheard.

“You don’t hear anything. You can’t hear” because of the background music and other diners’ chatter, DeAgazio said. “I mean, I can barely hear what’s going on at my table.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the intelligence community has kept sensitive intelligence from President Trump out of concerns that the information could be compromised. From the Journal:

The officials’ decision to keep information from Mr. Trump underscores the deep mistrust that has developed between the intelligence community and the president over his team’s contacts with the Russian government, as well as the enmity he has shown toward U.S. spy agencies. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused the agencies of leaking information to undermine him.

In some of these cases of withheld information, officials have decided not to show Mr. Trump the sources and methods that the intelligence agencies use to collect information, the current and former officials said. Those sources and methods could include, for instance, the means that an agency uses to spy on a foreign government.

Intelligence officials told the Journal that no information pertaining to imminent security risks had been withheld. The White House has categorically denied the Journal’s reporting. “There is nothing that leads us to believe that this is an accurate account of what is actually happening,” a White House official told the paper.

Tensions between the White House and the intelligence community were further underscored Wednesday in a New York Times report on President Trump’s plan to have billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg lead a review of the intelligence community. From the Times:

The possible role for Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, has met fierce resistance among intelligence officials already on edge because of the criticism the intelligence community has received from Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he became president. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump blamed leaks from the intelligence community for the departure of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, whose resignation he requested.

There has been no announcement of Mr. Feinberg’s job, which would be based in the White House, but he recently told his company’s shareholders that he is in discussions to join the Trump administration. He is a member of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council.“Anybody who watches the news knows we need to have law and order reinstalled and we need to have more support for Blue Lives Matter,” she said, referring to the pro-police slogan that became a retort to the protests.

In recent interviews, other supporters of Mr. Trump have said they want him to institute curfews in city neighborhoods and to increase funding to drug treatment programs. They also expressed approval for widespread use of stop-and-frisk, the police practice of stopping and sometimes searching people in high-crime areas.

While supporters of the practice say it helps officers find illegal weapons and bring down homicide rates, it became a source of enormous tension between the police and black residents in the cities that deployed it. A federal judge in New York struck down the tactic as unconstitutional in 2013, saying the way the city was using it violated the rights of minorities. But if it were ever reinstated, it could one day land in front of a Supreme Court with Trump appointees who could be more open to its use.

“Donald Trump has proposed nothing short of a police state,” said Brittany Packnett, an activist who served on President Obama’s task force on 21st-century policing. “This is backlash to a black president, a black movement and black people being self-determined, bold and unapologetic.”

Mr. Trump’s ability to impose stop-and-frisk, should he follow through on his campaign talk, would be limited by the fact that local police and sheriff’s departments control most aspects of law enforcement. His administration could conceivably use grants to encourage local departments to adopt his policies, much in the way that President Bill Clinton’s Justice Department handed out money to encourage the hiring of tens of thousands of new officers around the country.

Mr. Trump’s Justice Department will have another pressing policy matter: how aggressively to pursue investigations against the police.

Under Mr. Obama, the department has often taken the lead on police violence cases, sometimes looking into prosecuting officers on charges of civil rights violations after local prosecutors declined to charge them or juries declined to convict. The department has in the last couple of years demanded changes from a number of police departments, including in Ferguson, Mo., where it found that officers were violating the constitutional rights of black residents, and in Cleveland, where it found a pattern of “unreasonable and unnecessary use of force” that resulted in dangerous and reckless behavior by officers. Both inquiries came after black residents were killed by local officers.

“What role does he see for his Justice Department in dealing with use-of-force issues, pattern and practice investigations, and the overall role of the Justice Department vis-à-vis local law enforcement?” Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said of Mr. Trump. “We really don’t know yet.”

One of the first issues Mr. Trump’s Justice Department is likely to have to deal with is the case of Mr. Garner, whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a nationwide rallying cry. In December 2014, a state grand jury in Staten Island decided not to bring charges against Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was seen on a video using a chokehold, prohibited by the New York Police Department, to subdue Mr. Garner.

Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch recently replaced the New York team of federal agents and lawyers investigating the case, who were leaning against filing charges against the officers involved, a move that struck some as political.

On Tuesday night as defeat set in, Ms. Carr began writing a letter to Ms. Lynch pleading with her to quickly decide how to proceed before Mr. Trump takes office.

“Please hear my cry, don’t allow my son’s words and our tears to be in vain,” Ms. Carr wrote before sending it off Friday morning. “I’ve been living in a nightmare and crying for over two years and I’m ready to awake to peace.”

In an interview, Ms. Carr added that she felt new pressure to get the case resolved. “I know my son’s case is on the line, and if it goes past Obama’s administration, we are not going to get any justice,” she said.

William Bateman, 52, who voted for Mr. Trump and works as an operations manager in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, sees things differently. He felt that the Justice Department, under Mr. Obama’s direction, “politicized everything,” and that the president was unfair to the police by “blaming them before they went to trial.”

He also said he believed a constant theme of Mr. Obama’s tenure was a sentiment of exclusion, beginning when the president weighed in on the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” Mr. Obama said then.

“It was like he was defending the black community, the Muslim community, the Hispanic community,” Mr. Bateman said this week. “But not the white community.”

The feeling that Mr. Obama was taking sides reverberated around the country and was part of the reason the National Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Mr. Trump, said Jim Pasco, its executive director. Many saw parallels between Mr. Trump’s law-and-order pledge and Richard M. Nixon’s 1968 campaign that became a reaction to the national strife over the Vietnam War, the Voting Rights Act, the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, and widespread rioting.

“The atmosphere has gotten harder for police officers because there is a lot of second-guessing by people with a lack of insight into their jobs and a lack of expertise on what constitutes appropriate policing techniques in given situations,” Mr. Pasco said, adding that officers hoped that Mr. Trump would change the nation’s view of policing.

But if the election of Mr. Trump was a counterprotest against Black Lives Matter, there were no signs that protest leaders planned to turn down the volume. Activists like Charlene Carruthers, the national director of Black Youth Project 100, said this week that they were reeling from Mr. Trump’s election and were preparing to strongly oppose his policies.

“We are now facing a presidential administration that not only does not value black people’s lives,” Ms. Carruthers said, “but will promote and support policies that will actively make our lives worse and kill more people.”James Ransom

When you call Dorie Greenspan to say you’re coming over, this is what she bakes. “It takes longer to preheat the oven than to put these cookies together,” she wrote to me. “I love them for a million reasons, but chiefly because they’re a simple pleasure that can be shared on the spur of the moment.”

Dorie learned the recipe from Martine Collet, one of her oldest friends in Paris and couldn’t quite believe it. There are only three ingredients: egg, almond, and sugar, simply stirred together—and in very uncookielike fashion, no flour or butter.

It’s not entirely clear how these three ingredients become a cookie, but between the handy glue of egg and sugar, the architectural advantages of sliced almonds, and the crispability of all of the above, they do. “It's a miracle of a recipe in that it's delicious, of course; beautiful, in a higgledy-piggledy never-perfect way; and a snap to make,” Dorie says.

Bobbi Lin

But beyond the fact that this exercise in minimalism just happens to work, it tastes like so much more than just these three ingredients and this care-free technique; there are warm, toasty caramel notes and a sweet vanillalike scent.

There’s a wild array of textures: the shattering, airy crunch of meringue at the edges and the softer one of toasted almonds with rolling bubbles and pockets skittering across the surface. They’re more relaxed than a Florentine, more lightweight than a brittle. And they’re altogether really lovely over a cup of coffee with an old friend.

Beyond this come on over! scenario, Dorie also recommends these first for someone who’s never baked before. “They’re an easy treat for anyone to share in an act of #cookiesandkindness. And who doesn’t love—and need—a lot of cookies and a little kindness now?”

Once cooled, I’ve found they also travel and store extremely well (if it’s not too humid, that is); I’m still taste-testing the last of a big batch I baked three weeks ago, just to explore their magical powers further. So bake and share them freely, with your Valentine, your office, your kids’ teachers, your mail carrier, your barista, your dentist.

Makes 20 cookiesHouse Oversight Committee Chairman(R-Utah) said Tuesday that his panel won't investigate the circumstances that led to Michael Flynn stepping down Monday as President Trump's national security adviser.

"I think that situation has taken care of itself. I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue," Chaffetz told reporters.

"I think he did the right thing stepping down."

ADVERTISEMENT The Washington Post reported Monday night that then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates had warned the White House counsel before Trump fired her last month that Flynn had misled the public about his communications with the Russian ambassador after the Obama administration announced sanctions in response to election-related hacking.

Flynn stepped down from his post within hours after the report was published, saying in his resignation letter that he "inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador."

Law enforcement agencies discovered Flynn's communications during routine surveillance of the Russian ambassador.

Chaffetz said that sensitive intelligence methods fall to the House Intelligence Committee, rather than his House Oversight Committee.



But House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) indicated Tuesday that he doesn't plan to launch a separate investigation of Flynn. Nunes cited executive privilege, according to CNN Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, called for a full classified briefing about the circumstances leading to Flynn's departure from all the relevant agencies. "Now, we in Congress need to know who authorized his actions, permitted them, and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks. We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security," Cummings said in a joint statement with Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Last week, attendees at a Chaffetz town hall in Utah chanted, "Do your job!" — a call for Chaffetz to launch probes of the Trump administration. "It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation-state like that. It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee," Chaffetz said.

Instead, Chaffetz deferred to the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating Russia's attempt to influence the presidential elections, a scope that includes campaign communications with the Russian government.Need help getting along with partners, relatives, co-workers, and people in general?

President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday — the fourth visit by a foreign leader, less than four weeks into the new administration.

At their joint press conference, it was clear that U.S-Israel relations are once again on solid ground, after eight years of hostility from the Obama administration. Not only were relations restored to their customary warmth, but the two leaders also indicated five new directions for future policy.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

1. The two-state solution is no longer the only option. President Trump said that while the two-state solution once seemed “easier,” he was also open to a one-state solution — presumably meaning Israeli annexation of the West Bank — and that he would accept whatever solution Israelis and Palestinians themselves chose. An Israeli journalist challenged Netanyahu as to whether he still accepted the two-state solution. He replied that his goal was not a “label,” but a peace in which Palestinians recognized the Jewish state, and where Israel had full security control of the area west of the Jordan River. The shift from “two states at any price” is a fundamental change in U.S. policy and places new (and overdue) pressure on the Palestinians.

A new era.

New ideas.

No need for 3rd Palestinian state beyond Jordan & Gaza.

Big day for Israelis & reasonable Arabs.

Congrats. — Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) February 15, 2017

2. The U.S. opposes new settlements, but accepts existing ones. Trump asked Netanyahu, publicly, to “hold back” on settlements (to which Netanyahu joked, “That’s the art of the deal”). The implication is that the U.S. now accepts existing Israeli settlements. That is a stark contrast to the attitude of the Obama administration, which argued that the entire Israeli presence across the 1949 armistice lines — including the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem — was illegal. The settlements will no longer be regarded by the U.S. as an excuse for Palestinians to avoid negotiations and concessions.

3. The U.S. and Israel will aim at a regional peace involving Arab states. Netanyahu mentioned that plan, which the two leaders had apparently discussed in private. The rise of Iran as a regional aggressor has certainly created common interests between Israel and Sunni regimes like Saudi Arabia, but Netanyahu’s suggestion that those common interests could become formal alliances, under American leadership, was a new direction. Trump seemed to be on board with the idea as well.

4. Both countries are now focused on “radical Islamic terror.” Netanyahu explicitly thanked Trump for identifying the enemy clearly (which President Barack Obama refused to do throughout his time in office). It is a definition that takes in Sunni terror groups as well as state-sponsored Iranian terror. Both also criticized the “one-sided” treatment of Israel by the United nations, and both expressed a shared opposition to any attempts to boycott Israel, at the UN and in other forums.

5. The relationships between the U.S. and Israeli governments are warm, and personal. One of the most powerful moments in the press conference was when Israeli journalist Moav Vardi challenged Trump’s campaign rhetoric and implied that he was responsible for an alleged spike in antisemitism in the U.S., accusing him of “xenophobia, and maybe racist, tones.” Trump answered rather vaguely, referring to divisions in the country as a whole; pointing out his Jewish son-in-law and grandchildren; and promising: “You’re going to see a lot of love.” But Netanyahu went out of his way to defend the U.S. president: “I’ve known President Trump for many years … There is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest.” Trump looked, and sounded, genuinely appreciative.

In its annual letter published Tuesday, the Gates Foundation reports on the impact of its initiative to get contraception into the hands of women around the world. Placing contraceptives alongside vaccines as “one of the greatest lifesaving innovations in history,” Bill and Melinda Gates write that 300 million women in “developing countries” now have access to modern contraception, about a 50 percent increase from 13 years ago.

Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.



The foundation is part of Family Planning 2020, a coalition of government agencies that seeks to get contraception access for 390 million women in the developing world by 2020. Meeting that goal is essential to a lot more than women’s personal and economic empowerment: It would be a giant step toward mitigating global poverty. “No country in the last 50 years has emerged from poverty without expanding access to contraceptives,” the letter states, because the ability to avoid or space out pregnancies allows families to keep their kids in school, earn more income, and require less financial assistance from the government.

Melinda Gates attributes her own personal and professional success to birth control in a companion essay she published in Fortune. “It's no accident that my three kids were born three years apart—or that I didn't have my first child until I'd finished graduate school and devoted a decade to my career at Microsoft,” Gates writes. “My family, my career, my life as I know it are all the direct result of contraceptives.”

But outside the U.S. and other wealthy nations with advanced medical systems and reproductive health care, access to birth control can be “a matter of life and death,” Gates writes, crediting family-planning services with keeping 124,000 women alive in 2016. Without reliable contraception, women and children are less likely to be healthy and more likely to perish during or after childbirth. In the areas where the Gates Foundation focuses its work, spacing out children by at least three years doubles the chance of a child’s survival to age 1.

In a better world, this kind of unambiguous data would engender widespread support for programs that give women the resources they need to determine for themselves when, whether, and how they give birth. In our actual world, Donald Trump reinstated and expanded the global gag rule, which cuts U.S. funding from any foreign organization that provides abortion care, information, or referrals, even though U.S. aid already can’t go toward abortion care itself. This means some of the world’s most comprehensive, far-reaching programs in the reproductive health sphere are now ineligible for U.S. aid money. Previous research has connected the rule to spikes in unplanned pregnancies and, ironically, abortion rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Gates’ essay predicts that Trump’s reinstatement of the gag rule will bump up the number of women who want to prevent pregnancy but don’t have access to contraception, a statistic that currently sits at 225 million women worldwide.

There are some novel products and programs that show promise in tackling that gap. A Pathfinder International initiative in Burkina Faso to supply clinics with and educate women about intrauterine devices has been so successful, the organization recently received two grants—nearly $10 million in total—from the Gates Foundation to study how best to arm women in several countries with the family-planning tools they need.* The foundation’s annual letter also expresses excitement for a new injectable contraceptive that rural women can administer themselves, providing protection from pregnancy for three months at a time. Proponents of the global gag rule will be happy to know that such advances in contraception technology and access have at least one desired effect that abortion restrictions don’t: lower rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortion.Years from now, when we look back on Bill Clinton's presidency, its defining moment may well be Clinton's rationalization to the grand jury about why he wasn't lying when he said to his top aides that with respect to Monica Lewinsky, "there's nothing going on between us." How can this be? Here's what Clinton told the grand jury (according to footnote 1,128 in Starr's report):

"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the--if he--if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not--that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement....Now, if someone had asked me on that day, are you having any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, that is, asked me a question in the present tense, I would have said no. And it would have been completely true."

The distinction between "is" and "was" was seized on by the commentariat when Clinton told Jim Lehrer of PBS right after the Lewinsky story broke, "There is no improper relationship." Chatterbox confesses that at the time he thought all these beltway domes were hyperanalyzing, and in need of a little fresh air. But it turns out they were right: Bill Clinton really is a guy who's willing to think carefully about "what the meaning of the word 'is' is." This is way beyond slick. Perhaps we should start calling him, "Existential Willie."Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images

President Trump’s view of the media is well-documented. Advancing his administration's explicit strategy of treating the press like the opposition party, Trump said during Thursday’s press conference, “I haven’t seen more dishonest media than the political media.” But this time, Trump went beyond merely bashing the Fourth Estate writ large: He offered his criticisms outlet by outlet, reporter by reporter.

What did the media critic in chief sound like?

In response to CNN’s Jim Acosta asking how Trump could insist the New York Times story about his aids being in communication with Russian intelligence could be false while simultaneously insisting the leaks are real (and dangerous):

You look at your show that goes on at 10 in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings, but the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth. The hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this, I watch it. I see it. I am amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around and start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. I think you would do much better by being different.

Tomorrow the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump Rants and Raves.” I'm not ranting and raving.

In response to hearing BBC reporter Jon Sopel's British accent:

Trump: Where are you from?

Reporter: The BBC.

Trump: Here’s another beauty.

Reporter: It’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair.

Trump: Yeah, sure. Just like CNN. Right.

After saying he wanted to find a “friendly reporter” and then calling on a reporter for Ami Magazine, which caters to the Orthodox Jewish community:

Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.

After the reporter asked a question about how the government would address anti-Semitism:

He said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not. It's not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. OK, sit down.

In response to a question in which a reporter asked him to talk about “what first lady Melania Trump does for the country” and what the reopening of the White House Visitors Office “means” to Trump when there’s “a unique level of interest in your administration”:

Trump: Now that’s what I call a nice question. That is very nice. Who are you with?

Reporter: UNF News. It’s an independent—

Trump: Then I’m going to start watching.

After calling on April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks:

Trump: This is going to be a bad question. But that’s OK.

Reporter: No, it’s not going to be a bad question.

Trump: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.

After Ryan asked about Trump’s plan for “inner cities” and his executive order on historically black colleges and universities to be signed in the afternoon:

Trump: That was very professional and very good.

Reporter: I’m very professional.

Trump also paused to compliment his current favorite morning show:Immigration authorities last week arrested 680 people who were in the United States illegally, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said in a statement Monday.

The raids in at least a dozen states, which marked the Trump administration’s first large-scale crackdown on people living in the United States illegally, set off a wave of panic and protest in immigrant communities over the weekend and sparked questions from immigration advocates as to whether the arrestees posed legitimate threats to public safety.

DHS, which overseas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said Monday that approximately 75 percent of those arrested were “criminal aliens,” including some who had been convicted of crimes such as homicide, sexual assault of a minor and drug trafficking.

Asked to provide further clarification, a DHS official confirmed that the term “criminal aliens” includes anyone who had entered the United States illegally or overstayed or violated the terms of a visa. There are an estimated 11 million people in the United States who fit that profile.

ICE declined to provide the names and locations of those who were detained in the raids, nor would the agency say how many of the 680 people had committed serious crimes.

Field offices in Los Angeles, San Antonio, Chicago, Atlanta and New York City released a total of 15 examples of people ICE took into custody last week, including one who was a “self-admitted MS-13 gang member” and one who was wanted for murder and attempted murder in Mexico. Seven had prior convictions for sexual assault or for lewd or indecent acts with a child, and three, including the gang member, had convictions for drug trafficking or distribution.

ICE carried out the arrests in New York, California, Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin. Of those, about a quarter had no prior convictions.

ICE has characterized the raids as routine, but immigrant rights groups said the actions were out of the ordinary and that most of those swept up were not dangerous. They said ICE also handled the detentions — which activists described as playing out in homes, on the side of the road and outside workplaces — differently from how the agency had in the latter years of the Obama administration, and accused the government of sowing fear among the immigrant ­community.

“This is not normal,” Sulma Arias, field director for the Center for Community Change, said in a teleconference with reporters Monday, calling it a “horrific overreach that will destroy families and undermine the American Dream for thousands.”

The Center for Migration Studies of New York, a think tank that favors immigration, says there are about 3.3 million households in the United States that contain both legal and illegal residents. Most of those homes have U.S. citizens, including 5.7 million ­U.S.-born children.

Obama, who deported more people than any president, in his second term prioritized deportations to target public safety threats over other people with less-serious criminal violations.

More than 90 percent of those deported from the United States during the past fiscal year had been convicted of what DHS considers serious crimes, according to a Migration Policy Institute study. Activists say ICE also tended to detain people at night, which was often terrifying but less public.

“The Obama administration shied away from big displays of enforcement because it would alienate their base. For Trump, it is red meat for his supporters and fulfills a campaign pledge,” said J. Kevin Appleby, senior director of international migration policy for the Center for Migration ­Studies of New York.

Thousands of immigrants and activists rallied outside the Milwaukee County courthouse in Wisconsin on Monday for a “Day Without Latinos, Immigrants and Refugees.” The event was designed to demonstrate how integral the groups are to the nation’s social and economic fabric.Mr. Trump’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is facing a revolt by E.P.A. employees scrambling to block him. Ms. Collins declared her opposition to him Wednesday.

Republicans blamed Democratic obstruction, not the quality of the president’s choices, for the arduous confirmation process.

“I think when you have to put all this energy into an unreasonable nominations process, it takes away the energy that could better be used for other things,” Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said.

Democrats cheered Mr. Puzder’s withdrawal as a victory for working Americans. The Labor Department regulates workplace safety, enforces wage and hour laws, maintains unemployment and payroll data, and is generally seen as an advocate for workers. Mr. Puzder, at the helm of his fast-food company, ardently opposed the Affordable Care Act, cast a skeptical eye on minimum wage and overtime rules, and pledged an assault on regulations that he said in his withdrawal statement would “put America’s workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity.”

Some critics also cast him as sexist, denouncing fast-food advertisements he championed that featured bikini-clad women eating monstrous hamburgers.

“The simple truth is that, given his relationship to employees at the companies he runs, he was not fit to lead a department responsible for defending workers’ rights,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.

Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Trump to nominate someone who supported the rights of workers rather than suppressed them.

“Puzder should never have even been nominated to lead the Labor Department, and Senate Republicans clearly recognized this, too,” Mr. Schumer said. “The fact that someone so anti-labor was even nominated shows how far President Trump is from where he campaigned.”

As the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. fast-food chains, Mr. Puzder had come under intense criticism from Democrats and liberal groups that accused him of mistreating his workers and supporting automation in the workplace. The intense scrutiny of his personal life compounded his troubles.

His hearing was repeatedly delayed as he sought to extricate himself from his business and investments. Democrats, who organized screenings of the video of his wife detailing her allegations of abuse, were preparing to make his marriage an issue and to question him about his company’s salacious TV ads. However, as recently as last week, he had said through a spokesman that he was “all in” to move forward.

Despite the growing backlash, the White House and Republican leaders tried to rally support around him last week, arguing that no nominee was perfect.

“I think Andy Puzder is an outstanding choice,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who counted himself a friend of Mr. Puzder’s. “We’re always looking for nominees who have never made a mistake. Frequently, it’s impossible to find nominees who have never made a mistake.”

Republicans quietly acknowledged the setback as they saluted Mr. Puzder.

“Andy Puzder has the experience and ability to make an excellent labor secretary, but I respect his decision,” said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the labor committee.

Mr. Trump ignored questions about Mr. Puzder after a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday afternoon, but he will be under pressure to quickly find a replacement.

While labor groups and supporters of a higher minimum wage opposed Mr. Puzder, some in corporate America had been optimistic that he would understand the plight of businesses and relieve companies of regulations.

The National Restaurant Association, the industry’s lobbying group and one of Mr. Puzder’s biggest backers, lamented his treatment on Wednesday and expressed hope that Mr. Trump would choose someone else in his mold.

“It is extremely unfortunate that the confirmation process has resulted in a qualified and dedicated man withdrawing from the labor secretary nomination,” said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the association. “We hope that President Trump’s next labor secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy.”

Jim Talent, a former Missouri senator, had been helping prepare Mr. Puzder for his confirmation hearing and said he was ready to answer the questions about his family and his business record. After it became clear to Mr. Puzder that he did not have sufficient Republican support, Mr. Talent said, he decided to drop out.

“Nobody likes a process where you’re attacked all the time,” Mr. Talent said. “He was looking forward to being able to address these concerns, particularly the ones about his family.”But some more well-known institutions weren’t far behind. At Bennington College in Vermont, over 48 percent of former students were earning less than $25,000 per year. A quarter were earning less than $10,600 per year. At Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, the median annual earnings were only $35,700. Results at the University of New Mexico were almost exactly the same.

The data reveals how much money students are borrowing in exchange for earnings after graduation. While U.C.L.A. and Penn State are both prestigious public research universities, recent U.C.L.A. grads leave with about 30 percent less debt, even as their predecessors are earning about 30 percent more money than counterparts at Penn State. Harvard students borrow barely a quarter of what Brandeis students take on, and earn nearly twice as much.

The return is unequal in other ways. There is an earnings gender gap at every top university. The size of the difference varies a great deal. At Duke, for example, women earned $93,100 per year on average, compared with $123,000 for men, a difference of $29,900. At Princeton, men earned more and women earned less, for a difference of $47,700. Women who enrolled at Cornell earned more than women who enrolled at Yale.

The Gender Earnings Gap at Elite Colleges Women who enrolled at elite colleges are making less than their male counterparts. The gap is largest at M.I.T.: $58,100. Women who enrolled at Harvard are making as much as men who enrolled at Tufts.

Defining higher education in purely economic terms risks exacerbating what some have described as the corporatization of the modern university. People get a lot more out of college than earnings potential. They learn to be better citizens and better human beings. The world needs dancers and poets along with the future investment bankers and tech entrepreneurs streaming out of elite schools.

The problem is that the dancers and poets are paying the same, ever-rising tuition, even though the necessary cost of running a good poetry program is probably not much more than it was in earlier times when college tuition was much less expensive than it is today. And you can’t pay your student loans back with citizenship — only dollars will do.

Colleges can ameliorate this problem by providing need-based financial aid to low-income students, reducing their debt burden and likelihood of loan default. The new data indicates that some colleges are more successful with this strategy than others.

At the University of Cincinnati, a third of low-income students (from households earning less than $30,000 per year) had failed to pay back any of their student loans five years after graduation. At the University of Alabama, the number was roughly a quarter; at Wayne State University in Detroit, over 40 percent. At the for-profit University of Phoenix, nearly two-thirds of poor students are in these dire straits.

It will take time for the raft of new federal earnings data to seep into the complex reputational ecosystem that continues to govern the higher education market. But this new bottom line will eventually become a permanent aspect of how colleges of all kinds are understood.Oscar Ramirez and Thermon Brewster walked out of the Rising Hope United Methodist Mission Church just before 7 a.m. — when those who sleep at its homeless shelter must leave for the day.

Outside the church in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County, Va., U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were waiting.

As the two men and others crossed the street toward a shopping center on Feb. 8, about a dozen ICE agents ordered them up against the wall of a grocery store, questioning them about their immigration status. According to Ramirez and Brewster, the ICE agents then indiscriminately arrested seven of the homeless men — all of them Hispanic — and packed them into a van full of other detainees.

ICE tells it differently: An ICE official said officers approached the group, questioned them about a “potential target” and arrested two men, including a legal permanent resident of the United States. Both had been identified in the shopping center parking lot as “criminal aliens amenable to removable”— meaning deportation.

(Alice Li/The Washington Post)

The U.S. government said the series of ICE raids last week netted at least 683 “criminal aliens,” the first major immigration enforcement wave under President Trump. But a growing chorus of activists, lawyers and lawmakers have pointed to a sharp discrepancy between what ICE says it is doing and what immigrant families are seeing and reporting in cities across the nation.

[Federal agents conduct immigration enforcement raids in at least six states]

In Chicago, a student called her high school teacher to tell him that ICE had raided her home the night before, arresting her father, an undocumented immigrant whose criminal record included only traffic violations, the teacher said. In Centreville, Va., a woman told officials at London Towne Elementary School that a student’s father had been arrested after dropping their son off at school that morning. And in the Baltimore parking lot of a Walgreens, ICE agents arrested a barber and a local business owner who advocates said also had no criminal records.

The reports of seemingly random arrests, of ICE agents appearing during the day outside schools, shelters and apartment blocks, have sent a palpable wave of fear through the nation’s immigrant communities.

“I have never seen the immigrant community, both the lawfully and unlawfully present, with a greater amount of fear than I have in recent weeks,” said Faye Kolly, an attorney in Austin.

[This undocumented immigrant just announced that she is seeking sanctuary at a church. Now she waits.]

On Thursday, the agency’s top officials traveled to Capitol Hill to meet with members of Congress, some of whom had requested a briefing on the immigration enforcement actions. According to lawmakers present, ICE officials acknowledged that at least 186 of those apprehended in recent days had no criminal history.

“It was hard to not leave that meeting and believe that the Trump administration is going to target as many immigrants as possible,” said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), who attended the meeting. “The only hesitation they seem to have was whether they would go after DACA recipients,” Castro said, referring to the thousands of young people who came to the United States as minors and were granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals under the Obama administration so they could pursue education and work opportunities.

ICE has arrested at least one DACA recipient during the raids. ICE says the man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, is a gang member.

Virginia State Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) accused ICE of engaging in “Gestapo-style” tactics that amount to racial profiling. Some immigrants have been locking themselves in their homes, wary of opening their doors for any visitors; others have kept their children out of school or stopped showing up at work. Supporters protested Thursday, some skipping work, to show the impact of what the nation would be like without immigrants.

[Restaurants, schools close in ‘Day Without Immigrants’ protest]

ICE has repeatedly emphasized that agents are targeting dangerous criminals who are living in the United States illegally, as the agency did under President Barack Obama. But the agency has declined to identify any of the people who were arrested and has provided fewer than 20 examples of those swept up in the raids who had been charged with or previously convicted of violent or sexual crimes. ICE officials also declined to say how many people the agency arrested in Virginia and Maryland during operations last week and why ICE failed to mention those operations in its earlier acknowledgment of the operations nationwide.

“They’re doing street sweeps,” Surovell said. “Accosting groups of random people in public.”

ICE has denied that its officers have engaged in any “sweeps” or checkpoints, widespread allegations that have frightened immigrant communities from Raleigh, N.C., to Los Angeles. “Reports of ICE checkpoints and sweeps or ‘roundups’ are false, dangerous and irresponsible,” ICE tweeted.

In Austin, where immigration officials detained more than 50 people, news of “raids” quickly spread through immigrant neighborhoods after a bystander captured cellphone video of one of the first detentions and shared it on social media.

Carlos González Gutiérrez, Austin’s consul general of Mexico, visits ICE detention centers each day to provide legal support and interview Mexican nationals held in detention. On a typical day, he said, he talks to between one and three immigrants who have been detained. When he arrived last Thursday, he found 14 Mexican nationals in custody. On Friday, there were 30.

“There are cases of mistaken identity, cases of people who were passengers in cars that were pulled over, cases of people who are married to U.S. citizens and who have children who are born and live in this country,” said Gutiérrez, who has spoken with many of those detained in Austin. “It is pretty devastating what happens to the families that were caught in these nets. The destruction that comes after one of these operations is astounding.”

A government social worker for Durham County, N.C., said that the number of Hispanic residents seeking assistance had dropped off rapidly in recent days amid swirling rumors about an ICE checkpoint at a Durham intersection and ICE agents making arrests in a supermarket parking lot.

“Today, I haven’t gotten one Hispanic client in the entire check-in today,” said the social worker, a longtime government employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “That never happens … They think that when they come here for assistance, that they’re going to be on some sort of invisible list.”

Rumors of raids and checkpoints — which ICE officials have denied — have residents of Virginia’s immigrant-rich Culmore neighborhood on edge. The cluster of apartment buildings off Route 7 in Northern Virginia house hundreds of immigrants, many of whom do not have legal status.

Rumors have gripped the imagination of neighbors here, forcing families indoors and being vigilant of any law enforcement patrolling their streets. Doors typically open to neighbors and passersby drawn by the smell of pupusas or rice are now closed and locked. Knocks at the front door trigger terror, and occupants are asking visitors to identify themselves first before opening the door.

One resident, Ulises Martinez, said neighbors are furiously exchanging text messages about officers with dogs stopping people on street corners, but none of those reports has been confirmed. When his neighbor, a teenager, came by and knocked, Martinez asked who it was. The cheeky teen responded saying “Me” in Spanish and half-joking.

But Martinez was serious.

“Who is ‘me?’,” he said, peering hard through the dirty peephole.

Women in the U.S. continue to have children later and later in their lives, with the average woman approaching 30 for her first pregnancy. With more advanced motherhood has comes better average wages and educational levels for the mothers, alongside anxiety over riskier pregnancies. But a new study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology challenges the conventional wisdom that being an older mother is bad for the baby and indicates that, in a shift from previous research, children born to older mothers today may be more likely to perform well cognitively.

The study authors posit that the children of older mothers performed better because the mothers tended to be wealthier and more educated. The study, which divided women into age ranges of 25 to 29 and 35 to 39, found that the older women who gave birth in 2000–02 had children who performed better on tests. (The children were tested when 10 or 11 years old.) These studies are surprising when compared to similar studies done in 1958 and 1970, which found that children born to older mothers performed slightly worse. This study does not invalidate those studies but instead may point to changing educational and financial trends for women in the U.K., where the research was conducted.

More advanced maternal age is still associated with a greater chance of genetic defects, and having a first child over the age of 35 is associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications. But these concerns focus on the health of babies before and at birth, not on their health and development afterward, which can become entangled with external factors. Cognitive ability, which includes problem solving and memory abilities, has been shown to be hampered by poverty. This may be because poorer families tend to experience more stress, while wealthier families can afford healthier food and proper medical care, as well as more time to spend with their children and the resources for books and educational toys and other forms of mental stimulation. It makes sense, then, that because older mothers tend to have greater resources, they could therefore also have children more likely to perform well on tests of cognitive function.Although it is at the forefront of any discussion about security today, ransomware has only been a major part of the malware scene since 2014. The threat is still evolving, and IT professionals are sure to encounter even more advanced ransomware in 2017.

Tracking the Continued Rise of Ransomware in 2017

Ransomware generally revokes access to a victim’s endpoint or encrypts data on that endpoint before prompting the victim to pay a ransom to regain control. That’s the basic idea, but the devil is in the details.

These attacks have grown drastically more frequent in recent years. According to the IBM report, “Ransomware: How Consumers and Businesses Value Their Data,” 4,000 ransomware attacks occurred per day in 2016, four times more than the previous year.

Naturally, the total payout to cybercriminals has increased with the volume of attacks. The FBI reported that ransomware victims in the U.S. shelled out $209 million for their stolen data in just the first three months of 2016, a dramatic increase from the $24 million companies spent in all of 2015, according to Reuters. This growth shows no signs of slowing down.

Authorities generally advise victims not to pay the ransom, since there is no guarantee that they will receive a working decryption key. More importantly, paying the ransom funds future cybercriminal endeavors. Ransomware victims should resolve to slow this progress by refusing to pay for stolen files in 2017.

Consumers Versus Enterprise Users

Consumers in general may be unaware of the threat they face. Just 31 percent of consumers have specifically heard about ransomware, according to the IBM report. This creates a long-term problem when consumer actions are factored into a threat model because those consumers are less likely to know best practices for protecting data. IT experts must increase their efforts to educate people about ransomware as the threat landscape expands.

Enterprise users are, in general, much better informed about ransomware. The same survey found that 46 percent of executives had experienced ransomware attacks in the workplace and 70 percent of those executives paid to recover their stolen data. Larger enterprises are also more likely to train workers about IT security.

Social Engineering Going Strong in 2017

Most ransomware schemes depend on social engineering ploys to trick victims into activating the malware. This strategy served fraudsters well, so it’s safe to assume they’ll continue to employ it in 2017 and beyond. To mitigate the threat of an infection via social engineering, consumers should never open attachments from untrusted or unknown email.

Companies can implement policies to minimize actions that could lead to infections, but this is complicated by the legitimate need to frequently open attachments in a business setting. Many organizations would benefit from blocking Microsoft Office macros, because these are particularly popular vehicles for malware.

Not all attacks require user action to be implemented, however. Drive-by infections lurk in specially crafted pop-up advertisements. All a victim has to do is view a seemingly innocuous webpage. With social engineering, fraudsters like to keep it simple.

Low-Hanging Fruit

Ransomware typically targets the lowest hanging fruit. Cybercriminals are particularly well-versed in exploiting Windows vulnerabilities, for example. This malware does not need to infiltrate your entire system for long-term access; it simply needs a gateway to access your data, which doesn’t require advanced tools. Windows users have many default privileges that can be exploited to allow total access.

Ransomware will almost surely continue to grow in volume and complexity in 2017. Security analysts should keep an eye on the evolution of ransomware, which may bring advanced attacks, such as ransomworms, in the near future.Netflix

This article originally appeared in Vulture.

Sheila Hammond, freshly zombified, seems like a brand-new woman. A real-estate agent, wife, and mother, she’s long adhered to the whole suburban-mom thing: green smoothies for breakfast, a closet full of monochromatic business attire, SAT prep on weekends. But then she comes down with something. She vomits buckets of green goo and coughs up what looks like a small organ. She “dies,” then immediately wakes up. She’s renewed, rejuvenated, and hungry for the delicacies she’s long deprived herself of—not the human flesh she now needs to survive, but spontaneous sex, nights out, morning jogs, a Range Rover.

“I don’t feel dead or undead,” she tells her family and the neighbor boy who diagnoses her. “I feel the opposite: totally alive.”

Santa Clarita Diet wisely shrouds Sheila’s transformation in mystery. Something about a Serbian curse and earlier-reported cases lend a mythology to her condition, but don’t hamper its implications. This is the story of a family grappling with their matriarch’s newly discovered agency. And, more importantly, it’s about how her husband can’t really deal with the sudden shift in the status quo.

Drew Barrymore is Sheila, whose sunny, natural charm makes for a surprisingly compelling suburban “Mombie.” Timothy Olyphant plays her husband, Joel, and though he at first seems a little out of place, his manic, nervous outbursts eventually snap into focus. We see Joel for the insecure, at times downright-pathetic guy he’s become: the type who smokes weed in parking lots and dresses in cargo shorts. Sheila’s zombification is a confrontation for him. Her revived thirst for life is a threat to his apathy.

After Joel befriends a drug dealer he meant to kill for Sheila’s supper, he opens up about how he got to where he is. Joel and Sheila were high-school sweethearts, prom king and queen. They got married, he putzed around for a while—learned guitar, tried improv—but got serious with the arrival of their daughter.

“My wife is a realtor. I wake up one day … and so am I,” he says despondently. “It’s just not where I saw my life going.”

When Joel let’s the drug dealer go, an angry Sheila belittles his life trajectory, citing Joel’s pot smoking and gullibility as culprits for his poor judgment. Though it goes unsaid, this conversation seems to spark something in Joel, who later embarks on the solo mission of finding a cure for his wife’s ailment. She goes on with her life, reveling in her newfound popularity, outspokenness, and strengthened relationship with her daughter. While Sheila finds power in her situation, Joel works to squash it.

Sexual jealousy, also a recurring theme, highlights Joel’s discomfort with Sheila’s newfound agency. In the pilot, a co-worker Gary (Nathan Fillion) attempts to both put the moves on Sheila and steal one of her clients. Joel confronts him in a bar, but backs out before a fight breaks loose. Later, Sheila kills Gary in her garden and eats his stomach. The shift in the expected power play casts a shadow on their marriage, as evidenced later in the season when Sheila befriends a man she bit and transformed. Joel, openly uncomfortable with her new cohort, demands to see Sheila’s texts. “It’s just hard to see you connecting with someone when you and I haven’t exactly been burning up the bed sheets,” Joel says, blaming her for both making a friend and shelving their sex life.

Tensions between the couple climax when, in the season finale, Sheila asks Joel how he’d kill her if it ever came to that. “I’d bash your brains in with a baseball bat,” he admits, as if he’s thought about it. A horror-struck Sheila, expecting something “romantic” like a single gunshot to the head, points out the anger in Joel’s response.

“Where is that coming from?” she asks.

“That’s how they kill the undead in movies,” he responds, trying to move on. But Sheila’s onto something—there is anger in their relationship, as well as resentment. She hasn’t just touched on something: She’s fully pinched a nerve.

Santa Clarita Diet continually returns to the idea of how suspiciously men regard positive female transformation. And more than just showing the dichotomy between suburban men and women, Diet works to subvert the idea that wives should be pretty, quiet things while the husbands win bread. The women behave badly—have affairs with hot oncologists, set off smoke bombs, make threats to rude teachers—while the men embroil themselves in unnecessary crime and chaos, and wind up dead. Though Sheila ends the season in literal chains—she asks Abby to lock her in the basement in case her primal side takes over—she’s finally free of the rigor of a life that expected her to pipe down and take what comes.

Joel, meanwhile, is incarcerated for his pursuit of her cure. At what appears to be a psych ward, he babbles to his doctor about the ways Sheila’s transformation has pushed him to try new things. “When I look back at my life just three weeks ago, I think maybe I was the dead one,” he says with a laugh, before a look of dreadful realization takes hold of his face.Local Catholic Charities agencies are scrambling to save staff jobs as they respond to President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily suspending the country's refugee resettlement program.

Although the order remains on hold after a three-judge federal appeals court panel Feb. 8 denied a government request to overturn a temporary restraining order against Trump's action, agencies across the country are shifting staffers into other programs should the courts reinstate the resettlement ban or the administration issues a new order.

Dominican Sister Donna Markham, CEO and president of Catholic Charities USA, said up to 700 workers are affected in some way by the order, with many of them losing their jobs.

Sister Markham and her national staff at Catholic Charities USA's Alexandria, Virginia, headquarters are so concerned for the workers and the refugees they serve that the agency launched a campaign Feb. 2 to raise $8 million to save jobs in 80 dioceses nationwide.

"It's a mess. It's just a mess. If we're talking about American jobs, this is laying off people in these public-private partnerships," Sister Markham told Catholic News Service.

"We'd like to see if we can raise $8 million to make a dent in (the impact on) some of these jobs so we can retain some of these positions to continue the programming for those already here," Sister Markham said.

Trump's executive order, signed Jan. 27, suspended the entire refugee resettlement program for 120 days and banned entry of all citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries — Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia — for 90 days. Another clause in the order established religious criteria for refugees, proposing to give priority to religious minorities over others who may have equally compelling refugee claims.

It also capped the number of refugees entering the country during fiscal year 2017, which ends Sept. 30, at 50,000, down from the ceiling of 110,000 set by Barack Obama's administration.

Nearly 30,000 refugees have been admitted since the start of the fiscal year Oct. 1, the Department of State reported.

The resettlement program in the Diocese of Portland, Maine, will be among those most severely affected.

The agency originally expected to resettle 685 refugees during the current fiscal year, but could see that number reduced by more than half, said Judy Katzel, chief communications and development officer for Catholic Charities Maine. The agency has 24 full-time and part-time case managers, aids and administrative employees. It is the only organization in Maine that resettles refugees.

"We are working very hard how to maintain our staff during this four-month waiting period," Katzel said.

"If they cut it to 340 (refugees) or so, of which we've already resettled 218, we would be facing potentially having to lay off half (of the staff)," she said. "As much as our mission is to welcome the stranger and welcome the refugee population, we want to look very hard to keep our staff intact as best we can."

At Catholic Charities Maine, like agencies across the country, workers are responsible for assisting refugees beyond their arrival day. They work with the new arrivals for months afterward, helping them with housing, budgeting, adjustment to American life, job training and placement, and learning English. In many cases, staffers were once refugees themselves.

Catholic Charities leaders said they are hoping to avoid layoffs through reassignments to other departments or by raising their own funds to allow staffers to continue in their roles. They expressed concern that staffing cuts will make it difficult to get back up to speed when the refugee pipeline reopens.

More so, diocesan officials said, staff members remain upbeat, focusing more on the plight of refugees fleeing war, violence and discrimination than being concerned about their own jobs.

"Our main concern is the refugees. That's where our hearts are. That's where our prayers are. We want to be able to continue the work when the 120 days are up," said Heidi Smith, director of refugee services in the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.

Smith said layoffs are being considered, but that she and her staff are working to avoid them. She told CNS that her staffing level is lower than what is needed to resettle the 676 new arrivals they were expecting under the ceiling set before Trump's inauguration.

"For the staff members on the front end of the arrival process, we're looking at ways we can use them" including in advocacy for and education about the resettlement program at parishes, schools and businesses, she said.

In Boston, Marjean Perhot, director of refugee and immigration services for the archdiocesan Catholic Charities system, is operating in a "wait-and-see" mode.

"We still don't know, once (the ban) is totally lifted if the number of refugee arrivals is not what we anticipated. We're still going to have to look at how we're going to keep a full complement of staff," she said.

Boston is slated to resettle about 200 refugees during the current fiscal year. The State Department has set a lower number in Boston than in many other locales such as Maine because of the high cost of living in eastern Massachusetts.

Through Feb. 10, Boston had resettled about 70 people. "We were pretty much on track to meet our projected number until these executive orders came down," Perhot said.

At Catholic Charities in the Cleveland Diocese, two of the 38 staff members are facing a layoff, said Thomas J. Mrosko, director of Migration and Refugee Services. If Trump's cuts in resettlements hold, Mrosko expects to resettle about 200 refugees rather than the 400 first expected.

"We don't want to see our program implode," he said, explaining that staff members are being reassigned so that the diocese can be up to speed quickly in four months. "We were designed to resettle more people than are coming in the future."Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

The Golden State Warriors blew a 3–1 lead in the NBA Finals. The Cleveland Indians blew a 3–1 lead in the World Series. The Atlanta Falcons blew a 28–3 lead in the Super Bowl, which is pretty much a 3–1 lead cubed, so long as you also douse the cube in kerosene, strafe it with a blowtorch, and fumble it on your own 25-yard line while protecting a 16-point cushion in the fourth quarter.

Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slate’s editorial director.

The Cleveland Cavaliers winning a title in LeBron James’ second year back in Ohio was amazing.* The Chicago Cubs winning their first World Series in 108 years was unbelievable. Tom Brady and Bill Belichick winning their fifth NFL title was … certainly something that some people will celebrate. But sports isn’t about championship dreams realized and confetti-strewn victory parades. Sports is failure. Sports is devastation. Sports is losing, horribly and painfully. Sports is your 2016–17 Atlanta Falcons, who somehow ended up on the wrong end of a 34–28 overtime defeat in the greatest, saddest Super Bowl ever played.

With six minutes to go in the third quarter, Atlanta was up by 25 points and New England had no choice but to go for it on fourth down from its own 46-yard line. It was sad, really, but what choice did the Patriots have? Matt Ryan looked like Tom Brady, and Tom Brady looked like Drew Henson. The champ couldn’t quite connect with his fleet of bearded and/or lacrosse-playing receivers, and he’d been picked off by Robert Alford, whose prancing, strutting interception return gave Atlanta a 21–0 second-quarter lead. Even when the Patriots scored to make it 28–9, Stephen Gostkowski doinked the extra point. Pity the poor Pats.

Sometimes you doink the ball, and sometimes the ball destroys your soul. With nine minutes to go and Atlanta with the ball up by 16, ESPN’s win-probability machine gave the Falcons a 99.6 percent chance to win the Super Bowl. On that very play, Atlanta running back Tevin Coleman got his ankle crunched under a pile and had to leave the game. The play after that, Ryan was sacked by Dont’a Hightower, and the Patriots recovered his fumble deep in Atlanta territory. They’d score a couple of minutes later to cut the Falcons’ lead to 28–20.

A huge lead insulates you from catastrophe. The Falcons were in such a commanding position that an improbably enormous number of things could go wrong—injuries, sacks, turnovers, ridiculous catches by men with beards—without them managing to cough up the game. Blowing a 99.6 percent chance at victory is the equivalent of losing eight consecutive coin flips. In this case, one of those coin flips was an actual coin flip. If Atlanta had won the toss in overtime, Ryan very well might have led his red-and-black brethren to victory.

But that coin just kept on coming up tails. In fairness, the Patriots made some of their own luck. Belichick, to his great credit, was willing to risk embarrassing his team to improve its odds of victory. That sad, desperation fourth-down attempt in the third quarter could’ve sunk the Patriots. It was also a whole lot smarter than a punt. New England’s will to win didn’t win it the Super Bowl, but the Pats’ relentless pressure did play a part in wearing down the Falcons. The Patriots ran 93 total plays compared with the Falcons’ 46, and New England held the ball for more than 40 minutes. The Falcons’ tired defense gave up 25 points in the fourth quarter and overtime. Atlanta’s historically great offense, meanwhile, scored zero.

Even one of the greatest receivers who’s ever received couldn’t save the Falcons. Julio Jones is so impossibly great that calling him “one of the greatest” football players in history feels like an insult. The catch he made with just less than five minutes to go in the fourth quarter was so extraordinary and so beautiful that it felt impossible that the team he graced with his presence could possibly lose.

The leap, the extension, the tapping toes, the viselike grip that nullifies any ex post facto claim that this catch was not a catch. In a game where so much depends on happenstance, Jones made luck look like a crutch for lesser athletes. But then Ryan got sacked, and then the Falcons got called for a holding penalty—tails, tails—and then Julian Edelman won the Powerball twice while getting struck by lightning.

Robert Alford, again, read Brady’s throw perfectly, jumping up to deflect the pass before it reached Edelman. This time, though, he didn’t catch the ball. With Alford’s momentum knocking him down, the pass fluttered to the ground. Edelman, who was blanketed by two other Falcons—throwing that pass up the seam was not one of Brady’s smartest decisions—reached out his right hand before the ball hit the turf, then secured it with his left by the barest of margins. It was a great play, and a skillful one. It had also been abetted somehow by a poor throw and a great defensive play. Luck can be a hell of a crutch.

The Patriots had lost a Super Bowl on a play like this. The breaks always even out, right? That’s why Boston’s major sports teams have 37 combined titles, and Atlanta’s have one.

Sports are supposed to be zero sum. There’s always a winner and a loser. But that’s not really true. Sports are negative sum. There are 32 NFL teams, and 31 of them—that’s 97 percent, Falcons fans—finish each year without the pleasure of sticking a big, fat trophy in Roger Goodell’s face. The Patriots, who’ve won five Super Bowls in the past 15 years, are not normal. The success of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick and their rotating cast of skill-position players and pass rushers and defensive backs is a crazy outlier. New England’s victory on Sunday night—one in which they overcame a 25-point deficit; the largest previous Super Bowl comeback was 10 points—was an outlier among outliers. If it’s better to be lucky than good, then being lucky and good is best of all.

And the Falcons—oh, the Falcons. When we assess the world’s greatest athletes and the world’s greatest teams, we look at a failure to win as failure full stop rather than a painful, inevitable acquiescence to reality. Victory is as ephemeral as it is abnormal. Losing is the natural state of things. But losing like this, on the biggest stage in sports, with the organization’s first title in the balance, by blowing a huge lead to a franchise that is comically (and deservedly) self-aggrandizing …

Sports is failure. Sports is devastation. Sports is losing, horribly and painfully. But sports isn’t usually as horrible and painful as this. A 25-point lead! Come on, Atlanta.Drew Angerer/Getty Images

With his pick for secretary of labor, Donald Trump appears to be extending an enormous symbolic middle finger to fast food workers who have campaigned for a higher minimum wage. The president-elect has reportedly settled on CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder, whose company owns the second-tier burger chains Hardee's and Carl's Jr., and is known as a strident critic of regulations that would increase worker pay.



Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.

Yet, if you are a liberal who has spent most of the Trump transition suffering from existential nausea, there is one very large silver lining here. Puzder may be an affront to organized labor, but he's also a very eloquent advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. Perhaps he could end up serving as a voice of reason on that issue within the new administration.

Puzder donated to Trump's campaign and served as an adviser on job creation. He's a frequent op-ed writer and TV guest who, unlike some of his fellow fast food executives, has come out hard against significant minimum wage increases and said that workers asking for $15 per hour “should really think about what they're doing.” Back in 2014, he complained that California was “artificially” raising the pay floor to $9 an hour and argued that businesses would create more jobs if government would just “get out of the way.” He's also talked openly about replacing workers with automated ordering kiosks, something his fellow fry-mongers have been more circumspect about.



That said, Puzder has offered at least some nuance on the wage issue. “The CBO came out with a report last year that said you could raise the minimum wage to about $9 without much impact to jobs. And you probably could do that,” he said during an interview with Fox Business in May. (The current federal minimum is $7.25 per hour.) But he suggested that if the U.S. were to increase the minimum wage, there should be an exception for entry-level workers and high unemployment regions. States and cities have tried somewhat similar ideas in recent years by varying their minimum wage increase geographically, or exempting teenagers.

Puzder is also a vocal critic of the Obama administration's new overtime rules, which would have extended time-and-a-half to more than 4 million American workers. In a Forbes column he argued that the new regulation “devalues this career progression and forces some businesses to turn entry-level management careers with salaries and performance-based bonuses into hourly jobs.” Defenders of the rule might argue that was the whole point, since many retail and fast food businesses were wrongly classifying low-wage workers as managers to avoid paying them overtime. In any event, it seems unlikely that reg will survive Puzder's tenure. He may not even have to do much to roll it back. In November, a federal judge blocked its implementation, and as Politico notes, it seems unlikely the Trump administration will continue defending the case.

There are other policy implications to having a fast food exec atop the Department of Labor. For one, it seems probable that investigations of wage and hour violations would ease up, since restaurant franchises are notorious for violating the Fair Labor Standards Act.*

But in most ways, Puzder seems like a standard, business-oriented conservative of the sort you might expect any Republican administration to consider for the labor post. And while that might signal a bleak four years for workers' rights advocates, there is an upside to his nomination when it comes to Trump's marquee issue: immigration. Back in July, Puzder and conservative policy maven Stephen Moore wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal supporting the Republican nominee but challenging his stance on undocumented workers. “Legal immigrants are an asset to the country,” they wrote. “We believe that deporting 11 million people is unworkable, and we hope in the end Mr. Trump comes to this same conclusion. Deportation should be pursued only when an illegal immigrant has committed a felony or become a ‘public charge.’ ”

But Puzder was even more forceful about the issue in 2013, when (as the Atlantic's David Frum points out) he backed the bipartisan immigration bill working its way through Congress, which he called “the right thing to do.” He made his comments during an event at the American Enterprise Institute, and even got a little poetic at points (by fast food CEO standards). Here's his mini-oration:

If we had immigration reform and were able to hire these people who want to work, we’d have a more diverse, incentivized and productive workforce. We’d have access to not only low-skilled workers in our business but the high skilled workers that everybody talks about. You’d have consumption from these individuals, because obviously if they’re working and they’re making money and supporting their families they’d be out there buying things. You’d really reinforce the idea that the United States is the land of opportunity, the land of entrepreneurial vision. And that could use some reinforcing. And lastly, it would remind all of us that our freedoms and our liberties shouldn’t be taken for granted. We’re actually a country that was founded on the principle that god gave us the right to pursue happiness. And there are very few nations in the world, if any, that were founded on the principle that god gave you the right to pursue happiness for yourself and your family. That’s been a beacon for immigrants for years. That’s why there are 11 million people who came here illegally. They not only came here because they could get jobs but because they could pursue that goal of fulfillment and satisfaction for themselves and their families and their children going forward. So I think this bill, and I know that’s a lot of indirect ways it effects our business and some direct ways but I think a bill like the bill that’s before Congress now could really be a benefit to the United States. Not only because the CBO says that it would be productive to GNP, our gross national product, and reduce the deficit, but because it’s the right thing to do, it’s the country that we are, it’s the people that we are, and we need to foster that image across the world and in the United States.

During the same event, he praised immigrants' work ethic and suggested the whole country might be a little better off if it looked more like California.

Our Hardee's restaurant operators in the Midwest and Southeast often use the labor force in California as an example of what they would like their labor force to be. They’re very hard working, dedicated, creative people that really appreciate the fact that they have a job, whereas in other parts of the country you often get people that are saying “I can’t believe I have to work this job.” With the immigrant population, you always have a “thank God I have this job.”

Yes, most on the left are going to bristle at the idea that workers should be grateful for mere employment. But complimenting the industriousness of your Mexican employees is a tad preferable to describing them as rapists.

Practically speaking, Puzder could have some direct effect on policy here, since the Labor Department works with the Department of Homeland Security on workplace immigration enforcement. Perhaps more importantly, though, it looks like Donald Trump might have an actual advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, one who's against mass deportations, whispering in his ear. Considering that another leading candidate for labor secretary was apparently an immigration hawk, that's good news.

So Puzder's presence in the administration may be an insult to the Fight for $15. But he's still an above-replacement addition to Trump's Cabinet, at least for those of us hoping to see the incoming White House inflict minimal damage on the country. After all, most Republicans are bad on labor. Paul Ryan isn't going to pass a major minimum wage increase. Almost any GOP-er would deep-six Obama's overtime rule. And Trump himself just spent a night intimidating a steel union member on Twitter. At least this guy might restrain the president-elect's worst impulses when he's debating whether to banish human beings en masse from the country.

Or maybe he could pull off an even more amazing feat. One can almost imagine a scenario where Puzder and Paul Ryan cajole Trump into a Nixon-to-China moment on immigration reform, where in return for building his giant, utterly unnecessary wall and funding more border agents, Trump signs off on some sort of path to legal status for the undocumented. Probable? Of course not. But possible? Just maybe.Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images

See you on Mars,

Heather SchwedelMichael Flynn was at a beachside resort in the Dominican Republic, a stretch of sand and sun that he and his wife had visited for years, when he took a few moments out of their post-election vacation for a call with the Russian ambassador to the United States.

As a veteran intelligence officer, Flynn must have known that a call with a Russian official in Washington would be intercepted by the U.S. government, pored over by FBI analysts and possibly even shared with the White House.

But six weeks later, Flynn was forced out of his job as national security adviser to President Trump over what was said in that conversation and Flynn’s inability to be truthful about it with then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other officials now in senior positions at the White House.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that “the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.”

But Flynn’s removal was also the culmination of swirling forces and resentment unleashed by the 2016 election. He embodied the bitterly partisan nature of the contest, leading “Lock her up” chants directed at Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the Republican National Convention. His unusual association with Russia — and the discovery of his secret communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak — fanned suspicion among senior Obama administration officials of a more sinister aspect to Russia’s interference in the election. And ultimately, Flynn’s misleading statements about the Kislyak calls added to broader concerns about the Trump administration’s regard for the truth.

[Flynn’s firing is a scandal. But his hiring was, too.]

The sequence connecting Flynn’s call and his dismissal came to involve two presidents warily passing power, the leaders of national security agencies including the FBI and CIA, and incoming and outgoing transition officials who regarded one another with significant distrust.

Senior Obama administration officials said they felt so uncertain about the nature of the Flynn-Kislyak relationship that they took it upon themselves to scale back what they told Flynn and others on his incoming national security team, particularly on sensitive matters related to Russia. Officials emphasized, however, that there was no formal decision to limit information sharing with the Trump transition team.

“We did decide to not share with them certain things about Russia,” a former senior Obama administration official said. “We just thought, who knew? Would that information be safe?”

A flurry of communications

Flynn’s rising profile in the Trump campaign appears to have coincided with a resumption of his contacts with Kislyak. The two first met in 2013, when Flynn, then the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, met with military intelligence officials in Moscow on a trip that the Russian diplomat helped to arrange and coordinate.

As Moscow’s lead envoy in Washington, Kislyak’s communications were routinely monitored by the FBI, including diplomatic reports he filed with Moscow in which he documented his interactions with Flynn, according to current and former U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

At the same time, Russian intelligence services were carrying out an assault on the election, delivering troves of emails stolen from Democratic Party servers to the WikiLeaks Web site, according to U.S. officials. U.S. intelligence agencies later concluded that the effort was designed to destabilize U.S. democracy, damage Clinton’s prospects and help elect Trump.

No evidence has surfaced to suggest that Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak were in any way tied to the Russian operation. Nevertheless, by mid-December, senior officials in the Obama White House began to hear about Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak, both from intelligence reports and other sources.

Obama administration officials weren’t sure what to make of the communications. To some, they appeared to be consistent with the kind of diplomatic outreach expected of any incoming administration. To others, already alarmed by the scale of the Russian interference in the U.S. election, the frequency of the contacts seemed excessive and the lack of any effort by Flynn to coordinate his calls with the State Department was regarded with growing suspicion.

Susan E. Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, did not give Flynn advance notice of the sanctions that the White House planned to impose on Russia over its meddling in the election. Instead, Denis McDonough, who at the time was Obama’s chief of staff, waited until the sanctions were announced to inform his Trump counterpart, a former administration official said.

The measures that Obama announced on Dec. 29 included the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian intelligence officers from the United States, and the forced closure of Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York used as resortlike retreats for that country’s spies and diplomats.

Flynn had a flurry of communications with Kislyak in the days leading up to that announcement, including, by his account, an exchange of holiday greetings via text message on Dec. 25. The two also traded phone calls that Flynn said were limited to condolences over the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey and the downing of a Russian aircraft, as well as a preliminary conversation about setting up a phone call between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Trump.

By that time, Flynn and his wife were in the Dominican Republic for a beachside respite before he moved into one of the most demanding jobs in the White House. It was there, at a resort on the eastern tip of the country, that Flynn fielded a Kislyak call as sanctions were announced.

“He got a hold of me,” Flynn said in the Post interview, “I was on vacation, actually, with my wife.”

The digital packets streaming between their phones were intercepted by the FBI, using capabilities provided by the National Security Agency, as part of its routine surveillance of Kislyak. An FBI agent prepared a brief intelligence report summing up the contents of the conversation, officials said.

The report was not widely circulated and might have attracted only scant attention were it not for a Putin move that baffled Washington. Rather than retaliate against the United States with comparable sanctions — standard practice during the Cold War and afterward — Putin seemed to greet Obama’s punitive measures with an indifferent shrug.

Putin’s reaction — praised by Trump in a tweet saying “I always knew he was very smart” — sent officials at the White House, State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies scrambling for clues. What they began to focus on, in early January, were Flynn’s calls with Kislyak.

Telling the Trump team

On Jan. 5, FBI Director James B. Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. briefed Obama and a small group of his top White House advisers on the contents of a classified intelligence report showing that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump. That’s when White House officials learned that the FBI was investigating the Flynn-Kislyak calls. “The Flynn-Kislyak relationship was highlighted,” a former senior U.S. official said, adding that the bureau made clear “that there was an actual investigation” underway.

The Obama administration at times seemed almost paralyzed about how to respond to Russia’s unprecedented attack on the U.S. election system, even as officials watched it unfold. It wasn’t until weeks after the election that the Obama administration sought to punish Russia.

The Obama team was similarly slow in its deliberations over whether and how to confront the fledgling Trump administration over what it had uncovered in Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak.

The issue was forced out into the open on Jan. 12 in an op-ed by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. The article revealed Flynn’s calls with Kislyak and called for an explanation from the White House on whether the two men had discussed sanctions.

Pence and other members of the Trump transition team, still a week away from assuming power, checked with Flynn before they publicly denied that sanctions had been discussed during the call with Kislyak.

Sally Q. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, Clapper and Brennan wanted to inform the Trump White House that Flynn had misled Pence and other officials. They were concerned that Moscow could use the lie to blackmail Flynn and didn’t feel comfortable leaving Pence in the dark about being misled.

On Obama’s last full day in office, Jan. 19, Clapper and Brennan made the case to Comey for informing the Trump team about Flynn. The FBI director pushed back primarily on the grounds that notifying the new administration could complicate the agency’s investigation. The bureau, Comey also insisted, shouldn’t be “the truth police,” according to an official familiar with his thinking at the time. “In other words, if there’s not a violation of law here, it’s not our job to go and tell the vice president that he’s been lied to.”

In the days following Trump’s inauguration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his calls with Kislyak. That removed the basis for Comey’s earlier objection to notifying the White House, current and former officials said. It is unclear whether Flynn gave the agents an accurate account of his calls with Kislyak. If not, officials said he could find himself in serious legal jeopardy. The FBI interview with Flynn was first reported by the New York Times.

On Jan. 26, Yates notified White House counsel Donald McGahn about the concerns that she and the former intelligence chiefs had about Flynn’s misrepresentations to Pence and others. McGahn, in turn, informed Trump, leading to a review of whether Flynn had violated any laws. White House lawyers quickly concluded that no laws had been broken, according to Spicer.

In his letter of resignation, ­Flynn said that he had “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador,” and that he had merely sought “to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships” for Trump with foreign leaders.

Current and former U.S. officials described that assertion as implausible, noting that sanctions were such a prominent subject of Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak that it seems unlikely he could have forgotten.

Spicer also suggested that ­Flynn’s false account of the sanctions discussion was part of a troubling pattern, saying that a “series of issues and series of statements and pronouncements” had damaged Flynn’s standing beyond repair.

Flynn’s version of events finally started to crumble on Feb. 7, when he was informed that The Post was preparing to publish an article about his discussion of sanctions with Kislyak, citing nine current and former U.S. officials. Flynn, at first, stood by his denials. Then, one day later, he acknowledged through a spokesman that he might have discussed sanctions but couldn’t recall.

Pence finally learned from The Post — two weeks after McGahn — that Flynn had misled him. It would appear that neither McGahn nor Trump had informed him of the false statements.

After Flynn apologized to Pence, the vice president seemed open to allowing Flynn to remain in place, according to a senior administration official. But Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff who had also come to Flynn’s defense in January, “didn’t want to let it go,” the official added.

Flynn episode ‘darkens the cloud’ of Russia that hangs over Trump administration

Pence remains above the fray, but is he outside the inner circle?

Flynn departure erupts into a full-blown crisis for the Trump White HouseAccording to the New York Times, “Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.” This story may have been over-hyped — more about that below — but it and a similar report from CNN are troubling nonetheless. They come on the heels of national-security adviser Michael Flynn’s ouster in the imbroglio over his phone calls with the Russian ambassador. One does not need to believe, with Democrats and Trump’s reflexive critics in the media, that this matter is on the order of Watergate to see that a congressional inquiry is in order.

In November, following an entirely unanticipated loss at the polls, Democrats repaired to declaring that Russia “hacked the election.” Precisely what that meant was never clarified, but elected Democrats were content to insinuate that Moscow was somehow responsible for Trump’s victory, going so far as to hint that Russian intelligence may have manipulated vote totals — a claim for which there is absolutely no evidence but that more than half of self-identified Democrats now believe.

However, this narrative was successful in no small part because of candidate Trump’s extraordinary, at times unseemly, friendliness toward the regime in Moscow. Trump’s staffing choices bolstered that impression: His erstwhile campaign manager, Paul Manafort, worked as a political consultant to Viktor Yanukovych, Putin’s lackey in Ukraine (ousted from the presidency amid violence against anti-government protests in 2014); one of his foreign-policy advisers, Carter Page, was a consultant to and investor in Russia’s state-run gas company, Gazprom, and a vocal supporter of the Kremlin’s thuggish foreign policy; and Roger Stone, who despite being dismissed from Trump’s campaign early remained an everpresent de facto surrogate, admitted to “back-channel communications” with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. It was WikiLeaks that shortly before the election published thousands of private e-mails written by high-level Democratic officials, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and American intelligence immediately suggested that Russian intelligence services were behind the cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee. It’s no secret that WikiLeaks operates at the behest of the Kremlin.

These ties and the hack of the DNC prompted a probe by the FBI, and it was that probe that uncovered the phone records cited by the New York Times. According to officials with knowledge of the investigation, “the F.B.I. has obtained banking and travel records and conducted interviews” as well.

What any of this means, though, is far from clear. The Times does not identify the U.S. officials implicated by the investigation or Russian officials; it does not indicate the content of any of the conversations; and none of the law-enforcement sources are named. The Times probably overplayed the story; consider the following, buried well into the latest account: “The officials would not disclose many details, including what was discussed on the calls, the identity of the Russian intelligence officials who participated, and how many of Mr. Trump’s advisers were talking to the Russians. It is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with Mr. Trump himself.” That’s a significant asterisk.

Nonetheless, these revelations bolster the impression that the Trump campaign had unseemly connections to Moscow. And, of course, this comes just days after Michael Flynn’s resignation as national-security adviser — a consequence less of his phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in late December than of his apparent misleading of other senior Trump administration officials about those conversations. Of course, that situation, too, is mired in uncertainty. Whether Flynn actually discussed rolling back the Obama administration’s recent sanctions against Russia is unclear. Flynn is adamant that he didn’t, and the same officials who freely leaked news of the conversation (obtained during routine surveillance of Russian officials) to media outlets are not willing to release the actual recording of the conversation.

It is suspected that these leaks are coming from the intelligence community. Flynn was unpopular with many career intelligence officers, having made enemies during his time as President Barack Obama’s head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, then having spent his post-DIA years criticizing many of his former colleagues. But Trump himself has also attacked the CIA and others for what he claims are politically motivated crusades. Whatever the collection of motives, it’s clear that officials with knowledge of sensitive material are now waging a war-by-leak, which anti-Trump media are thrilled to lap up.

Following the Times’s story, some on the left are eager to draw up impeachment articles. Meanwhile, some on the right are eager to chalk up any criticisms of the president to ‘fake news.’

Meanwhile, the White House continues to open itself to charges of malfeasance. The administration long maintained that Flynn’s call happened before President Obama’s announcement of sanctions, apparently having failed to recognize that a recording of the call existed. Then, on Wednesday, just hours before the Times’s story, White House spokesman Sean Spicer declared that no campaign officials had been in touch with Russian officials during the election. When it comes to this issue, it’s impossible to know whether the White House is purposely misleading or just bungling.

A steadier hand is in order. It’s time for the appropriate committees to conduct the oversight — of the executive branch, and of the intelligence services — for which they are responsible. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees ought to conduct a thorough, transparent investigation into the allegations being leveled against the Trump White House, and also into the source of the leaks. The parties under investigation should be able to defend themselves in an official setting, instead of being sideswiped by continued divulgences to the press. And the leaking of classified information — news of Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak, for example — ought to be prosecuted as the felony it is. That Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, as well as the leading Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee (North Carolina’s Richard Burr and Virginia’s Mark Warner, respectively), have indicated an openness to a serious probe is encouraging.

Following the Times’s story, some on the left are eager to draw up impeachment articles. Meanwhile, some on the right are eager to chalk up any criticisms of the president to “fake news.” Both are wrong. The questions facing the Trump administration are still just questions, but they warrant sober, fair-minded examination. This is not a job for the media and its anonymous sources; it’s a job for Congress.The use of solitary confinement in prisons is increasingly being recognized as a form of torture. The practice, however, is still widespread, with as many as 100,000 people being held in solitary on any given day. In January, President Barack Obama declared that the time has come to acknowledge the “devastating, lasting psychological consequences” it carries and take steps to limit its use. In this video, two formerly incarcerated men—one of whom wrote about his experience in a new book of essays on solitary called Hell Is a Very Small Place—describe what it’s like to spend months, and even years, in extreme isolation, and how hard it has been for them to recover since they regained their freedom.“The framers of the Constitution were students of history,” said Deepak Gupta, one of the lawyers behind the suit. “And they understood that one way a republic could fail is if foreign powers could corrupt our elected leaders.”

The president’s son Eric Trump, who is an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said the company had taken more steps than required by law to avoid legal exposure, such as agreeing to donate any profits collected at Trump-owned hotels that come from foreign government guests to the United States Treasury.

“This is purely harassment for political gain, and, frankly, I find it very, very sad,” he said in an interview on Sunday.

The president’s lawyers have argued that the constitutional provision does not apply to fair-market payments, such as a standard hotel room bill, and is intended only to prevent federal officials from accepting a special consideration or gift from a foreign power.

“No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument,” one of the lawyers, Sheri A. Dillon, a partner at Morgan Lewis, said at a news conference this month.

The legal team filing the lawsuit includes Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard constitutional scholar; Norman L. Eisen, an Obama administration ethics lawyer; and Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine. Among the others are Richard W. Painter, an ethics counsel in the administration of George W. Bush; Mr. Gupta, a Supreme Court litigator who has three cases pending before the court; and Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham University law professor and former congressional candidate who has been studying and writing about the Emoluments Clause for nearly a decade.

Ms. Teachout said the one place of potential concern was a nation like China, which rents space at Trump Tower in New York and is a major lender to an office building in New York that Mr. Trump controls in part.

Foreign governments, Ms. Teachout and other ethics experts warn, could rent out rooms in Trump hotels as a way to send a message to the Trump family. “If you think other countries are not going to try to leverage relationships with Trump’s companies to influence trade or military policy, that is naïve,” she said.

But Andy Grewal, a University of Iowa law school professor, argued in an academic paper published last week that a payment to a hotel owned by the Trump family, like the Trump International Hotel in Washington, would not violate the Emoluments Clause because the money is paid to a corporate entity and not to Mr. Trump directly.

“There is no connection between the payment and performance of services by the president personally,” Mr. Grewal said.

“It would be a lot of fun to watch,” he said of the lawsuit, “but I imagine it will be kicked out.”

Mr. Eisen said the legal team intended to use the lawsuit to try to get a copy of Mr. Trump’s federal tax returns, which are needed to properly assess what income or other payments or loans Mr. Trump has received from foreign governments.

The plaintiff in the lawsuit is a liberal group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which until recently was controlled by David Brock, a Democratic Party operative and fervent supporter of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Mr. Eisen now serves as chairman of the organization’s board, and Mr. Painter is vice chairman.

The lawsuit may run into trouble, other legal experts said, given that CREW, as the organization is known, must demonstrate that it would suffer direct and concrete injury to give it standing to sue.

The group says it has suffered harm by having to divert resources from other work to monitor and respond to Mr. Trump’s activities. For example, the group said, it has answered hundreds of questions from news organizations.

In a 1982 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a civil rights organization had standing to sue because its use of black “testers” to see whether landlords and home sellers were abiding by federal law had hurt its ability to conduct other activities. But in recent decades, and outside the context of civil rights violations, the court has often been skeptical of broad assertions of standing.

Regardless of the lawsuit’s fate, it is just the first hint of the legal assault that the Trump administration will face.

Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said it was separately looking for plaintiffs to file a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause. It hopes to find a hotel or bed-and-breakfast that might compete against a Trump hotel as a party with standing to sue.

The A.C.L.U. filed an extensive Freedom of Information Act request on Thursday asking the Justice Department, the General Services Administration and the Office of Government Ethics for all legal opinions and memos they have prepared addressing financial or ethical conflicts that Mr. Trump might face. It could potentially use those documents in litigation against the Trump administration.

CREW filed a separate complaint with the General Services Administration on Friday over a provision that appears to prohibit the leasing of the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to an elected federal official. The building is the site of Mr. Trump’s hotel.

Did Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, warn White House Counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26 that National Security Adviser Mike Flynn had misled the FBI? Did McGahn relay that warning to President Trump? And did Trump decide it wasn’t legally problematic or serious enough to oust Flynn? That sequence needs to be investigated now that the Washington Post has disclosed what Flynn apparently told the FBI.

William Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He’s the author of Bearing Right.



Here’s the basic story. On Dec. 29, Flynn had a phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. According to U.S. intercepts of the call, Flynn told Kislyak that the incoming Trump administration would review sanctions that had just been imposed on Russia by the Obama administration for interfering in the election that installed Trump. Two weeks after the call, around Jan. 13 or 14, Flynn told the White House that he and Kislyak hadn’t talked about the sanctions. Based on this misinformation, Vice President Mike Pence and White House press secretary Sean Spicer publicly denied that the sanctions had been discussed.

Intelligence and FBI officials had seen a secret report on the intercepts of the call. They knew Flynn had misled Pence and Spicer. They wanted to warn the White House. They had three concerns. One was that Flynn’s offer to review the sanctions might have violated the Logan Act, an old law that prohibits private citizens (which Flynn was at the time) from meddling in diplomacy. A second concern was that Russia could blackmail Flynn, since it knew the story he had told Pence was false. A third concern was that Pence needed to know he was being deceived.

But that wasn’t enough for FBI Director James Comey. According to a Washington Post report from Tuesday, Comey told Yates, CIA Director John Brennan, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that before they alerted the White House, they needed something more:

On Obama’s last full day in office, Jan. 19, Clapper and Brennan made the case to Comey for informing the Trump team about Flynn. The FBI director pushed back primarily on the grounds that notifying the new administration could complicate the agency’s investigation. The bureau, Comey also insisted, shouldn’t be “the truth police,” according to an official familiar with his thinking at the time. “In other words, if there’s not a violation of law here, it’s not our job to go and tell the vice president that he’s been lied to.”

In the days following Trump’s inauguration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his calls with Kislyak. That removed the basis for Comey’s earlier objection to notifying the White House, current and former officials said. It is unclear whether Flynn gave the agents an accurate account of his calls with Kislyak. If not, officials said he could find himself in serious legal jeopardy.

The implication of these two paragraphs seems clear: The FBI interviewed Flynn on Jan. 24 to meet Comey’s standard. The interview produced the requisite violation of the law. The Post’s Thursday update indicates that the violation was Flynn’s false denial. The Post notes that Flynn “followed his denial to the FBI by saying he couldn’t recall all of the conversation,” and a CNN report posted Friday morning says that after the agents “challenged” Flynn, he said he didn’t remember. The FBI decided the interview wasn’t enough of a basis to prosecute Flynn. But according to both CNN and the Post, it was enough to satisfy Comey that Yates could warn the White House.

Somewhere in this chain of events, something went horribly wrong.

So she did. According to a Tuesday briefing by Spicer, on Jan. 26 Yates “informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a ‘heads up’ to us” about Flynn’s deception. The Post reported that Yates’ warning to McGahn included something Spicer didn’t mention in his Tuesday briefing: the danger that Flynn was “vulnerable to Russian blackmail.”

It’s not clear what Yates told McGahn, if anything, about the FBI interview. Maybe, to protect the Flynn investigation, she didn’t mention it. But it would be odd to delay warning the White House for lack of a crime, then send agents to interview Flynn to produce that crime, and then not mention or at least allude to that crime in the warning. Spicer says that at the time, Yates “could not confirm there was an investigation.” That remark by Spicer suggests that Yates withheld explicit confirmation but that something in her words made McGahn suspect Flynn was in legal trouble with the FBI and that the bureau had begun taking its usual steps, which would include an interview.

If McGahn knew or suspected that the FBI had interviewed Flynn, the next question is what McGahn told Trump. According to Spicer’s account, McGahn briefed Trump and his senior advisers “immediately” (not including Pence, apparently) and, at Trump’s direction, “undertook an extensive review” that included studying “materials” and interrogating Flynn “on several occasions based on information that was provided.” Spicer acknowledged that as part of this process, there was “communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel’s Office.” But he refused to say what that entailed. The bottom line, said Spicer, was that Trump concluded “Gen. Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsel’s review corroborated that.”

At his press conference Thursday, Trump said nothing he had heard from McGahn made him think Flynn was guilty of more than misleading Pence. Trump recalled that the “information” had come from Yates, the acting attorney general, and that “I was a little surprised, because I said, ‘Doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong.’ ” Trump was asked whether the White House had looked at transcripts of the intercepts or other evidence, but he didn’t answer. When a reporter asked why Trump had kept Pence in the dark about McGahn’s information for nearly two weeks, Trump replied: “Because when I looked at the information, I said, ‘I don’t think he [Flynn] did anything wrong.’ ”Sean Rayford/Getty Images

On Monday night, Donald Trump fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce his executive order on immigration. The order, issued Friday night, temporarily bars the entry of anyone from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump and his supporters insist that the order is valid and that the Justice Department must enforce it, because its text doesn’t explicitly target a particular faith. Yates disagrees. She says the order is religious discrimination because the intent behind it, manifest in statements by Trump and his aides, is to exclude Muslims.

Yates is correct. A mountain of evidence shows Trump did this to target Islam.

Yates takes a different view. On Monday, she sent Justice Department attorneys a letter instructing them not to enforce the order. She conceded that the department’s Office of Legal Counsel had approved the order as “lawful on its face.” But this level of scrutiny, she argued, “does not take account of statements made by an administration or its surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order’s purpose.” According to the New York Times, Yates rejected the order based on “repeated comments from Mr. Trump and his advisers about barring Muslims from entering the United States.”

Yates has the facts on her side. The record of anti-Muslim demagoguery behind this order is overwhelming. Ryan, McConnell, and anyone else who defends the president’s ban should be required to review the record and explain why, in light of it, they’re giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. Here’s a recap.

Dec. 7, 2015: Following the terror attack in San Bernardino, California, Trump calls for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” He bases this on a confused and distorted claim that “large segments of the Muslim population” favor Sharia (Islamic law) and violence against Americans.

Dec. 8, 2015: Trump rejects arguments that his proposal is discriminatory and wrong. On MSNBC, he says even supposedly innocent Muslims are guilty of protecting terrorists. He escalates his threats, falsely accusing Muslims of failing to report the San Bernardino plot:

The Muslim community is not reporting what’s going on. They should be reporting that their next-door neighbor is making pipe bombs and they’ve got them all over the place. The mother’s in the apartment, other people, his friend was buying him rifles. Nobody was reporting that. … The Muslim community has to help us, because without the Muslim community, we would have to get very tough and much tougher.

Jan. 14, 2016: In a Republican primary debate, moderator Maria Bartiromo asks Trump: “Is there anything you’ve heard that makes you want to rethink this position?” “No,” he says. “We have to stop with political correctness.”

March 9: Trump tells CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “Islam hates us.” Cooper asks: “Is there a war between the West and radical Islam, or between the West and Islam itself?” Trump replies: “It’s very hard to separate, because you don’t know who is who.”

The record of anti-Muslim demagoguery behind this order is overwhelming.

March 10: At another debate, Sen. Marco Rubio says: “If you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you’re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world, you’re going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.” Trump brushes off these objections: “You can be politically correct if you want. I don’t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate … where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means.” He suggests additional reasons to beware of Islam: “Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.”

June 13: In a speech responding to the terror attack in Orlando, Florida, Trump pledges to “suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies.” This formulation—which, according to Rudy Giuliani, was orchestrated by Trump’s advisers as a legally permissible alternative to his original “Muslim ban”—appears to replace the explicit ban. But Trump suggests that Muslims from other countries are still a problem: “Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East.” He also adds a new rationale for excluding Muslims: that “they’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is.”

July 17: On 60 Minutes, Lesley Stahl reminds Trump that his running mate, Mike Pence, once called a Muslim ban unconstitutional. Trump shrugs: “So you call it territories. OK? We’re gonna do territories. We’re gonna not let people come in from Syria …” Stahl asks: “So not Muslims?” Trump replies: “You know, the Constitution, there’s nothing like it. But it doesn’t necessarily give us the right to commit suicide as a country, OK?”

July 24: On Meet the Press, Chuck Todd asks whether the territorial ban is a “rollback” of Trump’s position. Trump says no: “In fact, you could say it’s an expansion. I’m looking now at territories. People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. ‘Oh, you can’t use the word Muslim,’ ” he says, mockingly. “But just remember this: Our Constitution is great, but it doesn’t necessarily give us the right to commit suicide, OK?”

July 27: At a press conference, Trump repeats that Muslim neighbors and congregants are responsible for terrorism: “I think that the people in the community know what’s going on, whether it’s in a mosque or it’s in the community. And they have to report these people.” The next day, at a rally in Iowa, he warns: “If a community isn’t going to report when they know something’s going to happen, those people have to suffer the consequences.”

Aug. 15: Trump extends his proposed crackdown. “In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups,” he says, “we must also screen out any … who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.” This clause taps into a misconception that Muslims who revere religious law, unlike Christians who do the same, can’t accept pluralism. By making such reverence disqualifying, Trump is able to exclude many more Muslims.

Sept. 14: Trump says of Syrian refugees: “We don’t know if they have love or hate in their heart, and there’s no way to tell. We can’t let these people come into our country.” On its face, this statement makes the presumption of unacceptable risk unfalsifiable.

Oct. 9: At a debate, ABC’s Martha Raddatz asks Trump about the Muslim ban: “Was it a mistake to have a religious test?” He doesn’t answer. He says the ban “has morphed into extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.” Raddatz presses: “Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?” Again, Trump refuses to say yes or no. “It’s called extreme vetting,” he says. “We are going to areas, like Syria.”

Nov. 10: Two days after his election, Trump speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol. A reporter asks: “Are you going to ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country?” Trump stares at the reporter, says “Thank you, everybody,” and walks away.

Dec. 21: In Florida, a reporter asks Trump whether he has decided “to rethink or re-evaluate your plans to create a Muslim registry or ban Muslim immigration to the United States.” Trump replies: “You know my plans. All along, I’ve been proven to be right.”

Jan. 27: In an interview for the Christian Broadcasting Network, David Brody asks Trump: “The refugee changes you’re looking to make—as it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority?” Trump says yes. “If you were a Christian in Syria, it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States,” he says. “If you were a Muslim, you could come in. But if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.” This characterization is grossly misleading. But Trump concludes that the process “was very, very unfair” to Christians. “So we are going to help them.”

Later that day, Trump issues his order. It suspends “entry into the United States of aliens” from countries in which “a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence.” In practice, this means seven Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The order doesn’t mention Christians, but it commits the United States to “prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.”

Jan. 29: Trump tweets: “Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting … Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!” Trump doesn’t mention Shiite Muslims, who are executed in greater numbers and are less likely than Christians to be admitted to the United States.

No principled person, looking at this record, would tolerate, much less defend, a Trump-initiated ban on migration from Muslim countries. The temporary character of the ban, the avoidance of explicit references to Islam or Christianity, and the omission of other Muslim countries don’t excuse the obvious animus behind the order.

In every way, Trump has targeted Muslims as a class. He has rejected the distinction between Islam and radical Islam, since “you don’t know who is who.” He has assigned all Muslims the burden of proving they’re not radical, since “there’s no way to tell.” He has held all Muslims responsible for terror plots that go unreported. He has added rationales—Sharia, sexism, conversion—for excluding Muslims without regard to terrorism. He has proposed better treatment for persecuted Christians but not for persecuted Shiites. He has never conceded that a ban based on religion is wrong, nor has he retracted it. He has said his current approach is an expansion of it.A group of career federal employees and national security officials have been whipped up into such a frenzy against President Donald Trump, they are committing felonies in leaking classified materials to outlets such as The Washington Post.

So says Joseph diGenova, who served as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia under President Ronald Reagan.

“The leaks of the content of an intercepted communication are felonies … All of the disclosures to The Washington Post are federal crimes.”

The leaks have recently scored their first target: Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, long targeted by the media and outgoing Democratic officials.

But it has not just been about Flynn. A Republican congressional staffer told LifeZette there is an uptick in damaging leaks, using highly classified material, since Trump was elected on Nov. 8.

The apparent aim: destroy the new administration. The leaks have usually involved classified material relating to Trump’s transition, Trump’s subordinates, or the president himself. And they involve national security details that should not be aired publicly, experts said.

DiGenova and the congressional staffer are not alone in their opinions. After the embarrassing resignation of Flynn for speaking to the Russian ambassador about sanctions, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the big story moving forward was the leaking of highly classified documents related to Flynn’s discussion.

Trump himself tweeted out his anger about the leaks on Tuesday.

"The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?" Trump said via Twitter. "Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N. Korea etc?"

So is the real story these leaks? Spicer was asked at the Tuesday briefing.

"It is leaks," Spicer said when asked about Trump's tweet. "If you think about it, all of this information was leaked ... I think there's a real story here. I think there's also a story here where the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out."

DiGenova says Attorney General Jeff Sessions, now the head of the Department of Justice, must be resolute in going after the leaks.

"The leaks of the content of an intercepted communication are felonies," said diGenova. "All of the disclosures to The Washington Post are federal crimes."

The Post was the first major outlet to report, on Feb. 9, that "nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters" related to Flynn.

That story began a cascade of events that led to Flynn resigning very late on Monday night.

DiGenova wants a federal jury impaneled to examine the leak issue. He said the Department of Justice attorneys under Sessions shouldn't be too concerned: Under former President Obama, the department slapped subpoenas on more journalists than all other presidents combined.

"I don't think the Justice Department has any choice," said diGenova.

DiGenova said the constant drumbeat of negativity and harsh rhetoric aimed at Trump since he shocked the Beltway and both party Establishments on Nov. 8 have led some federal officials to believe they are beyond the law in opposing Trump.

The leaks began after the election, and even included how many times Trump was being briefed. Some observers speculate the leaks began from disgruntled Democrats on their way out.

Many of the Democrats likely expected to stay in the federal government if Hillary Clinton had won. Others may have believed the extreme rhetoric aimed at Trump and decided to damage the new president.

"People thought they could do anything they wanted in the name of the 'Resistance,'" said diGenova.

The U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will begin investigating the leaks soon, according to a congressional source on Capitol Hill, but he could not give an exact date.

"I expect for the FBI to tell me what is going on, and they better have a good answer," said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House intelligence committee, according to a Tuesday story in The Post. "The big problem I see here is that you have an American citizen who had his phone calls recorded."

Nunes and Flynn himself are curious how and why he was recorded in the Dec. 29 conversation with the Russian ambassador.

The congressional staffer told LifeZette that for an American to be recorded, even in a conversation with the Russian ambassador, a warrant would be needed.

Somehow, a warrant was not only given to record Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador, but someone high up "unmasked" Flynn in transcripts. The congressional staffer then said the leaks to the media followed.

Both diGenova and Spicer said talking to the Russian ambassador was not an unusual step for an incoming national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn likely spoke to about 30 of his foreign counterparts during transition.

Ultimately, Trump decided based on the transcripts that Flynn should have recalled talking to the ambassador about the controversial sanctions that Obama placed upon Russia on Dec. 29.

After talking to Flynn, Vice President Mike Pence told the media on Jan. 15 that Flynn did not talk about the sanctions, placed upon Russia by Obama for alleged hacking. Trust had been eroded, Spicer said on Tuesday.

Now Trump must ponder if he has a bevy of federal officials under him that he certainly cannot trust.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Amid the controversy surrounding White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s alleged conversations with Russia, it may be instrumental to recall that representatives for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign were accused of meeting with Hamas and Iran.

Depending on what took place, the alleged contacts with Iran may have violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in dispute with the United States. It may be questionable whether Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, legally qualifies as a foreign government.

In 2008, Robert Malley stepped down as an informal foreign policy adviser to Obama’s campaign when it was revealed that he met with Hamas members.

Malley admitted to the meetings, but he claimed he met with the terrorists as part of his private job.

“I have never hidden the fact that I had meetings with Hamas,” Malley wrote in an open letter published in the New York Times. “I do this as part of my job as Middle East program director at the International Crisis Group.”

He said he distanced himself from Obama’s campaign because the Hamas meetings were “becoming a distraction to me and to Senator Obama’s campaign, and to avoid any misperception — misrepresentation being the more accurate word — about the candidate’s position regarding the Islamist movement.”

Malley later joined the Obama administration. In 2015, he was appointed to lead the Middle East desk of the National Security Council.

He was also named Obama’s special adviser regarding the Islamic State.

Meanwhile, in August 2014, Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the National Security Council and U.S. Defense Department, penned a column at PJ Media stating Obama opened a back-channel to Iran during the 2008 presidential campaign. Ledeen said the back channel went through retired Ambassador William G. Miller, who also led the 1979 negotiating mission during the Iran hostage crisis. Ladeen wrote that Miller confirmed his back-channel involvement to him.

Ledeen wrote:

The actual strategy is detente first, and then a full alliance with Iran throughout the Middle East and North Africa. It has been on display since before the beginning of the Obama administration. During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies. The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah’s rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign.

Also on the panel? A who’s-who of the wealthiest chief executives from some of the nation’s biggest companies, among them: Mary T. Barra of General Motors, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Company, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM.

The purpose, according to a statement released by Mr. Trump’s transition team: “To provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, nonbureaucratic and nonpartisan manner.”

The liberal American Sustainable Business Council was not pleased.

“Trump is doubling down on crony capitalists who don’t understand that a healthy economy requires a healthy planet and consumers with money in their pockets,” said its co-founder, David Brodwin.

Donald Trump will meet the Filipino president.

Mr. Trump, whose unscripted telephone calls with world leaders have broken with protocol and left diplomats in Washington aghast, on Friday invited President Rodrigo R. Duterte of the Philippines to visit the White House next year, according to an aide to Mr. Duterte quoted by Reuters.

Mr. Duterte, who has been criticized by the State Department for waging a bloody and ruthless antidrug campaign that has killed about 2,000 people in the Philippines, has called President Obama a “son of a whore” and, in September, said he “can go to hell.” The remarks prompted Mr. Obama to cancel a planned meeting with Mr. Duterte in Laos at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Mr. Trump has business and government connections in the Philippines, where he has partnered with a real estate company controlled by Jose E.B. Antonio, named in October as Mr. Duterte’s special envoy to the United States, on a $150 million office tower in Manila.

Officials for Mr. Trump’s transition did not confirm the call or include it in a rundown they gave on Friday of conversations with world leaders that Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence had held over the past 24 hours.

They did provide official accounts on Thursday of calls Mr. Trump had with the prime minister of Pakistan and the president of Kazakhstan, but those were sanitized versions of the readouts provided by those countries, which indicated that the president-elect had heaped praise on their leaders and suggested a readiness to side with them on delicate matters of diplomacy.

A look at policies to come.

Senator David Perdue of Georgia, a Republican and an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump, stopped by the microphones at Trump Tower to share his views of the legislative rush to come next year.

“Job 1 is getting people put back to work — we’re talking about Obamacare, the Keystone Pipeline, the Waters in the U.S. and the Clean Power Plan,” he said, singling out the transcontinental pipeline that President Obama killed, new clean water regulations and Mr. Obama’s climate change plan.

Asked about killing the Iran nuclear deal between the Islamic Republic and the western powers, he did not hide his feelings.

“It’s not a treaty, it’s a presidential resolution and it can be reversed,” he said. “This is a very dangerous deal. It provides a pathway for Iran to become a nuclear power and you just cannot allow that.”

Supporters of the deal, including Mr. Obama and the governments of Britain, Japan, France, Germany and Russia say it will prevent Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, not facilitate it.

Tall men, unite.

Much has been said about the photo of a windblown president-elect and his tie, exposed as taped together. Well, a tall man — Brendan Buck, senior aide to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan — has come to his defense.

Trump to White House: Thanks, Obama.

The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, while payrolls rose by 178,000, the 74th straight month of private sector gains — the longest expansion by far. Economic growth last quarter hit 3.2 percent.

Mr. Trump’s campaign painted the bleakest of portraits of the American economy, one that never really fit reality. Now, he will be taking office with a big head of steam thanks at least in part to his predecessor, President Obama.

But some economic analysts greeted the news with a note of caution.

“The president-elect still represents the mother of all uncertainties when it comes to domestic and foreign policies,” wrote Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group.

Not the party of Reagan anymore.

Jaw-dropping quote of the morning, from Vice President-elect Mike Pence to The New York Times:

“The free market has been sorting it out and America’s been losing,” Mr. Pence added, as Mr. Trump interjected, “Every time, every time.”

Chris Christie passed over again?

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey may be pressing his own candidacy to be the next chairman of the Republican National Committee, but Mr. Trump, who has the final say, appears to have other ideas.

A person close to Mr. Trump said the president-elect’s allies are coalescing around Nick Ayers, a member of the transition team, to be the party’s chairman. Mercedes Schlapp, another Republican operative, is being considered for a role as co-chairwoman.

Mr. Christie called Mr. Trump to put his name forward on Thursday morning, according to Politico. That was already something of a comedown from the governor’s former job leading Mr. Trump’s transition team and his aspirations to become the attorney general.

Now even the party chairmanship, which will change hands when Reince Priebus becomes Mr. Trump’s White House chief of staff, may slip out of Mr. Christie’s reach.

Fast-food chain C.E.O. rises in cabinet talk.

Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants and a financial supporter of Mr. Trump’s campaign, has gained steam as a candidate to become the secretary of labor, according to a transition official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the process.

Mr. Puzder, whose company oversees restaurant chains such as Hardee’s, has been extremely critical of Obama administration policies, including a push for a higher minimum wage and new overtime rules for workers who are considered management, but have few managerial responsibilities.

A change in tone? Not so much.

If presidential watchers were hoping for a more presidential tone in Mr. Trump’s “victory rallies,” they didn’t see much on Thursday night in Cincinnati.

“We did have a lot of fun fighting Hillary, didn’t we?” he asked.

The crowd broke into the familiar chant, “Lock her up!” as the president-elect smiled and lifted a fist.

Mr. Trump railed against the “extremely dishonest press” as the crowd chanted “fake news.” And he complained that there wasn’t “the highest-caliber politician in Ohio,” a reference to Gov. John Kasich, who never supported Mr. Trump.

Mike Pence’s new neighbors fly gay pride flags.

Many across the nation may rally around the new commander in chief and Vice President-elect Pence, but some in the District of Columbia probably won’t.

Incidentally ...

Hillary Clinton’s lead over Mr. Trump in the popular vote inched up on Thursday night to 2,564,276 — nearly a flat 2 percentage points. Minnesota and Massachusetts certified their totals, but votes keep trickling in from California.dean65/Thinkstock

Last week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to “drain the swamp in Washington D.C.,” saying in a campaign speech that he will “make our government honest once again.” How do you drain a swamp?

Build trenches and canals that allow water to flow out. For most swamps, you can dig a series of trenches below the current water level, allowing gravity to do the work of propelling water down and out of the swamp. As the standing water drains away, the swamp flora and fauna will die out, and—as long as the land remains relatively dry—upland flora and fauna will replace it. Depending on how permeable the soil is, the trenches may need to include piping to help ensure the water flows out instead of permeating the soil. Sometimes, a power source might be needed to initiate the water flow. The swamp will also drain more quickly if you fill it in with dry soil as you drain.

There is not a swamp on top of Capitol Hill. If there were, it would be quite simple to drain—just dig a trench and let gravity do the rest. Though modest, Capitol Hill is a notable point of elevation in an otherwise low-lying part of Washington. It rises quickly just in front of the Capitol—from 10 feet above sea level to 70 feet in less than a block before topping out around 100 feet behind the Supreme Court.

There is not a swamp on top of Capitol Hill, but if there were, it would be quite simple to drain.

When considering Capitol Hill’s location, the most practical path for a drainage trench would be straight down South Capitol Street, past Nationals Park, and into the Anacostia River. A slight modification of this route could channel the flow around the stadium to the northeast and down into the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority’s Main and O Street Pumping Stations, where the water could be collected for treatment if it were, say, toxic. Such a course would even have a historical precedent, generally following that of the old Washington City Canal, which allowed boats to cross through town between the Potomac and Anacostia in the first half of the 19th century. This canal was not swamp-related, however—contrary to popular belief, Washington was not actually built on a swamp. Some of the low-lying areas along the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers were marshy and prone to flooding, but they weren’t technically swampland—the wooded hills at the outskirts of the city are more indicative of the biome that was destroyed to make way for the metropolis.

Swamp drainage is not uncommon. An estimated half of the 221 million wetland acres that once existed in the lower 48 states have been drained to make way for development or farming. Still, draining a swamp, particularly in a heavily populated area, requires permits and environmental reviews. At a minimum, the Environmental Protection Agency would require a Section 404 dredge-and-fill permit under the Clean Water Act. The National Park Service would need to complete a full environmental impact statement, as required under the National Environmental Policy Act. A Section 106 review would also be needed to identify impacts to historic structures as required by the National Historic Preservation Act. Add municipal work permits, an engineering review to ensure digging doesn’t hit the Metro’s green line running south of the Capitol, and existing capacity headaches at the Main and O Street Pumping Stations, and it would likely be years before this project could get underway.Photo by FBI via Getty Images

Wednesday's mass murder of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina is the most high-profile example of white extremist terror in the United States since Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. But though not each incident makes national headlines, a tally kept by the Southern Poverty Law Center indicates that the murder of law enforcement officials and innocent civilians by racial supremacists, anti-government paranoiacs, and other believers in white fringe movements has been depressingly common in the two decades since Timothy McVeigh's attack. Below (taken from SPLC's records and confirmed by outside news accounts) is a list of 32 deadly attacks since Oklahoma City—comprising a total of 70 victims—carried out or believed to have been carried out by white extremists.

October 9, 1995. An Amtrak employee is killed when a train derails near Hyder, Arizona because the track it's traveling on has been sabotaged. The perpetrators are never found, but anti-law enforcement propaganda messages from the "Sons of Gestapo" are found near the scene.

(She appears to be a tax lawyer, without any obvious constitutional practice experience).

I’m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That’s a word I think we’ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before. And we’re gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says “officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.”

That’s actually not what the Constitution says, and this is an unfortunate paraphrase. Article I, Section 9, Clause 8, provides:

And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.

The clause does not apply to “officials,” but a “person holding any Office of Profit or Trust.” It’s unfortunate the official transcript used quotation marks. That is not a quote.

Dillon continues to provide a definition of emolument:

The so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder. No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument. But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm’s-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn’t even aware of. These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It’s not an emolument.

Her analysis seems to assume the Clause applies to the President. (I’ll leave that debate aside for now, other to note that Will Baude recently entered the fray).

The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires. So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit.

Assuming that these payments are indeed prohibited emoluments, transferring the money does not cure the problem. The clause prohibits the “accept[ance]” of emoluments. Avoiding a violation would entail not accepting the emolument in the first place.

Update: Several commenters have told me that I was too harsh, and that Dillon was merely paraphrasing the clause in common language to make it easier for the press to understand.

Sorry, I’m a snoot about these things. If the President-elect is taking a position on the Constitution, he has to be careful. The paraphrase came close to making it difficult to raise a defense that the clause is inapplicable to the President.

This is the kind of significant decision that needs to be accompanied by a legal opinion by constitutional law scholars (like when John McCain retained Larry Tribe and Ted Olson to opine on natural born citizen clause), not offhand comments by a tax attorney.

This caution is especially important because attorneys on the left are champing at the bit to file an emoluments clause challenge.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general Wednesday calling for an investigation into leaks from inside the government, including the disclosure to the press by anonymous officials that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, had likely been intercepted by American intelligence.*

“Generally, collection activities by intelligence agencies are classified, as are the products that result from those activities,” they wrote. “Federal laws, and the Constitution, distinguish law enforcement investigation authorities from intelligence collection authorities for good reason, and in neither case is collection intended to enable the government’s publication of conversations surreptitiously recorded by intelligence agencies. Similarly, the release of classified national security information can, by definition, have grave effects on national security.”

Chaffetz told reporters Tuesday that his committee would not investigate Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador themselves, saying that such an investigation would fall under the purview of the House Intelligence Committee and that, anyway, Flynn’s resignation meant that the matter had “taken care of itself.” Chaffetz has been similarly reluctant to investigate Trump and routinely points out that the president is exempt from federal conflict of interest laws. This is true with the exception of the constitutional prohibition of the receipt of foreign gifts in the Emoluments Clause, which has been made relevant by Trump’s foreign business dealings and stays by foreign dignitaries at his American hotels. When asked directly by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer about the clause last Wednesday, Chaffetz said he refused to launch a “fishing expedition that the Democrats want us to go into.” In January, Chaffetz blasted the head of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, for criticizing Trump’s plan to end his conflicts of interest. From Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick:

The Republican threatened to subpoena Shaub if he refuses to participate in an official transcribed behind-closed doors interview. The calculus here seems to be that if nobody sees this crooked behavior by supposed ethics guardians like Chaffetz, then it didn’t happen.

OGE, set up post-Watergate, is nonpartisan and advises executive branch officials on avoiding conflicts. Shaub’s five-year term expires in January 2018.

Chaffetz demanded in a letter that he appear before lawmakers in the aforementioned closed-door, transcribed interview, to answer questions in a deposition-style setting. Richard Painter, who served as the ethics lawyer for George W. Bush, told the New York Times that this was “political retaliation” by Republicans against nonpartisan ethics officers for doing their basic duty.

Chaffetz’s unwillingness to investigate Trump has drawn ire from his constituents, including many who showed up to a town hall event in his district last Thursday to berate him. Chaffetz later alleged that many who attended the event had been paid protesters. In recent days, Chaffetz, perhaps in response to constituent pressure, has taken small steps toward probing the White House. The congressman sent a letter to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus on Tuesday asking him to detail security measures in place at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump held evidently public talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on North Korea’s missile launch over the weekend. Last week, Chaffetz sent a letter to the General Services Administration about the terms of its lease to Trump’s company for the Trump International Hotel and another letter to the Office of Government Ethics, co-written with Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, about Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway’s promotion of Ivanka Trump’s fashion brand.Lisa Larson-Walker

Trump’s unconstitutional and un-American Muslim ban has piqued a lot of dogs. The angry pooches appear at protests around the country wearing placards that announce their intention to fight authoritarianism. “I wag 4 refugees,” declare the signs hanging from their bodies. “I’m a dog and even I understand this is fucked.”

These pets’ commitment to democratic paradigms might warm your heart. Or maybe you find such Pixar humor—cute animals saying naughty things in a context generally glowing with good intentions—a bit precious for a political demonstration. These billboards might make you wonder about the point at which activism becomes too flippant or impressed with its own cleverness. One popular sign averred that “Trump Is Fake News.” (He’s not.) Another one pointed out that his approval ratings fall below the Rotten Tomatoes percentage for Paul Blart: Mall Cop. (Yes, Trump is worse than Kevin James.) At what point does our urge to express our individuality—and to do so with a wink—make us lose sight of the seriousness of Trump’s transgressions against our collective ideals?

If you ask me, that line of argument misses the point and not just because squabbling over precisely how the opposition words its dismay seems like a bad look. Trump is a president uniquely obsessed with surfaces, and many of the issues that have confronted both citizens and journalists during his climb—should we take him literally or seriously or both?—are semiotic ones. Protests energize the populace, and they give us an opportunity to show off for each other, but they also send a message to the man transfixed by his own news coverage: Here are bodies in the streets. Here is proof of your unpopularity. The content of the posters matters less than their existence en masse.

That’s one reason why Trump developed such an ungodly fixation on his inaugural crowd count: Numbers speak to him in ways that language can’t. While some people undoubtedly fine-tune their protest signs to appeal to like-minded folks on social media (and maybe that’s not the noblest impulse), the performance they’re taking part in is, in the end, much blunter. The theater of activism can accommodate both decades-old slogans exalting democratic participation and of-the-moment wisecracks about the president’s hair.

Granted, it can be easy to lose sight of that fact in the face of so much simultaneously awesome and irritating signage. Unlike Inauguration Day’s modest sea of American flags and MAGA hats, the expressions of dissent we’ve seen over the past month have been deeply diverse. Some take aim at Trump’s personal appearance (“Orange is the new whack!”), his politics (“Pakistani dykes against fascism!”), his romantic history (“Without immigration Trump would have no wives!”), and his character (“Let them in Trump, you are being rude!”). A lot of them sincerely invoke stuff like the Constitution, democracy, and human dignity and compassion.

Cute poster children have also lent recent demonstrations a hopeful sweetness.

This uplifting, future-facing trend reached its apotheosis in a viral photograph of a Jewish boy on his dad’s shoulders grinning at a Muslim girl on her dad’s shoulders, all four activists holding signs emblazoned with messages of love and tolerance.

Just as often, though, that earnestness shades into insults and raunch. “We will fill his wall with glory holes,” vowed one sign. “When they go low, we go high. Also, fuck you,” read another.

The filthiness of these messages isn’t throwaway humor: It’s a self-aware way of measuring just how dire the world has gotten. Statements like “Build a wall around him and I will pay for it” sound like snatches of nimbly referential comedy until you catch the desperate undertones. “You know it’s bad when Angelenos go to LAX willingly,” said one placard several weekends ago. Ha ha. But the subtext was: You know it’s bad when the goofballs who would make this sign to go protest have to actually make this sign and go protest.

My friend stayed with me during the weekend of the Women’s March on Washington. At a bar late Saturday night, she stared fiercely into her tiki cup, which contained a spray of tropical flowers and an adorable dolphin fashioned from a banana peel. “Why weren’t people angrier?” she asked. She speared her dolphin with a little purple umbrella. “I wanted the march to be angrier.”

I picked up a plastic rapier the size of a toothpick and started sawing at a pineapple slice. “I think people are angry,” I said.

“Yeah, well.” My friend cast her vengeful eye around the sunset-colored Polynesian décor. “It doesn’t seem like it.”

Tiki bars are ironic places, havens of urban kitsch. They’re great if you want to both revel in and laugh at the gaudiness of your vacation fantasies. They’re not so great if you want to stab things with actual swords.

Should protests be ironic places? Writing in the New York Times, philosopher Christy Wampole claims that “a certain kind of seriousness is the precondition for the ascent to power.” If those who oppose Trump want to consolidate their might, she argues, they must rediscover “urgency,” avoid “smugness” and “dangerous cynicism,” and realize that “the luxury of ironic posturing is no longer affordable.”

Walpole’s suspicion that certain liberals have hidden for too long behind a disaffected pose strikes me as easy for Trump supporters to weaponize and exploit. Consider that few of the most prominently memed signs are original. When you stumble across a seemingly idiosyncratic statement often enough, it can start to look like a personal cry of outrage has been commodified into a signal of group belonging. Apparently, a lot of people “aren’t usually sign guys, but jeez,” and it’s not just that their relative apathy (reinforced by a conspicuous unwillingness to come up with their own slogans) feels like a weird thing to rally around. The words appear emptied of their meaning.

Yet it’s reasonable to argue that sophisticated, funny mottos, strengthened through repetition, are something to applaud. “If democracy looks like the Women’s March on Washington,” wrote the Huffington Post, “it looks energized, creative, diverse, joyous, and ready to fight like hell for equality.” The merry commitment on display at anti-Trump rallies may speak to a healthy, sustainable resistance—one that might hold more long-term appeal than a movement founded on unending horrified outrage.

Few would deny that the Vietnam War protests were instrumental in remaking public opinion. They were also kind of a party: You showed up not just because you believed the United States should withdraw from Southeast Asia but because your friends were going, and you might hook up with someone, and the whole experience was just exciting. “It was fun, it was cool, it was the time of Haight-Ashbury and the hippies and drugs and rock-and-roll,” notes a retrospective on campus antiwar activism by the University of California at Berkeley. Take out the delight, and you whittle away less motivated demonstrators; trim the ranks, and your resistance might not grow large enough to make a difference. “Protest is the new Tinder,” a different friend told me when I asked her about the role of humor at 2017’s marches. “That’s a good thing.”Turn-ons, and turn-offs, for that matter, are highly subjective. What gets one girl going might make another cringe. Like the word “daddy,” dudes who rock sandals, or getting spanked.

Editor: Amanda BrianSince October 2015, there have been reports on Kenyan social media about the so-called “36 Bloggers” — a group of 36 social media influencers purportedly hired by the federal government to defend its interests online.

Often referred to as “The Itumbi Boys” or “Itumbots”, the group curates online discussions, spreads propaganda and otherwise works to change narratives that are deemed to be critical of the current Kenyan government, through the creation of counter hashtags or by hijacking any existing hashtags that put the administration in a bad light.

It is believed that the bloggers were hired by State House Director of Digital Communications Dennis Itumbi and are working under the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit based at State House.

#TalkToRuto why did you hire 36 bloggers to spread propaganda and counter any critic? pic.twitter.com/WwPGsliuL0 — Ojijo Dancun Oyieko (@OjijoDanOyieko) September 28, 2016

The issue of the 36 bloggers has gained prominence online, following a nationwide strike by Kenyan doctors. In December 2016, 5,000 Kenyans doctors from all state hospitals went on strike to protest the government's failure to implement and honor the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) it had entered into with the doctors’ union in 2013. Ongoing since December 5, the public support for the strike has been bolstered by allegations of millions of dollars having gone missing from the Ministry of Health. It has also brought the public healthcare system to a halt.

The effects of the strike escalated on February 13, 2017 when an appeals court judge ordered that seven officials from the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentist Union (KMPDU) be jailed for contempt of court in failing to call off the the ongoing strike.

The #GreedyDoctors Hashtag

From the very beginning of the strike, the 36 bloggers created four hashtags: #DaktariRudiKazi, (loosely translated as “Doctors, go back to work”), #GreedyDoctors, #MyBadDoctorExperience, and #DaktariMmetuchosha (loosely translated as “Doctors, we are tired of you).

The hashtags have been countered not just by union members, but also by Kenyan social media users who refuse to buy into the rhetoric that the doctors are a greedy, incompetent lot, allowing innocent Kenyans to die. This caused the efforts of the allegedly paid influencers to backfire.

The Secretary General of The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU), the body that governs all Kenyan doctors, alleged that the 36 bloggers are getting paid more money than what the government has allocated for medical research in the country:

#GreedyDoctors sponsored at Kshs 20 million to 36 bloggers vs 5000 doctors promised Kshs 11 million a year for Research. Priorities please! — KMPDU Sec Gen (@fnoluga) January 13, 2017

The Twitter account of the doctors’ union also questioned the rationale behind the hashtag #GreedyDoctors, by posting a summary of the content of the CBA:

#greedydoctors? Our “greed” is to have a better health care as outlined in our CBA. @fnoluga has outlined the “greed” points below! pic.twitter.com/WNiXruGmw9 — kmpdu (@kmpdu) January 13, 2017

Referring to one of the other hashtags, #DaktariRudiKazi, Dr. Mo shared a post by an ordinary Kenyan who was defending the doctors against malicious propaganda:

Here's from a REAL Kenyan that sees through the propaganda & double standards. #DaktariRudiKazi is one of those propagandas!#LipaKamaTender pic.twitter.com/RUDszU605T — Dr.Mo (@Moshexxx) January 12, 2017

Omar Bond tweeted:

How I wish kenyans were as angry about massive corruption , looting and mp/mca Salaries as they are about #GreedyDoctors. Hypocrites! — Omar Bond (@AstronautKE) January 17, 2017

Poriot Teko pointed out that the hashtags created by the group have flopped:

So #GreedyDoctors was a flop #mybaddoctorexperience a flop I wonder what @OleItumbi ‘s errand boys will serve tomorrow. #implementcba — Poriot Teko (@PoriotTeko) January 16, 2017

Although there are a number of mission hospitals affiliated to different religious denominations, their capacity has been strained over the last two months due to the influx of patients, many of whom can’t afford private health care.

Strike takes a toll on public health

Not all Kenyans are seeing this crisis from the viewpoint of the doctors. Many of those affected directly have an ailing close relative and are expressing their disappointment and disapproval for both parties in the crisis. AbdulKarim Taraja, whose family member has been suffering in hospital since the beginning of the strike, felt that doctors need to go back to work:

My kin has been suffering for a whole 2+ months in hospital I don't care if someone sleeps on the deck #HealthCrisisKe — Abdulkarim Taraja (@Abdtaraja) February 13, 2017

John Muiru also felt that the doctors should return to work as negotiations continue:

Can the Doctors embrace the return to work formula, as the concerned bodies come to a consensus, we are suffering #HealthCrisisKe — John Muiru (@ThisisMuiru) February 13, 2017

Meanwhile, patient deaths in hospitals continue to rise. There has not been an official number provided by the Ministry of Health of the patient death toll due the ongoing strike. There is, however, an estimate of 300 deaths from a Kenyan media house, KTN:

KTN yesterday estimated 300 have died since the start of the Doctors strike — Intellect Mogul (@GicheruGicheru) February 2, 2017

Some of these cases are making their way to Kenya’s social media space. Writing about the deaths, Soko Analyst said:

The senseless deaths I have witnessed have scarred me in ways I don't know how I will recover #DoctorsStrike https://t.co/YJdzC0tHAD — SokoAnalyst (@SokoAnalyst) February 1, 2017

Teddy Eugene narrated:

3 pregnant women denied admission at Mwala hospital, lose their infants in attempt to give birth by themselves #NursesStrike #DoctorsStrike — The African Voice (@teddyeugene) February 3, 2017

Some like Kiprono do not support the strike at all due to how doctors treat patients under their care:

I may want to support doctors strike but to remember how they treat patients esp those in public hospitals is sad — kipro kiprono (@terer_aaron) February 2, 2017

The worst affected by the doctor’s strike are the nation’s poor who can’t afford private healthcare, many of whom go to the nation’s biggest referral hospital, Kenyatta Hospital.

As the battle to improve public healthcare in Kenya continues, the battle of the hashtags will definitely continue on social media.Screenshot via the Weather Channel

Lately I’ve been looking at naked birds a lot. I’ve always liked naked birds, by which I mean birds without feathers. My favorite species of bird is the marabou stork, a grandfatherly looking bird with a mostly featherless head and an obscene appendage hanging from its neck. Once I was at the Bronx Zoo, and it started to rain, and while all the other animals took cover, the marabou stork just stood there, unperturbed, the surly old neighborhood crank who’s long past caring if he gets a little wet. Very good bird.

The marabou stork’s nakedness is natural, but there are other reasons for naked birds to be naked. Some birds are naked because they pluck their own feathers out. There are two major reasons for a bird to pluck itself naked. One is medical: The bird has some sort of condition, maybe an infection or a parasite or a disease or a bad diet. The other major reason is behavioral: The birds end up plucking out their feathers because of stress.

She is chronically naked, so nice people knit her little bird clothes to keep her warm.

This is known behavior for captive birds. Science historian and writer Laurel Braitman, who witnessed a good deal of stressed-out animals while researching her book Animal Madness, says that she’s never met anyone who has seen birds compulsively plucking their feathers in the wild. “They tend to do it when something’s wrong,” she told Audubon in 2014. “More things tend to be wrong in captivity.”

Birds are generally smart. Kept in captivity, lacking proper entertainment and interaction, their brains seem to get the better of them. So some of them end up picking out the feathers that help keep them dry and warm and safe, and they wind up looking like something you’d find on a roasting spit. They can’t help it; stress is a terrible thing. They attack the very shelter nature had given them, something neurotics of all animal classes can relate to.

I am captivated by naked birds, by their trembling little bodies. They are captured beautifully by Oliver Regueiro in this photo essay, for example. Here is a cockatoo named Oscar, who is naked thanks to a condition called beak and feather disease. She has a good home and seems like a good bird. Apparently she has been called the ugliest bird in the world, a distinction that should really go to the potoo. Earlier in the day I discovered Rhea, a wonderful naked bird with a very intense social media presence. She is chronically naked, so nice people knit her little bird clothes to keep her warm.

Anyway, for some reason, I’ve found myself staring at naked birds more and more in recent weeks. There’s something about them that feels very relatable in this current moment. They are vulnerable without their bright plumage, stripped down to their almost unrecognizable but very birdy cores.In the antivirus world, a signature is an algorithm or hash (a number derived from a string of text) that uniquely identifies a specific virus. Depending on the type of scanner being used, it may be a static hash which, in its simplest form, is a calculated numerical value of a snippet of code unique to the virus. Or, less commonly, the algorithm may be behavior-based, i.e. if this file tries to do X,Y,Z, flag it as suspicious and prompt the user for a decision.

Depending on the antivirus vendor, a signature may be referred to as a signature, a definition file, or a DAT file.

A single signature may be consistent with a large number of viruses. This allows the scanner to detect a brand new virus it has never even seen before. This ability is commonly referred to as either heuristics or generic detection. Generic detection is less likely to be effective against completely new viruses and more effective at detecting new members of an already known virus 'family' (a collection of viruses that share many of the same characteristics and some of the same code). The ability to detect heuristically or generically is significant, given that most scanners now include in excess of 250k signatures and the number of new viruses being discovered continues to increase dramatically year after year.

The reoccurring need to update

Each time a new virus is discovered that is not detectable by an existing signature, or may be detectable but cannot be properly removed because its behavior is not totally consistent with previously known threats, a new signature must be created.

After the new signature has been created and tested by the antivirus vendor, it is pushed out to the customer in the form of signature updates. These updates add the detection capability to the scan engine. In some cases, a previously provided signature might be removed or replaced with a new signature to offer better overall detection or disinfection capabilities.

Depending on the scanning vendor, updates may be offered hourly, or daily, or sometimes even weekly. Much of the need to provide signatures varies with the type of scanner it is, i.e. with what that scanner is charged with detecting. For example, adware and spyware are not nearly as prolific as viruses, thus typically an adware/spyware scanner may only provide weekly signature updates (or even less often). Conversely, a virus scanner must contend with thousands of new threats discovered each month and therefore, signature updates should be offered at least daily.

Of course, it's simply not practical to release an individual signature for each new virus discovered, thus antivirus vendors tend to release on a set schedule, covering all of the new malware they have encountered during that time frame. If a particularly prevalent or menacing threat is discovered between their regularly scheduled updates, the vendors will typically analyze the malware, create the signature, test it, and release it out-of-band (which means, release it outside of their normal update schedule).

To maintain the highest level of protection, configure your antivirus software to check for updates as often as it will allow.

Keeping the signatures up to date doesn't guarantee a new virus will never slip through, but it does make it far less likely.

Last year, before Simone Biles blew everyone away at the Olympics by winning four gold medals and being generally awesome, UCLA’s Sophina DeJesus showed the world that women’s gymnastics isn’t all about nationalism, gold medals, and overwrought NBC coverage. It can also be a whole lot of fun, for spectators and for the gymnasts.

DeJesus dabbed and nae-naed her way to viral fame, a profile in the New York Times, and an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. But her routine is not the exception in NCAA gymnastics. It’s the norm. And you can watch performances that are just as thrilling on any given Friday or Saturday or Sunday from January to April.

Over the past few years, women’s college gymnastics has taken off all over the country. The SEC and Pac-12 television networks devote hours of programming time to women’s college gym each weekend. Attendance at meets is climbing, with schools like Utah, Alabama, Georgia, and LSU at or near capacity for every home competition. And Olympic medalists are getting in on the action. Madison Kocian, who won the team gold and individual uneven bars silver in Rio, and Kyla Ross, who was a member of the 2012 gold medal–winning team from London, both just started their careers as UCLA Bruins. Ruby Harrold, a member of Great Britain’s Olympic team from Rio, just matriculated at LSU. Maggie Nichols, the 2015 world championships bronze medalist on floor exercise, is dominating at top-ranked Oklahoma.

College gymnastics, compared with the elite international version, is the same sport but a different game. There are still four apparatuses—the vault, the uneven bars, the balance beam, and the floor exercise. The routines are still evaluated subjectively, so you can feel outraged or confused about any score that doesn’t seem quite right. But the goals are different. College gymnastics still uses the “Perfect 10” system that’s now obsolete at the elite level, and the gymnasts compete according to modified Level 10 rules, which are less demanding than the ones used by Olympic gymnasts. This means you’ll see slightly easier vaults, fewer release moves and complicated pirouettes on bars, and just three tumbling passes on floor. In college, the focus is on execution rather than pushing the body to its limits. It’s less about doing every crazy skill in the Code of Points than doing a few things perfectly. And since you can still get a perfect score, that attention to detail can be rewarded. Just five weeks into the college season, there have already been seven Perfect 10s.

College gymnastics is a true team sport. At the elite level, athletes are thrown together right before major competitions and dubbed a “team.” In college, they train together, day after day, year after year. They compete together every weekend for three months out of the year. (In an average, non-Olympic year an elite gymnast might compete just three or four times.) Their lineups shift throughout the season, just as in other team sports. Freshmen get their shots to gain experience while second-stringers come off the bench to fill a void left by an injured athlete. And most of the competitions are dual meets, a setup that mirrors other sports where opponents face off against one another. At the end, there’s one winner.

For college gymnasts, the team result is everything; the rest is just commentary. They don’t even bother holding a separate competition to crown the NCAA all-around champion—the gymnast with the best four-event tally during preliminaries, when all of the athletes are focused on helping their team make the Super Six Team Finals, is declared the winner.

Olympic gymnastics is more difficult and daring. College gymnastics is more fun.

It’s clear from watching the meets that the gymnasts have embraced this team-first mentality. After years of competing at the elite or club levels, where the focus was on individual success and outcomes, they get to subsume their goals to those of a very supportive, boisterous collective. When an NCAA gymnast is on the balance beam, she’s competing for her teammates, who are screaming for her from the sidelines. When she lands her dismount, she is mobbed with hugs and high-fives. After every vault landing, stuck or otherwise, the entire team treks down the runway to congratulate the gymnast. And on floor, as the gymnast dances and tumbles her way through 90 seconds, her team is there on the sidelines, performing her choreography in solidarity.

As DeJesus’ floor routine demonstrated, NCAA gymnasts are as committed to entertaining the crowd as they are to winning. “It’s competitive and aggressive and athletic but also a show,” Spencer Barnes, who snarkily and lovingly covers women’s college gymnastics at the Balance Beam Situation, told me. “It is committed to show at every moment.”

DeJesus’ routine caught on (and Lloimincia Hall’s back in 2014), in part, because it played against the expectations of those who’d only seen women’s gymnastics during the Olympics. DeJesus performed to crowd-pleasing music, used popular club dance moves, and looked like she was having a blast.

While DeJesus is notable for her dance ability—as a kid, she’d been on the TV show Hip Hop Harry—every floor routine in college gymnastics is constructed to please the crowd. This year, one gymnast tumbles to Fox’s NFL theme music. Another plays the part of a caged lion. Oklahoma’s Nichols, performing to a song called “Don’t Let Me Down,” plays an orphan worried about being reunited with her birth mom. While not every routine is as successful as DeJesus’, there’s something to be said for going for maximum show-womanship.

Perhaps all these gymnasts are having so much fun because, for most of them at least, the college game is their four-year farewell tour. There is no professional league for gymnastics. Although there are many former elites in the NCAA, most competitors did not compete at the sport’s top level before college. Even for those who did make it to the pinnacle, it can be very hard to get back into elite gymnastics after college—their bodies are more beat up after an additional four years of training and competitions. For all but a small group—among them UCLA’s Mohini Bhardwaj and Anna Li, University of Denver’s Jessica López, and Georgia’s Brittany Rogers—college is the end of the road. But you could do a lot worse than finishing out your competitive career on live TV in front of packed houses.

In addition to turning out gymnastics fans and young gymnasts, the college version of the sport taps into pre-existing fandoms. When I attended a meet between UCLA and Utah in Salt Lake City in early 2015, I sat next to season ticket holders who’d started attending competitions in the mid-1990s because they had been Utah basketball and football fans. There is no other context outside of the Olympics where gymnastics draws in viewers who are not explicitly fans of the sport.

And college gymnastics is just as good on television as it is in the arena. Sports, like award shows, are meant to be enjoyed live. You wouldn’t want to watch a basketball game if you already knew the final score; ditto for gymnastics. While NBC insists on showing Olympic gymnastics on a tape delay, the SEC and Pac-12 networks treat college gym like a real sporting event. A lot of the fun of watching a college meet comes from not knowing how it’s going to turn out. Unlike in elite competitions, where the U.S. women win titles by 8 points, the margins in college gymnastics are razor-thin, typically coming down to just a few tenths—just a handful of unstuck vault landings or beam wobbles.In the wake of Trump’s victory in November, the present leadership of the Democratic Party has failed to grasp the lessons of its own defeat. “I don’t think people want a new direction,” Nancy Pelosi insisted on Meet the Press just after the election. The DNC doubled down on that position in early January, announcing the creation of an anti-Trump “war room” staffed with Clinton operatives who will continue attacking Trump’s ethics, character, and speculative ties to Russia. This is the same strategy that failed to win the presidential election against a palpably flawed and eminently beatable candidate.

The nascent left rejects the idea that our current crisis will be resolved by technocratic solutions alone.

Though fragmented and incipient, this nascent left is now best placed to mount a convincing opposition to Trump, and to engage with the forces that brought him to power. With its focus on economic inequality and collective action, the left knows things that liberals have been reluctant to acknowledge, or in any event to say—knowledge that is necessary to embrace the populist moment, push back on its reactionary inclinations, and seize its progressive potential. The left is able to diagnose the malfunctioning of our democracy because, unlike the Democratic establishment, it starts from the premise that American democracy as it is currently constituted is profoundly insufficient.

The Sanders campaign recovered eclipsed ways of talking about politics and the economy, and began reinventing them; in resisting Trump, left ideas can help to make sense of our shared experience, suggesting how life came to be as it is, and how it might be different. None of this guarantees political success, of course. But it does mean that, far from being dreamily irrelevant, the left must place itself firmly at the center of the fights ahead.

At its heart, the new populism is a revival of themes that many well-intentioned liberals thought had been stamped out long ago, at least in the world’s rich, culturally avant-garde countries: nationalism, battles over international trade, the relationship between democracy and capitalism. The liberal elites of the Clinton-Obama years believed that history itself was over, and that they were charged with supervising the eternal present that followed. Whether they had read Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man, or simply absorbed a version of his ideas through liberal think tanks and Thomas Friedman’s columns, it comes to the same thing: They held that democratic capitalism, plus the defense of human rights, was the only theoretical framework left standing for making sense of human life.

This serene confidence left liberals in the United States and Europe totally unprepared for the present wave of populist insurgencies by millions of people who, whatever their other grievances, do not feel secure or dignified in their economic lives. At home, populism currently encompasses both the left-wing version of Bernie Sanders, with its calls for universal health care and a regulatory crackdown on Wall Street, and Donald Trump’s blend of atmospheric anti-elitism and a largely right-wing economic agenda. Abroad, Marine le Pen’s ethno-nationalist populism is building in France, and Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalism has swept India. We are living through a return of history.

Over the past year, two competing explanations for the populist wave have emerged. On the one hand, journalists like John Judis and Nate Cohn have traced political discontent to economic inequality and insecurity. In The Populist Explosion, Judis argues that Democrats in the United States and Europe’s social-democratic parties gave up the traditional working-class vote when they embraced free trade, failed to acknowledge class conflict, and withdrew from their traditional alliances with unions. By contrast, writing in The Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates argues that Republicans won by mobilizing voters who rejected a black president. At Vox, Dylan Matthews reviewed polling data and concluded that the concerns of Trump supporters are “heavily about race.”

It is perfectly clear that both economic inequality and racism fueled support for Trump. Only the left is equipped to explain how these two factors are entangled, by looking at the experience of life under capitalism. In this economy, most people lack important forms of security and control over their lives. They answer to bosses, who answer to investors, who answer to global flows of goods and capital. As Marx pointed out long ago, the system assigns the roles, and people fill them. An investor need not be a greedy person, nor a boss a bossy one; but if they do not maximize returns in the face of competition, they will be replaced by someone who will try harder, so they had better be prepared to act greedy, or bossy, or—in the case of the line worker—diligent and subservient.

When no one talks about how the system itself produces economic insecurity and a loss of control, scapegoating falls on the groups and individuals closest at hand. Immigrants particularly get scapegoated because often they are willing to take low-paying jobs or lack legal authorization to work. When no one in politics talks about brutal economic realities—including a merciless and de-unionized labor market, the unfettered mobility of capital, and the investor-driven imperative to squeeze every possible “efficiency” out of people—then your competitor for wages on the building site becomes the only economic rival you can actually see. Racism and xenophobia are not merely symptoms of economic anxiety, and are not to be morally or politically excused on account of hard times. But they are likely to be stronger and more politically effective when there appears to be no other way for people to address their sense of helplessness.

Liberals tend to ignore this analysis, and to personalize racism and xenophobia as moral failings, because they think the necessary preconditions for a decent cosmopolitanism are already in place: markets and multiculturalism. Conservatives from Edmund Burke to Ross Douthat have argued almost the opposite. They posit that people are basically tribal, and therefore all forms of cosmopolitanism, from liberal humanitarianism to socialist solidarity, are utopian fantasies that will reliably fall apart in the harsh light of human nature.

The left presents an alternative view: We simply don’t know what kinds of solidarity people would be capable of if they felt control and security in their lives. Historically, xenophobia and racism have been inseparable from enslavement, imperialism, economic domination or competition, and fear of losing one’s place. At the same time, people have shown enormous flexibility and resilience when they encounter changing notions of national identity (a concept that hardly existed in present form a few centuries ago), religion (witness rising secularization and syncretism), and gender identity (where our notion of “human nature” is turning out to be full of new expressions). There is no reason to assume, as conservatives tend to conclude, that what we already know marks a natural limit of human behavior or potential.

On the national stage, however, the left has not always made these ideas clear. The Sanders campaign lacked a political vocabulary for talking about the complex realities of capitalism. On the issue of trade, for example, Sanders roundly criticized liberal agreements such as NAFTA for hollowing out American industry, but he often failed to follow this deeper economic logic to its conclusion. Restricting imports would not, by itself, bring back some twentieth-century idyll in which workers shared the fruits of robust economic growth. Yes, American industries might gain a greater portion of global expenditure. But that would merely increase profits at the top—so long as investors like Mitt Romney and bosses like Donald Trump can hold automation or mass firings over the heads of recalcitrant workers.

To understand how the U.S. economy is changing, you have to understand not just trade but property law that gives workers no claim on the wealth they help to produce; labor law that makes firing easy and union organizing hard; and corporate law that helped Donald Trump stay rich while leaving indebted municipalities and investors in his wake. Turning these features of the market into political issues would help show economic life not as a naturalseeming struggle for survival, but as a legally constructed competition as arbitrary as the rules of the Hunger Games.

The left needs to get better at talking about how the economy affects the way workers view themselves and their political options—their sense of what they deserve and what is possible. The Rolling Jubilee gets at these themes by suggesting that debt is not necessarily a deep moral obligation, that there is justice in eliminating it. Calls for a universal basic income reflect the idea that people deserve some share of the world’s good things, some elementary security, just for showing up—that not everything has to be earned on the market or inherited from one’s parents. Likewise, in the Sanders campaign’s insistence on social entitlements as a right of citizenship, not a shameful badge of dependence, there was a glimpse of the older, social-democratic idea that the economy should produce not simply abstract efficiency, but security and dignified work.

The current resurgence of populism is linked to a crisis in the functioning of democracy itself. Trump won the election by scorning the political system and vandalizing its norms. But he did not create the conditions for his chaotic campaign; he merely fed on them. In much-discussed recent work, political scientists Yascha Mounk and Roberto Stefan Foa found that young people across Europe and the United States are increasingly skeptical of democracy and sympathetic to strong-man rule, even military government. People may not be clear what they are rejecting when they say they don’t care about democracy, but the air of indifference and hostility is unmistakable.

In the months since the election, many have struggled to understand why voters behaved the way they did. Some centrist commentators have expressed misgivings about democracy itself, arguing that it becomes self-indulgent and destructive unless responsible elites step forward to guide political passions. Joseph Schumpeter, the Austrian émigré economist, provided a memorable slogan for these worries when he wrote, in 1942, that “the typical citizen drops down to a lower level of mental performance as soon as he enters the political field.… He becomes a primitive again.” In democracies, Schumpeter continued, political judgment is “unintelligent and irresponsible,” and “may prove fatal” to any country that it governs. Writing in New York magazine after the election, Andrew Sullivan seemed to agree, arguing that support for Trump was “absolute and total . . . not like that of a democratic leader but of a cult leader fused with the idea of the nation.”

There is some truth to these arguments. We know from our everyday lives that much of our decision-making is not entirely rational. But Trump has played on a deep sense of unreality about the political process. His candidacy reflected the peculiar idea that someone “strong” and “smart” could singlehandedly master a complex world, untangle the politics of the Middle East and the South China Sea, renegotiate trade agreements, and see behind the obfuscations of intelligence agencies. This is a bizarre view of what it means to act in politics. It combines the epistemic amateurism of the conspiracy theorist with the virtual self-assertion of a first-person-shooter video game. It is an approach to politics tailored to people for whom politics is a domain of fantasy.

Who could expect political judgment to arise spontaneously in a world that does not afford many people the experience of participating in actual self-rule? Political judgment, like any other skill, is trained in practice. The decline of unions has meant fewer opportunities for workers to vote, debate, and even strike over issues that directly affect them. At the same time, the consolidation of businesses into large, integrated operations has meant that the ordinary experience of work for many people involves taking orders in a one-way and often remote hierarchy. The decline of voluntary civic and political organizations has made opportunities for democratic participation scarcer still. Although people can express themselves loudly online, or at concerts, sports events, and Trump rallies, they have few chances to practice making shared decisions with concrete consequences. The essential links between opinions and consequences are, in daily life, very weak.

This weakened sense of what it means to participate in a democracy comes at the same time as a crisis of shared truth. Rough-and-ready American success once bolstered the notion that a rich country with a “free market of ideas” should be able to sustain a good-enough democracy more or less automatically. It is increasingly clear, however, that the market for ideas works much like the market for recreational drugs: People consume the ones that relieve them of their ordinary miseries and make them feel special. Thanks to the proliferation of ideological media, citizens now enjoy the same range of choice in facts as in ideas.

Liberals and those further to the left differ sharply over how to respond to these threats to democracy. The Democratic Party professionals who circulated among the Clinton campaign and its affiliated institutions tend to accept Schumpeter’s pessimism about democratic irrationality. Instead of appealing to voters’ reason, their campaigns slice and dice voters into marketing categories. They then make targeted moral and emotional appeals to them (Trump is a bad man; be with Hillary), and use canvassing technology to prod swing-state voters who, their data models inform them, will likely support the Democrat. Clinton canvassers in Michigan, where she narrowly lost, were instructed not to engage in “persuasion,” but just to make yet another phone call or flyer drop to beleaguered folks who showed up on party lists as likely Democrats. Clinton counted on the political rationality only of an elite class of technocrats, whom she expected to bring in a victory.

By contrast, there is a swath of activists to the left of the Democratic establishment whose politics center on fostering self-rule. Labor organizers try to shore up the power of workers in workplaces from fast-food chains to universities that run on the labor of underpaid and overworked adjunct faculties. In places like Durham, North Carolina, activists from Black Lives Matter have gone beyond street protests to craft alternative municipal budgets that would redirect new expenditures on police into more inclusive and productive forms of community investment. The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of groups within Black Lives Matter, has called for community oversight boards to supervise police departments.

These activists reject the idea that our current political crisis will be resolved by technocratic solutions or get-out-the-vote strategies alone. Over the past 50 years, low-information, low-energy democracy has limped through a period when technology and elite institutions kept disagreement within a workable range of opinion. Today, however, technology and markets will produce increasingly self-indulgent and nihilistic forms of politics, unless our response goes beyond trying to restore the familiar consensus, and pushes toward deeper forms of democratic power.

The Sanders campaign showed that it is possible to connect this sort of ground-level democracy-building with demands for a larger-scale renovation of democracy. Sanders campaigned on overturning the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, which gives corporations the power to invest unlimited sums in political campaigns, and on moving toward a system of public financing for elections, breaking the undue influence of private wealth altogether. He also advocated easing ballot access and making Election Day a national holiday—effectively halting Republican efforts to deny the vote to minorities and other Democratic-leaning constituencies.

It would be implausible to suggest that the American left is on the cusp of any great victory. It remains far from most concrete forms of political power. Yet its intellectual clarity can help guide and coordinate the work of grassroots activists, open up new alternatives for voters, and raise the bar of public argument. Five years ago, when Occupy set up in Zuccotti Park, talk of economic inequality had long been condescended to as “class warfare.” Today, no serious argument about American politics can avoid the underlying economic reality. Pundits like David Brooks may still get away with regretting, as he recently did, that “globalism” suffers only from being “despiritualized.” In the years ahead, perhaps it will finally become impossible to talk about globalism without talking about capitalism and democracy.

Two caveats are terrifically important. First, none of this will be easy. That is in large part because the Democratic Party establishment believes in the rightness and adequacy of its ideas and is committed to maintaining its power. From the Democratic National Committee to Clinton-friendly commentators such as Paul Krugman, mainstream Democrats mocked and belittled the Sanders campaign and its supporters. Many will continue to denounce anyone to their left as naïve at best, dangerous at worst. The left must respond with ambitious but rigorous argument. We will need to challenge the establishment to address the threat of rising nationalism and the crises of inequality and democracy, while also building power that the mainstream cannot ignore.

Second, none of this criticism of liberals means jettisoning or demoting the core liberal commitments to personal freedom, especially free speech and other civil liberties. The point of the left’s criticism of liberals is that these sorts of rights are not enough to secure dignified lives or meaningful self-rule under capitalism, inherited racial inequality, and an ever-deepening surveillance state. Liberal values are not enough; but they are essential. A broader left program would work to deepen people’s lived experience of liberty, equality, and democracy—values to which liberals and the left share a commitment.

A political party, as Trump and the Tea Party have both demonstrated, is well worth fighting to take over.

For now, the left should follow the lead of Bernie Sanders, and that of many activists who have entered state and local politics, by fielding candidates for elected office. In the two-party system of American elections, the Democratic Party is the natural vehicle for campaigns like those of anticorruption activist Zephyr Teachout, who ran for Congress in upstate New York, and Occupy veteran Jillian Johnson, who won a seat on the city council in Durham, North Carolina. The party exists to maximize political power and to support a network of consultants, think tankers, friendly journalists, and patronage seekers. The left wastes energy when it vents its indignation at the Democratic Party for being an ordinary party in these respects. By the same token, however, the left owes nothing to everyday partisanship. A political party, as Trump and the Tea Party have both demonstrated, is well worth fighting to take over; beyond that, there is nothing in it that deserves loyalty or deference.

Nor should the left take its blueprint entirely from the Sanders campaign, as extraordinary as it was. Back in October 2011, in the convivial shipwreck that was the Occupy library, it would have seemed impossible for a self-described democratic socialist to become the country’s most popular politician, as Sanders was in October 2016. In Zuccotti Park, it seemed utopian to imagine that the young activists who shut down Wall Street would wind up reviving generations of work for economic justice and democracy. Now their insights and efforts, once derided as hopelessly insufficient, serve as our starting point, however tenuous and endangered in this bizarre and chauvinistic political moment. Who can say what utopias will come over the horizon next?Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, “never Trump.” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me.

So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.

I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time. We’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that.

And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we’ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That’s always a possibility.

I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done.

A new Rasmussen poll, in fact — because the people get it — much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it. Let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is — to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, “Oh, that’s good.” Now it means, “That’s good for jobs.” Very different.

Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league — Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit — a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s OK, too.

TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.

I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking — and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure; we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say — they’re honest and fantastic.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But much of it is not a — the distortion — and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea — we’ll take care of it folks; we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.

Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you’ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand.

We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He’s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it’s in large sections of the world.

They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer — another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great from Congress, generally.

We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it’s depleted — it won’t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I’m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.

We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.

Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons.

And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222, 230’s impossible.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media’s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason.

And — but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o’clock on Saturday and I heard — just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved.

And they’re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague — highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We’re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about and we can’t let that happen.

So, if the Democrats who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.

I’ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks — in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals but we’re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We’re going to have one on one deals.

We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process — they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.

Now, they may be rejected with me but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries. We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.

We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say “let me see your regulations” and they’re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental — all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.

We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation — take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible.

We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer.

We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general — now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke.

We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day.

The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order.

I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.

In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is — that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.

We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

TRUMP: And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I’ve started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.

We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.

So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It’s already happening. But big league.

I’ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.

You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.

Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.

Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.

Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here.

General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here.

Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.

Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we’re naming.

Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades — decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.

And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.

This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week.

Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there.

And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.

Mara (ph), Mara (ph), go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.

He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong — what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem.

And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this — that they know nothing about it; they weren’t in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.

It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal — I think it’s very important — the illegal, giving out classified information. It was — and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.

I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s — I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it’s out there for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.

Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I’m saying — the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it?

You know why? Because it’s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Yes, go ahead.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, “I don’t think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right.” He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, “Huh, that’s fine.” That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to — he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He’s doing the job.

You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.

But he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.

Yes?

QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was — it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really — I mean, they were such a minor part. They — I hadn’t spoken to them.

I think the one person — I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.

The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that.

That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s — by the way, who’s by the way a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody — people knew that. Everybody knew that.

So, these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.

He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that’s the extent.

Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.

As you know, Mike Pompeo has — has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.

And just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time’s story, yesterday. And it talked about — these are (ph) front page.

So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.

So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.

But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.

And it was totally — they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.

OK, go ahead.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph), or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 (OFF-MIKE).

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Yeah.

QUESTION: Obama (OFF-MIKE) 426 on (OFF-MIKE). So why should Americans...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: ...I’m skipping that information, I don’t know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) why should Americans trust you (OFF-MIKE) the information (OFF-MIKE)?

TRUMP: Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given — I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that’s...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes?

QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did — whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?

What— what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

TRUMP: We are.

QUESTION: Can we ask what you’re going to do and also, we’ve heard about a — a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?

TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they’re in position so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.

The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he’s offered his services and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.

As far as the general’s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn’t think.

It was really, what happened after that but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said “well I don’t see” — to me, he was doing the job.

The information was provided by — who I don’t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said “doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there.” But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as — as far as the actual making the call, fact I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.

That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So — and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man.

QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks — on the leaks, sir...

TRUMP: ...Go ahead. Finish off then I’ll get you.

QUESTION: I’m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You’ve said twice today...

TRUMP: ...Yes, we’re looking at them very — very, very serious. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies — I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate.

We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment — when I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised.

But I said “you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen” but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said “that’s terrible that it was leaked” but it wasn’t that important. But then I said to myself “what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?”

What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very — you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don’t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.

So I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the “Washington Post” and gets put into the “New York Times” and I’m saying “what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?

We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.

QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?

TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.

It’s very important to me and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and, you know, over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m OK with that. But I’m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.

I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good — he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim (ph). It’s OK, Jim (ph), you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now but I think that actually — I think that’d actually be better.

People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter (ph), is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower — I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I’d appreciate it — again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.

TRUMP: I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking, some of them had them approved immediately.

I’m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they’d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody’s good.

And sometimes — I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s OK. That’s fine. But I think it would — I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics.

And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.

Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine — seriously — can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric — you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We’ll do you next Jim, I do you next(ph).

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) clarify —

TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure

QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador —

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

TRUMP: No, I didn’t.

QUESTION: — prior to your — TRUMP: No, I didn’t.

QUESTION: — inauguration.

TRUMP: No, I didn’t.

QUESTION: And then fired him —

TRUMP: Excuse me.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.

I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way — and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that.

No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. OK? Jim?

QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don’t hate you. I don’t hate you.

TRUMP: OK.

QUESTION: So, pass that along —

TRUMP: Ask — ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK?

QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir —

TRUMP: Well, that’s — well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.

QUESTION: It’s pretty good right now, actually.

TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John.

QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time —

TRUMP: I was OK with it.

QUESTION: — you said — you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I’m wondering, sir, if you — TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

QUESTION: Then(ph), your(ph) numbers(ph) were off too.

TRUMP: No — no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that.

QUESTION: If — if I may ask you, sir, it — it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during(ph) the campaign —

TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready?

QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that —

TRUMP: No — no, but let me do one at a time.

QUESTION: If I may as a follow up?

TRUMP: Do you mind?

QUESTION: Yes, sir.

TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.

He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information. But in one case, you’re talking about classified — regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong — at my suggestion — and I give Reince great credit for this — at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.

I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so — they were — when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn’t even in the papers.

Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she — and she should have reported herself.

Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, “I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.” QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don’t understand. It seems that there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?

TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: You know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t — you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not. I just see many, many untruthful things.

And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word “tone.” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that — the tone is such hatred.

I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people. They’re very — not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That’s all I can say. It’s the most honest.

But the tone, Jim. If you look — the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes — sometimes somebody gets...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.

Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know.

I — I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s — it’s brutal.

Now, they’ll take this news conference — I’m actually having a very good time, OK? But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget, that’s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK?

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: No, that’s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure. But I’m having a good time.

Tomorrow, they will say, “Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.” I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But — but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it.

But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump rants and raves.” I’m not ranting and raving.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup...

TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have — let him have a little bit more?

Sit down. Sit down. We’ll...

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...

TRUMP: I’m changing it from fake news, though.

QUESTION: Doesn’t that under...

TRUMP: Very fake news.

QUESTION: ... I know, but aren’t you...

(LAUGHTER)

TRUMP: Go ahead.

QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news.

TRUMP: And you’re not related to our new...

QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.

TRUMP: I looked — you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.

QUESTION: I’m sure you checked that out, sir.

TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it — I said — they said, “No, sir.” I said, “Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.”

QUESTION: But aren’t you — aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don’t like “fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like.

TRUMP: I do that.

QUESTION: When you call it “fake news,” you’re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important.

TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here’s the thing. OK. I understand what you’re — and you’re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, “Wow, that’s going to be a great story.” And I’ll get killed.

I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive — sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make OK. They’ll even make it negative.

So I understand it. So, because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me.

Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?

Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go — as an example, you’re CNN, I mean it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph).

You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying “here’s my chief of staff,” a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right?

We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some — all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know — and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said “you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.” I mean, they’re fake. They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame because he’d rather be working on healthcare, he’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph).

I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there’s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know — you know, whatever reason. But — and I understand that. But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.

And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead.

QUESTION: (inaudible) ...for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news? And second...

TRUMP: ...I think they don’t believe it. I don’t think the public — that’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don’t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that’s a ruse. That’s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.

Now tomorrow, you’ll say “Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.” It’s not terrible. It’s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.

Nobody talks about that. I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?

Hillary Clinton — that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who’s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said “I know politically it’s probably not good for me.” The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles off shore right out of the water.

Everyone in this country’s going to say “oh, it’s so great.” That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you’ve had a lot of presidents that haven’t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can — now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But — but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.

Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said “you know.” He’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying “you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.” OK?

And that’s a shame because if we could get along with Russia — and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.

QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)?

QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you...

TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.

So we’ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid- March. And after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform.

Yes?

QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.

TRUMP: OK.

QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel — the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.

TRUMP: Not good.

QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.

TRUMP: Not good.

QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign ...

TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, “Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States; there’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.” Because the — you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, “Oh, isn’t that wonderful.” But I know you well enough.

Then you would say, “Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn’t have done that.” Look, all of the...

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I’m different than those people.

Go ahead.

QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?

TRUMP: I have. I have. And I’m so beautifully represented. I’m so honored that the Senate approved him. He’s going to be fantastic.

Yes, I think that I’ve already...

QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?

TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now.

Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal.

Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal. I don’t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough — the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.

If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There’s no upside. We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.

They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.

QUESTION: So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are...

TRUMP: Who did I say is not good?

QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they’re not good.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: No, it’s not good, but they happened.

QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine...

TRUMP: They all happened recently.

No...

(CROSSTALK)

QUESTION: ... this country’s ability to work with Russia?

TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they’re doing because they’re doing the same thing.

Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK?

But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia.

QUESTION: Can we...

TRUMP: I gave — you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.

QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?

TRUMP: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. “We are going to attack Mosul in four months.” Then three months later, “We are going to attack Mosul in one month.” “Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.”

In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things, you’re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you. I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.” I don’t have to do that. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.

TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you.

OK.

QUESTION: Could I just ask you — thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble...

TRUMP: Where are you from?

QUESTION: BBC.

TRUMP: Here’s another beauty.

QUESTION: That’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair.

TRUMP: Yeah. Sure.

QUESTION: Mr. President...

TRUMP: Just like CNN right?

QUESTION: On the travel ban — we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...

TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...

QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...

TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.

Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it’s 80 percent of the time, a lot.

We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.

That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.

Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.

Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.

You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there.

Kelly said you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don’t have time to come in.

Now nobody ever reports that. But that’s why we did it quickly.

Now, if I would’ve done it a month, everything would’ve been perfect. The problem is we would’ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would’ve come into our country.

Now in the meantime, we’re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed.

QUESTION: Just a brief follow-up. But if it’s so urgent, why not introduce...

TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?

TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.

QUESTION: During the election?

TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...

QUESTION: So you’re not aware of any contact during the course..

TRUMP: Look, look, look...

QUESTION: ... of the election?

TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?

QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.

I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important.

Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to.

I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.

We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk.

I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.

Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that — whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.

QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?

TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he — now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right?

He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.

QUESTION: Mr. President...

TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks?

QUESTION: Mr. President...

TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five?

QUESTION: Mr. President, on national...

TRUMP: Wait. Let’s see. Who’s — I want to find a friendly reporter.

QUESTION: Mr....

TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)...

TRUMP: Go ahead.

QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the — anyone on your staff of being (OFF-MIKE).

Because (OFF-MIKE). However, what we’ve already heard about and what we (OFF-MIKE) is (OFF-MIKE) so you’re general forecast (ph) like 48 (OFF-MIKE). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the (OFF-MIKE)...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP:...he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not, its not, not — not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question.

So here’s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti- Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican — quiet, quiet, quiet.

See, he lied about — he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.

I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it.

So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Thank you, I’m Lisa (ph) from the...

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines?

TRUMP: Yeah.

QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific...

TRUMP: It’s a very fair question.

QUESTION: ...countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.

TRUMP: Right.

QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?

TRUMP: We’re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.

In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way — it’s a very — it’s a very, very tough subject.

We’re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is — is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.

But the DACA situation is a very, very — it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.

I’m not talking about new laws, I’m talking the existing law, is very rough, it’s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.

But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we’re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.

And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK?

QUESTION: Mr. President...

(CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?

TRUMP: Yes.

QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what’s first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean...

TRUMP: Now, that’s what I call a nice question. That is very — who are you with?

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

TRUMP: Good, I’m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania’s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.

And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania’s gonna be outstanding, that’s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.

She, like others that she’s working with, feel very, very strongly about women’s issue, women’s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she’s a very, very strong advocate. I think she’s a great representative for this country.

And a funny thing happens, because she gets — she gets so unfairly — Melania, the things they say. I’ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well.

She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find. And the things they say — I’ve known her for a long time — the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.

I’ll just tell you this. I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady. She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they’re not doing this for money.

They’re not doing this for pay, they’re doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school — because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left — she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that’s a very nice question.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump?

TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s OK.

QUESTION: It doesn’t(ph) have(ph) to be a bad question.

TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.

QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you’re —

TRUMP: Fix the inner cities.

QUESTION: — president. Fixing the inner cities.

TRUMP: Yep.

QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that’s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn’t bad, was it?

TRUMP: That was very professional and very good.

QUESTION: I’m very professional.

TRUMP: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while and I’d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.

I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.

And by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible — you know, it takes a long time.

It’s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we’re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.

You go to some of these inner city places and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people — and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it — in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.

They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So, we’re going to be very, very strong. That’s a great question and — and it’s a — it’s a very difficult situation because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix.

We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know.

There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all — and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.

I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK?

QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going — are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your — your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as —

TRUMP: Am I going to include who?

QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional —

TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?

QUESTION: — Hispanic Caucus —

TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting?

QUESTION: No — no — no. I’m not —

TRUMP: Are they friends of yours?

QUESTION: I’m just a reporter.

TRUMP: Well, then(ph) set up the meeting.

QUESTION: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.

TRUMP: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting.

I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.

QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.

TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can’t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told — he was probably told “don’t meet with Trump. It’s bad politics.”

And that’s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more.

QUESTION: (inaudible)

TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.

QUESTION: (inaudible) ...not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible), some of it by supporters in your name. What do you...

TRUMP: ...And some of it — can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side and you think it’s like playing it straight?

No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead.

QUESTION: You’re the president now. What are you going to do about it?

TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that?

QUESTION: What are you going to do about — what are you going to do about (inaudible).

TRUMP: Oh, I’m working on it. I’m working on it very — no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided — I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.

We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education, we’re going to work on — you know, we’re going to stop — we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we’re going to try and stop crime.

We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me — but this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try — I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much.

It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.

The following women have alleged as a matter of public record that Bill Cosby sexually assaulted or raped them. They are listed in the order their allegations became public.

1. Lachele Covington. Covington, an actress who was 20 at the time, filed a police report alleging that Cosby pushed her hand toward his penis after inviting her to his New York home on Jan. 25, 2000 to give her career advice. The New York Post reported that authorities "decided no crime had been committed because until the very moment Covington pulled her hand away, all actions had been consensual." A Cosby spokesperson called the story "not true."

2. Andrea Constand. Constand told Ontario police in January 2005 that a year prior, when she was 31, she had visited Cosby at his home in Pennsylvania seeking career advice. (Constand, an Ontario native, worked at the time for Temple University, Cosby's alma mater.) Constand alleges he gave her "herbal" pills for anxiety, then “touched her breasts and vaginal area, rubbed his penis against her hand, and digitally penetrated” her. The Pennsylvania prosecutor who looked into the case has said that while he didn't bring charges because the available evidence was not sufficient, he found Constand "credible" and found Cosby "evasive." After prosecutors declined to charge him, Constand filed a civil suit against Cosby for $150 million; her suit cited, anonymously, 13 other women who alleged that he had sexually assaulted them. (Some of those women, referred to as "Jane Does" in legal language, have since identified themselves publicly and are mentioned below. The identities of Jane Doe witnesses are disclosed to defendants so their testimony can be fairly researched and challenged, but they are not ID'd by name in court or in public records.) Cosby's attorney called Constand's claims "utterly preposterous." The suit was settled for an undisclosed amount in 2006.

3. Shawn Brown. The National Enquirer reported in 2005 that Brown, who has also gone by the name Shawn Upshaw, says Cosby drugged and raped her while she was unconscious. The site Hollywood, Interrupted also published her allegations in 2007. Brown has now given an interview to the Daily Mail, which ran a piece on Nov. 26, 2014 detailing her story. Brown says she was in a consensual sexual relationship with Cosby in 1973 when he drugged and raped her at a house in Beverly Hills. Brown's daughter, Autumn Jackson, was jailed in 1998 for attempting to extort the comedian, who Brown believes to be Jackson's father. (Cosby has admitted sleeping with Brown but has said he is not Jackson's father.)



4. Tamara Green. In February of 2005, Green, a retired trial attorney, appeared on The Today Show and told Matt Lauer that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in the '70s. Green was working as a model and met Cosby through mutual friends, she says, and he once offered her what he told her was cold medicine when she was ill. When she began to feel incapacitated, she alleges, he offered to take her home, where he began groping and undressing her; when she struggled, he left, leaving behind two $100 bills on her table. Cosby's attorney issued the following response (which referenced Green's maiden name, Lucier): "Miss Green’s allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or Tamara Lucier, and the incident she describes did not happen." Green was one of the Jane Does cited in Constand's lawsuit.



5. Beth Ferrier. In June 2005, Ferrier, 46 at the time, told the Philadelphia Daily News that Cosby drugged her coffee when she visited him before a performance in Denver when she was 25. Ferrier, who worked as a model, had been in a consensual relationship with Cosby that ended before the alleged assault; she met him through mutual acquantainces and had believed he would help her with her career. Ferrier was also a Jane Doe.

6. Barbara Bowman. In 2006, Bowman publicly identified herself as one of Constand's Jane Does via an article in Philadelphia Magazine, though she didn't discuss details of her accusation at the time. In October of this year—after comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a performance—Bowman, now 47 and an artist, spoke about her experience to the Daily Mail. When she was 17 and pursuing a career as a model and actress, she says, she met Cosby, who she says pursued a mentor-mentee relationship with her and drugged and assaulted her multiple times. (While the Daily Mail can be unreliable, Bowman later vouched for its version of her account in a Washington Post piece.) Bowman's account mentions that during their first encounter he asked her to wet her hair and pretend to be drunk while he stroked her, an incident similar to those recounted by other accusers.

7. Joan Tarshis. On Nov. 16, 2014 Joan Tarshis, a 64-year-old music industry publicist and journalist, told Hollywood Elsewhere that Cosby raped her twice in 1969 when she was 19 years old and pursuing a career as a writer in L.A. Tarshis says Cosby first assaulted her after he invited her to work on material with him in his bungalow and made her a drink that caused her to lose consciousness.

8. Linda Joy Traitz. Now 63, Traitz wrote on Facebook on Nov. 17, 2014 that Cosby assaulted her when she was 19 and working as a waitress at a restaurant that he partially owned. Traitz alleges that Cosby offered her a ride home from the restaurant but instead drove her to a beach and tried to force her to take pills to help her "relax." Traitz told CNN he then groped her chest, pushed her down, and tried to lie on top of her. Traitz has a criminal record that includes imprisonment on a drug trafficking conviction; in a response to her allegations, Marty Singer, an attorney representing Cosby, cited her troubled past and said she lacks credibility.

9. Janice Dickinson. On Nov. 18, 2014 model and reality TV personality Janice Dickinson, now 59, told Entertainment Tonight that Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982. At a dinner in Lake Tahoe at which they were to discuss her career, she says, she asked him for a pill for period cramps, and that "the last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain." Singer, Cosby's attorney, called Dickinson's story "a fabricated lie." Dickinson says Cosby's attorneys kept her from including a description of the alleged assault in a 2002 book, but Singer says she never wrote such a description and was never contacted by Cosby representatives.

10. Therese Serignese. The Huffington Post printed allegations made against Cosby by Serignese, a 57-year-old nurse in Boca Raton, Florida, on Nov. 20, 2014. She says she encountered Cosby in 1976 when she was 19 years old; he was headlining a show at the Las Vegas Hilton, she alleges, and approached her in the hotel gift shop. Backstage in the green room, he allegedly gave her drugs, and when she came to he was having sex with her in a bathroom, she says. Serignese subsequently stayed in contact with Cosby and accepted money from him—which he had promised to give her if she pursued an education and received good grades. She told the HuffPo that at one point in their relationship (it's not clear when) he asked her to wet her hair and pretend to be an actress.

11. Carla Ferrigno. Carla Ferrigno, an actress and the wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, told Rumorfix on Nov. 20, 2014 that in 1967 Cosby grabbed her and forcefully kissed her at a party while his wife was in another room.

12. Louisa Moritz. Moritz, a 68-year-old lawyer and onetime actress who appeared in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, told TMZ in a story published Nov. 20, 2014 that in 1971, Cosby forced her to perform oral sex on him in the greenroom of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Singer responded by saying allegations against Cosby have "reached a point of absurdity" and alleging that Moritz has been the subject of professional sanctions: "Mortiz is a lawyer who was disciplined by the California State Bar and ordered not to practice. We pulled the documents -- she can't practice because she didn't report certain quarterly reports."

13. Renita Chaney Hill. Hill, now 47, says she met Cosby when she was 15 and he was filming an educational TV segment in Pittsburgh. Hill says they stayed in touch for four years—that Cosby flew her to meet with him in various cities and kept in touch with her parents, asking them about her grades in school. On Nov. 20, 2014 a Pittsburgh CBS affiliate broadcast an interview with Hill in which she said she believes Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her on more than one occasion during their relationship.

14. Michelle Hurd. Actress Michelle Hurd, known for her roles on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Gossip Girl, among others, described Cosby as being “very inappropriate” with her when she was doing stand-in work on the Cosby Show. “It started innocently, lunch in his dressing room, daily, then onto weird acting exercises were he would move his hands up and down my body, (can’t believe I fell for that) I was instructed to NEVER tell anyone what we did together,” Hurd reportedly wrote in a Facebook post on Nov. 20, 2014. “I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened... I then started to take notice and found another actress, a stand-in as well, and we started talking….. A LOT …. turns out he was doing the same thing to her, almost by the numbers, BUT, she did go to his house and because I will not name her, and it is her story to tell, all I’ll say is she awoke, after being drugged, vomited, and then Cosby told her there’s a cab waiting for you outside.”

15. Angela Leslie. On Nov. 21, 2014 the New York Daily News reported that a 52-year-old former model-actress named Angela Leslie says that Cosby sexually assaulted her in Las Vegas in 1992. Leslie alleges Cosby fixed her a drink, asked her to wet her hair and pretend to be intoxicated, and masturbated using her hand while she was "in shock."

16. Kristina Ruehli. The 71-year-old was one of the Jane Does in the Andrea Constand case that was settled out of court. In 1965, Ruehli worked as a secretary at a talent agency in Los Angeles that represented Cosby. Ruehli told Philadelphia Magazine in a story published on Nov. 21, 2014 that Cosby asked her to a party at his home, but it turned out she was the only guest. Cosby poured her a drink that she says must have been drugged. “There is just one point at which I was having a drink and feeling normal and the next I was somehow passed out completely,” Ruehli says. When she awoke Cosby was trying to force her to perform oral sex, she says, but after she ran to the bathroom and vomited he was gone when she returned to the room where he had been.



17. Victoria Valentino. In early 1970, Valentino—a former Playboy Playmate—had dinner with Cosby and an aspiring actress named Meg Foster. Valentino says Cosby offered them red pills. All three took a pill and went back to Cosby’s house, according to Valentino's account. Valentino, now 71, says she recalled pulling Cosby off of Foster as he tried to rape her. “The room was spinning, and Valentino said she remembered feeling as if she was going to throw up,” she told the Washington Post in a piece published Nov. 22, 2014. “[Cosby] came over to me and sat down on the love seat and opened his fly and grabbed my head and pushed my head down. And then he turned me over. It was like a waking nightmare. She protested but could not stop him, she said.”

18. Joyce Emmons. Former comedy club manager Joyce Emmons told TMZ in a story published Nov. 22, 2014 that she ran in the same crowd as Cosby in the late 1970s, and that he kept "a drawer full of drugs." Emmons says “one night she got a bad migraine and Cosby offered her a white pill which he said 'was a little strong' but could cure a headache,” according to TMZ. “She says she took the pill, blacked out, and the next thing she knew she was nude in bed in Cosby's suite with one of his friends—a guy who had unsuccessfully tried hitting on her earlier in the evening. Emmons says she confronted Bill and demanded to know what drug she took, and he laughed and said it was ‘just a Quaalude.’ ”

19. Sarita Butterfield. In a Nov. 23, 2014 New York Daily News article, Butterfield—a Playboy model—alleged that Cosby cornered and assaulted her on Christmas Eve in 1974 at his home in Massachusetts.



20. Jewel Allison. Allison, a former model, told the New York Daily News in a story published Nov. 24, 2014 that Cosby sexually assaulted her at his New York City home in the late 1980s. She says the two of them were eating dinner at his Manhattan brownstone when she became disoriented after drinking wine he poured for her. Cosby then led her in front of a mirror, telling her to look at her own face, then placed her hand on his genitals, Allison alleges. She says he then gave her a "hard kiss" before hailing her a taxi, in which she vomited.

21. Jennifer Thompson. The 44-year-old woman was identified only as "Jena T." in a People article published Nov. 25, 2014, but chose to make her entire name public in a piece published March 4, 2015. Thompson says she was an aspiring model when she met Cosby in 1988; she says he phoned her parents and took them out to dinner to earn their trust before ultimately pressuring her into masturbating him and then giving her $700.



22. Donna Motsinger. The New York Post reported on Nov. 26, 2014 that the 73-year-old Motsinger says Cosby "drugged and raped her in 1971 when she worked as a waitress at a jazz club in Sausalito, Calif." Motsinger was one of the Jane Does identified in Andrea Constand's lawsuit.

23. Judy Huth. In a lawsuit filed Dec. 2, 2014 Huth alleges that she met Cosby in a Los Angeles park in 1974 when she was 15 years old and that he sexually abused her days later at the Playboy Mansion. Huth claims that Cosby provided her with a number of alcoholic drinks before confronting her in a bedroom and using her hand to masturbate himself. Singer says Huth's allegations are false and that she attempted to extort Cosby before filing her suit.

24. Lisa Jones. Jones alleged on a Canadian television program broadcast Dec. 1, 2014 that Cosby tried to force her legs apart in his New York home after giving her alcohol and asking her to wet her hair.



25. Helen Hayes. At a Dec. 3, 2014 press conference called by prominent attorney Gloria Allred, Hayes alleged that Cosby groped her in 1973 after they met at a celebrity tennis tournament in Pebble Beach, Calif. and he followed Hayes and her friends around the city despite their attempts to avoid him.

26. Chelan. At the same press conference that Hayes spoke at, a woman identifying herself only by her first name, Chelan, said that Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1986 when she was 17 after promising to introduce her to representatives from a modeling agency. She says the comedian gave her a blue pill that caused her to become groggy, asked her to wet her hair, and sexually assaulted her before she passed out.

27. P.J. Masten. Masten, a former Playboy Bunny, told CNN in an interview broadcast Dec. 5 that Cosby drugged and raped her at the Whitehall Hotel in Chicago after drugging her drink. The network did not specify when the alleged rape took place, but Masten says she began working for Playboy in 1972.

28. Beverly Johnson.* In a Dec. 11 2014 Vanity Fair piece, Johnson—a model and actress who in 1974 became the first black woman to appear on the cover of Vogue—wrote that Cosby drugged her during a mid-'80s visit to his home when she was being considered for a role on The Cosby Show. She says he asked her to act as if she was drunk and put his arms around her before she objected. Cosby then pulled her down a flight of stairs with such force she "feared [her] neck was going to break" and ejected her from his home, she wrote.

*We're including Johnson with an asterisk because, while she alleges Cosby drugged and assaulted her, her account does not specifically accuse him of touching her sexually.



29. Chloe Goins. The 24-year-old Goins, a Las vegas "model and lap dancer," told the Daily Mail in a piece published Dec. 15, 2014 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.

30. Lisa. A woman identified only as "Lisa" alleged in a Dec. 19, 2014 Dr. Phil episode that Cosby drugged and possibly sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when she was a 21-year-old aspiring actress and model. Cosby asked her to perform an audition scene with him and gave her two drinks, she says, before she lost consciousness as she was sitting between his legs while he stroked her hair.



31. Katherine McKee. McKee, 65, alleged in a New York Daily News interview published Dec. 22, 2014 that Cosby raped her in the early 1970s in Detroit after asking her to bring him food. "I remember I walked in the door, and he had a robe and cap on. He took the ribs from my hands and just grabbed me," McKee said. The two were acquainted, McKee said, through Sammy Davis Jr., with whom she had a romantic relationship.

32. Linda Kirkpatrick. Appearing at a Jan. 7 press conference with Gloria Allred, Kirkpatrick said that Cosby drugged her with "clear liquid" in a champagne glass and assaulted her in a Las Vegas dressing room after meeting her at a tennis tournament in 1981.

33. Lynn Neal. Neal appeared at the same Jan. 7 press conference and alleged Cosby raped her in the early 1980s when she became disoriented after drinking a shot of vodka he'd bought for her at dinner. "Lynn Neal" is identified in some publications as a pseudonym.

34. Kacey. Identifying herself by only one name and speaking alongside Neal and Kirkpatrick, "Kacey" said she worked as an assistant to one of Cosby's representatives at the William Morris Agency in the early 1990s. She says Cosby invited her to his house and asked her to read a script with him; the script involved the two of them kissing. Later, she says, Cosby gave her a white pill when they met for lunch at the Bel-Air Hotel; she alleges that she then became disoriented and that when she woke up he was naked in bed with her.

35. Cindra Ladd. In a Jan. 26 piece for the Huffington Post, Ladd (a philanthropist who's married to producer Alan Ladd Jr.) said she met Cosby in 1969 when she was 21 years old and working for a movie producer in New York. Some time after that, she wrote, she was with Cosby when she complained of a headache and he gave her a pill that caused her to become disoriented. She woke up the next day in a bed near Cosby and believes he had sex with her while she was incapacitated.

36. Helen Gumpel. On Feb. 8, Gumpel said at a press conference that Cosby "made sexual advances and lewd gestures" toward her, in the words of the Associated Press, on the set of the Cosby Show in 1987.

37. Linda Brown. Brown said at a Feb. 12 conference held by Gloria Allred that Cosby drugged and raped her in Toronto in 1969 when she was 21.

38. Lise-Lotte Lublin. Lublin, speaking at the same Feb. 12 press conference as Brown, said that she she was 23 when she met Cosby in 1989. The third time they met, she says, he took her to a Las Vegas hotel room to give her acting advice. Lublin says she then became disoriented after he gave her a drink and remembers him wrapping himself around her and stroking her hair.

39. Heidi Thomas. CNN reported on Feb. 25 that Thomas accuses Cosby of assaulting her in a Reno, Nevada hotel room in 1984 after she was referred to him by the same Denver agency, JF Images, that represented Beth Ferrier and Barbara Bowman. Thomas told CNN that Cosby asked to her to act as if she was intoxicated, drugged her, and raped her.

40. Margie Shapiro. At a March 27 press conference hosted by Gloria Allred, Shapiro said that she was 19 years old when Cosby drugged her and raped her on Hugh Hefner's property in 1975.



41. Sunni Welles. At the same March 27 press conference, Welles said that she believes Cosby drugged and raped her when she accompanied him to a jazz concert in the mid-1960s. She said she was 17 at the time.

42. Janice Baker-Kinney. At an April 23 press conference held by Gloria Allred, Baker-Kinney said that Cosby drugged and assaulted her in Reno, Nevada in 1982 when she was working as a bartender. She was 24 at the time.



43. Marcella Tate. Tate also spoke at the April 23 event, telling reporters that Cosby drugged her at the Playboy mansion in Chicago in 1975. Tate was 27 at the time and said that some time after she lost consciousness she woke up next to an apparently naked Cosby in a bed.



44. Autumn Burns. At the April 23 press conference Burns said she was 20 and working at Las Vegas' Sahara casino when Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suite.

45. Lili Bernard. Bernard alleged at a May 1 press conference held by Gloria Allred that Cosby drugged and raped her while he was ostensibly helping her prepare for a 1992 role on The Cosby Show.



46. Sammie Mays. Appearing at the same press conference as Bernard, Mays said that Cosby drugged and undressed her at a convention in New Orleans in 1986.



47. Colleen Hughes. Appearing with Gloria Allred at an Aug. 13 press conference, Hughes said Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in Los Angeles in the early 1970s after they met while she was working as an American Airlines flight attendant.



48. Linda Ridgeway Whitedeer. Whitedeer said at the Aug. 13 press conference that Cosby shoved his penis in her mouth on a movie set in 1971.

49. Eden Tiri. Tiri, also appearing at the Aug. 13 press conference, said Cosby made unwanted advances and wrapped his arms around her on the set of The Cosby Show in 1989.

50. Elizabeth. Speaking at an Aug. 20 press conference held by Gloria Allred, Elizabeth—using only her first name—said that Cosby met her when she was 20 years old in 1976 and working as a flight attendant. He invited her to dinner then allegedly drugged her sake and took her to a hotel room. "I don’t want to repeat what happened next," she said. "All I know is that it was the most horrifying thing that could happen to an innocent young woman."

51. Charlotte Fox. Fox, also appearing at the Aug. 20 press conference, said she met Cosby when she was 23 in the 1970s on a movie set. Cosby drugged her at the Playboy Mansion, she alleged, then sexually assulted her.

Correction, Nov. 21, 2014: This post originally misspelled Hannibal Buress' last name.Mr. Spicer said the president asked Mr. McGahn to then determine whether Mr. Flynn had violated the law. In the end, he said, there was “a violation of trust,” not “a violation of law.”

“It was an evolving and eroding process,” Mr. Spicer said when asked why Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, could say that Mr. Flynn had the president’s full trust on Monday afternoon.

McCain hits Trump’s ‘intentions toward’ Putin

Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was the first elected Republican to hit hard on the turmoil in Mr. Trump’s White House, and the continuing questions about Russian influence.

“General Flynn’s resignation is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus,” said Mr. McCain, who has emerged as one of the few Republican antagonists that Mr. Trump has not silenced.

“General Flynn’s resignation also raises further questions about the Trump administration’s intentions toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia, including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies and attempted interference in American elections,” he continued.

Conway responds to ‘the hapless haters’

Trump tries his best to deflect attention from Flynn

A day after Facebook posts came to light showing deliberations over North Korea in the public dining hall of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump is up in arms about loose national security controls.

Illegal leaks are, of course, a growing concern for Mr. Trump, since they portray him as running a White House that from the outside at least appears to be spinning out of control. For Mr. Trump, however, the imperative is to focus attention on anything but Russia.

Republicans largely silent

As scandal swirled around Mr. Trump’s new White House, Republicans in Congress beyond Mr. McCain were almost silent on the resignation of Mr. Flynn and its implications.

Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin chose to focus on Mr. Flynn’s decision to mislead Mr. Pence on the contents of his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak.

“You cannot have a national security adviser misleading the vice president and others,” he told reporters on Tuesday.

But Mr. Ryan deflected when asked about calls for congressional inquiries into the episode. “I’m not going to prejudge circumstances surrounding this,” he said. “I think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this.”

He again praised Mr. Trump, without identifying Mr. Flynn by name. “As soon as this person lost the president’s trust, the president asked for his resignation,” Mr. Ryan said, “and that was the right thing to do.”

In fact, the Justice Department informed the White House a month ago that Mr. Flynn had not been truthful about his conversations with the ambassador.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes of California, a Trump loyalist, released one of the few statements from the Republican side of the aisle, and it offered no criticism:

“Michael Flynn served in the U.S. military for more than three decades. Washington, D.C., can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn — who has always been a soldier, not a politician — deserves America’s gratitude and respect for dedicating so much of his life to strengthening our national security. I thank him for his many years of distinguished service.”

Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, was no more forthcoming. “Mike Flynn served his country with distinction,” he said in a statement. “The president needs a national security adviser whom he can trust, and I defer to him to decide who best fills that role.”

One exception, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, who threw his not-very-heavy weight behind a bipartisan commission.

Amid turmoil, military leaders grow worried

Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, told a military conference on Tuesday that the upheavals in Washington are rippling through the American military.

“Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil,” he said. “I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war.”

General Thomas insisted Special Operations forces are “staying focused” despite all the controversy in Washington.

Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible.”

And you can speak up, too

Have feedback for the White House on Mr. Flynn or really any other matter? No need to hold your tongue.

Almost two months after the Obama administration temporarily closed it, Mr. Trump’s staff resuscitated the White House comment line on Monday, and volunteers will now take comments for the president on a routine basis.

The line’s closing, during a time of drastic change in the government, spawned consternation among those already wary about the new administration and its commitment to public accountability. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the closing had been merely a matter of staffing the office that maintains the line.

Give it a call at 202-456-1111.

Flynn listened to ‘leader calls’ as recently as Monday, Conway says

Although the White House was warned a month ago that Mr. Flynn had been untruthful about the nature of his contacts with Moscow, he was allowed into security briefings as recently as Monday, Ms. Conway said on the “Today” show on Tuesday.

The Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Mr. Flynn’s dissembling put him at risk of blackmail from Russian intelligence, but he was kept by the president’s side.

“That’s one characterization,” Ms. Conway said when confronted with those circumstances.

The Kremlin washes its hands of Flynn

Mr. Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States are not in question, nor is his trip to Moscow to celebrate the Russian propaganda network RT — sitting next to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin — but Moscow said on Tuesday that his resignation was a domestic matter unconnected to the Kremlin.(CNN) High-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence, multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials tell CNN.

President-elect Trump and then-President Barack Obama were both briefed on details of the extensive communications between suspected Russian operatives and people associated with the Trump campaign and the Trump business, according to US officials familiar with the matter.

Both the frequency of the communications during early summer and the proximity to Trump of those involved "raised a red flag" with US intelligence and law enforcement, according to these officials. The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to US intelligence.

Among several senior Trump advisers regularly communicating with Russian nationals were then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and then-adviser Michael Flynn.

Officials emphasized that communications between campaign staff and representatives of foreign governments are not unusual. However, these communications stood out to investigators due to the frequency and the level of the Trump advisers involved. Investigators have not reached a judgment on the intent of those conversations.

Adding to US investigators' concerns were intercepted communications between Russian officials before and after the election discussing their belief that they had special access to Trump, two law enforcement officials tell CNN. These officials cautioned the Russians could have been exaggerating their access.

Trump dismissed the claims that his advisers had close ties to Russia in a tweet Wednesday.

"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign," Trump tweeted.

CNN has reached out to Flynn for comment. In an interview, Manafort emphatically denied that he was in contact with Russians known to US intelligence.

"That is 100% not true, at least as far as me," he said. "I cannot believe that they are including me in anything like that. I have not been involved in any of these activities."

Manafort said he did not know where US officials got the idea that he was in contact with suspected Russian operatives during the campaign but said he never spoke with any Russian officials during that time.

"I don't remember talking to any Russian officials, ever. Certainly during the time we're talking about," he said, calling the allegations "boggling."

"I have knowingly never talked to any intelligence official or anyone in Russia regarding anything of what's under investigation," he said. "I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign."

Manafort said the FBI has not contacted him about the allegations and said he was not aware of any other Trump campaign officials or people close to Trump being in touch with Russians known to US intelligence.

Manafort, who has held business ties with Russian and Ukrainian individuals, also emphasized that his work for the Yanukovich government in Ukraine should not be interpreted as closeness to the Russians. He said he worked for Yanukovich during a time when Ukraine was "moving into the European orbit."

The extensive contacts drew concerns of US intelligence and law enforcement officials in part because it came at a time of Russian cyberactivities targeting mostly Democratic Party political organizations

Post-election intelligence briefings on Russian meddling in the US elections included details of those communications, which included people involved in Trump's businesses.

The communications were gathered as part of routine US intelligence collection and not because people close to Trump were being targeted.

The FBI and US intelligence agencies continue to try to determine what the motive for the communications were.

One concern was whether Trump associates were coordinating with Russian intelligence operatives over the release of damaging information about the Hillary Clinton campaign.

"If that were the case, then that would escalate things," one official briefed on the investigation said.Photo by Sam Breach

Q. Boyfriend uses derogatory language while gaming: My boyfriend, who is a tolerant, liberal guy, uses anti-gay slurs when playing games with his friends. He never uses this language in “real life,” just online. I know at least one person who games with him is gay, and has asked him and the others to stop using these words, but they haven’t stopped. I feel like using that word is borderline harassment, especially if someone he knows is gay and has already said it bothers him. My boyfriend says that I’m just being hypersensitive and that he should be able to say what he wants to say when he’s blowing off steam with his friends, especially since he’s not otherwise a hateful person. I think that while actions may speak louder than words, it doesn’t mean that words still don’t matter. I also think it reflects poorly on him as a person when he truly is otherwise a very tolerant individual. Is this a battle I should just stop fighting since he really only uses the word in the context of playing games with his buddies?

A: I disagree that your boyfriend is as tolerant a guy as he would like to think. “Sure, I called Tim a faggot, but I’m tolerant, so it doesn’t count.” Tolerance isn’t an identity but an action. He’s repeatedly used anti-gay slurs in front of a gay man who asked him to stop doing it. That’s unkind and intolerant behavior, full stop. He was presented with an opportunity to apologize and change his behavior, but decided to continue doing it. The amount of steam he feels entitled to blow off has nothing to do with it. The fact that he doesn’t use homophobic language 95 percent of the time doesn’t justify the other 5 percent when he does.

To stop challenging someone from using anti-gay language simply because they persist in using anti-gay language strikes me as a defeatist approach. I think you should continue to speak up when you hear him use those slurs. The real question is why your boyfriend feels it’s so important he be “allowed” to call other men homophobic names despite multiple requests to stop.

Q. Blindness: I am blind, and I wear dark glasses and use a cane. My problem is that everywhere I go, strangers will come up and grab me to help me walk and yell at me as if I am deaf. I know they mean well, but it throws off my balance when they grab me and it’s scary. I get a headache from people yelling at me. I can hear quite well so what can I do? Being blind does not mean I can’t walk or hear. I find myself staying home rather than deal with people. Suggestions?

A: If just one person touches you without your permission, stepping back and saying clearly, “Please don’t touch me” should get them to stop. “Please don’t yell at me. I can hear you fine” should do well for the shouters. But it sounds like when you leave the house, you’re beset by multiple well-meaning oafs who think pawing at you and bellowing in your ear is the best way to offer their assistance. Are there any readers with vision impairments who have had similar experiences? Do you have any tips for keeping overbearing do-gooders at bay that you’d like to share?

Q. Date problem: My best friend met her now-boyfriend when we were out celebrating my birthday night two years ago. They’ve been dating ever since and seem to be heading down the road to marriage. Each year since then, she celebrates their “anniversary” on my birthday, and it always takes priority in her eyes. Now, she’s told me that when they get engaged, she wants to have their wedding on that same date. I’ve told her this makes me uncomfortable and that it truly hurts me that my birthday would be forever known as her anniversary, and that I want to be able to make plans each year for my birthday without wondering if she will be able to make it because of her own plans. When I brought this up, we got into a small argument about it and didn’t reach a resolution. Am I being ridiculous? It was just the day they met, not even the day they went on their first date. Any advice?

A: I’m afraid you are being ridiculous. An adult woman should not be so possessive of her own birthday that she begrudges her friends the chance to get married on the same day. The day they met is an important date. Your birthday is not in any way diminished because two people happened to fall in love on it. You owe the two of them an apology for being churlish and petty.

Q. Lost in LDR: My boyfriend and I have been dating long distance for about 1½ years. The pros: I love him because he’s an incredibly kind, smart, talented guy who always makes me laugh, in addition to supporting whatever wayward dreams I have. In a perfect world, I might marry him eventually. The cons: He lives in Florida, and I live in New York; on average we see each other every few months for a weekend. In the beginning, we visited each other more frequently, but for the last 10 months, I’ve seen him for a total of a week. I don’t think our situation will change for the next few years (neither one of us can/wants to move within the near future). Whenever I tell him I’d like to see him more often, he apologies and promises to plan ahead more. I’m almost always free to see him—his schedule dictates our visits. Dating him long distance makes me feel lonely and sad, as a part of me is always 1,000 miles away, but I can’t quite pull the trigger. He’s not open to an open relationship. Do you have any advice on what I should do? Also, we are both 23. Also, he has the world’s cutest dog.

A: (Please send me pictures of the dog at your earliest convenience.) You seem fairly aware that this relationship is approaching its expiration date. No matter how great the boyfriend, if he can’t muster up the time or enthusiasm to see you more than one week out of every 52, that’s not a great sign. If he’s not interested in coming out to see you or in opening up the relationship (and neither of you plans on moving to be closer to one another), it’s a question of when and not if you two break up. You are separated less by time and space than a general sense of friendly indifference.

Advertisement



The real question is what will you get out of this if you end things now? What experiences or other relationships are you potentially missing by kicking the Decision Can a little further down the road? If you’re not terribly interested in dating someone else and you have a good time texting each other, you may not feel a sense of urgency to end things, but I don’t think you should treat your breakup as lackadaisically as he treats your visits. He may very well be a great guy, but this relationship is already over. You’re not really changing anything, just acknowledging reality. Break up and stay friendly; maybe someday he’ll work up the energy to have a full-hearted feeling and you can revisit things then. (This will also ensure your continued access to the dog.)

Q. Re: Blindness: I’m not blind, but I use a wheelchair. When people try to push me without my permission, I have a three-step process—first I ask nicely and explain why it’s an unsafe idea, taking a moment to (hopefully) educate. If that doesn’t work, I speak more forcefully, and then tell folks to back off if necessary. It seems to me that the problem doesn’t get better if folks don’t know why it’s a problem ... however, advocating all the time is tiring.

A: It’s a great reminder to anyone who wants to help: Ask first. Someone who has a disability is not necessarily in distress. You may be embarrassing and inconveniencing someone by butting in and making assumptions.

Q. Too young to step-parent: I recently started talking to a man I met on an online dating site. He is attractive, well-educated, respectful, and driven; we hit it off and have talked for over a week. He informed me that he has a 5-year-old son from a previous relationship and I feel a little blindsided. I am a recent college graduate who just started her first salaried job, and I am worried that dating someone with a child is a little over my head. Am I being too preoccupied with the idea of being with someone who has a child while I’m still trying to figure my own life out? Or is this something that I need to worry about after I’ve spent more time with him?

Advertisement



A: He’s not looking for a stepmother for his son, he just wants to get dinner. I’ve dated single parents who were very careful about when and how someone they were dating met their children; if he’s a good father, he’ll have plenty of space between his family life and his dating life. If things start to get serious and you realize your lifestyles just aren’t compatible, that’s one thing, but I don’t think you should dump this man pre-emptively just because he has a child.

Q. Homophobic alma mater: My wife went to a small religious college as an undergrad. At the time, she did not know that she was bisexual, and she ended up marrying me (also a woman) several years after graduating. She donated small amounts of money as an alumna, but stopped when she heard that the college was not allowing any LGBTQ student groups to form. When the school asked for donations, she wrote back and said, “Not until you support and recognize all your students.” However, she still wants to go back for class reunions—I said that this is a bad idea, as the college still gets money and goodwill from those. But, she enjoyed her college experience overall. Is there a way to keep ties with one’s alma mater while disapproving of its discrimination?

A: I also went to a small religious college that didn’t allow LGBT groups on campus (and am also out now, and also do not donate to my alumni fund), so I feel uniquely qualified to handle this question. I think your wife has drawn a pretty reasonable line. She’s not contributing to the school financially in any way, she’s made her position known to them, but she still wants to see old classmates and reminisce about her college years every once in a while. As long as they’re not asking her to pretend she’s married to a man whenever she walks on campus, I think she’s struck a healthy balance.

Q: Hate job but feel guilty about leaving: I’m 30 and have been working off and on for the same employer since high school. I’ve been with them full time for eight years. My father worked for the same (small) company for 30-plus years as a high-level manager, and was unceremoniously let go by the owner’s son (who came on board recently to take over for his own father). He replaced my dad with a college friend of his. This company meant everything to my dad and to have him treated so poorly and then “put out to pasture” has sent us both into a bit of a depression. I like the people I work with and the work I do, but I hate the company and the new owner for how my father has been treated. I want to quit and look for a new job, but leaving would put a burden on the people I work directly with. I know the new owner wouldn’t replace me, so it makes their lives harder, which I don’t want, but I don’t want to work for this guy anymore.

A: Look for a new job, then quit. You don’t want to stay tethered to this company for the rest of your life, which is perfectly understandable, but it’s a lot easier to find a job when you have a job than when you don’t.Story highlights Flynn was fired by President Donald Trump earlier this week

The FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers

Washington (CNN) The FBI is not expected to pursue any charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn regarding a phone call with Russia's ambassador, barring new information that changes what they know, law enforcement officials told CNN Thursday.

Flynn was fired by President Donald Trump earlier this week after it was revealed that he withheld information from Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the US. A US official confirmed to CNN last week that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions, among other matters, during a December call.

Flynn initially told investigators sanctions were not discussed. But FBI agents challenged him, asking if he was certain that was his answer. He said he didn't remember.

The FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers. Although Flynn didn't remember all of what he talked about, they don't believe he was intentionally misleading them, the officials say.

Further, then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates delayed notifying the White House until after Flynn was interviewed. At that point, FBI Director James Comey did not object to notifying the White House counsel.

Read MoreShe could turn the world on with her smile, but within Mary Tyler Moore’s overflowing bag of comedic gifts was her ability to make crying look and sound wonderfully comical. Throughout her career, the six-time Emmy winner, who died on Wednesday, was frequently awash in tears—particularly while playing Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show—and there was something special about her way of playing it up for laughs. The high-pitched sobbing, the tiny hiccups in between, the pathetic attempts at verbal communication in the midst of all of that sobbing and hiccupping—it made for some of her most masterful comedic moments.In this short documentary titled The Rhino Guardians, Dan Sadgrove spotlights the Black Mambas and their mission. Breaking free from the patriarchal community they hail from, they are doing a job previously done only by men. They patrol the Balule Game Reserve unarmed; they confront poachers nonviolently. They are committed to eliminate illegal poaching through education and conservation. As seen in the film above, their lives constantly are at risk—both from poachers and from the towering animals they protect.SHANGHAI -- President Donald Trump's triumph in the fight to wrest back his brand for construction services in China could spell the end of more than 225 Trump-related marks here that don't belong to him, including Trump toilets, Trump condoms, Trump pacemakers and even a "Trump International Hotel."

After a decade of grinding battle in China's courts, an official finding in Trump's favor expected this week could signal a shift in fortune for the U.S. president's intellectual property. Also at stake are 49 pending Trump trademark applications -- all made during his campaign -- and 77 previously registered marks, most of which will come up for renewal during his term.

Each win creates value for Trump's business empire -- and raises ethics questions about his administration. Critics say the trademarks present conflicts of interest for Trump and may violate the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless explicitly approved by Congress.

"There can be no question that it is a terrible idea for Donald Trump to be accepting the registration of these valuable property rights from China while he's a sitting president of the United States," said Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama. "It's fair to conclude that this is an effort to influence Mr. Trump that is relatively inexpensive for the Chinese, potentially very valuable to him, but it could be very costly for the United States."

China could use Trump's desire to control his brand to extend or withhold favor, particularly since its courts and bureaucracy reflect the imperatives of the ruling Communist Party.

Eisen is involved in a lawsuit alleging that Trump's foreign business ties violate the U.S. Constitution. Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as "totally without merit."

The precise value of the trademarks is uncertain, but in a 2011 letter to then-U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, Trump wrote that he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend his brand in China.

He railed against Chinese courts for not recognizing that he was famous, writing that "it appears the only two places in the world I am not well known are" China and Macau.

Trump's elevated profile as president will likely make it easier to protect his brand in China, said Zhou Dandan, a lawyer with Unitalen Attorneys at Law in Beijing, which has worked for Trump since 2006. Trademark authorities will almost certainly reject new "Trump" applications from unrelated parties, she said, and may take back rights from existing "Trump" trademark holders.

That's what happened in the case nearing completion this week.

Back in December 2006, Trump applied for rights to the Trump mark for construction services. He was rejected because China operates on a first-come-first-served principle and a man named Dong Wei had filed a similar application two weeks earlier. Trump appealed to Chinese authorities for 10 years and was rejected time and again, right up until the month before he declared his candidacy.

Then something changed. China's trademark authorities published their decision to invalidate Dong's trademark for construction services on Sept. 6, 2016. Trump's application moved ahead, and if no one objects, the trademark will be registered to Trump on Tuesday. Dong could not be reached for comment.

Why is Trump winning now, after years of failure? China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce and its foreign ministry did not reply to requests for comment.

Alan Garten, chief legal officer of The Trump Organization, said the Chinese trademarks were already in the works before the election, and the president has turned management of his company over to his children and a team of executives.

In an email, Garten wrote, "The only mark we were seeking was one in the related class of construction which someone was improperly squatting on."

Some lawyers say Trump may have benefited from a general hardening in China's stance toward trademark squatters, but others believe politics played a role.

"It would be hard to imagine that the judges, the Trademark Office and/or the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board were acting without some kind of guidance," said Dan Plane, a director at Simone IP Services, a Hong Kong intellectual property consultancy.

Meanwhile, the makers of Trump-branded luxury toilets at Shenzhen Trump Industrial Co. say they will defend their brand, even if it means taking on the U.S. president.

Co-founder Zhong Jiye said his Trump toilets have nothing to do with President Trump. The Chinese name brings together ideas of innovation and popularity, he said. And in English, the "U'' makes a nice toilet-seat shaped logo.

Trump toilets for the home can do pregnancy tests. Models for public use have disposable seat covers for improved hygiene. People use Trump toilets some 100 million times a year, Zhong said.

Among them, he added, are customers at Zhongnanhai, the official residence of Chinese President Xi Jinping.“We are completely unhappy,” Chris Crane told me recently over the phone. And he certainly hasn’t been shy about saying so. The head of the union that represents the country’s immigration enforcement officers, Crane has recently been on a crusade against the Obama administration—lambasting it for an attempt to loosen immigration enforcement that, he says, has created a “law outside the law.” Crane’s denunciations of the administration have produced an odd twist in Washington’s longstanding battle over immigration: As the Obama administration has gone about trying to liberalize our immigration policy, the people who enforce it are publicly voicing their opposition to the changes.

To understand how we got here, you have to go back to June, when John Morton, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, issued a memo stating that the government should exercise discretion when going after illegal immigrants. Writing in TNR at the time, Peter Schrag explained that the memo, “if it’s followed, comes close to a de-facto DREAM Act”—the legislation, long stuck in Congress, that would formally stop the deportation of certain classes of illegal immigrants, including many who are currently in college. For instance, the memo instructs ICE officials to take into account factors such as “[t]he circumstances of the person’s arrival in the United States and the manner of his or her entry, particularly if the alien came to the United States as a young child,” as well as “[t]he person’s pursuit of education in the United States.” In short, the memo was exactly the kind of step that immigration activists had long been hoping Obama would take.

Still, the memo wasn’t nearly as radical as it might have appeared. James Ziglar, who served as Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under George W. Bush, told me that prosecutorial discretion has been a common tool in the past. “You can’t just deport everyone,” Ziglar says. “You have to exercise practical judgment.” Doris Meissner, who served as INS commissioner throughout the Clinton administration, concurs. She issued a major prosecutorial discretion memo in 2000 at the urging of several members of Congress (including Lamar Smith, who is now Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a leading proponent of stricter immigration policy). “Prosecutorial discretion has been well established for a long time, in a variety of ways,” she says. “You should use your resources to target people who threaten public safety.”

But none of this has stopped Chris Crane and his 7,600-member union from expressing fury about the memo. Crane says his case against the Morton memo is not ideological; it’s that the discretion the memo asks for is extraordinarily difficult for ICE officers to carry out. Last June, the union issued a vote of no confidence in Morton. It charged that Morton had “abandoned the Agency’s core mission” in favor of “campaigning for programs and policies related to amnesty.” Last month, at a Congressional subcommittee hearing, Crane claimed that unnamed, high-level ICE officials were going beyond the memo, verbally warning officers to avoid arresting whole groups of people and threatening dismissal if officers didn’t comply. When pressed for the names of ICE officials who had issued these orders, Crane wouldn’t name names, though he said he would provide them later. In July, when asked on Fox News if the memo essentially encouraged officers to ignore unlawful immigrants, Crane responded: “Our hands are absolutely tied.”The government claims it has met 80 per cent of the CBA, the only contention being salaries and allowances, but doctors disagree.

What else is inside the 2013 collective bargaining agreement that doctors are so ready to die for?

According to Daisy Korir, the treasurer of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union, the 27-page document has been so mystified that a certain Cabinet Secretary winces whenever it is mentioned during negotiations.

“Whenever you mention the CBA on the negotiating table, some people are nearly convulsing. We need to let people know what it is,” she says.

NOT LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

The current document is not legally enforceable after the Labour Court in October ruled that it must be negotiated afresh.

However, the KMPDU negotiating team chairman, Dr Alex Muturi, says without it the union might just die.

“Any union stands on two things: the membership and the CBA. The CBA is the only reference any union has with the employer,” he says.

Muturi on Tuesday told striking doctors he suspects the government’s unwillingness to implement the agreement is a plan to kill their union.

KMPDU was registered in 2011, when the new constitution was adopted. The new laws gave every Kenyan worker the freedom to join a trade union and compelled every employer to recognise employees’ trade unions.

Their first action was organising the December 2011 strike that lasted only a few days after doctors agreed on a return-to-work formula.

On March 22, 2012, the Health ministry signed recognition agreement with the union and the two formed a team that worked out the collective bargaining agreement.

Negotiations for CBA lasted more than one year, and the document was finally signed by then KMPDU secretary general Sultani Matendechero and chairman Victor Ng’ani on June 27, 2013.

Former PS Mark Bor signed on behalf of the Health ministry.

The agreement suspended the proposed salaries and allowances until the Salaries and Remuneration Commission sets out guidelines for remuneration of doctors in public service.

The ministry was expected to submit the document to SRC for review and then the Labour Court for registration.

The union accuses the ministry officials of using “delay tactics” to frustrate implementation of the agreement for three years.

The union moved to the Labour Court in June 2015, seeking registration of the CBA in its current form or with amendments agreed by both parties.

The union also asked the court to declare the unregistered CBA valid if the Health ministry does not cooperate, and to backdate it to 2013.

COUNTY EMPLOYMENT

Doctors also insisted they are not county employees.

“The county governments are not the employers of doctors and, therefore, have no legal obligation that a collective bargaining agreement be negotiated with them,” KMPDU said.

In response, the ministry said the 2013 CBA was defective because health was devolved on February 1, 2013 (Gazette notice No 16 of 2013) and most doctors are now employed by counties.

“The respective county governments were not involved at the negotiations and signing of the CBA,” the ministry said.

It also claimed the agreement was signed by a former PS illegally. Health PS Fred Segor replaced Bor, now the chairman of Kenyatta National Hospital, on June 25, 2013.

However, Bor signed the agreement two days later, when he was already out of office.

“The CBA has not been implemented because it was signed by a non-officer. It had not been assessed by the SRC and Treasury. The ministry had not approved its signing,” the ministry says.

Dr Muturi says if Bor acted illegally, he should be in jail.

In her ruling on October 6 last year, Lady Justice Monica Mbaru told doctors the 2013 CBA does not comply with the law and cannot be registered.

“Without such registration, the collective bargaining agreement has no legal effect and cannot be enforced,” she said.

She noted the Health ministry acted in bad faith all along to derail the agreement’s registration.

Justice Mbaru also ruled that Bor’s signature on the CBA is valid because the backdated gazette notice that announced a new PS in the ministry was published on June 28, a day after the signing.

She asked doctors to embrace the reality of devolution and the fact that most of them are now employed by county governments.

“It will aid justice, fair labour practice and effective administration of the CBA to include major stakeholders — county governments,” she said.

ORDERED TO NEGOTIATE

She directed the union and the ministry to meet within a month to review the clauses they had not agreed on in the 2013 CBA.

They would then get the input of all other parties and return to the court in 90 days (expiring January 6, 2017) to register a new CBA.

KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga complains the ministry did not constitute a negotiation team within the first month.

The union immediately issued a strike notice and disregarded belated attempts by the ministry to start negotiations before expiry of the 90 days.

Labour Court judge Hellen Wasilwa last month declared the strike illegal and ordered doctors to return to negotiations.

The government has since offered the 5,000 doctors in public service an additional Sh4 billion, pushing the monthly salary of an intern to Sh197,000, up from Sh127,000. Public Service Commission chair Prof Margaret Kobia says union proposal for interns to earn Sh325,000 will distort the public service pay structure and burden Kenyans with additional Sh12 billion every year.Aaron P.

The Senate confirmed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday. Two Democrats, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, crossed party lines to approve Pruitt while Republican Susan Collins of Maine voted against him. From the New York Times:

Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general’s office is under order to release about 3,000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry.

But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep.

Democrats, environmental groups and even current E.P.A. employees have harshly criticized Mr. Pruitt’s record of fighting the mission of the agency he will now lead, as well as his close ties with the fossil fuel industry he will now regulate.

Pruitt’s confirmation came just hours after the court order mandated his emails and other documents be released in response to public records requests on his communications with the fossil fuel industry. From U.S. News & World Report:

Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons, of the District Court in Oklahoma County, ordered the state attorney general's office to turn over thousands of emails to comply with multiple public records requests dating to January 2015.

Those requests, filed by the Center for Media and Democracy, a left-leaning media watchdog, sought correspondence between Pruitt's office and fossil fuel titans such as Devon Energy and Peabody Energy, as well as industry groups like Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute and conservative organizations like the Republican Attorneys General Association.

As noted by the Times, Pruitt's correspondence has previously exposed unethical behavior. A 2014 investigation by the paper found evidence that fossil fuel lobbyists had drafted letters criticizing environmental regulations that Pruitt then directly copied and pasted onto his attorney general letterhead and passed on to the EPA. “Many of the coal, oil and gas companies represented by those lobbyists were also some his largest campaign contributors,” the Times’ Coral Davenport wrote in her piece on Friday's confirmation. “Mr. Pruitt also worked jointly with those companies in filing multiple lawsuits against major E.P.A. regulations.”Sam Breach

Mallory Ortberg: Certain days are marked by disorientation, days where we ask: “What place is this? What region, what quarter of the world? Where am I? Beneath the sun’s rising or beneath the wheeling course of the frozen Bear?” Days where we think: I should have taken a left in Albuquerque. Let’s get oriented.

Q. White lying to mom: My mother and I exhibit very similar symptoms of anxiety. We fidget constantly, have a hard time starting projects, overthink, and have days where doing anything productive feels impossible. After all kinds of medication, I am so happy to say that I have found CBD oil to be a very effective treatment option. It is giving me a new lease on life. I want to share this discovery with my mother to see if it can help her anxiety! However, she is a conservative Christian. Plus, I am already thought of as sort of a wild child. I’m afraid she’ll dismiss CBD oil without giving it a chance. Would it be terrible of me to fail to mention the words “cannabis” or “hemp” when I tell her about my new treatment? Just long enough for her to try it. It will save her a crisis of faith and CBD doesn’t induce a high or have serious side effects. What’s a white lie when you’re fighting decades of mental unwellness?

A: Oh, this is an easy one! Giving someone drugs without their knowledge or consent is not a “white lie”; it is a straight-up violation of their physical autonomy. Whether or not you find relief from your anxiety from CBD oil has no bearing on whether you should secretly give drugs to your mother. Do not surreptitiously give another human being prescription drugs, alcohol, marijuana, or any other substance, no matter how much you yourself enjoy using it and no matter how minimal you consider the side effects to be. This is not your choice to make. Encourage her to seek medical attention, limit your time together if you need space, and focus on your own treatment. Your mother has the right to dismiss medical marijuana in any form; you have the right to disagree with her and use it as much as you see fit. You do not have the right to drug your mother. That seems like a sentence that should not have to be stated—“don’t drug your mother” ought to be common sense—but I’ll say it anyway: Don’t drug your mother. Don’t drug anyone!

Q. Boyfriend secretly bought a gun: I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about two and a half years now. We’ve been living together for over a year and recently went shopping for engagement rings together. He is a wonderful, kind, smart, funny man, and I love him deeply and am excited to spend the rest of my life with him. Last night, through one of our mutual friends, I discovered that he had purchased a gun last month and never told me about it. I’m not wild about guns, and in a previous conversation that I had brushed off as a “what if” sort of thing, I had mentioned that were he to ever purchase a gun, I’d rather he not keep it in our home, since research pretty clearly states that he would be more likely to injure me or himself with it than any potential intruders. When I confronted him about this, he reported that he hadn’t told me because he wasn’t keeping it at the house.

I am feeling hugely betrayed about this. Like I said, I am not wild about guns, but I am mostly angry that he felt the need to hide this purchase from me. He had to take a test, pass a background check, apply for purchase, and then find somewhere to keep this gun (at our mutual friend’s home, apparently), and it either never occurred to him to tell me, or he deliberately kept it a secret from me (the second option here is clearly more concerning). How do I convey these feelings to him, and more importantly, how do we move forward? I am feeling like we need to put our potential engagement on the back burner until we can process why he withheld information about purchasing a lethal weapon from me, but also wonder if this is an overreaction. Help!

A: It’s fair for two reasonable adults to differ on the subject of gun ownership, but it’s more than a little ridiculous to think that your boyfriend feels more comfortable purchasing and storing a firearm than he does admitting he bought one to his girlfriend. Let’s dismiss entirely the possibility that it never occurred to him to tell you about this purchase, given that he already knows your feelings on the subject, and his “I didn’t have to tell you because I’m storing it at Jakery’s house” evasion is patently silly. This isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker, but it is an opportunity to have a serious conversation about honesty and conflict. Tell him you’d rather have an honest disagreement of opinion that’s based on good faith, even if it’s sometimes uncomfortable, rather than not know about significant life choices like your boyfriend becoming a gun owner, and that if you two are going to build a life together, he can’t make a habit of hiding points of conflict from you. If his response is lukewarm, or he continues to hew to his “I didn’t have to tell you anything because the gun’s not in the house” party line, you are absolutely within your rights to say, “Then we need to put a hold on moving forward with this engagement until we can agree on how to communicate and what sort of information we both have the right to know.”

Q. Exposing a verbally abusive ex-boss: For several months, I’ve been working part time at a small business, just a few hours a week. I love the community and my co-workers, but the owner is a verbally abusive monster. I’ve decided to quit—an easy decision, because I don’t need the money. However, I have deep friendships with the remaining employees who do depend on their part-time and full-time jobs, and I hate that they are still at his mercy. I’ve thought of contacting the Better Business Bureau but worry that will just intensify the owner’s wrath. Is there any action I can take to create a better work environment for my friends? Also, what are my obligations to the clients, many of whom I’m very close with and who will certainly ask why I’m leaving? I want to tell them the truth, as I’m done tacitly legitimizing the owner’s behavior but worry that doing so will come back to bite the remaining employees. Also, this job has no impact on my full-time job and career, so I’ll never need the owner for a recommendation.

A: The Better Business Bureau doesn’t handle employee/employer disputes, so if, as it sounds in your letter, your former company’s owner restricted his abuse to the people who worked for him and put on a friendly face for clients, the BBB isn’t going to be much help. If your former clients ask why you left, tell them that you loved your work and your colleagues but were looking for a more supportive boss who could communicate effectively. They’ll get what you’re saying without you having to go into great detail about his shortcomings. You can help your friends update their résumés and pass on relevant job leads, you can offer a sympathetic ear once in a while when they need to vent, you can encourage them to bring up their concerns to a board of directors if there is one, but if there’s no one he has to answer to as company owner, the best thing your friends can do is find new jobs as quickly as possible.

Q. Is fear standing in my way?: I am happily married to a wonderful man. Almost a year ago we decided that I would leave my job and help him run his practice. I would run the operations and this would give me the flexibility to go back to school. I previously worked at a small real estate firm for a great group of people. It was not a prestigious position, but I was great at what I did, felt appreciated and loved my co-workers. While my husband works as an independent contractor, he is still under the regulations of a larger cooperation. His boss was completely in support of this move and agreed to get me sponsored so I could be licensed in the new position. Not long after I left, my husband’s boss left the firm, along with all the promises we were given. They have yet to replace his boss, and no one we talk to thinks my working as a subordinate to my husband will be approved. Learning about our predicament and knowing I have a relationship with a real estate office, an acquaintance of my husband suggested I join his mortgage team in sales. I have never been interested in sales and am not comfortable taking on this task, but my husband is pressuring me to pursue the opportunity. I really think I will fail and know they offered me the position based on my relationship with the real estate office and friendship with my husband.

I am anxious just thinking about the new job and hate trying to sell to my friends at my former office. It feels dishonest to me, especially because they all believe I left to go back to school and help my husband. My husband believes fear of failing is not a reason to turn down the position and I’m being unreasonable. I applied for other jobs, but everything I apply to he thinks is beneath me. He recently bought me a very expensive SUV and told me I need to trade it in if I don’t start working or if I decide to go back to school full time. I feel so much guilt for not contributing to our finances and can understand his resentment. I really don’t know how to talk to him about my fears without feeling foolish. Am I being selfish and unnecessarily fearful? This has really caused a rift in our otherwise happy marriage.

A: I feel enormously confident that going to work for your husband’s team in a position you feel ill-suited for, pressured to accept, and anxious about is not going to result in a happier marriage. You agreed to take time off from your own career to help him as an operations manager; that doesn’t mean you would make a good salesman (or a good HR director, or whatever other fill-in-the-blank job opening they’ve got). You’re not a Lego component that can be neatly slotted into whatever hole needs to be filled.

In terms of what you should do, I think you ought to take your husband up on his eminently reasonable suggestion to trade in your fancy SUV for something less flashy (which I suspect was less a suggestion and more of a guilt-trip tactic on his part) and go ahead and take one of those jobs he thinks are “beneath you,” or else go back to school, so you can start contributing to the household on your own terms.

When it comes to how you should talk to your husband about it, you should bear in mind that there’s nothing foolish about being aware of your own skill set, or being realistic about what types of work you’re suited for and what types you’re not. Make it clear that you are not demurring out of false modesty or lack of initiative but out of a genuine understanding of your own abilities and experience. Tell him that you’re anxious to contribute financially, that you’re entirely certain you would not do well in sales, and that his company would lose the opportunity to hire an effective, successful sales representative if you were forced into the position.

Q. What’s in a (last) name?: My fiancé and I are getting married this summer. We are a little older (late 30s and mid-40s). I am shocked at how many people assume that I am going to change my last name, especially female friends in their 30s and 40s! I am very liberal, live in a very liberal part of the country, and for various reasons, will be keeping my name (family name and my dad died 10 years ago, professional reasons, and because it’s my name). I understand some people choose to change their name, but I have known since a young age that I would not change my name. Every inch of my feminist body aches when these assumptions are made. How do I respond to this assumption, in the moment and proactively? What is the right response to someone who says, “Next time I see you, you’ll be Mr. and Mrs. XYZ”?

A: Keep it straightforward: “I’m keeping my name, so we’ll be Mr. Flimshaw and Ms/Mrs. Screentime.” If anyone has follow-up questions or seems mildly interested, you can share a bit more about why keeping your name is important to you; otherwise you’ll have successfully challenged an often-unconscious assumption by a simple statement of fact.

Q. Re: White lying to mom: She’s not asking if she can mickey her mom, she’s asking if it’s OK to tiptoe around certain phrases when she tells mom about it. BIG difference. I still wouldn’t dance around it, but I would phrase it with the studies around older people and chemo relief, heavy on the science (including using the scientific names).

A: I don’t think it is OK to tiptoe around it. It’s a fair point that calling CBD oil “non-specific anxiety relief” isn’t the same as spiking a drink, although it feels like dangerous logic to want to obfuscate the nature of any sort of therapeutic treatment, especially if the LW is trying to encourage their mother to try said treatment. If the LW says, “Mom, this vague oil helps me with my anxiety, would you consider trying it?” without offering her full information about what’s in it, then that’s deceptive and unacceptable. I think it’s OK to be honest about what the LW finds helpful about it—“it’s a cannabinoid found in marijuana but not the same thing as marijuana, it doesn’t get me high, it’s helped me immensely”—but it’s crossing a real line to not call something what it is. If the LW’s mother wants to have an irrational response to medical marijuana, then she’s allowed to. The LW should make their case to the best of their ability, and let their mother make her own choices; they should by no means try to “trick” her into considering it, no matter how good their intentions.

Q. Future roommate has a lying problem: My friends and I are first years in college and have been looking forward to living together next year for months now. However, my friend “Sophie” and I have noticed that another friend, “Christina,” has developed a bit of a lying problem. It started with some embellishment to her stories and has snowballed to her flat-out lying about just about everything, from fabricating mundane details about her life to making up nonexistent medical issues. This might have been simply annoying, but as we are currently planning on sharing an apartment next year—which will include sharing the costs of cleaning supplies, grocery bills, etc.—it is instead concerning, and Sophie and I would really like to bring it up with her before housing is finalized. Our question is, how do we do it tactfully and productively, without making Christina feel attacked or possibly losing her friendship?After their meeting, Trudeau said he "wouldn’t lecture" Trump over his controversial travel ban.

"There have been times where we have differed in our approaches and that's always been done firmly and respectfully," he said.

"The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves."

Here are the best Obama-Biden 'bromance' memesMr. Trump, a profane, bombastic, thrice-married New Yorker, may not have been the candidate many religious conservatives prayed would win the White House. But the mutually beneficial arrangement he has nurtured with the Christian right is already starting to nudge the government in a more conservative direction.

The religious right’s influence is evident in the policies the new administration has prioritized in its first weeks, from Mr. Trump’s clampdown on federal funding that could indirectly support abortion to his directive to give persecuted Christians special dispensation to enter the United States. His pick to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, has written opinions favorable to businesses that have religious objections to government mandates. And the White House has told leaders of the movement that the president will select nominees for the lower courts who are opposed to expanding abortion rights.

A group that has felt shunted aside by the Republican establishment is finding doors open more quickly and willingly than it did even under friendly presidents like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

Mr. Trump has given many conservative Christian leaders his personal cellphone number. He has solicited their advice for filling key positions. He has invited them to the White House. And he has staffed his cabinet with many people of deep Christian faith, like Ben Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, and Betsy DeVos, who was raised in the Calvinist tradition.

Now that he has the movement’s support, he has good reason to keep its adherents happy. He needs them to preserve his cobbled-together base of voters. And given how few votes put him over the top in the Electoral College — 77,000 total in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where socially conservative Republicans are a key constituency — he may indeed owe them the election.

Once doubtful of his commitment to deliver on the promises he made during the campaign, they now count themselves among the converted.

“We’re happy to be wrong,” said Penny Young Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, who was once among the “anybody but Trump” Republicans but stood alongside him at the White House this month during a meeting of conservative leaders.

“He doesn’t pretend to be a Bible-banging evangelical,” Ms. Nance, an evangelical Christian herself, added. “And we respect that. But he was also very clear about what he was going to do, what positions he was going to take, what he was going to support for the country. And it lined up with what evangelicals wanted.”

This close relationship has consequences not only for how policy will be shaped over the next four years on issues like health care, education and free speech, but also for how the federal courts will decide cases for a generation or more.

What the religious right wanted, perhaps above all else, was the nomination of a solidly conservative judge to the Supreme Court. And Mr. Trump delivered with his selection of Judge Gorsuch, whom he picked from a list of 21 candidates blessed by conservative groups.

Perhaps most important, Mr. Trump has been almost conspicuous in his embrace. Speaking to Pat Robertson before he named his Supreme Court nominee, Mr. Trump insisted, “I think evangelicals, Christians will love my pick.”

Richard Land, a prominent Southern Baptist and a member of Mr. Trump’s evangelical advisory board, said he had been repeatedly asked to provide names of people who would like to join the administration.

“That didn’t happen before,” Mr. Land said in an interview. He described his bemusement to a Christian news outlet last month, saying, “Are we hallucinating, or is this actually happening?”

He invited scores of prominent Christian leaders to his inauguration events and asked them to speak. Cissie Graham Lynch, whose father is Franklin Graham, the evangelist and Trump supporter who offered a prayer from the steps of the Capitol, said she sat there as the president was sworn in and thought to herself, “To hear the name of Jesus Christ proclaimed on that stage — and for people not to be ashamed of it — was a breath of fresh air.”

The Trump administration has moved fast to enact new policies that the religious right considers important, including vowing to “totally destroy” a law known as the Johnson Amendment that restricts the activities of tax-exempt entities like churches in politics.

Mr. Trump’s cabinet is filled with deeply religious people who hold conservative views on religion, morality and social policy.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Methodist, has questioned the wisdom of separating church and state.

Tom Price, the new health and human services secretary, helped lead an effort in Congress to repeal the federal mandate that insurers cover birth control, on the ground that it violates religious freedom.

Mr. Carson, the nominee for secretary of housing and urban development, once said he doubted the validity of the Big Bang theory.

Andrew F. Puzder, the labor secretary nominee, was an early architect of the legal effort to pass laws stating that life begins at conception.

Among the Trump inner circle, Mr. Pence and Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, were known to the movement for their strong opposition to abortion and for other stances in culture war battles long before they were household names. In a first for a White House, Mr. Trump sent them both to address the annual march in Washington by abortion opponents.

Mr. Perkins, the Family Research Council president, who was at the White House for the announcement of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, said Mr. Trump had first reached out to him when he was considering challenging President Barack Obama. Then, in early 2016, after Mr. Perkins had aligned himself with many other evangelical leaders to back Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, he received another call from Mr. Trump asking him to pay a visit.

Inside Mr. Trump’s office in Trump Tower, Mr. Perkins said, “I sat there for 20 minutes and explained to him what an evangelical is and what they believe and what they are looking for.” Mr. Trump, not usually one to sit still for very long, listened intently, Mr. Perkins added.

Mr. Perkins was invited to say a prayer at a private reception at Union Station in Washington on the night of the inauguration. Based on other encounters with politicians, he expected to have to submit his remarks in advance. But the only limit he was given from the administration was one on time. “They said, ‘You have five minutes,’” he said.

Though Mr. Trump’s elevation to champion of religious conservatives may seem incongruous, his followers understand the phenomenon well. Reagan, after all, was also divorced, once supported abortion rights and saw no problem with his wife’s inviting an astrologer to the White House.

“You don’t need to be one of us to get our vote,” said J. Hogan Gidley, a Republican strategist who has worked for the presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, both of whom are deeply religious. “Donald Trump didn’t walk around pretending to be this paragon of Christian virtue. What he did was say he’d protect your right to be one.”

Mr. Robison, the televangelist who was among those who spoke at St. John’s, spoke later that day to a crowd gathered for the Faith, Freedom and Future inaugural ball. He told a story of how he had called Mr. Trump’s cellphone just to see if he would still pick up after he had won the election.

Mr. Trump, he said, answered.Republican members of Congress Thursday armed themselves with a general outline of the party's ideas to replace the Affordable Care Act just as they head home to their districts for the next ten days.

It's a strategic document appropriately timed to help Republicans who might face constituents at town halls angry and worried about losing their health insurance amid their stalled effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.

The 19-page document, released by the House GOP leadership, is thin on specifics but provides general goals for the party on reforming health care policy. But even such a broad outline reveals a party divided on how to approach the issue.

The general outline contains just four main policy objectives for replacing Obamacare. Republicans themselves are not in agreement with all of them, and, as time wears on, they are finding it more difficult to come together on a path forward.

Republicans face the challenge of trying to provide options for the nearly 20 million people who gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act, as many in their party are reluctant to create an entitlement program or spend federal dollars.

The blueprint released by Republican leaders Thursday models ideas championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. It says a replacement effort would expand the use of Health Savings Accounts, create high risk pools for the uninsured to purchase health coverage, provide a cap on the number of people on Medicaid and allow states to accept a block grant to manage their own program. Central to the plan is the offer of a tax credit to individuals purchasing health care in the individual marketplace.

But the diverse Republican caucus has different ideas on how to move forward and it's unclear how they put together a plan that can garner wide support. Conservative Republicans are reluctant to support any plan that raises taxes or continues the Medicaid expansion, for example.

Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., head of the Republican Study Committee, which has the membership of 172 conservative House members, said the outline contains "grounds for concern."

"Without seeing more details in the proposal, it would be challenging for House conservatives to vote for a plan that would extend Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, require keeping Obamacare taxes or imposing new ones, and potentially create a new health care entitlement," Walker said in a statement.

One health care lobbyist who saw Thursday's blueprint said, "All of it is very entertaining, but they are not any closer to finding common ground."

While they are figuring out how to replace Obamacare, Republicans are also struggling with how to first repeal it. The ACA instituted hundreds of millions of dollars of health-care related taxes to pay for the subsidies Obamacare provides to help people purchase health insurance as well as the Medicaid expansion. If Republicans simply repeal all of the taxes, there would be no way to pay for their own plan.

A spokesperson for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Drew Hammill, said the plan provides "no details of what they want to do."

"It's very similar to (Paul Ryan's) Better Way document that has been out for months," Hammill added.

Newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price traveled to Capitol Hill twice this week to speak with Republicans. The session Thursday morning with House Republicans was described as a meeting "to fill people in" on the latest of Republicans' top priority.

Republicans insist they are making progress but acknowledge that it's taking longer than expected.

The original timeline to present a plan for repealing Obamacare was January 27 - seven days after President Donald Trump's inauguration - but Republicans quickly acknowledged that was too ambitious. President Donald Trump said Price would release a plan after his confirmation, which hasn't happened yet. And the goal post was moved to March to unveil a plan but that could be ambitious too.

After years of promising repeal, Republicans are realizing that it's much more difficult.

"What's finally sinking into a lot of members is that Obamacare doesn't go away on one day," said Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Indiana.

"We didn't get into this overnight; we're not going to get out of this overnight," said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Michigan, added.

While this document is a starting point, the finish line is still miles away.

"We're getting closer," said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., but there is no consensus.

But one Republican said that what's going to be critical for consensus is the administration.

"It is going to require leadership from the White House," Rokita said.This spring, the Audio Book Club will also try something slightly new.

NASA has turned to crowdsourcing to solve one of space flight’s thorniest problems: astronaut poop. Some of the world’s top scientific minds piped up with ideas, and on Wednesday, the victor of the agency’s “Space Poop Challenge” found himself flush with cash—$15,000, to be exact.

While the bathroom situation on the space station is pretty OK, it’s another story when nature calls during a space walk. The competition, which ran October–December 2016, called on people to devise a more hygienic and comfortable solution to the problem that would manage human waste—including feces, urine and menstrual fluid—for six days. As the competition website explained: “An astronaut might find themselves in this suit for up to 10 hours at a time nominally for launch or landing, or up to 6 days if something catastrophic happens while in space.” The need for long-term waste solutions may become more urgent as NASA considers missions farther from Earth, which will increase the risk of emergencies stranding astronauts for longer periods of time in their suits.

As of now, NASA still relies on the ol’ diaper method, which it calls “low-tech and very temporary.”

Astronaut poop is tricky for a few reasons, mostly to do with microgravity and the vacuum of space: “The system had to operate in the conditions of space,” the website reads, “where solids, fluids, and gases float around in microgravity (what most of us think of as ‘zero gravity’) and don't necessarily mix or act the way they would on earth.”

The Space Poop Challenge winner was Thatcher Cardon, a family physician and flight surgeon, according to his bio on the competition’s site. He took the prize with a solution called “MACES Perineal Access & Toileting System.” According to NPR: “He designed a small airlock at the crotch of the suit, with a variety of items—including inflatable bedpans and diapers—that could be passed through the small opening and then expanded. His design even allows an astronaut to change underwear while inside the spacesuit, through the same small opening.”

A group called “Space Poop Unification of Doctors” won $10,000, while a Scottish man took third and $5,000.

The NASA engineers are still in the early stages of designing the space suits for their deep space mission on the spacecraft Orion, which NASA plans to eventually use to travel to (and back from) an asteroid and later Mars. But according to a statement on NASA’s website, the agency might use one of the submitted ideas for its first manned flights on Orion, which could occur in the 2020s.Photo from Shutterstock.



You've probably heard about Heartbleed by now. It's big, bad wolf of an Internet security problem. And though it's mainly server managers who have to take steps to fix it, you can manage your passwords to help protect yourself.

The strangest thing about Heartbleed is that changing your password on a particular site only gives you more protection if that site has already applied to the Heartbleed patch and resolved its vulnerability. If it hasn’t, changing your password in advance could theoretically put you at greater risk. Heartbleed is a vulnerability in a server's memory (RAM), not its data storage, so a hacker has access to things that are being called up by the server not everything that's stored on it. That means that the hacker could ascertain your new password, too.

Advertisement



Lists, which are being frequently updated, can tell you which websites are vulnerable and which have been patched. Once a site is no longer vulnerable, it's time to change your password. You're going to have to do this on a lot of sites, so this is the perfect time so start using a password manager.

A password manager helps you generate random, strong passwords so you don't have to think of them yourself. Then it stores your login information for every site you use, autofilling a password whenever you need one. You don't need to know or remember your passwords, because they're all stored and protected behind one master password that you make extremely strong and unguessable. I use 1Password, and my master password is a fairly long sentence (without spaces) that includes alternate spellings, numbers in place of certain letters, and punctuation.

I’ll admit it. I kind of hate using a password manager. Setting it up is tedious, and it’s a little unsettling to never know any of your passwords. It doesn't matter so much when you're on your personal computer and have 1Password (or your password manager of choice) running, but when you're using someone else's computer, you have to use a an app to check your password for any site/service you want to log into.

Password managers aren't about fun, though. They're about proactively protecting yourself from much more annoying, and potentially detrimental, problems down the line if your personal information gets hijacked. And they do offer a lot of useful features like super secure notes and a password generator. Many even incorporate two-factor authentication, and in our leaky digital world, it's reassuring to use a service whose only priority is security.

For example, after Heartbleed was disclosed, LastPass wrote in a blog post that it used the OpenSSL version that contained the vulnerability, but that its users shouldn't be affected at all because the company encrypts all data before sending it. This means that even if a hacker were monitoring LastPass servers, all she would be able to see would be encrypted code. And now LastPass has added a service that checks any site's Heartbleed status so people know when to change their passwords. The company also reiterated that there is no reason for LastPass users to change their master passwords, though they can if they want to take extra precautions.

The Internet has officially killed the Playboy bunny. The adult magazine that inserted itself into American popular culture in 1953 with Marilyn Monroe on its cover is ditching the nude photos it became synonymous with, the New York Times reports. The editor of the magazine brought the idea to the head of the Playboy empire Hugh Hefner last month in hopes of boosting sagging readership numbers. A redesign that will include provocative, but not naked, photos of women was agreed to and will hit newsstands next March.

Playboy execs are framing the change as a victory of sorts for the magazine. The cultural space, and acceptance, was hard won over the past 60 years and provided the springboard for the Internet age pornography industry with which magazines like Playboy could not keep up. “You’re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it’s just passé at this juncture,” Scott Flanders, the company’s chief executive, told the Times. Playboy’s circulation has dropped to 800,000 from 5.6 million 30 years ago.

Before it was passé, however, whether you loved or hated it, Playboy was cutting edge in the media world. Here’s more from the Times:

It is difficult, in a media market that has been so fragmented by the web, to imagine the scope of Playboy’s influence at its peak. A judge once ruled that denying blind people a Braille version of it violated their First Amendment rights. It published stories by Margaret Atwood and Haruki Murakami among others, and its interviews have included Malcolm X, Vladimir Nabokov, Martin Luther King Jr. and Jimmy Carter, who admitted that he had lusted in his heart for women other than his wife. Madonna, Sharon Stone and Naomi Campbell posed for the magazine at the peak of their fame. Its best-selling issue, in November of 1972, sold more than seven million copies.K.L. Ricks

Ruth Robinson met James Bailey by accident. Robinson, a 39-year-old lawyer from Birmingham, Alabama, was trying to schedule a legal visit at Holman Correctional Facility with an inmate named Bailey. But it turned out there was more than one inmate by that name at the southern Alabama prison. When Robinson spoke to James Bailey by phone ahead of her trip, she quickly established that he was not the one she needed to see. Before she could hang up, however, the convicted murderer on the other end of the line got her attention.

Leon Neyfakh Leon Neyfakh is a Slate staff writer.

Bailey swore he was serving time for a crime he didn’t commit and begged Robinson to come to Holman to hear him out. Robinson, who was in the process of making a return to the legal profession after nearly a decade away from the workforce, reluctantly agreed to keep her visit on the books. “I go from Birmingham to Biloxi to see my mother anyway,” she told me later. “Holman’s right there, so I’m like, ‘Pfft, I’m gonna go spread some joy, go buy a candy bar for some guy who has no hope.’ ”

On Jan. 25, 2016, in a plexiglass visitation room, Robinson met a weathered but affable man roughly her age, dressed in a white prison uniform stamped with the words Alabama Department of Corrections. Bailey recounted his story in the scattered manner of a person who has accrued so many grievances over the years that he doesn’t know where to begin when someone finally agrees to listen. “He was eager to let me know how his case was the craziest case I’d ever hear about,” Robinson said. “He kept saying, ‘This is gonna be your favorite part—you’re gonna love this.’ ”

Bailey had spent most of his adult life behind bars, going to prison for the first time on burglary charges at 18 and serving roughly a quarter of his 38-year sentence before he was paroled at 26. About a year later, he went to jail after being accused of operating a methamphetamine lab in his house. While awaiting trial on the drug charges, Bailey was implicated in the 2004 murder of a man named C.J. Hatfield. He eventually received three life sentences—two for the meth, and one for his role in the murder.

Sitting across from Robinson—an attentive woman with blond hair and a pillowy Southern accent—the 38-year-old Bailey explained that he’d been the victim of corrupt police officers and prosecutors in his former home of Dothan, Alabama. He wasn’t a murderer, Bailey said, but he’d never had a lawyer who could help him prove it. Robinson’s legal career up to this point had been limited to three years spent doing entry-level work at civil litigation firms. If Bailey was telling the truth, his case represented exactly the sort of miscarriage of justice that would vindicate her recent decision to get back into practicing law after working as a stay-at-home mother for most of her 30s.

Bailey handed Robinson a copy of his murder trial transcript, which he’d been keeping in his prison cell for years. Robinson took the document. She made no promises but told Bailey she would look into his case.

2.

About a month after her first meeting with Bailey, on a day when the local news was predicting tornadoes, Robinson drove from Birmingham to Dothan, a flat, humid city of about 70,000 that is built around a circular four-lane highway crowded with restaurant chains, big box stores, and auto-body shops. Robinson timed her trip to Dothan to coincide with a press conference hosted by the Alabama chapter of the NAACP. The event had been organized in the wake of an incendiary article published by a local writer named Jon Carroll on a blog called the Henry Report, which accused Dothan law enforcement officials of planting drugs on hundreds of innocent black residents and participating in a neo-Confederate hate group.

The article, which was accompanied by a cache of documents that Carroll said had been leaked to him by whistleblowers, received wide attention after getting a signal boost from the Southern Poverty Law Center. It portrayed Dothan as a city infested with sadistic, racist, and dishonest cops, a characterization that prompted a nationwide furor. Ultimately, the article’s most stunning claims proved impossible to verify based on the documents Carroll had posted. While the documents did suggest the possibility of wrongdoing, they did not constitute proof of even one case of drug planting, let alone hundreds.

Nevertheless, the blog post emboldened a chorus of local residents to voice their complaints about police misconduct to the NAACP and prompted the city’s police chief to request an FBI investigation into his department—an investigation that is still ongoing. In December, a yearlong reporting project by the New York Times culminated with a front-page story about the Dothan area’s long-serving district attorney, Doug Valeska. The Times article, published as part of a series on the corrupting role of money in the criminal justice system, described Valeska’s practice of granting leniency to some defendants if they can pay a fee—a dubious policy that offers second chances to people who can afford them while leaving the area’s poorest residents, who are disproportionately black, to face harsh punishments.

James Bailey, Robinson’s new client, was white. Even so, she wanted to go to the NAACP event to judge for herself whether law enforcement in Dothan was as crooked as Bailey insisted. With Bailey’s 60-year-old mother at her side, Robinson watched as a series of speakers stood in front of the Dothan Civic Center and described their brushes with injustice. “I listened to these people and felt like, Oh my God,” she recalled later.

After the press conference, Robinson was getting ready to make the three-hour drive home to Birmingham when it became clear the tornado warnings from earlier in the day had not been empty threats. With multiple twisters touching down around the area, Bailey’s mother convinced Robinson to wait out the storm at her house.

As they watched the evening news together, looking for coverage of the NAACP event and hoping to spot themselves in the crowd, Bailey’s mother told Robinson about a cardboard box that had been sitting under her bed for years. The box was full of paperwork related to her son’s case, and it had grown increasingly heavy with each of his failed attempts to secure post-conviction relief.

Robinson dumped the contents of the box onto the living room floor and began picking through the mess. It was then, Robinson says, that she discovered a pair of extraordinary documents. Photocopied and smelling faintly of stale cigarette smoke, the pieces of paper seemed to reveal something shocking—a plot by authorities to charge James Bailey with a crime they knew he didn’t commit.

Dothan Eagle

On the morning of Saturday, March 13, 2004, a pair of turkey hunters—one of whom happened to be the local coroner—found a dead body near the side of a dirt road on the rural outskirts of Dothan. The man had been shot three times: once above his right eye, once in the left cheek, and once in the throat. When investigators arrived on the scene that morning, they found several promising pieces of evidence, including two wet spots in the dirt that appeared to be urine as well as a set of tire tracks suggesting the recent presence of a large truck. The identity of the deceased, however, remained a mystery. Dressed in a gray T-shirt, a Nike windbreaker, and Phat Farm jeans, he had nothing in his possession other than the hat that sat sideways on his bloodied head—no driver’s license, no credit cards, no keys.

He did have a number of distinctive tattoos, including a samurai warrior battling a dragon on his back and the word outcast in old-English lettering on his calf. That night, when the tattoos were described on the 10 o’clock news, Doni Mobley knew right away that the newscasters were talking about her 23-year-old son, C.J. Hatfield. Mobley called the police. “I want to go where he is,” she told the dispatcher. “I want to see the body. I want to know if it is him.”

Mobley hadn’t seen her son in more than a month. They’d been arguing, she would later testify in court, about “his habits and his choice of friends,” and she had unhappy suspicions about how he was earning money. In the aftermath of Hatfield’s death, those suspicions were grimly validated, as law enforcement quickly settled on a suspect named Jason Stuckey who was known to be a drug dealer in Dothan and was believed to be an associate of Hatfield’s.

Stuckey was 28 years old and drove a black Toyota pickup truck. He had piercings in both ears and one on his left eyebrow. In high school he had played baseball, but in the years after graduation he had become an addict—first to painkillers, then to meth—and eventually entered the drug trade himself.

Stuckey’s business was modest, but at the time of Hatfield’s death, he was in the process of seeking out better connections so he could move more of his product—mostly “ice,” an extra-pure form of meth. Stuckey conducted most of his transactions at Dothan’s biggest nightclub, Grand Central Station, where he had briefly worked at as a bar-back.

By the time of Hatfield’s murder, Stuckey had left his job at Grand Central but continued making money there by selling drugs to its customers. He also continued hanging out with members of the club’s staff: Three of the bouncers at the club had become Stuckey’s friends and associates, and for several months starting in late 2003, they had all been roommates in his two-story Dothan townhouse. James Bailey was also part of Stuckey’s crew and worked at Grand Central—sometimes as a DJ in one of the smaller rooms upstairs and other nights as a food vendor selling microwave hamburgers and pizzas to clubgoers.

The Hatfield case was handled at its outset by an old hand from the Alabama State Bureau of Investigation named Tommy Merritt and Troy Silva, a young detective from the Henry County Sheriff’s Office who had never before investigated a murder. After conducting interviews with people in Stuckey’s circle, Merritt and Silva began to build a timeline. Hatfield and Stuckey had driven to Atlanta to buy about $3,000 worth of meth. But instead of fulfilling their end of the deal, the people Hatfield and Stuckey met with in Atlanta robbed them at gunpoint and took their money, their cellphones, their wallets, and the keys to Stuckey’s pickup. The ordeal had left the two men stranded, forcing them to hot-wire Stuckey’s truck to get home to Dothan.

How Hatfield ended up dead would prove harder for investigators to nail down, as they relied almost entirely on hearsay statements made by Stuckey’s bouncer friends from Grand Central Station. According to the bouncers, Stuckey had become convinced at some point after leaving Atlanta that Hatfield had set up the robbery. Enraged and resolved to exact revenge, Stuckey turned off onto a quiet, out-of-the-way road about 30 miles from Dothan, parked his truck, and invited Hatfield out for a bathroom break. When they finished, Stuckey aimed his gun at Hatfield and shot him three times.

On Tuesday, March 16, 2004, less than 72 hours after Hatfield’s mother identified her son’s body, Stuckey was arrested while leaving the home of his friend James Bailey. He surrendered without a struggle, though when questioned by investigators later in the day, he declined to provide a statement.

The circumstantial case against Stuckey was strong. By the time he entered his plea of not guilty, police had evidence that he had bought new tires after the murder and used them to replace a pair of all-terrain ones that seemed to match the tracks found at the crime scene. The police had also recovered a possible murder weapon—a Taurus .38 Special snub-nose revolver—from a man who said he’d purchased it from one of Stuckey’s bouncer friends the day after the body was found. The man said that when he took possession of the gun, it had three empty rounds and two live ones.

But the investigation did not end with Stuckey’s arrest. Though the Stuckey-as-lone-gunman theory was attractive for its simplicity, the police had heard too many conflicting stories to feel confident that it was true. They believed, instead, that one or more of the people they had interviewed in the opening days of the investigation were lying to them about their involvement in the murder. That group included Hatfield’s girlfriend, two of the bouncers who used to live in Stuckey’s townhouse, and the friend he’d been visiting when he was apprehended: James Bailey.

The C.J. Hatfield murder investigation dragged on for almost a full year, as Stuckey sat in jail awaiting trial. Then, in the fall of 2004, a new homicide investigator named Allen Hendrickson joined the Henry County Sheriff’s Office and began working on the Hatfield case.

Within a few months of Hendrickson’s arrival, the investigation was rocked by a series of breakthroughs, starting with the arrest of James Bailey on drug charges on Dec. 22, 2004. That night, the house that Bailey shared with his girlfriend, Heather Brown, was raided by a vice squad from the sheriff’s office of Houston County—the larger of the two neighboring counties that make up the jurisdiction presided over by District Attorney Doug Valeska. Later, the officers who conducted the raid would testify that they found assorted chemicals used for making methamphetamine—including muriatic acid and Red Devil Lye—under the kitchen sink and recovered three trash bags full of empty Sudafed packets and acetone cans from Bailey’s attic.

Though technically separate from the murder investigation, the raid was set in motion by Hendrickson, who had reported smelling suspicious chemicals at Bailey’s house while trying to talk to him about the Hatfield case. Bailey was arrested, charged, and booked on the drug counts as a direct result of the tip. Heather Brown, who was also in the house at the time of the bust, was not arrested until about three weeks later—a strange delay that an officer later explained in court by stating, “I’m kind of stuck on what I can say. She was left out for a particular reason, and that was to assist us in some way.”

It was also about three weeks after Bailey’s arrest, during an interview with Hendrickson, that Bailey gave an incriminating statement that would eventually lead to his murder conviction. The transcript of the statement that sits in Bailey’s case file begins with him repeating the story he’d told police shortly after the murder—that at the time of Hatfield’s death, he and Heather Brown had been visiting her children in Pensacola, Florida, and staying with an old friend in the nearby beach town of Navarre.

About an hour into the conversation, the transcript indicates, Hendrickson suggested to Bailey that they take a short break, and the transcript cuts off. Later, at his murder trial, Bailey would testify that a group of law enforcement agents, including Hendrickson, took him out for a smoke break and took the opportunity to intimidate him, explaining out of earshot of the tape recorder that they could help him with his drug charges if he agreed to “put the gun in somebody’s hand” in the Hatfield case. If he refused, Bailey alleged the police told him, they would charge him with the murder.

The transcript, of course, does not include any of this alleged exchange. Instead, it shows Hendrickson prompting Bailey to confirm that he has not been threatened or coerced while the recorder was off. He asks Bailey to repeat “some things that you told me out there.”

“Just take a deep breath, OK?” Hendrickson says. “Take your time.”

Bailey then abandons the Florida story. In its place, he provides an entirely new account of what happened on the night of the murder—one more in line with the officers’ suspicion that Jason Stuckey had help in committing the crime. The truth, Bailey says, is that Stuckey called him from the road on his way home from Atlanta, told him he and Hatfield were about to run out of fuel, and asked him to come meet them with a gallon of gasoline. Bailey says he then picked up their mutual friend—and eventual co-defendant—Mark Hammond and took directions from him about where to go.

Dothan Eagle

When they pulled up behind Stuckey’s truck, Bailey says, he stayed in his car while Hammond got out and walked over to Stuckey and Hatfield. Moments later, while he was fiddling with the car stereo, Bailey heard shots—“pow, pow, pow”—and when he looked up, Hatfield was no longer visible.

All of a sudden, Bailey tells the investigators, “Mark was running to the car and he jumped in …. and he said, ‘Motherfucker, if you say anything, I’m gon’ kill you.’ ” Then Stuckey approached and made a more elaborate threat, telling Bailey that unless he kept his mouth shut, he would kill him and his girlfriend, Heather Brown.

During his murder trial three years later, prosecutors would argue that Bailey’s statement constituted evidence that he had provided crucial assistance in the commission of Hatfield’s shooting, and was therefore guilty of murder. Nevertheless, he wasn’t charged immediately after giving his statement, nor is there any indication in the case file that authorities tried to make any arrangements for him to become a state’s witness against Stuckey or Mark Hammond. It wasn’t until two months later, when a second eyewitness came forward with a story that put all six eventual co-defendants on the scene, that Bailey was finally charged. In that second witness statement, the murder of C.J. Hatfield sounded like a full-fledged conspiracy.

Provided in March 2005 by a bouncer from Grand Central Station named John Edward Parmer, the statement laid out a story that was fundamentally inconsistent with the one Bailey had told two months earlier. As Parmer described it, Hatfield had been shot after being lured to a gathering in front of the home of his girlfriend, Sarah Drescher. His body, Parmer said, had then been transported in the back of a truck to the location where it was later found. This wasn’t merely a different narrative than Bailey’s—Parmer’s statement implicated a different though overlapping set of people than Bailey’s had, putting Drescher on the scene of the murder, along with Bailey, Stuckey, Parmer himself, and two other bouncers from Stuckey’s crew.

Tommy Merritt, the investigator who assisted Hendrickson in the murder case, told me he never found Parmer to be particularly credible. “It was kind of like, ‘This is too easy,’ you know?” he said. “When things are real easy, I wonder about their validity.” But when District Attorney Valeska heard about Parmer’s statement, he ordered charges brought against everyone who had been implicated in it, including Bailey.

After he found out he was being charged with murder, Bailey tried to recant his incriminating statement, telling Hendrickson and Merritt he’d invented the story to win leniency on his pending drug charges. “I was looking for a deal and ended up getting caught in the middle of it,” he said, according to a transcript of his police interview. “I knew y’all needed an eyewitness.” It was the first of many times that Bailey would make some variation of this claim over the subsequent decade as he fought for exoneration. He had told a lie, he insisted, and he wanted to take it back.

This is the knot at the center of James Bailey’s story: Either he was lying when he said he was present at the scene of the crime, or he is lying now when he says he was not. By his own admission he is a man who will lie to advance his goals, as I’ve witnessed for myself over the past year of reporting this story. In just the time I’ve known him, Bailey has created a Facebook account under an assumed name to contact his ex-girlfriend’s family, posed as a government investigator to extract information from a stranger over the phone, and maintained a website about his case called “Free Alabama’s Innocent” that purported to be the work of a “watch dog” group. When I confronted Bailey about his deceptions, he replied, “Sometimes you have to use bullshit to grow vegetables.”

There is no question that James Bailey is a liar. But he might be a liar who had nothing to do with the murder of C.J. Hatfield.

Seated in the living room at Bailey’s mother’s house, Ruth Robinson dug through the cardboard box, trying to find and arrange all the pages of the documents that had caught her eye. Once she did, it took all the restraint she could muster not to tell Bailey’s mother she had just found the key to her son’s exoneration.

The first of the two documents appeared to be a copy of a five-page transcript, dated Nov. 22, 2004, of an interview between Heather Brown—the girlfriend Bailey was living with at the time of his drug arrest, as well as his alibi for the murder—and the sheriff’s deputy Allen Hendrickson. Over the course of the conversation, Hendrickson appears to ask Brown to help him get Bailey to talk about Hatfield’s death. When Brown assures him that Bailey wasn’t involved, Hendrickson replies, “We know he was not there. The evidence shows that.” All he wants from Bailey, he explains, is information.

Hendrickson then makes a stunning proposal. Given that Brown has worked with local police to plant drugs on people before, he says, might she be willing to place a batch of chemicals in her home so Bailey could be caught with them, then threatened into cooperating in the Hatfield case? “He don’t have to be there,” Hendrickson is quoted as saying. “We just need chemicals so it looks good.” At the end of the five-page transcript, Brown appears to agree to the plan in exchange for unspecified “favors” and promises Hendrickson she will call him when the setup is ready.

The second document Robinson discovered was even more explosive. Short, type-written, and issued on what looked to be the official letterhead of District Attorney Doug Valeska, it was addressed to Hendrickson and appeared to be signed by Nereida Bundy, a prosecutor in Valeska’s office working the Hatfield murder. In the letter, Bundy indicates she is aware of the Heather Brown interview and instructs Hendrickson to remove the transcript from Bailey’s case file. “Please be advised that there are some discrepancies in the interview … which this office is not willing to support,” the cryptic note reads.

The interview between Hendrickson and Brown suggested that the methamphetamine bust was a straightforward frame-up. The letter from Nereida Bundy, meanwhile, looked like evidence of prosecutorial complicity in concealing a remarkable piece of exculpatory evidence. Robinson asked Bailey’s mother, Frankie McDaniel, where the documents had come from and whether they had ever been presented in court. McDaniel replied that she didn’t know but assumed they had been given to her by one of the many court-appointed lawyers who had represented her son in the years since his arrest. McDaniel, a long-haul trucker who would later testify that she quit school in ninth grade, told Robinson that she had looked at the documents before but had not understood their significance.

With the new evidence in hand, Robinson felt a giddy sense of confidence, even as part of her wondered whether the documents were too good to be true. But given the accusations of police misconduct swirling around Dothan, as well as the growing faith Robinson had in her client, she was inclined to accept the documents’ authenticity. When she told James Bailey about them over the phone, he said he’d never seen them before, but that they were consistent with a statement that Heather Brown had made at his 2005 parole hearing, where she’d attested that the drugs in the house had all been hers. The documents could also explain why only Bailey, and not Brown, had been arrested during the raid on their shared home.

Though Robinson had no courtroom experience, she had a hard time imagining that a judge could look at what she had discovered and decline to either invalidate Bailey’s convictions outright or at the very least grant him a new trial. On Feb. 29, 2016, she filed the Brown-Hendrickson transcript and the Bundy letter in court. Soon afterward, she submitted them as part of a formal petition for a new trial. “[A] fundamental miscarriage of justice has occurred,” Robinson wrote in her filing. “James Bailey hereby asserts that the State’s withholding of evidence constitutes a violation of his constitutional rights.” In March, Jon Carroll of the Henry Report—the writer responsible for the sensational drug-planting story from the previous December—published the documents on his website as part of a high-pitched post calling on the Justice Department to investigate the latest evidence of Dothan’s corrupt law enforcement culture. “The gravity of this case cannot be underestimated,” he wrote.

The reply to Robinson’s filing from the prosecutors in Doug Valeska’s office was swift and unequivocal. “Every material allegation” in Bailey’s petition was unsubstantiated, they wrote, and “a thorough and exhaustive investigation” of his case file had failed to produce any mention of the Hendrickson transcript or the Bundy letter. The documents Robinson had found, the prosecutors alleged, were nothing more than forgeries.

Robinson dismissed the state’s response as further proof that the authorities in Dothan were willing to do and say anything to hide the truth, and she began the work of demonstrating that they were wrong. To show the letter from Nereida Bundy was authentic, she would need to find a certified document examiner who could attest to its validity. To authenticate the transcript, she would need to track down Heather Brown to confirm that Allen Hendrickson had indeed urged her to plant drugs on her boyfriend.

There was a problem, though: No one knew where Heather Brown was. The last time anyone heard from her, she was due in court for a hearing in connection with the drug charges she had eventually picked up after the meth raid on her house. But Brown didn’t show up to the hearing and afterward went abruptly silent: no phone calls to her siblings or her four children, no emails, no logins on her MySpace account. Everyone close to her had come to the conclusion that she was dead.

Brown’s older siblings, Tim Franzen and Erin Hallman, got in touch with Robinson not long after reading about the documents on the Henry Report. (Bailey had sent the story to Brown’s eldest daughter through Facebook, using the pseudonym “Frank W Price”). They had always assumed their sister had died as the result of a conflict with one of her friends or enemies in the Dothan underworld. Now, as they read the alleged transcript of her conversation with Hendrickson, they began to wonder if she’d vanished because someone in law enforcement—someone with an investment in protecting Bailey’s conviction—was worried that she knew too much.

The documents from the cardboard box weren’t the only reason to doubt that James Bailey was involved in C.J. Hatfield’s murder. Investigators had recovered no physical evidence to link him to the crime—no DNA, no fingerprints, no footprints where the body was found. The only thing placing him at the scene was his recanted statement, which no one else had corroborated. Even the prosecutor conceded during Bailey’s trial that without the statement, he couldn’t definitively connect Bailey to C.J. Hatfield’s murder. Every other piece of evidence presented at trial seemed to support, at worst, a scenario in which Bailey helped Jason Stuckey cover up his role in the murder after the fact. That was a crime, but not one that would have carried a punishment nearly so severe as a life sentence.

Neither the investigators who worked the case nor the prosecutors who pursued charges against the six co-defendants could seem to agree on the basic facts of the murder—when it occurred, who was involved, and whether the clearing where Hatfield’s body was found was the scene of the crime or merely the place where his body had been dumped. The consequence of this uncertainty was that, in convicting Bailey and the other two individuals who are still in prison for Hatfield’s death, the state advanced three completely different—and incompatible—stories of how the murder happened and which of the six co-defendants were responsible. In prosecuting Bailey, they told the jury that he had driven gas to the crime scene moments before the murder was committed by the side of a dirt road. In prosecuting Parmer, they accepted the bouncer’s assertion that the murder occurred outside of someone’s house and involved six different people. In prosecuting Stuckey, the key witness they put on the stand said Stuckey had killed Hatfield all by himself.

The confusion left even the victim’s family unsure of whether justice had been served. “We never really got answers,” C.J. Hatfield’s mother told me. “I still don’t know who actually did what.”

Allen Hendrickson, the Henry County investigator who was credited in the Dothan Eagle with cracking the Hatfield murder in March 2005, declined to be interviewed about his work on the case, citing Ruth Robinson’s ongoing efforts to overturn Bailey’s conviction. But Tommy Merritt, the captain in the State Bureau of Investigation, told me that despite spending more than a year interviewing and reinterviewing the suspects and their associates, he could not tell me with certainty who had killed C.J. Hatfield. “I don’t know exactly what happened,” Merritt said.

The investigator blamed the co-defendants for this uncertainty, saying they had offered such a thicket of conflicting, deceitful stories that it was impossible to determine who was telling the truth. “Either these people were incredibly stupid, or incredibly smart,” Merritt said. “If their intent was to really muddy the water to keep us from knowing exactly what happened, they did a really good job.”

Still, Merritt seemed conflicted about the investigation. At one point during our conversation, he said he believed that no innocent people had gone to prison in connection with Hatfield’s death. Moments later, he said that most likely only one of the six defendants—Stuckey—had been responsible for the killing, and that he didn’t know how, exactly, James Bailey fit in. “Them all being there and this all being a conspiracy—it just doesn’t make sense,” he said. “I don’t know if Bailey was there or not. He said he was, and then he said he wasn’t.”

As for the possibility that Allen Hendrickson had asked Heather Brown to plant drugs on Bailey in order to compel Bailey’s cooperation, Merritt told me he could not rule it out. “He did a lot in this case alone that I did not know about and did not approve of. … I couldn’t stop him from whatever he was doing and it caused problems.” Later, in an email, Merritt called Hendrickson a “police officer without discipline,” and added, “I would not conduct an investigation with him again, nor would I allow an Agent under my supervision to do so.”

Even so, Merritt said he was at peace with the outcome of the Hatfield case. All six co-defendants had “had their day in court,” he said. “It was what it was.”

Merritt’s confidence in the outcome of the investigation, despite his clear misgivings about how it was conducted, reflects a paradox inherent in our criminal justice system. Despite the elaborate protocols designed to correct mistakes and reverse unjust verdicts, there exists a powerful inertial force that ratifies past judgments even when they are manifestly flawed. This is especially true for a defendant like James Bailey, a “career criminal,” as the state has described him in court filings, whose claim of innocence is premised on convincing the authorities he is telling the truth when he says he lied to them in the past.

7.

The decision to charge six people on the basis of one questionable statement and several theories of the crime was a typically aggressive move by Doug Valeska, who left his job last month as district attorney for Henry and Houston counties after a 30-year career. A proud upholder of “law and order” values, Valeska is known across Alabama for his reluctance to accept plea bargains, and for his fondness of the death penalty. As AL.com reported last year, Houston County “imposes the death penalty more often than any other county in a state that imposes the death penalty more often than any other state in the nation.”

Valeska’s severity was also reflected in his voracious approach to charging decisions. One local bail bondsman put it to me this way: “Down here … they find a joint in the car, they’ll charge everybody in the car and figure it out later.” A circuit judge confirmed that characterization when a defense lawyer noted that six people had been accused of C.J. Hatfield’s murder. “Yeah,” the judge said in court. “This is the 20th Judicial Circuit. … The pattern is to charge anybody in all directions in the beginning, and then let somebody sort it out.”

James Bailey and his five co-defendants appeared in front of a judge for a preliminary hearing in April 2005. Over the course of the all-day session, defense lawyers pointed out a string of flaws in the state’s case, asking questions that prompted investigators to respond with variations of “I don’t know” or “I don’t recall” dozens of times. The state’s witnesses couldn’t account for the fact that statements given by James Bailey and John Edward Parmer contradicted one another on the most basic of facts: where the murder took place and who was there. Nevertheless, each defendant’s case was bonded over to a grand jury, and formal indictments on charges of felony murder followed shortly thereafter.

It took more than five years for all the cases to be adjudicated. During that time, Sarah Drescher—who declined to comment for this article—was cleared of all charges while two of the bouncers from Jason Stuckey’s crew—both of whom deny having anything to do with Hatfield’s murder—avoided prison by pleading guilty to the lesser charge of hindering prosecution. In 2009, Parmer pleaded guilty to manslaughter after stipulating that he had failed to prevent Hatfield’s murder and had helped to move his body.

In an interview, Parmer told me that, like Bailey, he had given his incriminating statement in an attempt to secure leniency on an unrelated charge—in his case, a robbery he had committed at a Dothan gas station while wielding an ax. “I was telling them what I thought they wanted to know,” Parmer said by phone from prison. “I’m the reason all this stuff is screwed up like it is and everybody got messed around like they did,” he said.

Bailey and Stuckey were both ultimately convicted by juries and sentenced to life in prison. Bailey’s trial came first. It reached its climax when his court-appointed lawyer put him on the stand and exposed him to the kind of brutal cross-examination that illustrates why defense attorneys typically advise their clients not to testify.

It began smoothly enough. Bailey testified that he didn’t see Stuckey until several days after the murder, at which point he confessed, tearfully, to what he’d done and asked Bailey for advice. Bailey said he told his friend to turn himself in and hire a lawyer, and that Stuckey was on his way to do just that when he was arrested outside Bailey’s house.

On cross-examination, Bailey was questioned about how he’d been able to draw a picture of the crime scene for investigators during his interrogation if, as he now claimed, he had never been there. He explained that the police had shown him photos of the scene and that he’d remembered them. “I have an excellent [memory],” he said. “I have an associate’s degree in drafting.”

Bailey was also asked about Heather Brown, whose absence from the courtroom was glaring:

Prosecutor Gary Maxwell: Where is [Brown]?

Bailey: Your guess is as good as mine, sir.

Maxwell: Did you subpoena her?

Bailey: Did I subpoena her? I don’t have an address for her.

Maxwell: She would be an important witness, wouldn’t she? She could verify a lot of things you said, wouldn’t she?

Bailey: She sure would.

Maxwell: What efforts did you make to get her here?

Bailey: The Houston County Sheriff’s Department has been looking for her for four years. … I tried to contact her through the last address I had. She is wanted. I don’t think they will find her.

The prosecutor also confronted Bailey with a series of inconsistencies in the portion of his police interview that occurred before the suspicious smoke break:

Maxwell: So why all of a sudden are you telling lies before the break then?

Bailey: There were many lies told in that.

Maxwell: And you have told lies and lies and lies, according to what you … have said about this, right?

Bailey: Yes.

Maxwell: But you’re telling the truth today?

Bailey: Yes.

Maxwell: And you want the jury to believe that you lie to the police, you lie to everybody else, but you’re telling the truth today?

Bailey: The evidence will show the truth.

The jurors were not impressed by Bailey’s performance. After the judge explained that they didn’t need to think the defendant had himself shot C.J. Hatfield to find him responsible for the murder—only that he had been party to the planning or commission of the crime—the jury quickly came back with a guilty verdict. A month later, in December 2008, Bailey received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.

Stuckey’s trial, which took place in 2010, turned on the testimony of Scott “Bam Bam” Mathis, one of Stuckey’s old friends from Grand Central Station. He told the jury what he’d told the police back in 2004: that Stuckey called him the day after he’d killed C.J. Hatfield, confessed, and asked him to sell the murder weapon. “He told me that he pulled over, C.J. woke up, and Stuckey said he had to use the bathroom,” Mathis said. “He told me that he shot him in the chest area. And he said as soon as C.J. hit the ground, he walked up and shot him two more times … in the face area.”

Parmer, whose testimony would have contradicted that of Mathis, was not called as an eyewitness, meaning the Stuckey-as-lone-gunman theory carried the day. The jury found him guilty, prompting Stuckey to convince the judge to let him retroactively admit to his role in the murder in exchange for a lesser sentence. The judge agreed, giving Stuckey a life sentence, but with the possibility of parole.

After the trial, Stuckey met with C.J. Hatfield’s mother, Doni Mobley. “They let him go into a room and talk to me, and I told him, ‘Take me through every step. I want to know every single detail,’ ” Mobley recalled recently. “He said that on the way home from Atlanta he was mad [about the robbery], and that he was on drugs and he was high, and he kept getting madder and madder and madder, and when they stopped somewhere to pee, he killed him. … I can’t remember exactly what he said, but he told me he shot him, and then he shot him again, and then he shot him again to make sure he was dead.”

Mobley told Stuckey she didn’t believe him—that she was certain that other people had played a role in her son’s death. But Stuckey held firm: No one else was involved, only him.

Stuckey’s willingness to take sole responsibility for the murder—something he had not done at the time of Bailey’s trial—became one of the main pieces of evidence in Bailey’s efforts to overturn his conviction. In 2011, with help from a Dothan lawyer named Allen Mitchell, he filed a petition for an evidentiary hearing during which Stuckey would testify on his behalf. When Stuckey took the stand, he told the court the same thing he had told Mobley: that neither Bailey nor anyone else had been present when he shot C.J. Hatfield by the side of a dirt road, and that anyone who said otherwise wasn’t telling the truth.

“Mr. Bailey is a lot of things, a liar is the first and foremost; [but] a murderer, he is not,” Stuckey said, according to a court transcript. “I acted alone. It was me.”

The presiding judge wasn’t convinced. In a written opinion, he declined Bailey’s petition on the grounds that he was “not inclined to pick and choose which part of the co-defendants’ testimonies is true at any given time.” On appeal, a different judge ruled that Stuckey’s testimony couldn’t be trusted because, as a convicted killer who would be spending the rest of his life in prison regardless of what happened to Bailey, he had nothing to lose by trying to clear his friend’s name.

Bailey appealed the decision all the way up to the Alabama Supreme Court. His conviction was upheld every step of the way. By the beginning of 2016, he told me, he’d given up any hope of winning his freedom. Then Ruth Robinson called him in prison, hoping to speak to another man named Bailey.

8.

A judge in the 20th Judicial Circuit scheduled an evidentiary hearing to debate the legitimacy of Robinson’s documents for July 18. Technically, the hearing would be extremely limited in scope and would be concerned only with the validity of Bailey’s Houston County drug conviction. But Robinson saw it as an opportunity to exonerate Bailey completely. If she could cast doubt on his drug arrest, she reasoned, the confession he had given while in custody would be called into question as well.

On June 21, the Alabama Office of the Attorney General filed a notice of appearance in the Bailey matter, informing Ruth Robinson and the court that the state’s top prosecutor would be sending a few of his people down from Montgomery to Dothan to help District Attorney Valeska with the case. A week later, the AG’s office took the extraordinary step of asking the court to remove Robinson as Bailey’s lawyer, on the grounds that prosecutors intended to call her as a witness. The filing read:

In his petition, the Defendant alleges that he has newly discovered evidence that entitles him to post conviction relief. This alleged new evidence was discovered by Attorney Ruth Lang Robinson on February 23, 2016, underneath the Defendant’s mother’s bed. … The State avers that these documents are not legitimate and are, for lack of a better term, false.

Robinson was livid, if flattered, that the attorney general of Alabama wanted her off the case. “They’re trying to make a Bruce Cutler out of me,” she told me by phone, referring to the lawyer who was blocked from defending mob boss John Gotti in a 1991 murder case amid allegations that he had been complicit in Gotti’s criminal activity. “I have done nothing wrong,” Robinson said.

With less than three weeks left before the evidentiary hearing, the judge presiding over the case declined to grant the state’s motion to disqualify Robinson, asking instead that she consult with the Alabama State Bar so that the issue could be discussed at the hearing. In a letter that Robinson later filed with the court, a representative for the bar advised that Bailey’s mother would be no less effective than his lawyer at providing testimony about the circumstances under which the disputed documents were discovered.

In preparing for the hearing, Robinson’s central task was to prove that the documents she had found in Bailey’s mother’s house were authentic. But Robinson’s deepening obsession with Bailey’s innocence—at one point she told me that even her young children had started asking her about when “James” would be getting out of prison—made it hard for her to stay focused on that goal. Instead, she immersed herself in every aspect of her client’s legal history, traveling to prisons around Alabama to conduct interviews with his co-defendants in the murder case, trying to figure out where Heather Brown’s body might have been buried, and doing extensive opposition research on the law enforcement agents connected to Bailey’s case.

No one interested Robinson more than Allen Hendrickson, who had long since stopped working at the Henry County Sheriff’s Office and was now a police officer in two tiny cities outside of Dothan. Hendrickson, Robinson learned, had joined the Hatfield investigation in late 2004 after being fired from his previous job in neighboring Houston County. The reason for his termination, according to a letter Robinson had obtained, was a pattern of refusing “to accept and conform to department policy and guidelines” and “providing false information to supervisors.” The letter, written by Hendrickson’s then-boss Lamar Glover, also noted that Hendrickson had tested positive for methamphetamine. (When I showed Glover a copy of the nearly 13-year-old letter, he said that while he could not recall the details, the letter was authentic.)*

As Robinson bore deeper into Bailey’s case, she and her client communicated with increasing regularity, making plans for all the “secret weapons”—Bailey’s phrase—they would spring on their opponents.

Robinson arrived in Dothan a few days before the hearing and met me and Frankie McDaniel, Bailey’s mother, for dinner at a TGI Fridays. As we waited for a table, Robinson clutched her handbag as if someone might tear it from her shoulder, and her eyes rarely settled on any one part of the dining room. McDaniel seemed similarly unnerved, knowing she had to testify about the documents Robinson had found in her house. As we sat down at our table, Robinson tried to buoy McDaniel’s spirits. “We’re gonna win,” the lawyer said. “We’re gonna win.”

“That’s my angel,” McDaniel said, softly. “I don’t know where she came from, but she’s my angel.”

The rapport between Robinson and McDaniel was tender but tense, with the lawyer exhibiting a palpable protectiveness over her client’s mother and trying to channel confidence. But Robinson was also on edge, having now dedicated months of her life to helping Bailey without any guarantee that she’d ever be paid for her work. McDaniel had managed to send her two payments of $250 over the course of six months. Robinson was proceeding with the understanding that her services would never be fully compensated unless she succeeded in exonerating Bailey and could move on to pursue civil damages.

When our food arrived, McDaniel took our hands and said a prayer. “Oh lord, thank you for this food we’re about to receive,” she said. “And lord, put your hands on us come Monday, and help us show that our son is innocent of the crime, and should be at home, and that we love him.”

Over the course of dinner, we talked about the day McDaniel and Robinson first met and the night they discovered the documents that would be scrutinized at the upcoming hearing. We also discussed Doug Valeska; I mentioned that I’d gone to his office and asked for an interview, but that I’d been turned down. At one point, Robinson paused and indicated that we should be more discreet. “I think there’s some people here who don’t need to hear this conversation,” she said.

“Over there?” I asked, gesturing toward two men seated near us at the bar.

“Everywhere,” Robinson said.

10.

On the morning of the hearing, an assortment of Bailey’s relatives—including his mother and his 21-year-old son, Billy—stood in line in front of the Houston County Courthouse waiting for the metal detector attendant to wave them through. Heather Brown’s siblings were there, too, as was C.J.’s Hatfield’s mother.

Shortly after 9 a.m., Ruth Robinson walked into the courtroom and sat down next to her client, who was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and had his hands folded in front of him in a pair of chunky handcuffs. On the other side of the room sat an imposing group of prosecutors, including Doug Valeska, an assistant DA, and three lawyers from the Alabama attorney general’s office. Robinson approached Frankie McDaniel, her first witness, and began her questioning:

Robinson: Hi, Ms. McDaniel. How are you this morning?

McDaniel: I’m fine. How are you?

Robinson: I’m OK. Can you kind of fill us in on what’s been going on this last week or so—

Judge Bradley Mendheim: I’m sorry. Can I get her name first? I’m sorry. What’s your name?

McDaniel: Frankie McDaniel.

Judge Mendheim: I’m sorry. Go ahead.

District Attorney Doug Valeska: We’re going to object to “just kind of fill us in.”

Judge Mendheim: Sustained as to the form.

It was an infelicitous beginning. At one point during the direct examination of McDaniel, the state objected to a line of questioning involving the Bundy letter, and the back-and-forth that followed seemed to expose Robinson’s lack of familiarity with basic courtroom procedures. Seeing that Robinson was flustered by the exchange, Judge Mendheim—who, with his thin-framed eyeglasses and methodically slow diction, brought to mind a good-natured math teacher—exhibited a tentative but generous patience. “I understand, obviously, why you’re anxious,” he said.

Despite being unable to hide her nervousness, Robinson scored some points in the presentation of her case. The strongest came by way of a forensic handwriting analyst and document examiner named Steven Drexler, who testified that the Nereida Bundy signature at the bottom of the disputed prosecutor’s letter was “probably” authentic and that the letter itself did not betray signs of Photoshop-style manipulation.

Though Drexler could only phrase his conclusions in terms of probability—“Working from a copy as a questioned document, I can't totally, 100 percent, eliminate the possibility of a very skillful cut and paste,” he said—his testimony carried credibility: Drexler was the only document examiner in Alabama certified by the American Board of Forensic Document Examiners. He was also someone Allen Hendrickson had previously relied on as an expert while investigating the Hatfield murder.

In questioning her other witnesses, Robinson betrayed the scattershot approach she’d taken in her preparation, eliciting intriguing testimony that lacked clear relevance to the matter at hand. While her opponents kept their arguments relatively simple—Hendrickson denied that he had ever had a conversation like the one depicted in the transcript; Nereida Bundy said she had not written the letter—Robinson worked in fitful, impressionistic circles.

At one point, she called to the stand a woman named Crystal Boyett, a childhood friend of Bailey’s who also happened to be Allen Hendrickson’s former sister-in-law. Boyett’s name had appeared in the disputed transcript, and when she read about it on the Henry Report, she contacted Hendrickson over Facebook. On the stand, Boyett testified that when she asked Hendrickson what to do if she got subpoenaed as a witness, he replied in a threatening manner. Robinson asked Boyett to read from a printout of the Facebook exchange:

Hendrickson: If you do get called just say it’s been a long time. … They can’t make you remember.

Boyett: I will not do that if James is innocent you need to let him out

Hendrickson: James Bailey is not innocent he lied to me and now he has to live with the consequences. It back fired.

Boyett: He is innocent and that is wrong and you know that

Hendrickson: But he was found guilty and that’s that. … you just keep your mouth shut or I will make sure you do I’m done with this. Don’t text me again

Boyett: He don’t deserve that

Hendrickson: Well I didn’t put him there his roommate did

The exchange, which the state did not dispute, reflected poorly on the investigator whose work on the Hatfield case had put Bailey in prison. But it didn’t tell Judge Mendheim anything about whether the transcript or the Bundy letter were authentic.

The same problem plagued Robinson when she questioned Robert Brown, Heather Brown’s ex-husband and the father of her children. Brown made two central assertions under oath: that his ex-wife had gone missing a decade ago and that he knew she and James Bailey were in Florida at the time of the Hatfield murder. These claims would have been consequential if Brown had been testifying at Bailey’s murder trial. In the context of a hearing to determine whether the documents Robinson had found were authentic, they amounted to a useless digression.

Early on the second day of testimony, Robinson requested to have Bailey’s handcuffs removed so he could write her notes while witnesses gave testimony. “I don’t know if anyone really cares, but my client’s handcuffs—they’re bearing into him,” she said. Mendheim denied the request.

Robinson’s inexperience hindered her throughout the hearing. While questioning Hendrickson, she became so frustrated by his defiant manner on the stand—at one point he refused to accept the validity of an official trial transcript because his first name was spelled incorrectly—that she blurted out, to no one in particular, “Another typical Houston County …” Though she trailed off before finishing the thought, Judge Mendheim was taken aback. “Ma’am? Ms. Robinson? Ms. Robinson? I need you to stop,” he said, as Robinson tried to clarify her comment. He continued in an injured tone:

Judge Mendheim: Please stop and focus on me for just a moment. Just stop. … That is a completely inappropriate comment. I take it personally. And I’m personally offended because it’s from a lawyer. ... I don’t care what criminal defendants say about me. But when a lawyer comes in here and insults the county that I was born and raised in, I just—I completely don’t understand it. I’m not insulting where you’re from. I don’t even know what you’re referring to. I’m trying to give you a fair trial and a fair hearing. I’m bending over backwards.

Robinson: Well, Your Honor—

Judge Mendheim: I mean, if you don’t think I can be fair, you should have filed a motion to recuse.

Robinson: Yes, Your Honor. Can I do so now?

There were audible gasps in the courtroom. But before the situation could escalate further, Robinson withdrew her comments, apologized, and was allowed to move on.

After the hearing ended, Bailey was escorted out of the courtroom by a pair of deputies. On his way out, he almost collided with several members of the attorney general’s team in the hallway. As he was being led away, he seemed to apologize to them on his lawyer’s behalf. “This is not her thing,” he said.

On Aug. 3, two weeks after the hearing, Robinson submitted a written pleading in which she articulated a number of legal arguments that had come through faintly, or not at all, in court. The pleading was a last stand of sorts. In it, Robinson argued that Mendheim had a responsibility to consider “the entire record” when evaluating Bailey’s claim. She cited a U.S. Supreme Court case from 1976:

The [prosecutor’s] omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record. If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial. On the other hand, if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.

Robinson ended her pleading with a quotation from Robert F. Kennedy: “Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.”

Mendheim was unmoved. On Aug. 12, he ruled against Bailey in a 25-page opinion. The Hendrickson-Brown transcript, he wrote, could not be authenticated given that there was no “original” version of it—only a copy—and that there was no audio recording. The Bundy letter didn’t strike him as any more credible, despite the testimony of the document examiner. Nereida Bundy, Mendheim wrote, had sounded “genuinely shocked, aghast, and upset that her integrity as a lawyer, prosecutor and a person was attacked in such a way.” He continued:

[T]he petitioner has offered no explanation or motive for Nereida Bundy to write not only a professionally unethical letter, but also one that could lead to criminal liability. … Why would Ms. Bundy seek to “frame” an innocent man for a crime he did not commit? Why would that person be the petitioner, James Bailey? It is illogical that Ms. Bundy, an experienced lawyer and prosecutor, a well-educated person, would memorialize a conspiracy to frame an innocent man by writing a letter. If what the petitioner claims is true, she could accomplish the same purpose verbally, and not have a lifetime of fear that her conduct may be uncovered.

In his analysis of the Bundy letter, Mendheim hit on the most basic argument for treating both documents with skepticism: Who would be so brazen, or so stupid, to conduct their conspiracy in writing? If an investigator wanted to ask Heather Brown to plant drugs on her boyfriend, he would presumably do so without a tape recorder running. If a prosecutor wanted to bury an inconvenient piece of evidence, she would almost certainly give the order in person or over the phone.

There were others reasons to be suspicious of the documents, reasons that Mendheim did not discuss in his ruling. Above all, they seemed a little too convenient—a pair of puzzle pieces perfectly configured to complete a picture of the case in which James Bailey has been railroaded by the authorities. In just a few short pages, they discredited the investigator who arrested Bailey and the assistant district attorney who prosecuted him, and did the work of absolving him of both his drug charge and his murder charge. The transcript even contained a passage that suggested Hendrickson knew that Bailey was not guilty of the murder but that he’d participated in prosecuting him anyway.

Another red flag was the similarity—pointed out to me by a team of forensic linguists led by Robert Leonard at Hofstra University—between the transcript’s opening and some boilerplate from a conversation between Hendrickson and Heather Brown that had been captured on tape. Both interviews began with Hendrickson saying to Brown, “Heather, do you understand your rights? You’ve been advised of your rights. Do you understand your rights? Are you giving me this statement without the presence of your attorney?” In both transcripts, Brown says, “Yes,” and Hendrickson responds, “Ok that’s freely correct?” The repetition could suggest either that the documents Robinson had found were authentic—that that was just how Hendrickson opened his interviews—or that they’d been forged by someone who was familiar with the details of Bailey’s case and had access to his case file.

James Bailey assured me on multiple occasions that he did not forge the documents. “No. Never,” he said last summer. “I gave up [on my case], man. I gave up three years ago. If I had had this, you think I would have given up?” Later, he said that if he had forged the documents, he would have done a better job. “I’ve thought about it, you know? If I was to do it, how would I do it?” he said. “Well, there’s a lot of things … that I would have done a lot differently if I’d done it.”

Had Bailey asked anyone outside of Holman prison to forge the documents on his behalf? “I promise I didn’t,” Bailey said. “And I promise that nobody in my family did. … I mean, my son, he could do it if I could get him to talk to me. But I mean, I talk to him like once a month.”

Bailey was referring to his eldest child, Billy Norton. Norton, who was 21 when I met him at a bar outside of Dothan last summer, talked nonchalantly about being the owner of six or seven email addresses and described for me the freelance work he did as a white-hat hacker for companies trying to test their security. Norton also told me that he’d offered to help his father get out of prison by forging some documents for him, but that Bailey had said it was unnecessary given the vast amount of real evidence he already had working in his favor.

“Between … what I can do with Photoshop and everything, I mean, it could be easily done,” Norton said, in between puffs on a vape pen. “But never once has he asked me to do anything of that nature. In a way it surprises me, but at the same time it doesn’t. … My dad, to be blunt, is honest. He’s like me.”

Ruth Robinson, for her part, forcefully denied playing any role in forging the documents when I asked her about it after the hearing. And despite Mendheim’s unfavorable ruling, she was determined to press ahead with Bailey’s case, appealing the decision to Alabama’s Court of Criminal Appeals and filing a petition for a second evidentiary hearing, this time in Henry County (where Hatfield was killed) instead of Houston County (where Bailey was arrested on the drug charges).

It was around this time that I received a phone call from Heather Brown. She was calling from a jail in Canada, she told me, where she’d been arrested after living under an assumed name for more than 10 years. She also told me that everything in the Hendrickson transcript was true.

12.

Brown had been arrested in British Columbia during the first week of September and deported about two months later to Whatcom County Jail in Washington state. She was now being held as a fugitive from justice awaiting extradition to Alabama.

Though the circumstances under which she was discovered and apprehended are murky—privacy laws in Canada make it impossible to independently verify the details of her arrest—her brother Tim Franzen told me that an FBI agent named Tracy Lollis had been looking into Brown’s disappearance for several months. While there is no evidence Lollis was responsible for Brown being captured, the timing is suggestive: According to Franzen, Lollis traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, to interview Brown in jail almost immediately after her arrest.

Reached by phone at his office, the FBI agent declined to comment, emphasizing that he could not confirm that any investigation was underway. “I’m not permitted to discuss anything,” Lollis said.

When Brown called me on Oct. 18, she explained that she had fled Dothan in 2006 for a new life in Canada because she believed that she, James Bailey, and her four children in Florida would all be in mortal danger unless she disappeared.

“I was [being] threatened to keep my mouth shut and not to testify on James’ behalf … or I was gonna die,” Brown said, speaking in a low growl that I recognized from listening to tapes of her being interviewed by police. “I am James’ alibi. James did not kill, or have anything to do with, in any shape and/or form, the death of C.J. Hatfield. He was with me, in Florida.”

Brown was adamant, in our conversations, that the police interview represented in the contested transcript really happened—that she vividly remembered Hendrickson asking her one night in late November 2004 to plant drugs on Bailey in order to get him to help with the Hatfield murder. But the more I talked with Brown, the less I felt I could take her recollections at face value. On the one hand, she was consistent—the stories she recounted about fearing for her life in Dothan were the same ones she’d told her family before she disappeared. On the other, the stories strained belief: She talked of coming home to find menacing messages spray-painted on her walls, hearing people whisper ominous warnings into her ear while she was filling up her car with gas, and finding strange photographs of her children in her purse, with death threats scrawled across the back.

“They tried to run me off the road a few times,” Brown told me at one point. “There is a ravine outside of Houston County on a main highway. There’s a bridge, and the ravine is very, very deep. They tried to run me off the road at that ravine, at that bridge. I had been followed quite a bit. Little notes were placed around where I would find them—at my work, and on my car.”

Brown described Dothan, Alabama, as “the most corrupt area that you can even think of in the majority of the U.S.”—a city where police officers covered up murders, sold drugs, and blackmailed women into working for them as undercover informants. Her account of Dothan as a warren of lawlessness recalled the viral blog post that had made the city infamous one year earlier. But as Brown herself conceded, she possessed no more evidence of her claims than Jon Carroll of the Henry Report had presented in that post. Even her corroboration of the disputed documents in Bailey’s case fell somewhat short: Though she insisted the Hendrickson transcript was authentic, she also swore that she never actually followed through on her promise to plant drugs on Bailey. In other words, Brown was willing to ratify the transcript insofar as it illustrated Hendrickson’s misconduct, but she would not take responsibility for the chemicals that had landed Bailey in jail. Someone else must have put them there, she told me.

Not long after Heather Brown’s reappearance in September, Bailey’s exoneration effort was thrown further off course when a minor procedural hearing ended with the Dothan Police Department confiscating Ruth Robinson’s cellphone. As Robinson has since described the incident in a federal civil rights lawsuit, several sheriff’s deputies approached her in the Henry County Courthouse after the hearing, served her with a search warrant, and informed her that she was being investigated for intimidating a witness.

Later, Robinson explained to me that the intimidation complaint stemmed from an interaction she’d had the night before the hearing, involving a woman she had been eager to talk to about Bailey’s case. According to a tip Robinson had received, the woman was privy to some information that was possibly relevant to Bailey’s case. But in pursuing the tip, Robinson seems to have let her tireless dedication edge into recklessness: When the woman indicated she wouldn’t talk to Robinson on the phone, the lawyer looked up her home address and showed up at her doorstep after 10 p.m. The aggressive move frightened the woman so much that she called Allen Hendrickson, a friend, and told him about it. Hendrickson, in turn, referred the matter to the Dothan police.

Robinson filed her civil rights lawsuit against the officer who took custody of her phone on Nov. 8, Election Day, accusing him of seizing her belongings “for the purpose of retaliating against her and preventing her from exercising her rights under the First Amendment to free speech.” Shortly before Christmas, Robinson called me to say that the police had combed through her digital communications with Bailey and had included some of them in a court filing submitted in response to her lawsuit.

In a hushed tone, Robinson said she wanted to tell me something before I heard it from somebody else. She and James Bailey were in love.

“I don’t know if we’ll ever end up together,” she said, emphasizing that the feelings that had developed between them did not constitute an actual relationship. “I don’t even know him. … He’s in prison, and I’m not. So if they were to say we’re having an affair—well, not really.”

I asked Robinson if she thought her feelings for her client had influenced her thinking about the evidence she’d discovered or the broader question of his innocence or guilt.

“I mean it with all purity, I want him to get out of prison because I love him, but I know he didn’t do this,” she replied. “If I had to pick one, if the bar came to me and said you can only do one thing, either be romantic or represent him, then I would choose to represent him, and I think he would too, because that’s what he needs.”

In early January, I reached out to James Bailey over Facebook Messenger. He responded to me with uncharacteristic despair: “Hey don’t think it’s a good idea to talk to me,” Bailey wrote. “[E]veryone that does gets there life ruined and it all has to do with me.”

When I convinced him to get on the phone, Bailey explained why he was feeling so defeated. Not only had the Dothan authorities confiscated his lawyer’s phone, he said, but they were coming after his family, too. His mother, it turned out, had just been jailed on charges of promoting prison contraband. She stood accused of sending a package of cellphones through the mail to Holman that prison guards had intercepted.

“They’re pissed,” Bailey said. “Anything they can do to screw me up, they’re doing it.”

I asked him about his relationship with Robinson.

“I love Ruth,” he said. “She’s the greatest thing that’s happened to me in 13 years. She’s a great person. She’s a kind person. She’s an understanding person.”

About his chances of exoneration, Bailey was less sanguine. He sighed. He didn’t care about his case anymore, he said, and he didn’t think Robinson should either. “I told her to quit. Leave it alone. Just, screw it. Because the deeper this shit gets, the more they’re gonna hurt people. [But] she ain’t going to. She won’t listen. She’s more hard-headed than I am.”

About a month after that conversation, Heather Brown was released from the Whatcom County Jail in Washington, after authorities in Alabama failed to submit a timely extradition warrant requesting her return to Dothan.

I’ve been unable to reach Brown since her release from jail, and her siblings haven’t told me definitively whether she plans to stay on the run or return to Alabama to face her charges and possibly testify on her ex-boyfriend’s behalf.

The district attorney in Dothan declined to respond to questions about Brown’s release or provide an explanation as to why a fugitive wanted for trafficking in methamphetamine had been allowed to go free.

In a recent court filing, the state reaffirmed its opposition to granting James Bailey a new trial, arguing that his petition for post-conviction relief was “meritless” and “predicated on possible criminal activity.”

As of this writing, Ruth Robinson remains James Bailey’s lawyer. She still believes that he will be released from prison.Each day, Slate features an article from Atlas Obscura, the website dedicated to the world’s hidden wonders. You can follow Atlas Obscura on Facebook or on Twitter.

Riggs Library at Georgetown University is one of the United States’ great old book shrines. Dating to 1898, Riggs has four floors of cast iron walkways laid out around a central light court. Sixteen columns divide the hall into smaller alcoves and two spiral staircases connect walkways.

Riggs was designed by an architect named Paul J. Pelz who had just finished drawing up blueprints of the Library of Congress. It’s located on the top floor of Healy Hall and has sweeping views down the Potomac River.

Construction of Georgetown’s library was financed by Elisha Francis Riggs, to commemorate his father George and his brother Thomas, and the centennial of the university. Thomas was the force behind the Riggs family fortune. He made a fortune in banking (he ran the so-called “Bank of Presidents”) before turning to philanthropy.

Back in the day, Riggs Library boasted an impressive collection of storied old books. Contemporary writers marveled at the numerous first editions, 18th century prayer books, Chinese dictionaries, and Renaissance-era Italian texts. This treasure trove was protected by “fire proof” building materials: masonry walls, cast iron shelves and terracotta tile floors.

Riggs was a functional library until the 1970s when a larger library facility opened on campus. Today it is used mainly as an event space.Jacob Weisberg talks to the former United States Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul about the latest New York Times story reporting that Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence. Also, the two discuss the steps that need to be taken for an independent investigation and why the leaks coming out of the White House are a cry for help.In 2005, the world was introduced to reclusive billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, friend to princes and an American president, a power broker with the darkest of secrets: He was also a pedophile, accused of recruiting dozens of underage girls into a sex-slave network, buying their silence and moving along, although he has been convicted of only one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor. Visitors to his private Caribbean island, known as “Orgy Island,” have included Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Stephen Hawking.

According to a 2011 court filing by alleged Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre, she saw Clinton and Prince Andrew on the island but never saw the former president do anything improper. Giuffre has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was a minor, a charge Buckingham Palace denies.

“Epstein lives less than one mile away from me in Palm Beach,” author James Patterson tells The Post. In the 11 years since Epstein was investigated and charged by the Palm Beach police department, ultimately copping a plea and serving 13 months on one charge of soliciting prostitution from a 14-year-old girl, Patterson has remained obsessed with the case.

“He’s a fascinating character to read about,” Patterson says. “What is he thinking? Who is he?”

Patterson’s new book, “Filthy Rich: A Powerful Billionaire, the Sex Scandal That Undid Him, and All the Justice That Money Can Buy,” is an attempt to answer such questions. Co-authored with John Connolly and Tim Malloy, the book contains detailed police interviews with girls who alleged sexual abuse by Epstein and others in his circle. Giuffre alleged that Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell, abused her. Ghislaine Maxwell has denied allegations of enabling abuse.

Epstein has spent the bulk of his adult life cultivating relationships with the world’s most powerful men. Flight logs show that from 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane, dubbed “The Lolita Express” by the press, 26 times. After Epstein’s arrest in July 2006, federal tax records show Epstein donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation that year.

Epstein was also a regular visitor to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, and the two were friends. According to the Daily Mail, Trump was a frequent dinner guest at Epstein’s home, which was often full of barely dressed models. In 2003, New York magazine reported that Trump also attended a dinner party at Epstein’s honoring Bill Clinton.

Last year, The Guardian reported that Epstein’s “little black book” contained contact numbers for A-listers including Tony Blair, Naomi Campbell, Dustin Hoffman, Michael Bloomberg and Richard Branson.

In a 2006 court filing, Palm Beach police noted that a search of Epstein’s home uncovered two hidden cameras. The Mirror reported that in 2015, a 6-year-old civil lawsuit filed by “Jane Doe No. 3,” believed to be the now-married Giuffre, alleged that Epstein wired his mansion with hidden cameras, secretly recording orgies involving his prominent friends and underage girls. The ultimate purpose: blackmail, according to court papers.

“Jane Doe No. 3” also alleged that she had been forced to have sex with “numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders.”

“We uncovered a lot of details about the police investigation and a lot about the girls, what happened to them, the effect on their lives,” Patterson says.

“The reader has to ask: Was justice done here or not?”

Epstein, now 63, has always been something of an international man of mystery. Born in Brooklyn, he had a middle-class upbringing: His father worked for the Parks Department, and his parents stressed hard work and education.

‘We uncovered a lot of details about the police investigation and a lot about the girls, what happened to them, the effect on their lives.’ - James Patterson

Epstein was brilliant, skipping two grades and graduating Lafayette High School in 1969. He attended Cooper Union but dropped out in 1971 and by 1973 was teaching calculus and physics at Dalton, where he tutored the son of a Bear Stearns exec. Soon, Epstein applied his facility with numbers on Wall Street but left Bear Stearns under a cloud in 1981. He formed his own business, J. Epstein & Co.

The bar for entry at the new firm was high. According to a 2002 profile in New York magazine, Epstein only took on clients who turned over $1 billion, at minimum, for him to manage. Clients also had to pay a flat fee and sign power of attorney over to Epstein, allowing him to do whatever he saw fit with their money.

Still, no one knew exactly what Epstein did, or how he was able to amass a personal billion-dollar-plus fortune. In addition to a block-long, nine-story mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Epstein owns the $6.8 million mansion in Palm Beach, an $18 million property in New Mexico, the 70-acre private Caribbean island, a helicopter, a Gulfstream IV and a Boeing 727.

“My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won’t get a straight answer from him,” one high-level investor told New York magazine. “He once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I’ve also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It’s like looking at the Wizard of Oz — there may be less there than meets the eye.”

“He’s very enigmatic,” Rosa Monckton told Vanity Fair in 2003. Monckton was the former British CEO of Tiffany & Co. and confidante to the late Princess Diana. She was also a close friend of Epstein’s since the 1980s. “He never reveals his hand . . . He’s a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get.”

Both profiles intimated that Epstein had a predilection for young women but never went further. In the New York magazine piece, Trump said Epstein’s self-professed image as a loner, an egghead and a teetotaler was not wholly accurate.

“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump said. “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Three years after that profile ran, Palm Beach Police Officer Michele Pagan got a disturbing message. A woman reported that her 14-year-old stepdaughter confided to a friend that she’d had sex with an older man for money. The man’s name was Jeff, and he lived in a mansion on a cul-de-sac.

Pagan persuaded the woman to bring her stepdaughter down to be interviewed. In his book, Patterson calls the girl Mary. And Mary, like so many of the other girls who eventually talked, came from the little-known working-class areas surrounding Palm Beach.

A friend of a friend, Mary said, told her she could make hundreds of dollars in one hour, just for massaging some middle-aged guy’s feet. Lots of other girls had been doing it, some three times a week.

Mary claimed she had been driven to the mansion on El Brillo Way, where a female staffer escorted her up a pink-carpeted staircase, then into a room with a massage table, an armoire topped with sex toys and a photo of a little girl pulling her underwear off.

Epstein entered the room, wearing only a towel, Mary said.

“He took off the towel,” Mary told Pagan. “He was a really built guy. But his wee-wee was very tiny.”

Mary said Epstein got on the table and barked orders at her. She told police she was alone in the room with him, terrified.

Pagan wrote the following in her incident report:

“She removed her pants, leaving her thong panties on. She straddled his back, whereby her exposed buttocks were touching Epstein’s exposed buttocks. Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an up-and-down motion. Epstein pulled out a purple vibrator and began to massage Mary’s vaginal area.”

Palm Beach assigned six more detectives to the investigation. They conducted a “trash pull” of Epstein’s garbage, sifting through paper with phone numbers, used condoms, toothbrushes, worn underwear. In one pull, police found a piece of paper with Mary’s phone number on it, along with the number of the person who recruited her.

On Sept. 11, 2005, detectives got another break. Alison, as she’s called in the book, told Detective Joe Recarey that she had been going to Epstein’s house since she was 16. Alison had been working at the Wellington Green Mall, saving up for a trip to Maine, when a friend told her, “You can get a plane ticket in two hours . . . We can go give this guy a massage and he’ll pay $200,” according to her statement to the police.

Alison told Recarey that she visited Epstein hundreds of times. She said he had bought her a new 2005 Dodge Neon, plane tickets, and gave her spending money. Alison said he even asked her to emancipate from her parents so she could live with him full-time as his “sex slave.”

She said Epstein slowly escalated his sexual requests, and despite Alison’s insistence that they never have intercourse, alleged, “This one time . . . he bent me over the table and put himself in me. Without my permission.”

Alison then asked if what Epstein had done to her was rape and spoke of her abject fear of him.

An abridged version of her witness statement, as recounted in the book:

Alison: Before I say anything else . . . um, is there a possibility that I’m gonna have to go to court or anything?

Recarey: I mean, what he did to you is a crime. I’m not gonna lie to you.

Alison: Would you consider it rape, what he did?

Recarey: If he put himself inside you without permission . . . That, that is a crime. That is a crime.

Alison: I don’t want my family to find out about this . . . ’Cause Jeffrey’s gonna get me. You guys realize that, right? . . . I’m not safe now. I’m not safe.

Recarey: Why do you say you’re not safe? Has he said he’s hurt people before?

Alison: Well, I’ve heard him make threats to people on the telephone, yeah. Of course.

Recarey: You’re gonna die? You’re gonna break your legs? Or —

Alison: All of the above!

Alison also told Recarey that Epstein got so violent with her that he ripped out her hair and threw her around. “I mean,” she said, “there’s been nights that I walked out of there barely able to walk, um, from him being so rough.”

Two months later, Recarey interviewed Epstein’s former house manager of 11 years, documented in his probable-cause affidavit as Mr. Alessi. “Alessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day . . . towards the end of his employment, the masseuses . . . appeared to be 16 or 17 years of age at the most . . . [Alessi] would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.”

Another house manager, Alfredo Rodriguez, told Recarey that very young girls were giving Epstein massages at least twice a day, and in one instance, Epstein had Rodriguez deliver one dozen roses to Mary, at her high school.

In May 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department filed a probable-cause affidavit, asking prosecutors to charge Epstein with four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor — a second-degree felony — and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation of a 14-year-old minor, also a second-degree felony.

Today, Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, albeit one who routinely settles civil lawsuits against him, brought by young women, out of court.

Palm Beach prosecutors said the evidence was weak, and after presenting the case to a grand jury, Epstein was charged with only one count of felony solicitation of prostitution. In 2008, he pleaded guilty and nominally served 13 months of an 18-month sentence in a county jail: Epstein spent one day a week there, the other six out on “work release.”

Today, Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, albeit one who routinely settles civil lawsuits against him, brought by young women, out of court. As of 2015, Epstein had settled multiple such cases.

Giuffre has sued Ghislaine Maxwell in Manhattan federal court, charging defamation — saying Maxwell stated Giuffre lied about Maxwell’s recruitment of her and other underage girls. Epstein has been called upon to testify in court this month, on Oct. 20.

The true number of Epstein’s victims may never be known.

He will be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life, not that it fazes him.

“I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an ‘offender,’ ” Epstein told The Post in 2011. “It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.”President Trump's White House press conference on Thursday was Round Two of his battle with CNN's Jim Acosta.

It was supposed to be a presser for Trump to announce his new labor secretary nominee, which he did, but he spent a much longer time criticizing the media for their continued "fake news" coverage. In particular, he was incensed that multiple outlets were reporting false information about leaks coming out of the White House.

At CNN, Trump said, "there is so much hatred and anger" toward him that he just can't understand.

Seeing Acosta shake his head at his remarks, Trump said, "it's okay, Jim, you'll get your chance," meaning he'd soon call on him for a question.

"The public doesn't believe you people anymore," he frankly told Acosta and his network.

President Trump to @Acosta: "I'm changing it from fake news, though. Very fake news." https://t.co/mkjPvSheuV pic.twitter.com/gQ1HU146rw — CSPAN (@cspan) February 16, 2017

Acosta, in response, told Trump that he nor CNN hates him and proceeded to ask his questions.

"Are you undermining people's faith in the First Amendment" and the news media, he wondered.

"I know when I should get bad media," Trump said, disagreeing and noting that CNN airs bad news every single night.

Trump then asked CNN to do some self reflection. He told them to honestly consider not airing such anti-Trump news every night, and they'll see their ratings rise.

"If you told it like it is, I would be your biggest booster."

This was at least the second time Trump has butted heads with Acosta at a press conference. Last month, the president-elect dismissed Acosta as "fake news" and refused to answer his question.

Trump had plenty of other mini battles with reporters at Thursday's conference, which resulted in a very entertaining hour.Happy Presidents Day! What a wonderful occasion to reflect on the people who have served as president of the United States—diverse in their backgrounds, views, races, genders, and creeds, but united in their devotion to the greater good and their extraordinary intelligence, industriousness, and moral rigor.

From the day he announced his campaign and called Mexicans “rapists” through 17 months of promises to erect his big, beautiful wall, Donald Trump made contempt for immigrants a central theme of his campaign. Friday brought news that Trump plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions, who enjoys a reputation as the most anti-immigration U.S. senator, as attorney general. And the previous Sunday, in an interview on 60 Minutes, the president-elect told Lesley Stahl that one of his first priorities in office would be the immediate deportation of 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. (Most advocates say there are at most 800,000 such people.)

Henry Grabar Henry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate’s Moneybox.

Big-city officials had an immediate response: not with our help. Last Monday, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said his department would not assist the Trump administration with deportations. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said his city “is and will remain a sanctuary city.” A handful of other mayors, including those of New York; Oakland, California; Minneapolis; San Francisco; and Seattle, also pledged that they would not relinquish their status as sanctuary cities, places that in some way decline to put their powers in the service of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In the 100-day action plan his transition team released, Trump has promised to block all federal funding for such places, which, depending on how you define sanctuary cities, may number as many as 400. That pledge sets Trump up for a showdown with local officials, including police chiefs and sheriffs, who say aggressive immigration enforcement isn’t compatible with good policing. And it places cities at the frontlines of the resistance against the incoming administration’s policies.

This conflict goes back two decades. Many of the so-called sanctuary cities were indispensable partners in the enormous wave of deportations that surged in the George W. Bush era and peaked, under Obama, with the eviction of more than 400,000 people in fiscal year 2012. The following year, local law enforcement initiated more than half of all nonborder deportations. Now, most large jurisdictions—even those that do not label themselves as sanctuaries, such as Philadelphia, which considers itself a “Fourth Amendment city,” a municipality that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures—will no longer commit their police to federal immigration work. Hundreds of U.S. jurisdictions, including cities, counties, and whole states, are exhibiting some form of noncompliance with federal immigration authorities.

“Local law enforcement is not going to do the job of the federal immigration agency,” Denver Mayor Michael Hancock told me. “It’s not our responsibility.” Denver doesn’t have a formal policy of noncooperation with federal immigration authorities, but it refuses to unlawfully detain suspected undocumented immigrants without warrants. For some jurisdictions, resisting ICE is about limited resources. For others, it is a political, ethical, or economic stand. For nearly all of them, rejecting federal entreaties to find, hold, and hand over undocumented immigrants is considered a requirement of effective urban police work.

Big-city officials had an immediate response to Trump’s immigration plans: not with our help.

This is not a new phenomenon. New York City had a law prohibiting city employees from reporting to federal immigration authorities until Congress pre-empted it in 1996. Then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani, of all people, fought for the city’s law in court and lost. “We can remind people that no one is required to turn in the names of illegal aliens,” he said at the time, “and we can encourage people not to do that.” But even though cities can no longer mandate “don’t tell” provisions, they can still adopt “don’t ask” and “don’t enforce” rules, and so they have.

Today, the nation’s three biggest cities, New York, L.A., and Chicago, alone account for about 2 million of the undocumented residents who help make up the fabric of American life. Can cities—and the hundreds of other jurisdictions that have some kind of explicit sanctuary policy—serve as a bulwark against a Trump administration pushing to deport millions? The answer is almost certainly yes. The question is what it will cost them.

ICE divides deportations into two categories: border and interior. The former is straightforward: Agents apprehend entrants on the coastlines, at airports, and in the desert around the southern border with Mexico. The latter is much more complicated. Once immigrants have integrated into society, their evictions are harder to achieve—in part because they’re harder to justify: They have homes, jobs, children, and communities.

For years, immigration enforcement was the purview of the federal government, which managed to deport tens of thousands each year. Then came the 1996 immigration bill, which gave immigration officials vast powers and expanded the types of crimes that enabled detention. Annual deportations leaped from 70,000 in the 1996 fiscal year to nearly 200,000 two years later. The law also deputized local law enforcement as immigration police. In the wake of Sept. 11, 2001, dozens of jurisdictions signed up, which helped the Bush administration deport 200,000, and then 300,000, and finally nearly 400,000 people a year during his terms. Under a 287(g) agreement, counties such as Texas’ Harris (which includes Houston) and states such as Florida opted to make their cops into the eyes and ears of ICE, changing the nature of police work. The largest local collaborator was Arizona’s Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, where Sheriff Joe Arpaio waged a yearslong campaign of intimidation, harassment, and racial profiling against immigrants. (The Department of Homeland Security rescinded the agreement with Maricopa County in 2010.)

This was a crucial factor in the linear growth of deportations under Bush. ICE is the largest investigative agency in DHS and employs about 6,000 enforcement officers. But its numbers are tiny compared with the nation’s full-time law enforcement officers, who numbered about 725,000 in 2013.

In 2008, at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, the Bush administration introduced a new information-sharing program called Secure Communities. The idea was simple: Any time a participating jurisdiction took fingerprints, it sent them to the FBI. Now, those prints would also be checked against a DHS database. If DHS found someone it suspected could be deported, the agency issued a detainer request. Flagged individuals would then be held in local jails until ICE could arrive and place them in federal custody. Some saw a judge, some didn’t. Few had legal representation. Between 2011 and 2013, when the program was at its peak, S-Comm led to 243,000 deportations—about 40 percent of the total interior removals.

In 2011, states and cities began to withdraw from the program. Part of municipalities’ reluctance stemmed from the human cost of complying with ICE. Jobs were lost and families ruined over minor offenses. Between 2007 and 2012, for example, 260,000 noncitizens were deported for drug possession. Through 2011, according to ICE, more than half of those deported through S-Comm either had no criminal record or had been convicted of minor offenses like traffic violations.

The economic impact of deportations was also becoming obvious, especially in small towns. Postville, Iowa, lost a fifth of its residents over a few hours when 1,000 DHS agents raided the nation’s largest kosher meatpacking plant. The company filed for bankruptcy. The raid cost $5 million.

Perceived as agents of ICE, local police officers were met with growing distrust in Hispanic neighborhoods by both legal and illegal immigrants. A survey of Latinos in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix—four of the nation’s largest Latino population centers—found that 44 percent of Latinos were less likely to contact the police when they were the victims of crimes for fear of ensuing investigations. Even among citizens of Latino origin, nearly a third were less likely to contact the police for fear that cops would use the interaction to investigate their family, friends, or neighbors. The President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, a report released last year, recommended DHS terminate its reliance on state and local criminal justice.

ICE is the largest investigative agency in the Department of Homeland Security. But its numbers are tiny compared with the nation’s full-time law enforcement officers.

Finally, the policy had a dubious legal foundation. By detaining people on the word of ICE, cities made themselves vulnerable to Fourth Amendment lawsuits. In 2014, a handful of federal district courts concluded that local police would be liable for civil rights violations for heeding ICE detainer requests without warrants.

Three things changed in Obama’s second term that conspired to send deportation numbers plummeting to a 10-year low. The Obama administration replaced S-Comm with a less stringent protocol. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson declared a new focus on high-risk individuals. And local resistance flourished.

A crucial question heading into the Trump administration is this: To what extent did local noncompliance precipitate the deportation decline?

When the Obama administration ditched S-Comm, its replacement was a more flexible system called the Priorities Enforcement Program. In some cases, instead of asking local authorities to detain immigrants until they could be picked up, ICE started asking to know release dates. This decreased cities’ liability for complying, and DHS was able to boast that dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions had come back around. It also allowed both federal enforcers and cities to claim victory. Under PEP, only a small percentage of detainer requests are rejected. At the same time, many fewer requests are made. Many advocates, however, saw little difference between S-Comm and PEP and doubted the administration’s claim to be focused on more serious criminals.

Still, deportations fell rapidly. Apprehensions at the border now account for more than two-thirds of deportations, up from about one-third in 2008. The number of ICE deportations that start in the interior and evict U.S. residents has fallen by 70 percent since 2009. Hard-liners see the shift as a concession and a result of a policy that’s a poor, porous substitute for S-Comm.

Trump, among others, has called for S-Comm to be reinstated.

Now the immigration hard-liners have taken over. And we’re about to find out if ICE has really been stymied by the sanctuary movement.

Local resistance to S-Comm posed a “significant challenge,” ICE Director Sarah Saldaña testified last year. But because the backlash to ICE pressure coincided with a vocal realignment of federal priorities—the emphasis on serious criminals, plus PEP—it’s hard to pinpoint how many deportations were avoided because of local noncompliance and could be avoided in the future. Some scholars believe the anti-detainer policies helped change federal policy. Others aren’t so sure.

“If the main reason for that drop is state anti-detainer policy, then a huge amount depends on state resistance,” said Adam Cox, a professor at New York University Law School. If, on the other hand, detainers and deportations have fallen because of federal priorities, cities and states may not have played so great a role in sending the numbers down—and may not be able to offer substantive reprieve in a Trump administration. Trump could immediately direct ICE to aggressively pursue detainers for individuals with nonviolent offenses like marijuana possession or illegal re-entry on their records.

But forcing cities and states to participate will be more difficult. Thanks to a 1997 Supreme Court case (over, of all things, federally mandated background checks for gun sales), local police can’t be dragooned into doing Washington’s work. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to get noncompliant jurisdictions on board. But if the past decade is any guide, local police will resist any stricter policy. Major city police chiefs have repeatedly stated their opposition to enforcing federal immigration law.

They were once the single most important funnel of immigrants into detainment, according to Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute. “I don’t know of a single major city police chief that does not abhor the general entanglement of federal immigration enforcement and local police,” he said. Chishti is optimistic that local authorities can effectively slow a deportation push by Trump.

But while Congress almost certainly cannot force local cops to hold suspects, it can withhold funding—a common way to avoid violating the 10th Amendment, which gives power not explicitly held by the federal government to the states. Trump has said he will cut all federal funding from sanctuary cities as a threat to ensure compliance, taking up a threat that congressional Republicans made last year after a San Francisco woman was murdered by an undocumented immigrant with a criminal record whose detainer request had been ignored by the county sheriff’s department.

How much punishment is Trump willing to inflict on cities?

The version of that bill that was proposed by Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania this summer would have cut two types of federal grants to sanctuary jurisdictions, amounting to a penalty of about $700 million, collectively, on the 10 largest noncompliant localities. That is a small portion of the money cities receive from the federal government but would still put local authorities in a difficult position.

Trump can take action elsewhere, of course. The president can reverse President Obama’s 2012 executive action that created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which allowed so-called Dreamers, who were brought to this country as children, to receive deportation protection and work permits. About 750,000 have been approved. Their information is also in a federal database, putting them at risk under a Trump administration.

Trump’s attorney general—whether it ends up being Sessions or someone else as eager to crack down on undocumented immigrants—could do a wide number of things: Support hostile immigration judges, as Bush Attorney General John Ashcroft did, or tighten asylum rules, or decline to investigate reports of civil rights violations like those that occurred in Maricopa County under Arpaio. He could sue cities with soft “don’t tell” policies, which may violate a section of federal law but have rarely been contested in court. Trump could also try to make good on his campaign promise to triple ICE’s manpower, creating a “deportation force.” House Speaker Paul Ryan has said that is not on the table.Aftenposten/Facebook

In the space of a single day, Facebook has managed to:

Draw condemnation from a Norwegian news organization for censoring a famous work of photojournalism from the Facebook news feed.

Delete a Facebook post by the prime minister of Norway in which she reposted the photo and criticized Facebook for its censorship.

Publicly defend its decision to censor the photo.

Change its mind after a torrent of criticism and pledge to reinstate the deleted posts after all.

Did I mention that Facebook also promoted in its trending news section on Friday a story claiming that the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job? And then, as “a temporary step,” removed the entire trending topic relating to the upcoming 9/11 anniversary?

Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter.

It’s just another day on the world’s most influential news platform, whose founder and CEO continues to insist that it is not a media company.

My colleague Jacob Brogan has more about the dustup over the 9/11 truther story, which is only the latest in a series of embarrassing blunders resulting from Facebook’s misguided attempt to exorcise human judgment from its trending news section.

The photo censorship episode is somewhat different, although it has its roots in the same conundrum. It revolves around the Pulitzer Prize–winning 1972 photo “The Terror of War,” which depicts terrified children fleeing a napalm attack in Vietnam. One of the children was a naked and badly burned 9-year-old girl. The photo has been credited by some with hastening the end of the Vietnam War.

When a Norwegian writer published a series of Facebook posts that included the photograph, Facebook suspended him from the site, according to Aftenposten, the country’s largest print newspaper. The social network had determined that the image violated its anti-nudity policy.

When Aftenposten reported on the censorship in a news article that it shared on its Facebook page along with the photo in question, Facebook deleted the newspaper’s post, too. Aftenposten on Friday responded with a front-page open letter denouncing Facebook’s “abuse of power,” and Norway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, weighed in with her own Facebook post criticizing the the company, again including the photo. Facebook went ahead and deleted that as well.

Pressed by reporters Friday, Facebook defended the decision with the following statement:

While we recognize that this photo is iconic, it’s difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others. We try to find the right balance between enabling people to express themselves while maintaining a safe and respectful experience for our global community. Our solutions won’t always be perfect, but we will continue to try to improve our policies and the ways in which we apply them.

As the outcry grew, Facebook flip-flopped and promised to reinstate the posts it had taken down. It issued a second statement explaining that choice:

After hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time. Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance, the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal, so we have decided to reinstate the image on Facebook where we are aware it has been removed. We will also adjust our review mechanisms to permit sharing of the image going forward. It will take some time to adjust these systems but the photo should be available for sharing in the coming days. We are always looking to improve our policies to make sure they both promote free expression and keep our community safe, and we will be engaging with publishers and other members of our global community on these important questions going forward.

The photo controversy differs from the company’s trending-news snafus in that it centers on Facebook’s signature product, the news feed. In that respect, it’s a bigger deal.

The trending news section is peripheral to the Facebook experience, and its decisions only marginally affect what the company’s massive audience reads. The news feed, in contrast, is a daily or even hourly addiction for a significant portion of the world’s population. Some 66 percent of U.S. Facebook users say they rely on it for news, which equates to 44 percent of all U.S. adults. Accordingly, the news feed has become a critical distribution channel for major news outlets—and, as a result, a reluctant arbiter of what’s most relevant in the news.

Media companies, generally speaking, accept responsibility for the content they publish, including its newsworthiness. But, as I’ve explained, Facebook is loath to do that, because exercising editorial judgment is both controversial and labor-intensive. That’s one big reason why traditional media companies are both relatively poor and widely mistrusted while Facebook is wildly rich and relatively well-liked.

In place of human editors, the company has fallen back on one-size-fits-all policies, such as its prohibition against nudity, which can be enforced via a combination of proprietary software and poorly paid contractors working in warehouses in Manila. That approach has helped to fuel the company’s rapid growth and enormous profits. But as the social network’s dominance of media grows, its drawbacks are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

When Mark Zuckerberg says that Facebook isn’t a media company, it’s not so much a descriptive claim as a wishful one. Facebook doesn’t want to be a media company, for the reasons outlined above. That’s understandable: Editorial judgment is perilous territory, and as much as we cry out when Facebook clumsily enforces a blunt policy, the cries would only grow louder if the company were to take a more activist approach to the types of content it permits and promotes.

Yet the company’s persistent claims to neutrality, which were philosophically empty from the outset, are further undermined each time it changes its policies in response to public pressure, or makes an exception for “an iconic image of historic importance,” or offers a rationale such as, “the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal.”

That is so naked a value judgment that Facebook’s PR team couldn’t even find a word other than “value” in which to cloak it. In essence, with its second statement on Friday reversing the ban on the “Terror of War” photo, Facebook just admitted to all of the following:

It does make value judgments about the content people are allowed to post in the news feed.

It is willing to make such judgments on a case-by-case basis.

In doing so, it is prepared to consider claims of newsworthiness and historical importance, while considering such factors as source, cultural context, and feedback from its readers.Paramount

Years ago, reporters assigned to the “financial catastrophes caused by 4-year-olds” beat were mostly chasing broken gumball machines and stolen allowances. The demographic gained a much greater ability to wreak fiscal havoc with the development of in-app purchases, but, as the Wall Street Journal reports, one budding young film mogul has set a record that will likely stand for a long time. On Wednesday, Paramount Pictures’ parent company Viacom revised its earnings-per-share expectations to account for “a programming impairment charge of $115 million in its filmed entertainment segment in its fiscal fourth quarter related to the expected performance of an unreleased film.” This is Wall Street speak for “We don’t even remember making this Monster Trucks movie. It just sort of had its own momentum after a while, you know? It felt like it was happening in some other department of the studio. No one wanted to be the first person to say what a bad idea it was, and looking at how much money we were spending gave us a sick feeling in the pit of our stomachs so eventually we just stopped looking. And now we’ve got this thing, this film, quote-unquote, and oh my God, have you seen the trailer? We’re all going to get fired. We all deserve to be fired. But we’ll probably fire the marketing department instead.”

The idea for the film—what if monster trucks had real, live monsters in them? Burping monsters?—was developed by one-time studio president Adam Goodman with the help of his then-4-year-old son, who is now the undisputed world champion of economic collapse, preschool division. The studio was seeking properties that could sell toys and become franchises, and it seems that the inexplicable success of Paramount’s Transformers films, combined with development work from a gifted 4-year-old, sent the company off the rails. When the trailer came out this summer—after picking our jaws off the floor—we tracked the HR carnage the project has already left in its wake: Goodman has left Paramount, as has Bob Bacon, the one-time head of Paramount Animation, the division behind Monster Trucks. As of this week, Paramount’s interim CEO and president Tom Dooley is stepping down, as is vice chairman Rob Moore, though mostly for non–Monster Trucks–related reasons. Who knows how many careers will be crushed before this is finished, like so many old cars carelessly parked in the center of Knoxville’s Thompson-Boling Arena on Jan. 14, the night of the Monster Jam?

And still hardly anyone has seen the movie. It was originally scheduled to come out in the summer of 2015 and is now on its fourth release date: a confidence-inspiring Friday the 13th in January. Paramount’s write-down doesn’t necessarily mean that Monster Trucks won’t be a monster hit; it just means it’s so sure it’s going to bomb that they felt legally required to tell their shareholders in advance. Maybe they’re wrong! And maybe next time the junker will defeat Robosaurus.After endless attacks from the alt-left propaganda media, President Trump is fighting back in a big way, by calling out the press directly and setting the record straight.

In a marathon press conference, Trump turned the tables on the press and made his case that the media’s agenda-driven campaign to destroy him is dishonest. The event was supposed to be an announcement of his new pick for secretary of the Department of Labor, Alexander Acosta. But Trump had more than that on his mind. And by speaking on live television, Trump went over the media’s heads and straight to you.

“I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present,” Trump said, “because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.

It got even uglier for the abusively biased alt-left propaganda media assembled in the East Room of the White House. President Trump, clearly angry at the media’s use of illegal leaks to make vague accusation his team colluded with Russia, administered a well-deserved pummeling.

“I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I've never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media,” Trump said. “I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.”

President Trump also talked about the disaster he inherited from President Obama and the progress he has already made to address the nation’s problems – issues the press willfully ignores.

“I inherited a mess,” Trump said. “It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea -- we'll take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.

“We've begun preparing to repeal and replace ObamaCare. ObamaCare is a disaster, folks,” he said. “It's a disaster.”

And he touted his progress in less than one month on the job.

“Jobs have already started to surge,” he said. “Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.

“And one more thing,” he added. “I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch.”

President Trump defended Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who resigned from the post of national security adviser, and vowed to plug the illegal leaks coming from Obama holdovers entrenched in the government bureaucracy.

“How does the press get this information that's classified?” he said. “How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process. And the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.”

It was a historic beat down of the alt-left propaganda media, and they had it coming. It's refreshing to see a commander-in-chief who will fight back against all the dishonesty and smears to set the record straight with the American people.

That disturbance was the Washington Supreme Court’s oppressive ruling in State of Washington v. Arlene’s Flowers, a case holding that a florist was bound by state law to use her artistic talents to design floral arrangements to celebrate what she viewed as an immoral event: a gay wedding.

The pretext for overriding the florist’s rights to free speech and religious liberty was Washington’s so-called “public accommodations law,” which required the owner, Barronelle Stutzman, to provide goods and services to customers “regardless” of their sexual orientation.

Let’s be clear, according to the plain language of the law and the undisputed facts of the case, Stutzman did nothing illegal. She had always consistently and joyfully served gay clients, including the man who ultimately decided to bring potentially ruinous legal claims against her. On each of those prior occasions, however, she was not using her artistic talents to help her clients celebrate an occasion she considered immoral.

In other words, she was not discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. She was making a decision not to help celebrate an action, a form of expression. She would no more celebrate a gay wedding than she would any form of immorality, gay or straight. To dispense with her argument, the court did what numerous progressive courts have done: It rewrote the law. It rejected what it called the “status/conduct” distinction, and essentially interpreted the word “orientation” to also mean “action.”

To understand how nonsensical and dangerous this is, one need merely apply it to other categories of expression. Is it now racial discrimination to refuse to bake a cake with Confederate flag icing, since the person asking for such a cake will almost always be white? Is it gender discrimination for fashion designers to refuse to “dress” Ivanka or Melania Trump? They’re women, after all.

But this is the sexual revolution we’re talking about, so it’s necessary for the court to make a statement declaring the government’s allegiances. Indeed, late in the opinion its author gave the game away. Picking up on the absurd and historically ignorant comparison of the modern gay-rights movement with the civil-rights movement in the segregationist South, the judge wrote, “This case is no more about access to flowers than civil rights cases in the 1960s were about access to sandwiches.”

This is the sexual revolution we’re talking about, so it’s necessary for the court to make a statement declaring the government’s allegiances.

What are they talking about? The federal government took the extraordinary step of passing the civil-rights acts to give black Americans access not just to sandwiches but to hotel rooms, jobs, voting rights, and all the other things they were systematically denied as southern states and communities continually and oppressively imposed the “badges and incidents of slavery” on them. In the pre-civil-rights South, black citizens often had trouble finding places to eat or sleep. They couldn’t vote. They couldn’t get justice in state courts. Civil rights was about access, at its most elementary and necessary level.

But that’s not the case any longer. The gay couple in this case had no trouble finding flowers. Stutzman even recommended other florists who would have been happy to help them celebrate their wedding. So, given the absence of any real harm, the court said that the state had a compelling state interest in punishing the “independent social evil” of discrimination toward a “broader societal purpose: eradicating barriers to equal treatment of all citizens in the commercial marketplace.”

That’s it right there: the state religion. It reserves for itself the exclusive ability to name, define, and eradicate “social evils,” and heaven help the individual citizen who disagrees. There is no need to show a traditional, legally recognized harm. There is no need to prove lack of access to alternative artistic expressions. There is only the need to show that the business owner won’t use her unique talents to help celebrate the sexual revolution.

Finally, if you doubt the court’s malice, look only to its last ruling — that Stutzman can be held personally liable for her allegedly discriminatory act. In other words, the court is willing to pierce the corporate veil to impose individual liability even in the absence of the traditional justifications for that drastic step. Stutzman didn’t commit fraud. She didn’t commingle her personal and corporate funds. She kept her private and professional affairs separate. But she still faces personal financial ruin.

Social-justice warriors will no doubt celebrate the breaking of another egg for their cultural omelet. Meanwhile, Stutzman’s lawyers — my friends and former colleagues at the Alliance Defending Freedom — are appealing her case to the Supreme Court. Once again, eyes will be fixed on Justice Kennedy. Will he continue to impose his own version of the state religion, the one he so enthusiastically articulated in Obergefell? Or will he remember that words have meaning, orientation doesn’t mean action, and the state can’t compel citizens to condone what they consider immoral.

It’s time for the Supreme Court to take a deep breath, abandon its revolutionary crusade, and remember the great wisdom of its predecessors:

If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.

What say you, Justice Kennedy? Do those who oppose the sexual revolution forfeit that fundamental protection? I suppose we’ll soon find out.

Back in the 1930s, you could walk into a press box and find not just a social justice warrior but an actual communist. His name was Lester Rodney, and he wrote sports for the party newspaper, The Daily Worker. Rodney’s politics made his life complicated. Writers at “respectable” outlets like The New York Times would hardly speak to him. But his moral clarity was keener than just about anybody’s.

“I can do a lot of things you guys can’t,” Rodney told colleagues, according to his biographer Irwin Silber. “I can belt big advertisers, automobile manufacturers, or tobacco companies. … You guys can’t write anything about the ban against Negro players. I can do that.”

Indeed, the segregation of baseball — “The Crime of the Big Leagues!” the Worker called it — was Rodney’s great subject. He was determined to exact justice on the sports page. Rodney pestered owners and managers about their willingness to sign black players and recorded their responses. The pitcher Satchel Paige used Rodney’s column to challenge the winners of the World Series to a game against a Negro Leagues all-star team.

When baseball’s commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, ignored Rodney’s reporting, Worker headlines taunted him: “Can You Read, Judge Landis?” When Landis refused to give a statement about the progress of integration, they taunted him again: “Can You Talk, Judge Landis?” By the time Jackie Robinson integrated baseball in 1947, black ballplayers knew Rodney’s was one of the first and loudest voices to rally to their cause. But thanks to Rodney’s radioactive politics, he was largely written out of history until his rediscovery a half century later.

Occasionally, Rodney was so committed to being an ideological sportswriter that he tied himself in knots. After a game in the early ’50s, a fan at the Polo Grounds got close to Giants manager Leo Durocher, stole his baseball cap, and made off with the prize. If you’re sticking up for the oppressed masses on deadline, what do you do with that? According to Roger Kahn, Rodney wrote a column arguing ballplayers were workers and should be granted the use of their tools.

Later, police apprehended the thief. He turned out to be a poor Puerto Rican. At the request of his boss, Rodney then wrote the opposite column, arguing the thief was a victim of capitalism and, thus, had as much right to the cap as Durocher. Such were the headaches of being a lefty in the press box.

In 2017, it’d be hard to find a communist covering the Grapefruit League. But it’s easy to find a sportswriter who is infused with Rodney’s passion, his crusading spirit. Today, sportswriting is basically a liberal profession, practiced by liberals who enforce an unapologetically liberal code. As Frank Deford, who joined Sports Illustrated in the ’60s, told me, “You compare that era to this era, no question we are much more liberal than we ever were before.”

In the age of liberal sportswriting, the writers are now far more liberal than the readers. “Absolutely I think we’re to the left of most sports fans,” said Craig Calcaterra, who writes for HardballTalk. “It’s folly for any of us to think we’re speaking for the common fan.”

Of course, labels like “liberal” and “conservative” don’t translate perfectly to sports. Do you have to be liberal to call Roger Goodell a tool? So maybe it’s better to put it like this: There was a time when filling your column with liberal ideas on race, class, gender, and labor policy got you dubbed a “sociologist.” These days, such views are more likely to get you a job.

Donald Trump’s election was merely an accelerant for a change that was already sweeping across sportswriting. On issues that divided the big columnists for years, there’s now something like a consensus. NCAA amateurism is rotten. The Washington Redskins nickname is more rotten. LGBT athletes ought to be welcomed rather than shunned. Head injuries are the great scandal of the NFL.

A few decades ago, Taylor Branch’s line that NCAA amateurism had “an unmistakable whiff of the plantation” would have been an eye-rollingly hot take. Now, if you turned in a column comparing college football to the institution of slavery, I suspect few editors would try to talk you out of publishing it. But they might ask you to come up with something more original.

As recently as the turn of the century, you could find columnists hanging Alex Rodriguez’s $252 million contract around his neck. Nobody much writes about free agency like that anymore. Even a bad contract is usually called a misallocation of resources by a team rather than a manifestation of a ballplayer’s overweening greed.

In the new world of liberal sportswriting, athletes who dabble in political activism are covered admiringly. Last year, Slate’s Josh Levin went searching for the voices who were dinging Colin Kaepernick for his national anthem protest. Levin found conservatives like Tomi Lahren and a couple of personalities from FS1. In the old days, such voices would have filled up half the sports columns, easy.

Institutions that made for easy off-day fodder for the writers now get increasing scrutiny. The writer Joe Sheehan has called the Major League Baseball draft “a quasi-criminal enterprise that serves the powerful at the expense of the powerless.” Lester Rodney would have been proud of that line.

And these are just issues within sports. Look at the way sportswriters tweet about politics now. “God bless the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost,” Peter King tweeted earlier this week after the papers revealed the Trump administration’s web of ties to Russia. Two weeks ago, sportswriters blasted away at Trump’s immigration ban — staging their own pussy-hat protest within the press box. Last year, Roger Angell came out of the bullpen to endorse Hillary Clinton.

“How many sportswriters have you seen on Twitter defending Donald Trump?” asked the baseball writer Rob Neyer. “I haven’t seen one. I’m sure there must have been a few writers out there who did vote for him, but there’s a lot of pressure not to be public about it.”

Forget the viability of being a Trump-friendly sportswriter today. Could someone even be a Paul Ryan–friendly sportswriter — knocking out their power rankings while tweeting that Obamacare is a failure and the Iran deal was a giveaway of American sovereignty?

In sportswriting, there was once a social and professional price to pay for being a noisy liberal. Now, there’s at least a social price to pay for being a conservative. Figuring out how the job changed — how we all became the children of Lester Rodney — is one of the most fascinating questions of our age.

There was always a coven of liberals in sportswriting: Shirley Povich, Dan Parker, Sam Lacy, George Kiseda, Robert Lipsyte, Wells Twombly, and the merry band known as the Chipmunks. As Roger Kahn once wrote, “Sports tell anyone who watches intelligently about the times in which we live: about managed news and corporate politics, about race and terror and what the process of aging does to strong men.”

But these idealists plied their trade in a media universe almost completely different from our own. The first reason sportswriting became a liberal profession is that the product known as “sportswriting” has been radically altered from what it was 40, 30, even 20 years ago.

The old liberal sportswriter was a prisoner of daily newspapers. If he wanted to write about politics, he had to do it within the confines of a sports story. “You decide whether you think this is a lefty idea or not,” said Larry Merchant, who was a columnist at the old (liberal) New York Post. “I wrote a story about a horse that had ridden in the Kentucky Derby. Now, it was in service of the national police in riot control in Washington, D.C. To me, that’s the most natural story in the world!”

Even if a newspaper had a “political” sports columnist, he was nearly always paired with a second, apolitical columnist, who matched the former’s moral crusades with his own rigid attention to balls and strikes.

“When you treat sports as a self-contained universe into which the rest of the universe does not intrude, it will inevitably be conservative,” said Craig Calcaterra. You defer to the commissioner, to the head coach, to the reserve clause — to the reigning authority.

The internet leveled the barrier between sportswriting and the rest of the universe. It also dropped the neutrality that was practiced by everyone but a handful of columnists. “We might have been more liberal than you would have imagined we were, but we didn’t bring it in our copy, you know?” said Deford. “We separated our individual lives from what we wrote because that was what was expected.”

This loosening of the prose was hastened along by a technological change. Starting in the 1950s, accounts of games (“gamers”) became less valuable when fans could watch for themselves on TV. As the game inventory on cable and then DirecTV and then the internet has exploded, gamers are less valuable than ever. Newbie sportswriters have been redeployed. “The people who in an earlier generation would be telling us what they saw are telling us what they think instead,” said Josh Levin.

The internet transformed sportswriting in another way: It made a local concern into a national one. On one level, this is pure joy: Now everyone gets to read Andy McCullough. But it also meant that reactionary opinions that may have played in St. Louis or Cincinnati are now held up for ridicule by the writers at Deadspin. I suspect a lot of sportswriters who might be right-leaning either get on the train or don’t write about politics at all.

You might argue, as Neyer does, that the old sportswriters were probably mostly left-of-center types. But without Twitter, it was difficult for anyone to know this. “When I started doing this, in 2003, it felt a little lonely, like I was in a phone booth yelling this stuff,” said The Nation’s Dave Zirin. “I didn’t know, or have access to, a community of sportswriters who felt similarly.”

The changes in the architecture of sportswriting also changed the profession’s great dilemma. For a century, even sportswriters who had curious minds felt the narcotic pull of the toy department. (It took the carnage of the ’68 Democratic National Convention to shock Red Smith into consciousness.) Then — once woke — the sportswriter faced a second problem: What do I do? Try to sneak politics into my column? Abandon the good salary and Marriott points offered by sportswriting to do “real work” on the front page?

In the Twitter era, I suspect most sportswriters don’t feel this dilemma very keenly or even at all. As the world burns, they turn in their power rankings and then they tweet about Trump.

There were other tractor beams that pulled sportswriting to the left. After a slack period since Muhammad Ali and Jim Brown shuffled off the main stage, we’ve finally entered the second great age of athlete activism. “You’re talking about 50 years of pretty much quiet,” said Sandy Padwe, who wrote a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer and later became an editor at Sports Illustrated. The new wave of activism “is not like the ’60s by any means,” Padwe said. “But it’s a hell of an improvement.”

Activism smuggles liberalism into sportswriting — not as opinion but as news. Whatever his politics, the sportswriter must report Gregg Popovich’s lecture on white privilege; Steph Curry calling Trump an “ass”; and a handful of the Super Bowl–winning Patriots refusing to go to Trump’s White House.

It’s not only athlete activism that has rejiggered sportswriting but the athletes’ increased power. In the ’60s, a sportswriter who merely wanted to be a stenographer to the powerful would cozy up to the league commissioner or owner. Now — after the explosion in player salaries and the voice granted by Twitter — the same power seeker is more likely to cozy up to LeBron James, or his agent. As Lester Rodney would tell you, when you’re covering sports from the workers’ point of view instead of management’s, the trade inevitably moves to the left.

Non-sports types like Taylor Branch have given the industry a much-needed noogie. Branch’s 2011 article in The Atlantic transformed the crusade against NCAA amateurism from one often neglected in the sports press into one that burned up the New York Times op-ed page. “It makes sense that a hometown sports page is not going to get into this,” Branch said. “Their job is to feed the appetite of the sports fan. This is a fly on their dessert.”

Deford told me: “I kill myself when I think that when I ran The National neither I nor the bright people on that paper thought we really ought to examine the NCAA. We never said that. We just accepted that. We took it at face value. We should be ashamed of it.”

If liberals have a long-standing delusion, it’s that the presentation of hard data (about everything from climate change to “voter fraud”) will win the masses to their cause. But within sportswriting, this is actually true. The publication of college football coaches’ rapidly inflating salaries floated the anti-amateurism crusade. If you know that the NBA signed a $24 billion TV deal with ESPN and Turner, it’s hard to argue that even Timofey Mozgov’s contract is going to bankrupt the league.

“It’s the accumulation of evidence rather than political change,” said Bruce Arthur, who writes a column for the Toronto Star. “People just figured it out.”

There are chance events too. The fact that Dan Snyder hasn’t put many winning Redskins teams on the field has the side effect of undermining support for the team’s nickname — “If Snyder’s for it,” people think, “how can I not be against it?” Similarly, Roger Goodell’s mishandling of issues like Deflategate suggests that he might be mishandling player safety too.

Donald Trump’s election changed sports Twitter into a frisky episode of All In With Chris Hayes. But here, sportswriters are probably being radicalized at roughly the same rate as the rest of the electorate — a process that began during George W. Bush’s administration and continued apace through the Obama years. If most Democrats you know seem feistier than they did 20 years ago, it follows that sportswriters would too.

Talk to the real lefties within sportswriting — Lipsyte, Padwe — and you find they’re skeptical that we’re witnessing a genuine ideological conversion. Sportswriters rarely touch issues like the antitrust exemption and the flag-waving militarism that drenches pro sports. (See Fox’s Super Bowl pregame show for one recent example.) There’s still plenty of PED hysteria, even if it’s getting better. The idea that league drafts unfairly conscript players to teams feels like an issue that’s just starting to get mainstream traction. In 10 years, woke sportswriters will be wondering why our generation didn’t talk more about it.

Maybe what we’re seeing is simply writers plying their trade in a different era. “We shouldn’t piss on things that are progress and are good,” Lipsyte said. “But how much of it is really any kind of expression of liberalism? How much is times change and we change with it? Maybe we’re just standing in the same place but being carried along by the flow.”

The Obama administration was a dream time for liberal sportswriters, who had a president who talked about sports like they did. Trump’s election caused a convulsion. Lipsyte added, “Kaepernick, the manifestos of Melo and LeBron, and the Trumpish tinge to the Patriots and its reaction from players who say they won’t go to the White House have to be acknowledged, and once you do that, it feels like left-leaning commentary. Unless, of course, it is.”

On November 8, we learned a lot of Americans aren’t ready to sail into the progressive horizon. In sportswriting, as in politics, there was a backlash that you could see across the media.

First, conservative political writers began grumbling about their sports pages the way they grumble about the front pages. A 2014 American Spectator column sniffed: “[The sportswriter] now lies prostrate before a new set of masters: Mimosa-sipping Manhattanites and liberal witch hunters whose sole interest in sports is purging football teams of offensive names, obtaining equal screen-time for females, and celebrating sexual diversity.” Equal time and diversity — what a crock.

Next, other sportswriters took up the critique. “The sports media is the most far-left contingent of media that exists in this country,” Fox Sports’ Clay Travis declared last month. In tsk-tsking the writers — and the athletes they worship — the holdouts sounded like the founders of Fox News. Your media’s been hijacked!

Those who are sitting out the liberal sportswriting renaissance are as likely to tweak the media as they are to offer competing ideas. This week, when Nike released an “Equality” ad starring LeBron James and Serena Williams, Jason Whitlock said: “all this ‘resist, resist’ … it’s bogus. It’s a campaign. … It ain’t got a damn thing to do with you, the ordinary working man.”

Earlier this year, when Ronda Rousey was throttled by Amanda Nunes, Travis said: “There were a ton of people in the sports media who wanted Ronda Rousey to be good because it somehow represented their belief that women are better than men.” Breitbart approvingly cited the remark.

In a world where liberal sportswriters predominate, there’s a second economic opportunity. You create a “safe space” where sports and politics don’t intermingle, where readers aren’t just excused for not being woke but are rewarded for it. On one of the recent Barstool Rundown TV specials, Dave Portnoy said the immigration protests that were filling airports were “probably the no. 1 story for people [who are] not us … real-world issues that we don’t care at all about.”

Then Portnoy cut to footage of a reader — a Stoolie — who’d arrived on a flight from Istanbul while the protests were raging. The Stoolie pretended to be a refugee who’d made it through customs and marched through the terminal, soaking up the applause of the crowd. If there was ever a more backhanded indictment of sports Twitter, I’d love to see it.

What about me? If it hasn’t seeped into the preceding paragraphs, I’m a liberal sportswriter myself. The new world suits me just fine. Would it be nice to have a David Frum or Ross Douthat of sportswriting, making wrongheaded-but-interesting arguments about NCAA amateurism? Sure. As long as nobody believed them.

If anything has gone haywire in this new world, it’s the problem of Leo Durocher’s cap. Writers trying to find the proper, liberal response to new issues wind up tying themselves in knots.

Take the reaction to the Ray Rice video in 2014. There was a hue and cry throughout sportswriting: Something ought to be done! (If there was any criticism, it came from the left: that replays of the elevator video were “re-victimizing” his then-fiancée, Janay.)

Unfortunately, many of the early columns didn’t always say who ought to do something or what it should be. Roger Goodell used the groundswell of rage to suspend Rice indefinitely and increase his already-fearsome power over player discipline.

Such imprecision doesn’t just empower hardliners like Goodell. A few months after Rice’s suspension, Adam Silver, the model of a progressive commissioner, used a gray area in his league’s CBA to levy a harsh punishment against a convicted domestic abuser, Jeffery Taylor. Silver attributed his actions to what he called the “evolving social consensus” — much of which was crafted in the media.

And there’s another liberal ideal at stake here: that criminals who’ve paid their debt to society ought to have a chance to re-enter it. In 2010, Barack Obama congratulated the owner of the Eagles for giving Michael Vick a job after he was released from prison. Rice’s bad acts were very different from Vick’s. But say Rice got another NFL job after his apology tour. Would a sportswriter have written an encomium to the owner who signed Rice? Should they have? It’s an awfully tough question.

I bet old Lester Rodney would have smiled when told the headaches he faced at The Daily Worker are now racking sportswriters from the L.A. Times to SB Nation. For this is what happens when revolutionary ideas become a ruling philosophy — when the former insurgents get the run of the place.Andrew Harrer - Pool/Getty Images

Scientists are terrified of Donald Trump. The president and his staff, who at times seem ignorant of basic scientific facts, have already made a series of attempts to undermine scientific work. Researchers at several agencies have been censored, silenced, and otherwise intimidated; public documents on climate change have been targeted for deletion; fringe ideas in public health and the environment have been getting traction. The last few news cycles in Washington have so thoroughly antagonized the nation’s scientific establishment that it now makes sense to ask whether Trump will be the first anti-science president in U.S. history, or the most anti-science president that we’ve ever had, or maybe just the shameless perpetrator of a perverse war on truth.

Daniel Engber Daniel Engber is a columnist for Slate.



Lost in all this consternation, though, is the fact that almost every single move that Trump has made against the scientific enterprise has quickly been retracted. His administration may be prone to grand, aggressive gestures of control, but it always seems to follow them with a grand volte-face.

This pattern of taking wild swings at science, and then shrinking back, started early on. Near the beginning of December, Trump’s transition team sent a lengthy questionnaire to the Department of Energy asking for the names of any staffers who had worked on various issues related to climate change. When news of this apparent witch hunt leaked, the Trump team changed direction. “The questionnaire was not authorized or part of our standard protocol,” an official said on Dec. 14. “The person who sent it has been properly counseled.”

Then on Jan. 10, the president-elect met with noted vaccination skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at Trump Tower. Trump has suggested in the past that vaccines might be dangerous to children: “I want smaller doses over a longer period of time,” he said at one Republican debate. “I think you’re going to see a big impact on autism.” Following the January meeting, Kennedy told the press that he’d accepted an invitation to chair a commission on vaccine safety. But hours later, in the face of widespread outrage, the Trump team walked the story back: The boss had only been “exploring the possibility,” said Trump aide Hope Hicks, and “no decisions have been made at this time.”

Trump’s lunge-and-feint routine only grew more blatant after he took office. On Jan. 23, the Monday after his inauguration, the new administration prepared a disturbing multi-front assault on the integrity of federal research. This was followed by a swift multi-front retreat.

First, the Trump administration told the Environmental Protection Agency that it would freeze all the agency’s grants and contracts until it could review them. Three days later, following an outcry from activists and members of Congress, the White House abruptly thawed the same grants and contracts. “We finished our review process,” explained EPA spokesman Doug Ericksen. “There was simply a pause and everything’s up and running.”*

On Tuesday, Jan. 24, the White House informed staffers at the EPA to pull any pages from its website that had to do with climate change. Again, the scientific community responded with outrage and alarm. By Wednesday, Jan. 25, Ericksen suggested the administration had a different plan in mind. “We’re looking at scrubbing it up a bit,” he clarified, “putting a little freshener on it, and getting it back up to the public.”

Even as Ericksen backed away from the plan to censor the EPA’s website, he created another imbroglio when he announced that the White House would review all of the agency’s data and publications on a case-by-case basis. “Everything is subject to review,” he told reporters on Wednesday. A few hours later he reversed direction yet again, calling accounts of his earlier statement “inaccurate” and affirming that scientific data would not, in fact, be subject to political review.

The backtracking has continued. Most recently, on Monday, Jan. 30, it came out in the press that Trump had appointed a leading climate-change denier named Kenneth Haapala to the team handling appointments to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which happens to be an important source of data on changes to the climate. The next day, as criticism mounted, the administration took its favored course—directly backward: According to an anonymous White House source, Haapala was kicked off the team.

For scientists, there are still plenty of reasons to be frightened. Congress just approved the nomination of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education despite the fact that her family charities have been linked to those who support teaching an alternative to evolution. Meanwhile, Trump has nominated climate-change skeptics to lead both the Department of Agriculture (“liberals have lost all credibility when it comes to climate science”) and the EPA (“scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind”). And then there are Trump’s public statements from before he became president. Those include a bizarre and unfounded attack in 2015 on the credibility of the National Institutes of Health. “I hear so much about the NIH,” he told Michael Savage, “and it’s terrible.”

An onslaught of clumsy strikes might serve as cover for careful moves against the status quo.

When it comes to anti-science policies, though, as opposed to anti-science nominees, Trump has so far reneged on every count. What should we make of these reversals?

It’s possible that Trump has been governing by trial balloon. That’s how he carried out his presidential campaign: He’d float some outlandish notion—e.g., that South Korea and Japan ought to have nuclear weapons or that women should be punished for illegal abortions—and then abandon it if necessary. Perhaps his staff has adopted this approach. They’ll propose something extreme (a case-by-case review of all scientific publications, for instance) and then back down if it doesn’t fly.

This constant pushing at the boundaries of acceptability could have its own strategic value. An onslaught of clumsy and abortive strikes against the science establishment might serve as cover for more careful and strategic moves against the status quo. EPA nominee Scott Pruitt, for example, seems poised to pare back environmental regulations in subtle, lasting ways. According to the New York Times, his associates suggest he’ll avoid Trump’s favored “shock and awe” routine, and threats to eviscerate the agency, in favor of selective cuts and carefully rewritten regulations.

If Pruitt can find a way to gut Obama’s climate action plan, or his rules on water pollution, that would surely be more consequential than a policy on how scientists express their views on Twitter. But it isn’t clear to me that moves like the ones Pruitt is reportedly considering should always count as being “anti-science.” There’s a difference between the Trump administration’s refutation of the fundamental values of the scientific community—e.g. shutting down entire avenues of inquiry or bending facts to fit a pre-existing view—and conservatives pushing a small-government philosophy that many natural scientists (who tend to be left-wing) find abhorrent. It’s legitimately “anti-science” to abandon climate regulations on the basis of distorted evidence. It would be more accurate to describe other regulatory rollbacks as being “anti-government” or “pro-business.”

Take, for example, Trump’s potential picks to run the Food and Drug Administration. As a group, they have endorsed weaker standards for approval of new drugs and medical devices. One possible appointee, Jim O’Neill, would like to allow the sale of new drugs even if they haven’t yet been found to be effective. There are plenty of reasons to oppose this lowering of standards, which could be bad for public health, but is this really “anti-science”? The whole point would be to give more leeway to an industry that’s based on scientific research.

Indeed, the administration’s cruder, stop-and-go gestures could be a way of baiting its opponents into outrage over what appears to be a “war on science.” If researchers react too aggressively to what has so far been a vaporous assault, they may end up weakening their own positions. Instead of standing up for basic scientific values and asking for protection of their roles as unbiased expert sources, science activists would be drawn into more explicitly ideological debates. Trump’s supporters, for their part, are already skeptical of the scholarly elite, and the sight of white-coats marching on the Capitol will only calcify their stance.

It seems unwise to celebrate the fact that Trump’s administration has decided not to implement several of its most outrageous proposals. (Shouldn’t we be lamenting the fact that pro-science policies haven’t been adopted in their place?) Even when the administration calls backsies, these anti-science moves can still cause lasting damage: At the very least, they signal its antipathy toward mainstream expertise and telegraph the threat of more effective meddling to come. Still, the backpedaling that we’ve seen so far suggests some modest grounds for optimism. It seems the White House may be more sensitive to public peer review than one might have guessed.Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Power 105.1

For most hit songs, the catchiest bit, the part that takes up residence in your frontal cortex and won’t let go, is the chorus. But there exists a special species of smash whose stickiest bit is right at the start—some lyrical doggerel that leads off the track and somehow eclipses the refrain. Indeed, it might as well be the refrain—it’s so quotable, so infectious, it defines the song. I would scarcely need to remind you of the source of most of these lyrics, all of which are opening lines to Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits since the ’70s:

Migos are a Lawrenceville, Georgia–bred trio; on a recent episode of Donald Glover’s TV series Atlanta they called themselves “the ’Migos,” and Glover included the “the” when thanking the group during an acceptance speech for his show at last week’s Golden Globes. The three ’Migos are all related: Quavo, born Quavious Marshall; his nephew Takeoff, born Kirshnik Ball; and his cousin Offset, born Kiari Cephus. Produced by Atlanta-based hitmaker Metro Boomin, “Bad and Boujee” lands at No. 1 directly on the heels of Rae Sremmurd’s smash “Black Beatles,” making it the second straight ATL-based hip-hop track to ride the back of a meme to No. 1. Add to these two surprise, meme-driven hits last spring’s chart-topper “Panda” by Brooklyn rapper Desiigner, and we have the makings of a serious pop trend: superviral rap, riding sudden bursts of sociability and streaming to the top of the charts. (Housekeeping note: While this Slate series was on hiatus over the holidays, the “Black Beatles” run at No. 1 was briefly interrupted, during the slow week just after Christmas, by the Weeknd’s “Starboy” featuring Daft Punk. Your humble chart-watcher regrets the missed hit.)

Fortified by a loopy guest verse from Philly rapper Lil Uzi Vert, “Bad and Boujee” is Migos’ biggest pop hit by far. Prior to this, the crew had never gotten further on the Hot 100 than No. 69, with their 2014 single “Fight Night.” (Even on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay list, Migos have mostly landed outside the top 10; “Fight Night” managed No. 6.) The trio honed their mantralike style early, leading off in 2013 with the widely acclaimed single “Versace” (No. 99 pop, No. 15 R&B/HH Airplay), a three-minute track on which Quavo says the titular fashion designer’s name more than 100 times. “Bad and Boujee” dials back Migos’ penchant for repetition a tad, but Metro Boomin’s track is still hypnotic, punctuated by a dark piano toll and a recurring trap synth line. The single dropped in October and kicked around for a few weeks before the holiday season, when the song’s opening line began infecting rap fans across the country—and around the world:

Unlike “Black Beatles”—which spent seven weeks on top of the Hot 100 fueled by the Mannequin Challenge, a meme not actually related to the content of Rae Sremmurd’s song—“Bad and Boujee” has, in effect, become its own meme. In the context of the song, “Raindrops—drop top” is meant to set a scene: a crew parked in a sleek convertible, putting up the roof to keep out the rain and hotbox the car. But on social media over the holidays, it’s become an all-purpose pick-me-up—just hearing that opening piano “DONNGGGG!” and Offset’s “You know …” provides guaranteed mirth in virtually any incongruous context.

Not all of this social-media LOLzing counts for the Hot 100—just the versions of the meme that use the original recording and wind up on YouTube. But Billboard reports plenty of those: “B&B” racked up 19.3 million YouTube streams during the chart’s tracking week, and that was before Donald Glover called it “like … the best song ever” at the Globes. (Any fallout from Glover’s shoutout—including his other pronouncements about the song’s party-starting and amorous qualities—won’t have any chart impact until the next Hot 100.) Unsurprisingly on a hit like this, the streaming-and-memeing public is out way ahead of the music-biz gatekeepers—in the week it topped the big chart, “B&B’s” radio audience was a modest 20 million, and it hasn’t even made Billboard’s Radio Songs chart yet. (Of course, “Black Beatles” and “Panda” also both started almost exclusively as streaming hits before eventually becoming top 10 airplay hits.) “B&B” also isn’t a terribly huge seller—it has yet to top the Digital Songs chart, and even in its triumphant week on the Hot 100, the song’s digital downloads are only 76,000, one of the lowest weekly sales totals for a No. 1 hit in the digital era.

The formula that brought street rap back to the top of the pops is simple: Hip-hop dominates streaming, and streaming now dominates the music business. It’s a handy reminder that often, technological shifts are what change the shape of our art. On the other hand, what all of these recent trap smashes have in common is that they’re striver’s anthems, part of a long tradition in hip-hop. “Panda” was about coveting a fancy ride; “Black Beatles” is about wishing for cross-cultural stardom. As for “Bad and Boujee,” as easy as it is to focus on its opening line, the rest of the song, an ode to dating a higher class of acquisitive yuppie, is about rising to a higher socioeconomic status: “We came from nothin' to somethin’, n---a.” These aspirations to the good life seem to be bearing fruit for Migos: In addition to their chart-topping hit they, like Desiigner, recently signed with G.O.O.D. Music, the label-cum–management company run by Kanye West, a man who places a premium on acquisitive striving.

It’s a handy reminder that often, technological shifts are what change the shape of our art.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

William Binney, a former highly placed NSA official turned whistleblower, contended in an exclusive interview today that the National Security Agency (NSA) is “absolutely” monitoring the phone calls of President Donald Trump.

Binney was an architect of the NSA’s surveillance program. He became a famed whistleblower when he resigned on October 31, 2001 after spending more than 30 years with the agency.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Asked whether he believes the NSA is tapping Trump, Binney replied: “Absolutely. How did they get the phone call between the president and the president of Australia? Or the one that he made with Mexico? Those are not targeted foreigners.”

Binney further contended the NSA may have been behind a data leak that might have revealed that Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, allegedly misled Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump administration officials about the contents of his phone calls with Russia’s ambassador to Washington.

Regarding Flynn’s case, Binney stated of the NSA:

If they weren’t behind it, they certainly had the data. Now the difference here is that FBI and CIA have direct access inside the NSA databases. So, they may be able to go directly in there and see that material there. And NSA doesn’t monitor that. They don’t even monitor their own people going into databases.

So, they don’t monitor what CIA and FBI do. And there’s no oversight or attempted oversight by any of the committees or even the FISA court. So, any way you look at it, ultimately the NSA is responsible because they are doing the collection on everybody inside the United States. Phone calls. Emails. All of that stuff.

He was speaking on the podcast edition of this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM.

During the interview, Binney referred to a 2008 report referencing two NSA whistleblowers who said they worked at the agency’s station in Fort Gordon, Georgia and were asked to not only monitor phone calls of U.S. citizens but transcribe them.

Utilizing data provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Guardian and Washington Post in June 2013 released a series of articles reporting that the NSA was collecting the telephone records of millions of Americans.

Prior to those reports, National Intelligence Director James Clapper claimed on March 12, 2013 during an open session of the Senate Intelligence Committee that the NSA was not “wittingly” collecting data on Americans.

“Not wittingly,” Clapper said when asked whether the NSA was spying on U.S. citizens. “There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.”

During the interview, Binney charged that the NSA was over-funded and out of control.

He offered recommendations for how he says Trump can reign in the agency:

He can order that they put a filter on the front end of all their collection that eliminates any U.S. citizens anywhere in the world unless they have a warrant for it. If they don’t, then he has to put people in jail if they violated.

So, I mean, that’s the way to do it. The other way is to cut their budget. I mean they are given too much money anyway. When they are given too much money, they get to do wild and crazy things. And this is wild and crazy. Violations of the Constitution’s 4th, 5th, and 6th amendments.

On Wednesday, Trump singled out the NSA and FBI in a series of tweets about Flynn’s case as well as reports in the New York Times and Washington Post claiming further contacts between Trump advisors and Russia.

Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017

The Times on Tuesday seemed to be quoting from intercepted phone calls to report on alleged contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian intelligence agents.

The Times reported:

Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials.

American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said.

The warrants, delivered to the jail late Friday, charge most of the inmates with illegal re-entry.

Immigration agents have obtained federal arrest warrants for more than 40 people recently booked into the Travis County Jail and suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, sidestepping the need to ask Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez to voluntarily house inmates on so-called “detainers,” the American-Statesman and KVUE-TV have learned.

Federal officials on Monday confirmed that they have expedited the timing with which they are reviewing newly arrested inmates and moving forward with possible arrest warrants on immigration charges “so we don’t have to rely on the administrative hold,” said Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office.

The warrants, signed by U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Lane and delivered to the jail late Friday, accuse most of the inmates of “illegal re-entry,” a federal charge that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents frequently pursue when a suspect has been previously deported.

Hernandez said she is holding those inmates until they are released to federal agents — part of a provision of a new policy she unveiled last month that critics say is too lenient on illegal immigration and has resulted in the loss of nearly $2 million in state funding to Travis County.

“We are treating ICE just like any other law enforcement agency,” Hernandez said Monday. “When you submit a warrant, we hold them on the warrant.”

In a written statement, Fields said: “In coordination with ICE, our office is evaluating detainees in the jail for federal prosecution at an earlier stage. In the past, we might review them after state proceedings concluded and after they went into ICE custody. We are now reviewing them before the state has completed their proceedings. The coordination has not changed the nature of our assessment, simply the timing.”

Hernandez, who took office last month, has said she would detain suspects who had been booked into the jail only if they were charged with capital murder, murder, aggravated sexual assault or human smuggling — or if agents obtained an arrest warrant or court order for her to house them.

In response, federal agents filed 42 arrest warrants Friday. By the time the warrants were served, eight inmates had already posted bail and been released, requiring agents to find and arrest the suspects again. However, Hernandez said others will be released to federal agents, who will move them to a detention facility after they post bail or “satisfy their charges.”

“If ICE would just come in with a warrant, we wouldn’t be having this conversation at all,” she said. “We are working with ICE, but we want to do it the right way. That reduces the liability to Travis County because they are being lawfully held.”

In discussing the reason for her new policy, Hernandez has pointed to lawsuits against counties similar to one in Bexar County, where officials are accused of illegally holding an inmate 75 days on an immigration detainer, even though underlying charges against him were dropped.

Hernandez said she was still researching the charges on which the 42 were arrested by local police that landed them in the county jail and the time frame of their bookings.

Immigration agents became aware that those suspects had been booked into jail by mining a federal law enforcement fingerprint database, which is routinely updated by the county jail staff.

The new policy by Hernandez for handling detention requests from federal authorities — announced the day President Donald Trump was sworn in — continues to prompt controversy.

The policy ended blanket cooperation with requests to detain suspected undocumented immigrants at the Travis County Jail.

In response, Gov. Greg Abbott cut off $1.5 million in state grants to Travis County earmarked for rehabilitation and diversion programs that include the veterans court. The future of those programs is unclear, but a state lawmaker announced an initiative last week that aims to make up for canceled grant money through donations.

Since the policy was put in place Wednesday, the county has declined 203 requests from federal authorities to detain inmates. It has led to the release of 40 people suspected of being in the country without legal permission who would have been released to ICE agents under previous policy.

Abbott has called for further penalties to be placed on the county, stating that “Texas will hammer Travis County.” His office is examining what federal money the county receives, and Abbott has said he will work to oust Hernandez from office if she does not change course on immigration.

Abbott made eliminating sanctuary cities an emergency priority for the Legislature, clearing the path for quick passage of Senate Bill 4, which would make compliance with federal detention requests mandatory. Last week, the bill cleared a committee after senators heard hours of testimony from hundreds of people. The vast majority of those who spoke were against the bill.

The bill is set for a floor vote Tuesday in the Senate, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Monday.

Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, said the spate of federal charges is not proof that the federal government is punishing Travis County over its practice of noncompliance with detention requests. Many probably would have been charged over time.

He called the federal charges an “enormous waste.”

“This is the use of the criminal justice system to harshly punish immigrants for returning to the U.S.,” Libal said. “The consequences of this are people languishing in prisons for years.”Mark Wilson/Getty Images

On Thursday, Donald Trump held his first solo press conference as president of the United States, in what was ostensibly an announcement of his replacement nominee for secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta. It turned out to be about so much more. Below is a selection of his verbatim responses to questions.

On National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation: “[W]hen I looked at the information I said I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. I was coming into office. He ‘looked at the information. ‘He said, huh, that's fine. That's what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to—he didn't just call Russia, he called and spoke to both ways—I think there were 30-some-odd countries. Doing the job. You know, he was just doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me.”

On bad press: “I will be honest. I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I have all my life, but I have never seen more dishonest people than frankly the political media. I thought the business media were much more honest. I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story without asking me or how do they write a story in the New York Times, put it on the front page? That was like the story they wrote on the women and me, front page, massive story. And it was nasty. And then they called, they said, ‘I never said that. We like Mr. Trump.’ They called my office. ‘We like Mr. Trump. We never said that.’ It was totally—they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women.”

On his Electoral College margin of victory:

NBC’s Peter Alexander: Mr. President, very simply you said today that you had the biggest electoral margin since Ron Reagan. In fact, president Obama had 365,

President Trump: I was talking about Republicans—

Alexander: George Bush, 426 when he won. So why should Americans trust—

President Trump: I was given that information. I was just given it. We had a very, very big margin.

Alexander: I guess my question is why should the American people trust you when you accuse the information they receive as being fake when you’re providing information that’s not accurate?

President Trump: I was given that information. Actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?

Alexander: You’re the president.

President Trump: Yes.

On bad press again: “I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody. As long as it's true.”

On leaks: “When WikiLeaks, which I have nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they are not giving classified information. They are giving stuff, what was said in an office about Hillary cheating on the debates, which by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine, seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK? He should be put in the electric—you would even call for the institution of the death penalty. Maybe not you, John.”

On bad press again: “And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word tone. The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is—I do get good ratings, you have to admit that—the tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks—I have to say, Fox and Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people.”

On a response to recent Russian actions, including their buzzing of an American destroyer and movement of a spy ship to the coast of Connecticut: “If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say—you would say—‘Oh isn't that wonderful?’ I know you well enough. Then you would say, ‘He was too tough. He shouldn't have done that.’ ”

On relations with Russia in general: “I have been briefed. I and I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say, because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.”

Again on a response to Russian actions: “I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. ... Because I don't talk about military and I don't talk about certain other things. ... So I don't have to tell you. I don't want to be one of these guys that say [imitative voice] ‘Yes, here's what we're going to do.’ I don't have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So, when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship, the Russian ship, as an example? I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully I won't have to do anything. But I'm not going to tell you.”

On how the government will respond to a surge in anti-Semitic hate incidents post-election: “Folks, number one, I am the least anti-semitic person that you have ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism. The least racist person. We did relatively well in fact, relative to other people running as a Republican—quiet, quiet, quiet—see he lied about he was going to get up and ask a very straight simple question. So, you know. Welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something. I hate the charge. I find it repulsive, I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday, did you hear him Bibi, he said I've known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said forget it, so you should take that instead of having to get up and asking a very insulting question like that.”

This is the second of two posts. Read the first one here.

As they try to understand what happened in November 2016 in the industrial heartland, Democratic strategists are focusing on the “rural and small-town demographic.”

In my earlier post I suggested that voters in rural areas and small industrial towns are often two rather distinct demographic groups that should not be conflated. Yes, Democratic candidates lost votes in both postindustrial towns and their surrounding rural environs. But their losses were especially dramatic in the latter, while they still have pockets of support in the former. In larger towns with an industrial history or a university (or both), Democrats still win majorities.

If Democrats try to reacquaint themselves with rural America as part of a strategy for winning back the pivotal postindustrial states, they must also come to grips with another important difference between town and countryside: turnout.

[Democrats’ policies are more popular. But Republicans are more ideologically unified.]

In postindustrial town centers, where Democrats still win majorities, comparatively few people turn out to vote. By contrast, in the surrounding rural areas — where Republicans have gone from a slim to an overwhelming majority — a much higher percentage of the population votes.

In the graphs below, I plot turnout among registered voters in 2016 against the log of population density for several counties in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania; the size of the dot shows the precinct’s comparative size. The blue curve plots the 2016 turnout; the red curve shows the 2012 turnout for comparison.

In each case, a far higher percentage of registered voters actually turned out in surrounding suburbs and rural areas than in the town centers. In many cases the difference is quite striking.

In the overwhelmingly Democratic downtown precincts of Terre Haute and Muncie, Ind., turnout was only around 30 percent of registered voters; in the rural Republican precincts a few miles away, more than 60 percent voted. In Pennsylvania, where the presidential campaigns focused more energy, turnout in the downtown Democratic precincts was around 50 percent, but around 75 percent in the most rural precincts.

[How different are the Democratic and Republican parties? Too different to compare.]

By comparing the red lines and the blue lines, we can see that the pattern was quite similar in 2012, although the gap may have increased a bit in a handful of counties.

These graphs help explain Trump’s narrow victory in the electoral college. His campaign focused on rural whites who typically demonstrate relatively high levels of turnout in the crucial states. Conceivably, some habitual Democratic voters stayed home in these precincts while a set of new voters turned out for Trump. To show this would require individual-level data from voter files that are only now becoming available.

However, the lesson from these graphs, combined with those in my previous article, is that the Trump campaign successfully appealed to high-turnout rural areas that had been either evenly divided or delivered slim Republican majorities in the recent past.

The consistent high turnout of rural whites in postindustrial counties is not well understood. When examining exit polls or even post-election voter files, analysts tend to lump residents of low-turnout Muncie or Williamsport together with their high-turnout rural surroundings into a single, “rural white” category.

Worse, analysts might be tempted to draw inferences from aggregate county-level data, especially since they can be downloaded, merged with census data, and mapped in a matter of minutes. For instance, it is easy to download the Pennsylvania 2016 county-level presidential results, merge them with data on citizen voting-age population from the census, and then produce a graph like this one:

A look at this graph suggests a happy story for Democrats: Turnout is higher in relatively urban counties with higher overall population density (and higher overall support for Democrats). The graph looks similar if produced using data from Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012, and it looks similar in many other postindustrial states.

However, it is quite misleading. Returning to the fine-grained precinct-level graphs above, you can see that the relationship within Pennsylvania counties is exactly the opposite: People in low-density Republican areas are showing up to vote while those in the high-density towns are staying home.

To be technical for a moment, this is a classic case of what statisticians refer to as the “modifiable aerial unit problem”: a statistical bias that can arise when data on spatial phenomena such as population density are aggregated to geographic units such as counties.

Within Pennsylvania counties, turnout is substantially lower in relatively dense clusters populated with renters and young people than in the surrounding areas populated with older homeowners.

It will take some time to collect and geo-code precinct-level data from a full set of counties in the 2016 election, but the pattern was already very clear in the precinct-level data from earlier elections, including the 2008 presidential election. This is true not only in Pennsylvania, but in a large cross-section of states. This includes yesterday’s battleground states, like Indiana and Missouri, as well as in the urbanizing battleground states of the future, including Georgia, Texas and Arizona.

As Democrats consider whether to completely give up on rural areas where they once brought in votes, they must keep in mind that rural voters might be able to make up for their dwindling raw numbers by voting at higher rates than growing urban populations.

Polarization between urban and rural areas is bad for the Democrats in several ways. Not only does it leave them underrepresented in the House and Senate, but it also magnifies a problem with turnout that faces left parties everywhere. Despite its gains among educated suburbanites, the Democratic Party still relies on a base of younger, lower-income renters who frequently change addresses. The Republican Party relies on a base of older, higher-income long-term homeowners who are more likely to vote.

This is just as true in towns such as Muncie and Williamsport as it is in cities such as Indianapolis and Philadelphia.

He’s handsome, smart, funny, and I have a good feeling where things are going. His only flaw: He uses baby talk on occasion, usually when he’s feeling snuggly. It’s dangerously close to being a deal-breaker, but I like him so well that I am trying really hard to ignore it and chalk it up to being an imperfect person myself. Is there any way to broach this issue without sounding like I am trying to change who he is or hurt his feelings? I don't feel like there’s a nice way to say “I would rather eat glass than hear you say something in baby talk?” Any advice-y wicey?

A: The job of a host is to make a guest feel comfortable, within reason. The job of a host is not to expose a guest to certain aspects of “the real world” that he deems necessary. It is not necessary for you to dress differently for your guest’s sake, as her dress code is her own. If you can go to the supermarket or out to a restaurant without violating everyday social convention, then whatever you normally wear will be fine. If you decide to curb your swearing for a week to make your guest feel more at ease, that would be a kind and thoughtful thing to do. Think of it this way: If you eat meat and had a vegetarian guest over for dinner, you wouldn’t necessarily eat vegetarian food all day yourself, but you’d still want to provide them with something they could eat and a comfortable environment where they don’t feel scrutinized or unwelcome. You don’t have to make a big production out of self-correction if the occasional “damn hell ass kings” slips out, and you don’t have to monitor your husband’s speech either. Both of you should think of it as a courtesy, rather than an obligation. While you’re under no imperative to adopt her manners of speech or dress as your own, you shouldn’t go out of your way to demonstrate how different her lifestyle is from yours, either.Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images

On Sunday afternoon, nearly 200,000 people were told to evacuate from the river valley beneath California's Oroville Dam north of Sacramento. A failure of the emergency spillway, which consists of a 30-foot-tall, 1,700-foot-wide concrete wall holding back the dammed lake as well as the chute below it, was expected within the hour.*

Henry Grabar Henry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate’s Moneybox.

That didn't happen, and hasn't happened yet—but the evacuation order remains in effect as engineers frantically drain off the top of the lake before storms expected this week.

How did America's tallest dam veer toward a crisis? It's easy enough for a nonengineer to understand: Last week, dam workers discovered an enormous gash in the main spillway, the long concrete chute that lets excess water out from the top of the lake. In an effort to contain the damage, they slowed the outflow from the main spillway, letting the lake rise. The emergency spillway—a concrete wall over an earthen hillside—would be activated for the first time, easing pressure on the dam without worsening the sinkhole below the main spillway.

And then, barely a day after the lake started to flow over the emergency spillway wall, the evacuation was ordered. A hole had been discovered in the hillside below the wall, eroding quickly in the direction of the lake. If the wall gave way, an uncontrolled, 30-foot wall of water would be unleashed on the hillside and the towns below.

Immediately, the damaged main spillway was pushed to let out as much water as possible, as work crews with dump trucks and helicopters work to fill the hole beneath the emergency spillway wall with boulders, to prevent further damage.

The larger question is why engineers were sure that letting 450,000 cubic feet per second of water flow down an earthen hillside would not cause damaging erosion. (That was what the emergency spillway was built for—in reality, a far smaller quantity of water surged over the lip and down the hillside.) In 2005, environmental groups argued this exact situation might occur, and urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to force the state to "armor" the hillside with concrete or other reinforcements.

That didn't happen. Ron Stork, the policy director of Friends of the River, an environmental group that brought the original complaint, told the San Jose Mercury News that he was told that contractors (the entities that buy water from the massive State Water Project, of which Lake Oroville is the keystone) did not want to pay for the improvements.

Jeffrey Kightlinger, the general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the water utility for Los Angeles and its environs, said the issue was not cost but federal guidelines, the Los Angeles Times reported. In those guidelines, he said Monday, "they talk about how you don’t put a lot of funding and concrete, etc. into emergency spillways because presumably they will rarely if ever be used.” That rare moment, it turns out, would've been right now.

It all adds up to a fable for whatever political framework critics would like to apply: regulatory negligence (why wasn't erosion potential recognized earlier?), utilities with perverse incentives (did price-sensitive contractors have undue influence over a safety decision?), even California liberalism ("California spent on rail and illegals, but not on damaged dam").

And, of course, extreme weather: the swing from California's severe, yearslong drought to what may wind up being the wettest year in its recorded history. The acting director of the DWR said at a press conference on Monday that he wasn't sure anything had gone wrong with the agency's plans. "This was a new, never-happened-before event."Americans are reminded in daily headlines that the nation’s original sin of racism is far from expunged. In Hollywood’s own backyard, that reminder came earlier this year in the form of the #OscarsSoWhite backlash, which turned a spotlight on the glaring lack of recognition and opportunities for minority performers.

What #OscarsSoWhite did not address, though, is the racial divide that exists for people of color working in entertainment crafts such as art direction, costume design, editing, sound, and cinematography.

For a business that often prides itself on progressive values, it’s a telling point that discrimination and racism are facts of life for minorities in so-called below-the-line jobs, according to a number of artisans who were interviewed by Variety.

Kyle Bean for Variety

“It’s really a hidden segregation that happens in the industry, that’s not talked about,” says “Selma” director Ava DuVernay, who notes that in her previous line of work as a publicist she was often the only African-American on a crew. Yet some below-the-line reps Variety spoke with seemed oblivious to the experiences of their own clients, saying they didn’t think race was a pressing issue.

If on-set segregation is hidden, it’s hiding in plain sight. At some guilds, leaders and members alike have brought attention to the preponderance of white males in the membership, and have started diversity programs in response. Intl. Cinematographers Guild president Steven Poster says he’s spent his career working to integrate camera crews. “This has traditionally been a very white, male industry from the very beginning,” Poster says, “and it’s taken a number of years to change that demographic.” Poster maintains that the progress over the years among DPs and camera assistants is obvious. “You just look at crews and you see that there’s more diversity,” he says. “Is it enough? No.”

At the American Cinema Editors, Troy Tataki, who is half-Japanese, started a diversity program after African-American editor Lillian Benson did an informal count and found there were fewer than 25 people of color among the active guild membership of more than 400. Out of 30-40 new members who have joined the organization over the past year, six are minorities, says Tataki, who has been recruiting minority editors to join. As small as that number may be, it’s a significant step forward for the ACE, as it represents a roughly 20% increase in minority membership in one year. Most guilds are heavily white and male, but they can’t say for sure how diverse their membership is, because they haven’t tracked it by race or ethnicity. The Cinematographers Guild is moving to survey members about race, but if the experience of the Costume Designers Guild is any indication, it may not succeed. The designers organization, which sometimes get calls from producers looking for designers of a particular race, found its members did not want the guild to collect such data, because they don’t want to be typecast.

And clearly, such typecasting does exist in the workplace.

One African-American artist, who requested anonymity for fear of a career backlash, recounted overhearing some producers talking several years ago on the other side of a high-backed restaurant booth. Their conversation turned to hiring African-Americans. “One of the producers said, ‘Oh, they’re so difficult to work with,’ ” the artist remembers.

“The message I was given growing up [was] people are going to be watching you, and aware of who you are. You are African-American in a very white-dominated society … so you have to be 10 times better at what you do. ” J. Kathleen Gibson

Clint Ramos, the Filipino-American designer who won a 2016 Tony for the costumes of “Eclipsed,” recalls a disturbing incident that occurred right after an interview he had with a director and artistic director for a design job on an 18th-century farce at a regional theater.

“I left the meeting really feeling great,” says Ramos. “But [as] I was waiting for my ride … I overheard them say, ‘Well, he would be good if this was, like, set in Hawaii or something, or in Polynesia.’ And that made me think, ‘Wow, the way I appear really affects how people perceive the work that I am capable of.’ ”

Most artists interviewed for this article say that the prejudice they encounter tends to be more subtle. Ruth Carter, the first African-American nominated for a costume design Oscar (for 1992’s “Malcolm X”), says, “We’re not living in the ’50s, where they stamp your application ‘Denied’ just because you spelled a word wrong. Now it’s a more intricate and multi-layered issue of discrimination.”

Some incidents reveal unconscious bias. Sharen Davis, a two-time Oscar nominee for costume design (for “Dreamgirls” and “Ray”), recounts that when she reports to the set, security usually assumes she’s an extra. She’s not alone in that experience.

Once at work, artists of color sometimes encounter resistance on the set as well. Visual effects supervisor Edward L. Williams won a VFX Emmy for “Star Trek: Voyager,” but says some DPs have openly challenged his skills before they’ve even worked with him. “They’ve been quite blunt with it,” Williams says. “[They’ll say,] ‘The only reason you got this position is because they wanted to hire somebody black.’ And I’ll go, ‘Well, you know, good for them,’” says Williams with a laugh. “I guess I’m that black person they hired.”

Kyle Bean for Variety

Williams says that that puts him in the position of proving, little by little, that he belongs — sometimes even tactfully calling out those DPs when necessary. “Then they realize you can do the job. There’s still a little resentment, but they say, ‘Hey this guy’s pretty good,’ and then, before the end of the shoot, they’re asking you to go have beers, and they apologize for what they said, and say they were under stress because they wanted to bring their buddy on.”

The artists Variety spoke with come from varied backgrounds. Some rose out of abject poverty, some come from working-class roots, others had comfortable upbringings in families that were from the middle-class or upper crust within their communities. But almost none had any connection with show business —so when they were young, the industry seemed out of reach.

Production designer Arv Greywal, a Sikh whose family migrated from Mumbai to Canada, attended inner-city schools in Toronto with big minority populations. Even in a production center like Toronto, he says, “People don’t think that opportunity exists for them. They just don’t know that they can do this, because it’s always been something that’s so removed from them.” Greywal all but camped out at production designers’ offices, though many refused to see him. Eventually, he clawed his way into the industry, mostly through relentless determination and hard work.

No minority artists spoke of having received much encouragement from secondary schools they attended. Many of Greywal’s classmates were “channeled” toward trade schools. On the other side of the continent, Daryn Okada, who wanted to be a cinematographer, got similarly unhelpful advice in high school in South San Gabriel. When standardized tests showed he had an aptitude for technology, guidance counselors suggested he become an engineer or a pharmacist. “They said, ‘Well, if you want to get into the arts, maybe you should talk to the person who teaches band.’ That’s the best advice they could give me.”

But Okada, who is Japanese-American, was fortunate to have the support of one instructor who helped make a difference — a photography teacher who liked his

pictures and submitted them to competitions. Then Okada graduated early and, like Greywal, climbed up through the industry ranks, thanks to almost obsessive hard work.

Supportive parents can also be a springboard. While Okada was still in high school, his mother helped him enroll in a summer cinematography class at USC that made his dream seem attainable.

Kyle Bean for Variety

Sometimes parents help by sharing their experiences of living in a white-dominated world. “The message I was given growing up, says J. Kathleen Gibson, a film editor of mixed-race ancestry, “[was] people are going to be watching you and aware of who you are.” Gibson’s parents, she recalls, told her, “‘You are African-American in a very white-dominated society … so you have to be 10 times better at what you do.’”

The lack of minority artists in entertainment often leaves young artists of color with few role models. But among the artists Variety interviewed, where such role models did exist, they had an outsized impact. African-American DP Daniel Patterson got encouragement from cinematographer Bradford Young, who’s also black. Okada was aware of the work of James Wong Howe, a great Chinese-American DP during Hollywood’s Golden Age.

Benson, as a young editor, met Madeline Anderson, a pioneering African-American editor and producer who worked on public TV documentaries in the 1960s. “I knew that there was one, and so I could do it,” Benson says. Years later, after Benson became a member of the ACE, she attended Anderson’s induction into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. “I walked up to her and said, ‘Ms. Anderson, you don’t remember me. My name is Lillian Benson, and I want you to know that I’m the first African-American female director of the ACE. I thought you would be proud.’ She was astonished.”

Many artists say they feel like they’re being pigeonholed by race. Benson recalls reconnecting with a high school friend who looked up her credits online and observed she that had worked on a lot of films about African-Americans. “What popped out of my mouth was, ‘That’s the only thing they think I can do.’”

Ruth Carter has carved out a niche doing African-American period stories, and says she enjoys it. But many minority artists recount frustration at being stuck in the black niche. Sometimes they get hired first by a black director, get a “black” film or TV show on their resume, and then are asked to do only “black” stories thereafter. It’s common for designers, regardless of race, to complain about being pigeonholed by genre, in action movies or comedies or period pieces. In the case of African-American designers, however, the genre seems to be “black,” and that tends to rankle.

Sometimes “black” seems to override everything else. DP Daniel Patterson recalls getting hired to shoot documentaries for a German company, only to find that regardless of the nominal subject matter of the film, he was asked to lead the production into some aspect of black life.

“I’m always grateful to work,” he adds, “but it’s something that you just kind of take note of and keep going.”

What stings about such pigeonholing, says Ramos, is the assumption that artists can’t do a certain job because of what they look like or where they’re from. That goes to the very heart of why people become designers for the performing arts in the first place, he says. “We want to be immersed in different worlds. We can participate in cultures that we don’t know, or in a world that we don’t know, through the particular project that we’re doing.”

“It’s my turn, I guess you can say, to fight some of these battles, and not to let anyone get away with racial remarks or putting down people. Within the last three or four years, I’ve just kind of taken it upon myself to start speaking up.”

Artists often cite a lack of interracial networking as a factor that keeps them from getting opportunities outside their racial niche. Since the industry tends to be socially segregated, it tends to be segregated on the set as well.

“Any kind of artist segregation comes out of a fear of trusting that someone who is not like you can perform at the level that you can perform,” says DuVernay. “You don’t know a lot of women who run things, you don’t know a lot of black people in your personal life, you’ve never been around Latinos who are leading a department. So that’s a question mark. And most would rather not take the risk, because there’s a lot of money at stake, there are reputations at stake, and you’d rather go with what you know.”

Another common experience of subtle racism identified by multiple artists is extra scrutiny on the job. Choices are questioned. Advice is dispensed that’s meant to be helpful, but in a way that implies a person hasn’t done research or can’t be trusted. Sharen Davis sardonically remembers being summoned by a producer to answer questions about the bright colors she chose in designing costumes for one film. “This isn’t a comedy, you know,” she remembers the producer telling her. “Yes, I know,” she replied.

Davis was uncomfortable because it’s unusual for a producer to so insert himself between director and designer. Worse, she says, “I’ve never done a comedy.”

Ramos feels that he’s scrutinized more when he’s doing work where he’s cast against type — say, on a French farce or a period American play. “You get ‘educated,’” he says. “You get ‘informed’ about the nuances. It happens sort of blithely, and it’s presented to you as a piece of trivia, but then you realize, ‘Wait. Why did he just tell me this?’ I don’t think they know that they’re doing it.”

The artists who experience such scrutiny are left with the gnawing suspicion that they’re being treated differently because of their race. It can’t be proven, but the feeling can’t be denied, either, which can create a simmering stress. Benson alludes to the classic film “Gaslight,” where the protagonist’s husband tries to convince her she’s going insane. “People make you think you’re crazy, and you’re not,” she says. “Sometimes you’re too sensitive. But many times, you’re not crazy.”

Patterson says that in the indie world, where he does most of his work, filmmakers share stories all the time, including their suspicions about bias. “We hear of friends of ours who have had nervous breakdowns. Mental health is a serious thing,” he says. “We constantly check in with one another.” Some artists call it their “Am I crazy? calls.”

That kind of second-guessing can prevent victims of racism from speaking out when they encounter something objectionable.

“I’ve had to bite my tongue a few times to keep the peace,” says Williams, explaining that he has to find the line between being too aggressive and too passive. But he says he’s come to accept that he needs to raise his voice. “It’s my turn, I guess you can say, to fight some of these battles, and not to let anyone get away with racial remarks or putting down people,” he says. “Within the last three or four years, I’ve just kind of taken it upon myself to start speaking up.’”

Though one cinematographer interviewed for this story voiced frustration with #OscarsSoWhite precisely because it ignored his craft and others, Greywal credits the campaign with raising awareness of racial disparities inside the industry. “If you play nice, if you just go away at their behest, then you’re never gonna get there,” he says. “Until you get in somebody’s face, it’s never going to change.”

One of the key ways to effect significant change and attain parity across all facets of the entertainment industry, both for those who work behind and in front of the camera, is for the decision-makers to improve hiring practices.

DuVernay insists that directors have to say, “ ‘I’m going to make sure that no department head brings me a whole list of white guys.’ When you’ve chosen someone as a token, then that creates an environment of division, and you might as well just have all white guys.”

She says that integration has to start with department heads and the director’s own unit, including the ADs. “It can’t just be the PAs,” she adds.

Meanwhile, some artists and directors of color are taking matters into their own hands, making a point of mentoring those who will follow in their footsteps — becoming the role models they may have lacked when they were breaking into the business.

Costume Designers Guild president Salvador Perez, a California native of Mexican-American heritage, has a multicultural crew on “The Mindy Project,” including Latina costumers and a Cambodian cutter-fitter working alongside African-Americans. However, he acknowledges that his set is more the exception than the rule.

The guilds have been more focused on gender than on race in recent years, and few have diversity programs like the one the American Cinema Editors has instituted. The Art Directors Guild has started a diversity committee. The Costume Designers Guild has no formal diversity program, but has done outreach at Los Angeles area schools. Rachel Stanley, the CDG’s executive director, says she sees many more minority artists entering the guild.

There are also calls for more minority “gatekeepers” in the executive ranks, so that some people at the top will be sensitive to the sight of a set that has all-white department heads.

Ultimately, minority artists are asking to be considered for different kinds of projects. They don’t want to be defined by race, but by their craft and their artistry.

“Regardless of if it’s race-specific or just a personal issue, putting yourself into your work is key to connecting with a bunch of people,” says Frank Abney, a young African-American animator whose credits include “Kung Fu Panda 3.” “Because as different as we are, we’re a lot alike. No matter what race we are.”Photo: Chris Weeks/Getty Images

Director Zhang Yimou is leaping into the fray to defend his film The Great Wall, the most expensive Chinese production to date. The film caused considerable controversy with the release of its trailer, which featured, among other things, Matt Damon defending the Great Wall from dragons in ancient China. The most prominent critic was Fresh Off the Boat’s Constance Wu, who argued that the film continued a long history of white men saving Asia. “We have to stop perpetuating the racist myth that [only a] white man can save the world,” Wu wrote. “Our heroes don’t look like Matt Damon. They look like Malala. Ghandi. Mandela. Your big sister when she stood up for you to those bullies that one time.”

Zhang, well known for directing epics like House of Flying Daggers and classic films like Raise the Red Lantern, argues that The Great Wall is “the opposite of what is being suggested” and that the film is “deeply rooted in Chinese culture.” Zhang released a full statement to Entertainment Weekly:

In many ways The Great Wall is the opposite of what is being suggested. For the first time, a film deeply rooted in Chinese culture, with one of the largest Chinese casts ever assembled, is being made at tent pole scale for a world audience. I believe that is a trend that should be embraced by our industry. Our film is not about the construction of the Great Wall. Matt Damon is not playing a role that was originally conceived for a Chinese actor. The arrival of his character in our story is an important plot point. There are five major heroes in our story and he is one of them — the other four are all Chinese. The collective struggle and sacrifice of these heroes are the emotional heart of our film. As the director of over 20 Chinese language films and the Beijing Olympics, I have not and will not cast a film in a way that was untrue to my artistic vision. I hope when everyone sees the film and is armed with the facts they will agree.

Zhang is deploying the patented “Wait and see!” argument, which isn’t entirely unfair. However, he also doesn’t quite address the substance of Wu’s argument, which is that the film is centered on a white hero protecting the Great Wall. While it’s unclear what the substance of the narrative is, what is clear is that Matt Damon gets top billing in the film. In fact, the credited actors are Matt Damon, Jing Tian, Pedro Pascal, Willem Dafoe, and Andy Lau.Rachel Nichols won the Roger Goodell press conference.

The NFL commissioner addressed reporters Friday afternoon regarding domestic violence and the league’s new conduct policy. After a prepared statement, Goodell took questions for approximately 30 minutes. That’s when Nichols, who grilled Floyd Mayweather last week about his history with domestic violence, put on a journalism clinic.

Her first question was about the balance of power in the league office when it comes to discipline.

Rachel Nichols: “You’ve had pretty extreme unilateral power in deciding discipline, but as you’ve said a few times, you’ve gotten it wrong in a few cases and that tends to happen when there’s no checks and balances. How willing are you to give up some of that power, and do you think that would be the right thing for you to do?”

Roger Goodell: “Everything is on the table. We’re going to make sure that we look at every aspect of how we gather information to make a decision, how make that decision, and then the appeals process. And all of that is on the table, and all of that is important information that we want outside experts to give us perspective on, and see if there’s a better way to do it. We believe there is and we believe we need it. We can’t continue to operate like this.”

Nichols had a follow-up question, and noted the prosecutor’s office in the Ray Rice case said that they don’t have any record of the NFL asking for the video or information.

RN: “Also you mentioned on TV last week that you tried to get the Ray Rice video and any information. The Atlantic City prosecutors office in an open records check says they don’t have any electronic communication from the NFL asking for those kinds of documentation or the video. Can you give us sort of the trail of how you guys did that investigation so people can know really what you put into it?”

RG: “Our security department works with law enforcement. They are fully cooperative. We gather almost entirely all of our information through law enforcement, and that’s something else we’re going to look at. That’s something else, is that the right process? Should all of our information be gathered through law enforcement? We understand and respect what they go through and the job they have to do, and there are certain restrictions that they may be under.”

Later, Nichols took Goodell to task once more, questioning the integrity of hiring ex-FBI director Robert Mueller’s law firm to conduct the NFL’s internal investigation.

RN: “Commisioner you mentioned Robert Mueller’s investigation as key to solving all of these issues. I’m not gonna sit here and discuss the integrity of the ex-director of the FBI, I can leave it as a given that he’s a man of integrity, but the law firm that he works for and will help him carry out that investigation is a law firm with extremely close ties to the NFL. You guys paid that law firm recently to help you negotiate some television deals, the president of the Ravens who will be key in this whole investigation worked at that law firm for more than 30 years. Why hire someone with even the appearance of impropriety and how do you expect this to affect everything?”

RG: “Well Rachel, I would respectfully disagree because you now are questioning the integrity of the FBI. But part of the idea of this, I guess, is to restore public trust. So even if he does a flawless investigation isn’t there an element here of your leaving the door open to doubt?”

Nichols’ questions received instant praise an adulation on Twitter, as the reporter was lauded for not letting Goodell off the hook.

“I love WikiLeaks!” then-candidate Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in October. “It’s amazing how nothing is secret today when you talk about the internet.”

Indeed, it’s hard to keep secrets these days, and especially hard to do so when you’re managing a bureaucracy of several million people. Since assuming that managerial role, Trump has taken a less flattering approach toward leaks, especially those that expose lies from himself or his team. It was press leaks of intercepted communications between ex–National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador that did Flynn in—and, if you buy the line of Trump and his suck-ups in Congress, those leaks are the only problem to see here. Very little concern from the White House is being paid to the news value of those leaks: information that proved Flynn to be lying, either in conversations with the press or to his superior, Vice President Mike Pence, and which resulted in Trump requesting his resignation. It was illegal for officials with access to that intelligence to share it to the press, but it was legal for the press to publish it to serve the public good, and Trump is tacitly acknowledging it was a public good if he's the one deciding that Flynn had to go. This, unfortunately for Trump, is how things are supposed to work.

The man in the White House does not see it this way. It is natural for presidents to be upset when classified information appears in the press. President Obama certainly wasn’t a fan, and his administration prosecuted leakers with aggression, to major press criticism. It is a horse of a different color to lump the press in with the leakers as complicit in the illegal act as a continuation of one’s war against the press, and to turn the public further against the press as malevolent and untrustworthy.

“The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that's classified?” Trump said during his press conference on Thursday. “How do they do it? You know why? Because it is [an] illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.”

Another illegal process was the allegedly state-sponsored hacking of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta’s emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was illegal to do this. Though some may disagree with WikiLeaks perceived political aims or lack of discretion in choosing what to publish, it was not illegal for them to publish, and it was not illegal for news organizations to report on which emails they deemed to have news value.

Trump distinguished between the material published by his beloved WikiLeaks and the leaked information that brought about Flynn’s ouster this way: “In one case you are talking about highly classified information,” he said, and “in the other case you are talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.” That is a fair point to lay out, if you ignore all of the questions swirling around Trump's team and their possible coziness with Russian officials, which has been subject to FBI investigation. (Fairer than another assertion he made in the press conference, which is that WikiLeaks doesn’t reveal classified information. Someone should inform the president that this stuff is their bread and butter.) In terms of news value, though, there is more in the revelation that the president’s national security adviser has been lying left and right—and could thus be possibly open to blackmail by a foreign government—than there is in your average John Podesta email. The press shouldn’t be “ashamed” of exposing this.Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Archideaphoto/Thinkstock and Alex Wong/Getty Images.

Around Election Day, a prescient 2012 statement from retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter resurfaced on social media. Souter was speaking in Concord, New Hampshire, and a member of the audience asked about the role of schools in producing “civically engaged students.”*

“I’ll start with the bottom line,” the justice said, sighing deeply. “I don’t believe there is any problem of American politics and American public life which is more significant today than the pervasive civic ignorance of the Constitution the United States and the structure of government.” He went on to express concern that an ill-informed and disgruntled electorate would turn toward an authoritarian ruler and suggested a revival of civics education in American high schools. “An ignorant people,” Souter said, channeling Thomas Jefferson, “can never remain a free people.”

In our reality-warping era of “alternative facts,” imaginary papal endorsements, “pizzagate,” and “widespread voter fraud,” it seems more important than ever to help people, especially young people, learn to sift fact from fiction and figure out how to engage constructively with their government. Not surprisingly, voices on both the left and right have begun to call for our educational system to work toward a fix.

At the confirmation hearings for Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse proclaimed, “We have a crisis of civic education. … This is a crisis when kids don’t understand the distinction between the legislative and executive branches.” Sasse went on, implausibly, to suggest President Obama was at fault, for confusing children with his aggressive use of executive actions. Still, Sasse is right about the widespread ignorance of the way the federal government works. A 2015 survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center found only 31 percent of respondents could name all three branches of government.

Could a push for media literacy and civics education unite conservatives and liberals?

The progressive Century Foundation is concerned, too. In a recent report it argued that Trump’s election indicates the “failure of our education system to instill an essential belief in the values of constitutional democracy,” such as freedom of the press and freedom of religion. There have been scores of news stories written about a single study out of Stanford that found that 80 percent of middle-schoolers can’t tell the difference between sponsored content and a news story, while less than a third of college students understand that a tweet from an activist group may be a biased source of news.

Could a push for media literacy and civics education unite conservatives and liberals who fear the rise of uninformed voters swayed by propaganda and “fake news”? As Chris Berdik recently reported in Slate, preliminary research suggests that students who receive media literacy training are better able than other students to evaluate the accuracy of political claims and distinguish advertising, entertainment, and advocacy from news.

But there’s reason to be skeptical, too. The media literacy and civics education movements aren’t new. And their history shows that when curriculum-writers and teachers wade into these waters, they often get caught up in ideological storms, buffeted by the very disagreements over facts and values that they hoped to teach children to overcome.

* * *

America would never have had a public education system if not for elite anxiety about the excesses of popular democracy. The civics education movement began in the 19th century, when social reformers wanted teachers to make sure that the voters of the future would choose the right candidates—men who were rational, moral, and disinterested. Horace Mann, a founder of the common school movement, wrote in 1847 that public schools had the “power” to “redeem the state from social vices and crime.” The goal of education was to create “exemplary men—honest dealers, conscientious jurors, true witnesses, incorruptible voters and magistrates, good parents, good neighbors, good members of society.”

Beneath that lovely rhetoric were some uglier convictions. Protestant common school reformers such as Mann believed America’s fundamental democratic character was threatened by the swell of “papist” Catholic immigrants, and they wanted teachers to inculcate children with WASP morality. Indeed, calls for civics education have often been strongly ideological. During World War I, New York City public school teachers who refused to deliver prebaked lessons on the superiority of the United States to other nations were investigated and sometimes driven from their jobs. The same thing happened during the McCarthy era. All in all, tens of thousands of left-leaning American educators lost their jobs in red scares. Progressive educators, too, have pursued ideological goals under the guise of civics education. In 1943, the New York City teachers union produced a sample civics lesson that glorified Soviet communism.

These historic examples may seem extreme, but civics education continues to fall prey to ideological minefields. In Texas, where Republican legislators have fought hard to influence the social studies curriculum, the state standards for high school government classes refer frequently to the American “free market system” and call for students to “understand how government taxation and regulation can serve as restrictions to private enterprise.” (This is a longtime conservative educational priority. Amway, the multilevel marketing company owned by the family of Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for secretary of education, runs a program in which volunteers visit classrooms to teach children “the fundamentals of free enterprise, business and economics.”) The Texas standards also refer to the “Judeo-Christian” and “Biblical law” roots of American democracy—phrases that appear nowhere in the social studies standards of liberal New York City.

When it comes to the economy, the New York City standards emphasize that the American system is not technically free market but rather a “mixed economy,” meaning it is shaped by both the market and by government regulation. The New York City Department of Education suggests that 12th-graders explore the question, “Is American capitalism sustainable? … Economic policymakers face considerable challenges within a capitalist system, including unemployment, inflation, poverty, and environmental impact.” The content of civics education inevitably flows from the political principles of the school district and state.

The Common Core standards that are currently driving curricular change across the country attempt to thread the ideological needle on civics education. They focus on the importance of students reading and analyzing primary historical sources such as the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, the U.S. Constitution, and various Supreme Court decisions. Pretty much everyone can agree those documents are crucial to a good education, but that doesn’t mean they are easy to discuss without debating contemporary politics. For example, how heavily should teachers emphasize the discrimination against women and minorities that is baked into our founding documents? Will administrators or parents complain if teachers raise questions about whether Donald Trump’s travel ban is constitutional? As I’ve reported for Slate, one campaign-season survey of mostly progressive teachers found that 40 percent were scared to discuss the election with their students, lest they hear complaints from parents or administrators.

It’s difficult to imagine a purely nonideological or unifying civics curriculum.

They may be right to worry. In a July blog post, the conservative-leaning education advocate Robert Pondiscio wrote about psychology research that suggests that civics education celebrating multiculturalism as a positive value risks provoking an intense conservative backlash. Individuals in the majority group tend to turn toward authoritarianism when they feel the monolithic society they grew up in is “coming apart.” It would be more politically unifying, Pondiscio suggested, to base civics education around the constitutional ideals that unite Americans. “There is good evidence to think that the key to creating conditions that sincerely welcome and celebrate diversity may lie in focusing the attention of our children on what makes us one country and one people,” he wrote. “The challenge for our diverse, pluralistic and democratic society—a challenge that, as ever, falls most heavily on schools, the civic institutions with the broadest reach in American life—is to blunt the sense that we are, in fact, coming apart.”

A liberal might respond that minority students or girls will feel left out by a curriculum that does not reflect their struggles and unique experiences and that those in majority groups will get a richer education if they are exposed to diverse cultures and perspectives. In short, it’s difficult to imagine a purely nonideological or unifying civics curriculum. And in truth, there has never been a time when American classrooms had one.

* * *

The media literacy movement is a historically newer attempt to deal with the same problems that civics education tackles: the ability of students to grow into informed and empathetic citizens. According to Renee Hobbs, director of the Media Education Lab at the University of Rhode Island, the movement can be traced back to the early 1940s, when books with titles such as How to Read a Newspaper were popular. In that work, Edgar Dale, a professor at Ohio State University, explained that newspapers were businesses supported by advertisers; that the reporting and editing process could introduce errors and leave out important information; and that headlines were, by necessity, incomplete and sometimes misleading attempts to capture the audience’s attention.

If these revelations seem anodyne today, it is only because media critique has become such a central part of our culture. Media literacy theorists are amused by the attention their field has received since Election Day from journalists looking for solutions to the spread of viral conspiracy theories. For decades, media literacy education has “corrected misinformation and dealt with the question of whether media messages can and do tell the truth,” Hobbs said. “That has always been fundamental.”

The media literacy movement picked up steam after World War II, when English teachers shocked by revelations about the Holocaust developed curricular materials on how to spot propaganda. Then, in the 1970s, popular and visual culture became more central. Kodak funded efforts to introduce “visual literacy” into the curriculum, teaching children that photographers and filmmakers make editorial decisions each time they frame and edit their shots.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was an explosion of interest in media literacy education, driven by both liberal and conservative concerns. Some of it trickled down from the academic cultural studies movement, as progressives increasingly wanted students to deconstruct the sexist, racist, and otherwise bigoted stereotypes in films, TV shows, news stories, and advertisements. (The magazine Adbusters, a staple of grunge-era alternative culture, was founded in 1989. It went on to play a key role in the Occupy Wall Street movement.) Simultaneously, culture warriors were deeply worried about children’s exposure to violence on film and later, in the age of school shootings, on violence in video games.

A commitment to media literacy “tends to bubble up from the grassroots—a passionate teacher who says, ‘My kids don’t know how to analyze advertising.’ Or, ‘Look at this terrible example of violence the kids are celebrating and laughing at and being desensitized to,’ ” Hobbs said. “From the right, media literacy teachers in Tulsa are worried about satanic imagery in Disney movies.”

The solutions may be old hat: better teacher training, stronger curricular materials, and more funding.

In 2017, the idea that you can’t trust the media has become a cliché. But this cynicism can be dangerous, says Paul Mihailidis, a media literacy theorist and associate professor at Emerson College. In a 2013 study, Mihailidis examined the attitudes of students at the University of Maryland, some of whom were enrolled in a media literacy course and some of whom were not. The students who completed the class were better able to critically analyze media sources. But they also demonstrated negative and even hopeless views, which could prompt them to distrust even reliable sources of information. In one representative comment, a student said, “I personally feel like organizations are out to get us. I think everyone needs to question everything. I think when the media tell you something on the news, they aren’t trying to give you information, but trying to benefit themselves.”

If media literacy education doesn’t move beyond critique to also offer examples of how the media can create positive change—such as when an investigative reporter reveals an injustice, or a citizen uses social media to organize a petition or protest—it can lead to “more cynicism toward civic engagement,” Mihailidis said. “Media literacy is now being seen as a panacea or solution,” he added, but effective media literacy empowers students to consume and create good content, not just critique the bad stuff. In other words, skepticism toward sources is good, but a blanket cynicism is counterproductive to the civic ends that media literacy theorists hope to achieve: a more informed and engaged public.

At their heart, these pedagogical movements are really about knowledge and skills that ought to be developed in any decent history or English class: an understanding of our nation’s founding and laws and an ability to consume media critically and seek out accurate sources of information. If our schools aren’t excelling at those tasks, the solutions may be old hat: better teacher training, stronger curricular materials, and more funding for schools that are especially struggling to provide good instruction.

What’s more, the outlook may not be as grim as postelection prognosticators make it out to be. The same 2015 Annenberg survey that found ignorance of the three branches of government had some bright spots. Eighty-one percent of respondents knew the Constitution protected the right to peacefully assemble, and 69 percent knew it protected against unreasonable searches and seizures. Seventy-six percent said government should not be able to prevent the press from publishing articles critical of the government. With a new president who has condemned protesters and journalists, that’s knowledge that may come in handy.

The self-proclaimed “least anti-Semitic person you’ve ever seen,” who is also the “least racist person,” who is also the president of the United States, held a press conference on Thursday to inform the media that they are “fake news” and that their dishonesty is “out of control.”

“Many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect they deserve,” President Trump said at the outset of the briefing, whose ostensible purpose was to announce his new pick for secretary of labor. (It’s R. Alexander Acosta.) For that reason, he said, he felt it was necessary to address the American people directly.

What followed was a stunning display of Trump’s ability to lie, exaggerate, obfuscate, and mislead the public while insisting that it was actually the media who were doing all of those things.

Over the next hour and 15 minutes, Trump proceeded to berate the press for negative coverage of his administration, shout down reporters who asked questions that he deemed unfriendly, dismiss evidence that his campaign aides had contact with Russia as “fake news,” defend WikiLeaks while calling for a crackdown on leakers in his own White House, and complain that the country he inherited was “a mess.” He also lamented that “drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars,” spouted a deeply misleading statistic about the federal court that blocked his immigration ban, maintained that the ban had a “very smooth rollout,” and falsely claimed that he had won the Electoral College by a larger margin than any president since Reagan. In response to a question from an Orthodox Jewish reporter about a wave of anti-Semitic attacks, Trump cut the reporter off, told him to sit down and be quiet, and called him a liar, while declaring himself “the least anti-Semitic person you have ever seen in your entire life.” Trump added that he is also “the least racist person.”

At the same time, Trump waved away the well-documented dishonesty of his own national security adviser, Michael Flynn, which led to Flynn’s resignation. Flynn “did nothing wrong” by calling Russia’s ambassador to discuss U.S. sanctions while Barack Obama was still president, Trump said. Rather, Trump has repeatedly blamed “the fake media” for treating Flynn “very, very unfairly.”

It’s the media’s dishonesty, Trump insisted again Thursday, that’s the real story here. Asked by CNN’s Jim Acosta how, if the leaks about his aides’ Russian contacts are real, Trump could call them “fake news,” Trump offered no evidence. But he reiterated that “the reporting is fake” and said he didn’t appreciate the negative tone of CNN’s coverage. “You know the word tone?’” he asked sarcastically. “I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad,” Trump said. “I won. I won.” Trump also objected to the use of the word chaos by someone on CNN to characterize the early days of his administration. “There’s zero chaos,” he said. “We are running, this is a fine-tuned machine.” His chief of staff Reince Priebus, Trump added, spends half his time “putting out lies by the press.” (The full exchange is here.)

Yet it was Trump who was caught in a blatant falsehood Thursday, when NBC’s Peter Alexander challenged him on his claim that his electoral-college victory was the largest since Reagan’s. And once again, his response revealed that he is only outraged by perceived falsehoods when they come from the media. You can watch his shoulder-shrugging, mealy-mouthed dismissal below.

Got that, American people? Straight from the president’s mouth. When Trump or his advisers say things that aren’t true, it’s not their fault; the real villains are the media who report on it.(CNN) White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller has garnered attention in recent weeks as one of the chief architects behind President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.

The 31-year-old aide's hardline views on Islam and terrorism took shape while he was still a student at Duke University. It was there, in the 2007 spring semester of his senior year, that Miller helped launch and run the "Terrorism Awareness Project," an initiative, Miller wrote at the time, that was aimed at educating students about the risk of "Islamofascism."

A CNN KFile review of Miller's comments on TV and on his blog for the project, which is available on the Web archive, reveal Miller's belief that the US and western civilization are at war with Islamic jihadists. Miller did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN's KFile for this story.

Miller served as national campus coordinator, president, and co-founder of the initiative, which was launched by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a right-wing group which describes its missions as combating "the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror."

A key premise of the project, Miller wrote in a blog post, was that schools and universities under left-wing influence had failed to educate students about the risk of what the project's leaders called "Islamofascism" and had allowed the ideology to penetrate school systems and academia.

"Gripped by complacency and the omnipresent force of political correctness, our nation has failed to educate our youth about the holy war being waged against us and what needs to be done to defeat the Jihadists that are waging this war," Miller wrote. "American kids attend school in an educational system corrupted by the hard left. In this upside-down world, America is the villain and Jihadists the victims of our foreign policy. Instead of opening eyes, we are fastening blindfolds."

The mission, Miller added, was to "provide informational literature, films, posters, advertisements, speakers, and panel discussions whose purpose is to make our fellow students aware of the Islamic jihad and the terrorist threat, and to mobilize support for the defense of America and the civilization of the West."

The main effort taken on by the group was putting on "Islamofascism Awareness Week" at college campuses around the country. One poster for the event available on the Web archive depicts the execution of a woman by a member of the Taliban.

A guide available on the Web archive outlined suggestions to college students on how to put on events for the week.

The guide suggested students do a sit-in in Women's Studies Departments "to protest the silence of Women's Studies programs and Women's Centers in our universities while women are suffering brutal and inhumane treatment in the Islamic world."

It also suggests hosting a filming of "Islam: What the West Needs to Know" which "reveals the violent, expansionary ideology of the so called 'religion of peace' that seeks the destruction or subjugation of other faiths, cultures, and systems of government."

The archived site also includes a grainy, mid-2000s animation film that features the word "Jihad" superimposed over the United States and set to the musical selection Carmina Burana. The film, "What Every American Needs To Know About Jihad" listed Islamic terrorists and showed quotes of Osama Bin Laden. Ads by the group in the Duke Chronicle advertised screenings of another film "Obsession," a documentary on radical Islam screened on campuses which some critics charged as incendiary and Islamophobic.

In February 2007, the group attempted to run an ad in campus newspapers nationwide, but newspapers refused to run it. Fox News reported at the time the ad was designed by Robert Spencer, a man who the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation league have labeled "anti-Muslim." The ad argued that jihad "is about the global rule of radical Islam" and constitutes a war against Christians, Jews, women, and gays, alongside quotations attributed to Osama bin Laden and others.

In a February 2007 appearance on Fox and Friends, Miller said the decision by some universities not to run the ad showed their bias.

"That's what so insane, is that in today's environment on college campuses, you can have these professors saying that we fabricated 9/11, you can have people like Samuel Arion teaching, who were indicted for terrorist ties, you can have, like at Duke, we had a conference come to the university where people were actually recruited to interfere against Israeli anti-terror operations," Miller said. "You've got this insane stuff happening on our campuses, but you can't run a simple fact-based ad that talks about the threat of radical Islam."

Spencer wrote in an email to CNN's KFile that he didn't remember writing the ad, but he said he was "of course" pleased that Miller had attained an influential role in the White House and defended himself against the criticism that his views are "anti-Muslim."

"The idea that those who call attention to the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat are 'extreme thinkers on the right' is false and malicious propaganda spread by the SPLC, a hate group dedicated to defaming and thereby marginalizing voices that dissent from its hard-Left, globalist, internationalist line," Spencer said. "I am no more 'anti-Muslim' than foes of the Nazis were 'anti-German.' That any of our views are remotely controversial is a testimony to how corrupt and compromised you and your colleagues are."

David Horowitz, the founder of the project, said that he didn't remember Miller's involvement, but said that the two have known each other since Miller was in high school and that he recommended Miller to former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann (Miller worked as her press secretary). Asked how he thought Miller's views on Islam had evolved since he participated in the project, Horowitz said he didn't know, adding, "I know that he admires my work. As many normal people do."Monday’s Supreme Court ruling in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins appeared to break no new legal ground. A long line of prior cases had said that in order for a plaintiff to have legal standing to sue in federal court, the plaintiff must have suffered or be in danger of imminently suffering a “concrete and particularized injury.”

The lower court—the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit—had permitted Robins to proceed with his lawsuit charging that the people-search company Spokeo had provided users with inaccurate information about him in violation of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), because the data related to Robins. That suffices to show that the alleged injury is “particularized,” the Supreme Court said in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, but a plaintiff must also allege a “concrete” injury—and the dissemination of false information does not necessarily cause concrete injury. Accordingly, the Court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for consideration of the concreteness question.

What exactly is a “concrete” injury? As I explain below, the Spokeo opinion provides inadequate guidance on that question, and the guidance it does provide is highly problematic. The Court would do better to abandon the concreteness requirement, at least in cases, such as Spokeo, where one private party sues another.

The Concrete Injury Requirement

Modern standing doctrine is an inference from Article III of the Constitution, which limits federal courts to resolving “cases” and “controversies.” Although historical practice dating back to the George Washington administration justifies reading this language to forbid judges from giving purely advisory opinions, the case law limiting standing on the basis of the so-called case-or-controversy requirement developed only in the second half of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it is now firmly established that a plaintiff cannot come to federal court seeking relief without alleging a “concrete and particularized injury.”

There is not much dispute about what it means for an injury to be “particularized.” This requirement appears to be the converse of the prohibition on the litigation of “generalized grievances.” Suppose that I think that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee are setting interest rates too high to achieve the statutory goal of “maximum employment.” Nonetheless, I lack legal standing because my injury—low return on my stock portfolio, say—is not particular to me. The complaint is general, that is, shared with a broad swath of the public.

The Supreme Court agreed with the Ninth Circuit that the injury alleged by Robins was adequately particularized. Even though firms like Spokeo are legally forbidden from disseminating false information about anyone, the allegedly false information that is the basis for this lawsuit relates to Robins in particular. The fact that many others might also suffer particularized injuries of the same sort does not render the injury alleged by Robins a generalized grievance.

However, Justice Alito noted for the Court, a particularized injury is not necessarily a concrete one. What makes an injury concrete? Some of what the Court says about that question in Spokeo is unhelpful. We are told that the injury must be “de facto” and that “it must actually exist.” Okay, but what is the it that must actually exist?

From the rest of the opinion and prior cases, it appears that the Court means to distinguish between the set of things that can happen to or about someone and the subset of those things that can fairly be called “injuries.” Quoting language from an important 1992 case denying standing to environmentalists, the Court in Spokeo acknowledged that Congress may “elevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law.” However, the Court also reiterated an outer limit on that congressional power. Only de facto injuries can be so elevated.

In Spokeo, the Court said that the dissemination of some kinds of inaccurate information would not be injurious and thus could not be the basis for a suit under the FCRA. Justice Alito gave the example of “an incorrect zip code. It is difficult to imagine,” he said, “how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code, without more, could work any concrete harm.”

Confusing Standing With the Merits

But is it really that difficult to imagine that an incorrect zip code would cause harm? Robins alleged that prospective employers use information they obtain from Spokeo and similar firms in making hiring decisions. A firm that relied on an address from Spokeo to send notices to prospective employees with incorrectly listed zip codes could surely harm those prospective employees, because they would lose out on employment opportunities if the notices never reached them.

Moreover, as Justice Ginsburg noted in dissent, Robins did not simply allege generally incorrect information. He alleged that Spokeo erroneously listed him as married with children and financially well off. Each of these errors could have cost him an employment opportunity: the erroneously listed family ties would dissuade prospective employers from offering jobs requiring relocation and the erroneous financial claim would dissuade prospective employers from considering Robins for low-paying jobs.

The majority decision in Spokeo leaves open the possibility that on remand the lower courts could find that these or other factors entail that Robins actually did suffer a concrete injury in virtue of the dissemination of false information about him, but it is not at all clear why he should have to make such a showing as a threshold for bringing suit—rather than as part of his damages case if he establishes liability. Why does the Court think that the mere dissemination of false information about someone cannot be an injury?

The Court in Spokeo says that in defining the outer limits of what counts as an injury, “both history and the judgment of Congress play important roles.” But Congress in enacting the FCRA made clear that it thinks that disseminating false information about someone is itself injurious. Thus, the Court, in overriding that judgment, is saying that in this case history plays the decisive role.

But again, why? The Court says it looks to the common law for the outlines of the sorts of claims that can be deemed injurious. However, the common law did not include a concept of injury. The relevant question at common law was simply whether the plaintiff had a valid cause of action—i.e., a valid substantive claim. In looking to the common law for the boundaries of injuries that Congress may recognize, the Court thus appears to confuse the threshold standing question with the different question of substantive liability.

No one doubts that the common law would not have provided a remedy for the mere dissemination of false information. Under the traditional common law in England and the United States, a plaintiff seeking damages for defamation had to prove both that the defendant made a false statement about the plaintiff and that the false statement damaged the plaintiff’s reputation. But legislatures can alter the common law.

Separation of Powers

The Constitution undoubtedly limits the ability of Congress to alter the common law. In altering the common law—which is state law—Congress must exercise one of its enumerated powers (such as the Article I power to regulate interstate commerce). And a federal statute altering the common law must not violate the Bill of Rights (as it would violate the First Amendment if it permitted defamation liability too readily). But the majority in Spokeo appears to be saying that Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement limits the ability of Congress to alter the common law. That is a strange interpretation of a constitutional provision regarding the jurisdiction of the federal courts.

What, then, is the Court up to? Perhaps the best explanation for the ruling in Spokeo is that the justices forgot why they articulated limits on congressional power to expand standing in the first place. In the leading cases questioning the power of Congress to confer standing on persons who had not, in the Court’s judgment, suffered a sufficiently concrete injury, a private party sued a government official, alleging that the latter had violated a non-discretionary duty to bring an enforcement action against some third party (such as a polluter). The Court’s reluctance to permit such cases to go forward was rooted in separation of powers. Article II gives the president the duty to execute the law. Congressional authorization of private lawsuits to compel enforcement could thus be seen as an effort to shift power from the president to Congress. Accordingly, prior standing cases expressly invoke separation of powers.

Yet standing doctrine is at best an awkward tool to limit congressional aggrandizement of its power relative to the president. After all, asking whether some particular plaintiff has suffered a “concrete injury” is not the most direct means of measuring the ebb and flow of power between the branches. But at least in cases in which plaintiffs seek to compel executive enforcement of the law, there is a reason for the courts to limit Congress’s power.

By contrast, as Justice Clarence Thomas suggests in a concurrence in Spokeo, the separation-of-powers concern is largely absent where Congress authorizes one set of private parties to sue another set of private parties. In a case like Spokeo, the substitution of judicial judgment for congressional judgment about what constitutes a private wrong is simply misguided.Slate Plus members get extended, ad-free episodes of Slate ’s Mom and Dad Are Fighting every week.

The threat landscape is challenging for signature-based detection with an ever-increasing number of threats and the shortened duration time for the effectiveness of a single signature variation.

Because of these difficulties, complements to signature-based detection, such as heuristic-based scanning, sandboxing and/or multi-scanning (scanning for threats with multiple anti-malware engines) are needed to more effectively address modern risks. In this post, we look at the pros and cons of both heuristic-based scanning, which is used alongside signature-based detection in multi-scanning solutions to increase detection rates, and sandboxing.

Introduction to Heuristic-based Scanning

As opposed to signature-based scanning, which looks to match signatures found in files with that of a database of known malware, heuristic scanning uses rules and/or algorithms to look for commands which may indicate malicious intent. By using this method, some heuristic scanning methods are able to detect malware without needing a signature. This is why most antivirus programs use both signature and heuristic-based methods in combination, in order to catch any malware that may try to evade detection.

Benefits of Heuristic Scanning

Heuristic scanning is usually much faster than sandboxing because it does not execute the file and then wait to record its behavior, with the exception of some emulation-based techniques .

Vendors can change the rules in their heuristic engines with their daily update packages based on new threat vectors without the details being known to malicious actors.

Does not give away details on how malware is flagged (unlike sandboxing), so malware authors will not be aware of what they need to change in order to evade detection.

Heuristic scanning is able to detect malware that can evade sandbox detection through blind spots targeted by malware authors.

Limitations of Heuristic Scanning

When scanning a sample, the information found is generally limited to the threat name.

Because the engines are looking for specific pieces of code which indicate a malicious action, it can lead to two possible limitations: If the vendor has not built detection for a particular action, then the malware will evade detection. If the malicious action is obfuscated successfully (e.g. within an encrypted file), it will evade detection.

Some of the older methods of heuristic-based scanning have a higher propensity for reporting false positives because they are looking for a wide range of actions that could indicate a potentially malicious file. However, newer methods of heuristic scanning such as generic detection produce false positives less frequently. Generic detection works by looking for features or behaviors that are commonly seen for known threats.



Introduction to Sandboxing

Sandboxes consist of some sort of purpose-built environment, usually virtualized (in some cases physical), where the potentially malicious files are executed and their behavior is recorded. The recorded behavior is then analyzed automatically through a weights system in the sandbox and/or manually by a malware analyst. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether the file is malicious and if it is, what exactly the file does.

Benefits of Sandboxing

Because sandboxing actually opens the file being analyzed, it is able to see in detail exactly what that file will do in that particular environment.

Instead of a binary yes/no and threat name, most sandboxes offer reporting with details on the behavior recorded. In addition to providing more information on how to classify the file, this method can be particularly useful in an incident response environment in order to identify exactly what the intention of the file was, in order to understand what the effects are.

Though it varies by product, many offer the ability to create a highly customized environment. For example, a piece of malware that is designed to only fully execute on a particular user’s machine can be replicated.

Limitations of Sandboxing

Because of the visibility to their methodology and customization that is available in commercial sandboxes, malware creators can build specific behaviors to get around detection. This includes two key categories: “Sandbox aware” malware which is able to tell it is being executed in a sandbox and will act differently in order to not be flagged as malicious. This may be as simple as not running on any virtual machine, or something more advanced looking for signs specific to a sandbox. Blind spots will vary based on the product, but in some cases malware creators have created pathways to act maliciously in ways which cannot be detected by the sensors of a particular sandbox.

There needs to be an environment to execute the sample and the time necessary to collect full reports, particularly if trying to accommodate stalled code execution, it takes both a large amount of time and hardware resources to process a given sample, causing relatively low throughput.

While the industry trend is towards automated sandboxes, many still only provide the raw data on behavior of the malware and it is necessary to either build a custom application to interpret the information, or have a malware analyst manually review the information.

Due to the overhead time in running them, many sandboxes are optionally or completely cloud-based, which renders sensitive files as unusable.

As detailed above, sandboxing does have its limitations. We recommend using sandboxing in combination with other methods, like multi-scanning, to increase malware detection rates.

Conclusion

Both heuristic-based scanning and sandboxing present unique strengths and weaknesses, and for different situations one scanning method may be more appropriate than the other. The best security comes from utilizing both methods simultaneously in order to minimize the number of samples which may be able to evade detection. Multi-scanning (scanning with multiple anti-malware engines) to take advantage of the differing heuristic algorithms of many scan engines.

As proof of the benefits of using many scan engines for a layered approach, we took at look at our cloud-based multi-scanning solution, Metadefender Cloud, which is powered by anti-malware engines that use both heuristic and signature-based methods to detect threats.

Top searched for threats on Metadefender Cloud's statistics page

By looking at the statistics page results above, you can see that the percentage of threats detected increases as more anti-malware engines are added. Metadefender Core 4, which includes 4 anti-malware engines, detected 89.41% of the top 10,000 threats compared to Metadefender Core 20 plus 13 custom engines, which detected 99.88% of the same threats. The statistics page highlights the value of multi-scanning; every engine has different strengths and weaknesses, so the more engines you have, the greater the chance of detecting threats.

Mike Pence.

"We're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS," Trump said in the interview with CBS' Lesley Stahl, which aired on "60 Minutes" Sunday night.

"I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there," he said.

Trump added: "We're going to have surrounding states and, very importantly, get NATO involved because we support NATO far more than we should, frankly, because you have a lot of countries that aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing. We have to wipe out ISIS."

The interview -- featuring Trump and Pence side-by-side for the first time -- comes the week the Republican National Convention in Cleveland is set to nominate the two to face Hillary Clinton in the general election.

Trump tweeted on Sunday, "We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching."

Trump also laid the blame for the rise of ISIS at the feet of Clinton -- who was President Barack Obama's secretary of state during his first four years in office.

"Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies. She is responsible for ISIS. She led Barack Obama -- because I don't think he knew anything; I think he relied on her," Trump said. "As Bernie Sanders said, 'Her judgment is so bad.' She's got bad judgment. She's got bad instincts."

Pence criticized Obama and Clinton, saying the two have "led from behind."

"The larger issue here is declining American power in the world," he said. "I truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil. And whether it be the horrific attack in France, the inspired attacks here in the United States, the instability in Turkey that led to a coup -- I think that is all a result of a foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that has led from behind and that has sent an inexact, unclear message, about American resolve."

Picking a running mate

In the interview, Trump also said he didn't expect Pence to campaign in a similar manner to his brash, confrontational style.

"We're different people," Trump said. "I understand that."

Pence also said he would be comfortable disagreeing with Trump.

"I promise you that when the circumstances arise where I have a difference on policy or on presentation ... I would have no hesitation, were I privileged to be Vice President, to walk into the President's office, close the door, and share my heart," Pence said. "And I also know this good man would listen, and has -- and has the leadership qualities to draw from the people around him."

Trump also gave more insight into how he made up his mind in picking Pence, saying "a lot of people" were campaigning to him for the job.

"(People) that called me and came to me and wanted it badly," Trump said. "And you know, the press didn't report that. The press said, 'Well, maybe he's having a hard time picking.'"

The mogul said he brought up the idea to Pence, saying he got to know the governor during the Indiana primary. Pence endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ahead of that race.

"I did very well in Indiana, like I did just about everywhere else in all fairness," Trump said. "I got to know him very well and I gained great respect for him. And I looked at the numbers. ... Unemployment? What a great job he did. Jobs? What a great job he did. Triple-A rating on his bonds."

Trump said Pence thought about being considered for "about two seconds" before calling back and saying he was interested. He said he picked Pence not to win Indiana, which he expected to win anyway, but for his individual "quality."

"I'm an outsider. I am a person that used to be establishment when I'd give them hundreds of thousands of dollars. But when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment because I understand the system," Trump said. "He's very establishment, in many ways, and that's not a bad thing. ... He has helped bring the party together."

Disagreement

The interview also highlighted plenty of areas the two candidates diverge.

On trade, the Iraq War, preventing foreign Muslims from entering the country temporarily, and waterboarding, Pence and Trump were pressed on the divergence in their past positions.

Pence did his best to present a united front.

"I don't think we should ever tell our enemy what our tactics are," Pence said when pressed on Trump's support of waterboarding, for example. "What I'm okay with is protecting the American people."

On his vote in favor of the Iraq War, Trump said he'd let that slide.

"Many people have, and frankly, I'm one of the few that was right on Iraq," Trump said. "He's entitled to make a mistake every once in a while."

But he stuck by his criticism of Clinton for the same reason: "But she's not."

Proposed Muslim ban explained

In the interview Trump also explained for the first time in his own words where he now stands on the Muslim ban he proposed in December.

Trump's aides have suggested that he has modified his proposal from a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," to only banning individuals from terror states.

Trump was most recently asked about this in Scotland where he wasn't specific on where exactly he stood on the issue.

In the interview Trump said he doesn't intend to ban all Muslims, but instead from certain countries.

"There are territories and terror states and terror nations that we're not going to allow the people to come into our country. And we're going to have a thing called 'extreme vetting.'"The One Percent

Trump’s supporters have long wondered whether he’d use billionaire sicko Jeffrey Epstein as ammo against the Clintons—until a lurid new lawsuit accused The Donald of raping one of Epstein’s girls himself.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect the withdrawal of Virginia Roberts Guiffre's allegations against Alan Dershowitz and the striking of the allegations from the court record by a federal judge.

For Jeffrey Epstein and his famous friends, the Aughts were a simpler time, when the businessmen, academics, and celebrities who counted themselves among the playboy philanthropist’s inner circle could freely enjoy the fruits of his extreme wealth and connections.

Epstein’s little black book and flight logs read like a virtual Who’s Who: Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Larry Summers, Kevin Spacey, Prince Andrew, and Naomi Campbell all hitched rides on Epstein’s private planes. Socialites and distinguished scientists went to visit Epstein’s island in St. Thomas, and cavorted at epic dinner parties at his palatial townhouse—then the largest privately owned residence in New York, as he liked to brag . There, they picked at elaborate meals catered by celebrity chefs like Rocco DiSpirito, marvelled at Epstein’s opulent decor, and noted the pack of very, very young model-types with whom Epstein always seemed to surround himself.

But a darker story was going on underneath the glamour. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting sex from an underage girl and quietly paid settlements to scores of alleged victims who said he serially molested them. But the girls kept coming out of the woodwork—in 2014, another young woman filed a lawsuit claiming that Epstein used her as a sex slave for his powerful friends—and that she’d been at parties on his private island with former President Clinton.

And just last week, yet another “Jane Doe” filed a suit in New York accusing Epstein and Donald Trump of raping her at a series of sex parties when she was only 13.

Trump has denied Jane Doe’s claims and his reps have said he barely knew Epstein—even though New York media in the ’90s regularly chronicled his comings-and-goings at Epstein’s Upper East Side palace, and even though Epstein had 14 private numbers for Trump and his family in his little black book. Meanwhile, Bill and Hillary Clinton have remained mum about their ties to the Palm Beach pedophile—despite evidence that shows Bill was one of the most famous and frequent passengers on Epstein’s “Lolita Express ” and that Epstein donated money to the Clinton Foundation even after his conviction.

For months, talking heads have wondered whether Trump would use Epstein and his girls as a weapon against Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Now, with the latest federal lawsuit against Trump himself, it seems the notorious financier has become a serious liability for both campaigns.

***

Less than a year before Florida police began investigating Jeffrey Epstein for the alleged rape and abuse of scores of young girls, the questionable billionaire responded to a call on Edge —an online club where navel-gazing intellectuals and academics meet to pose questions to one another—for a “bit of wisdom, some rule of nature... that you’ve noticed in the universe that might as well be named after you.”

“Epstein’s First Law,” he wrote, “Know when you are winning.”

“Epstein’s Second Law: The key question is not what can I gain but what do I have to lose.”

What the 63-year-old Ralph Lauren lookalike had to lose was his perverted double life. According to law-enforcement officials and alleged victims, between the years 1998 and 2007—and possibly even earlier—he ran a particularly vile pyramid scheme that involved paying minors around $200 at a time to perform sexual massages nearly every day and then recruit even younger girls to do the same. (“The more you do, the more you are paid,” one said .) During these massages, girls as young as 13 told police they were instructed to get undressed. Epstein would masturbate or penetrate them, they said —with his finger, or a vibrator, or his allegedly egg-shaped penis .

By the time Epstein was arrested in 2008, police in Palm Beach County, Florida, had already spent months monitoring his movements, rifling through his trash, and interviewing potential victims and witnesses. Police reported to prosecutors that they had gathered enough evidence to charge the money manager with several felonies: lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Epstein’s freedom, his wealth, his little black book full of famous folk—including princes, presidents, and prime ministers—all were seemingly at stake.

So Epstein did what the mega-rich do in these situations: hired star attorneys Gerald Lefcourt and Alan Dershowitz, who defended their client vigorously , reportedly having witnesses followed and discrediting the alleged victims by offering their MySpace pages as evidence of supposed drug use and scandalous behavior.

Prosecutors said Epstein’s dream team made successful prosecution unlikely. “Our judgment in this case, based on the evidence known at the time, was that it was better to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex offender, and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial with a reduced likelihood of success,” U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta explained in a 2011 letter.

And so, despite a decade of alleged serial sexual abuse and rape of an unknowable number of girls, some as many as 100 times according to court filings, the notoriously secretive financier was offered a deal. For the alleged systematic victimization of young girls—most of whom were plucked by Epstein’s assistants from Palm Beach’s poorer neighborhoods and groomed to adore or acquiesce to him—he was slapped with a 2008 conviction on a single charge of soliciting a minor ; and sentenced to an 18-month stay in a Palm Beach county jail—of which he served only 13 months and was allowed to leave six days out of every week for “work release.” He also agreed to a few dozen confidential, out-of-court payoffs to his accusers, the most recent of which was finalized in 2011.

Epstein’s “potential co-conspirators,” as the U.S. Attorney called them—women who allegedly procured girls for Epstein—also received immunity from prosecution as a condition of the 2007 agreement that enraged the local police force for its leniency. As of 2015, according to The Guardian , two of these women had changed their names, and were operating businesses out of a building owned by Epstein’s brother, where it was alleged in court documents that Epstein had housed young women.

From his plush perch, Epstein continues to dismiss any notions that he should be viewed as the child rapist that victims and Florida police say he is.

“I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an ‘offender,’” he told the New York Post in 2011, shortly after a New York judge classified him as a level 3 offender, or “a threat to public safety.”

“It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel,” Epstein said .

But for the wealthy and famous in Epstein’s orbit, his conviction has meant suspicion by association.

In December 2014, just as the Palm Beach lawsuits were winding down, another alleged victim emerged and her claims were salacious: Epstein, she said, had loaned her out as an underage sex slave to his famous friends—including Britain’s Prince Andrew and Epstein defense attorney Dershowitz (both men denied the charges). Coming forward in Britain’s Daily Mail in 2011, Virginia Roberts Guiffre—called Jane Doe #3 in a related lawsuit (PDF)—claimed that Epstein and his “girlfriend,” alleged madame Ghislaine Maxwell, forced her to have sex with the pair’s powerful pals and gather intel that Epstein could later use. In court documents, Guiffre testified, “Epstein and Maxwell also told me that they wanted me to produce things for them in addition to performing sex on the men. They told me to pay attention to the details about what the men wanted so I could report back to them.”

Guiffre noted that Epstein appeared to be collecting information on Prince Andrew—particularly on his alleged foot fetish—and claimed, “Epstein also trafficked me for sexual purposes to other powerful men, including politicians and powerful business executives. Epstein required me to describe the sexual events I had with these men presumably so that he could potentially blackmail them. I am still very fearful of these men today.”

A judge threw out Guiffre’s motion in 2015, but Guiffre stands by her claims and is suing Ghislaine Maxwell, whom she claims acted as Epstein’s madam.

Meanwhile, the men named by Guiffre seem eager for her to go away. “It’s as if I’ve been waterboarded for 15 months,” Dershowitz told the Boston Globe after the settlement of a defamation case related to Guiffre’s claims. “This has taken a terrible toll on my family, on my friends…” Buckingham Palace has also denied the allegations against Prince Andrew, calling them “categorically untrue.” UPDATE: This April, Giuffre's lawyers withdrew her allegations against Dershowitz and said that it was a "mistake" to have filed the accusations in the first place. A federal judge later struck her allegations against Dershowitz from the court record. At Dershowitz's request, Louis Freeh, the former head of the FBI, also conducted an independent investigation of her claims and published a statement noting, "Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct against Professor Dershowitz."

In her lawsuit, Guiffre had claimed that during trips to Epstein’s private island, she'd also encountered another very famous person: former President Bill Clinton. Guiffre alleges the former U.S. president visited Epstein’s “Orgy Island” when there were underage girls present, but added that she never had sex with him and never saw him have sex with any of the young women.

Still, it’s these sorts of allegations that have journalists and Clinton-haters circling. Just last month, pundits on MSNBC’s Morning Joe were speculating about Bill Clinton’s oft-discussed friendship with Epstein and whether it would be the go-to play for a Trump campaign looking to combat Hillary Clinton’s claims that Trump is bad for women .

Requests for comment to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Clinton Foundation were not returned.

The former president, who flew on the “The Lolita Express” at least 26 times from 2001 to 2003, has never addressed his ties with Epstein, a onetime major Democratic donor, according to Federal Election Commission records, who also gave millions to the Clinton Foundation even after his arrest for abusing underage girls. “I invest in people—be it politics or science. It’s what I do,” Epstein has reportedly said to friends.

“There’s a 100 percent chance [Trump] is going there,” said former McCain strategist Steve Schmidt on Morning Joe, referring to Clinton’s friendship with the pervy moneyman.

***

Still, Trump may not want to actually “go there” in light of the new federal lawsuit against him.

Just last week, Trump’s own connections to Epstein made headlines when a Jane Doe claimed that the presumptive Republican nominee and his financier pal raped her on several occasions when she was 13 years old.

The allegations are explosive. And the circumstances surrounding them are very, very strange.

According to the complaint , filed in a Manhattan federal court, one of Epstein’s assistants approached Jane Doe as she waited for a bus at the New York Port Authority terminal and offered the teenager money and contacts that could lead to a modeling contract if she came to a party at Epstein’s house. Jane Doe says she attended several parties at Epstein’s Upper East Side mansion, and supposedly had sexual contact with Donald Trump at four of them. The fourth and final time she attended a party with Trump, she alleges he tied her to a bed with pantyhose, raped her, then beat her and threatened to kill her and her family if she told a soul.

This is the second time the woman has brought a suit against Trump and Epstein. The first, which she filed herself this April in California using the name Katie Johnson, was dismissed for failure to bring a claim under the civil-rights law under which she had filed suit. Calls to the phone number listed on the original suit were never answered, with no way to leave a voicemail. The plaintiff’s reported address in Twentynine Palms was a one-bedroom, one-bath home belonging to 72-year-old David Stacey, who had died on Oct. 9, and public records show no evidence of a Katie Johnson living at the property. Neighbors told RadarOnline that squatters had overrun the home while Stacey was hospitalized, and a real-estate agent reported the home had been turned over to the bank by April.

“The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated,” Trump told RadarOnline , responding to the original lawsuit. “There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.”

The new complaint charges that Trump’s denial amounts to defamation. This time, Johnson also has a declaration from a woman who claims to be a corroborating witness, known in the suit as Tiffany Doe . According to her statement, Tiffany was 22 when she lured Johnson to Epstein’s home and witnessed Johnson’s alleged rape firsthand.

Johnson has a number of non-anonymous supporters, though it’s a cast of characters who do little to allay Trump’s assertion that her claim was brought solely to influence the election.

According to a lengthy article on the site Jezebel , some eight months before Johnson filed her California lawsuit against Epstein and Trump, a man named Al Taylor—who claimed to be the “PR person” for something called the Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas—reached out to a reporter at Gawker to shop a video recording of Johnson and her rape story. Taylor, who identified himself to The Daily Beast as “a friend” to Johnson, claims to have met her at a party where she revealed her alleged childhood assault by Trump. In a video published in part on Jezebel , a woman claiming to be Katie Johnson appears—wearing a blond wig, her face pixelated and her voice disguised. In it, she details the allegations of rape.

When The Daily Beast asked Taylor for a copy of the video, Taylor suggested it was still for sale. “I heard it would be worth $1 million,” Taylor said, claiming the proceeds from the sale would go to Johnson’s protection.

“We’ve got her in hiding,” he said.

Taylor has coincidentally been the subject of Epstein-related news before. In 2011, Taylor, at first freelance producing for The Jerry Springer Show then working alone, claimed to have made a million-dollar deal with Casey Anthony for an interview after the Florida woman’s acquittal in the murder of her 2-year-old daughter. When the interview didn’t happen, Taylor retained the services of Spencer Kuvin , a Palm Beach lawyer who also represented three Epstein victims. Taylor says he met Kuvin during an attempt to interview his Epstein clients. They settled with Epstein out of court and declined to be interviewed by Taylor.

But Taylor wasn’t the only party working to get the tape and Katie Johnson’s story to the media. According to Jezebel, Steve Baer, described in National Review as “a conservative activist and major, if secretive, donor to the conservative movement,” lobbied their reporter to publish Johnson’s claims. Baer is also, according to Jezebel, the father of Chandler Smith, an Ohio woman who happens to be the co-founder of an organization called Vote Trump Get Dumped , a campaign that urges ladies to withhold sex from Trump supporters. “Until Trump is defeated, we don’t date, sleep with, or canoodle with Trump supporters,” the group’s manifesto reads.

When Johnson’s case was thrown out in California, Taylor says he began looking for an attorney to file a new case for his “friend.” They approached Brad Edwards, the lawyer who has represented a number of Epstein victims through settlements—and who is now representing Virginia Roberts Guiffre in her claim against Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell as well as four alleged victims in the case against the federal government.

“I will say I’ve never represented [Johnson] and I won’t be representing her,” Edwards told The Daily Beast.

Edwards couldn’t comment on the conversations he had with Johnson or her representatives, citing attorney-client privilege. Concerning Trump’s involvement in Epstein’s illicit affairs, Edwards said he hadn’t seen any evidence that would implicate the GOP nominee and described Trump as “extremely helpful and honest,” during questioning.

When Edwards declined to take the case, Taylor told the website GossipExtra they were shopping for representation. That’s how Johnson’s current attorney, Tom Meagher, says he found his client.

Meagher is a patent attorney in New Jersey who openly admits, “I've never taken on accusations like this,” but says he was drawn to Johnson’s story and believes her “100 percent.” In an effort to get media attention for Johnson’s case, Meagher attended a May fundraiser in Lawrenceville, New Jersey—thrown to pay off the debt incurred by Chris Christie’s failed presidential campaign, and one at which Donald Trump spoke. Described as “a protester” by a local reporter , Meagher confirms he was removed by security after holding up a sign that read: “Ask Trump About Katie Johnson.”

“I don’t have a view on the race,” Meagher now tells The Daily Beast. “I did before the matter, but now I’m apolitical so I can focus on my client.”

Concerning the timing of the lawsuit, Meagher says: “Of course, she does not want her rapist to be president.”

Despite several requests, The Daily Beast was not able to speak with Katie Johnson or Tiffany Doe. When asked whether any evidence of their claims existed outside of the Doe declarations, Taylor said Tiffany kept a journal of Epstein contacts. “She has all the goods,” Taylor said, but would not elaborate and said future names would only be released in response to a scandal on par with Donald Trump’s political ascent.

But Mike Fisten, a retired Miami-Dade homicide detective who worked as a private investigator in several Epstein-related cases, is skeptical about the new claims.

Fisten says Epstein had in effect two lives: “a business life and deviant pedphile life.” To find out which friends were involved in which life, Fisten carried a book with photos of Epstein’s contacts. In hundreds of interviews with hundreds of witnesses, he said no one has ever identified Trump as being involved in any kind of sexual activity with underage girls. In fact, Fisten recalls learning in the early 2000s that members of Trump’s private Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, complained that Epstein was often accompanied by very young girls–“a different girl every week”—each of whom he would refer to as “his niece.” Fisten says he offered to look at Tiffany Doe’s book to vet her free of charge, but Taylor and Meagher declined.

Emails to the Trump Organization and the campaign for this story were not returned, but Trump’s attorney Alan Garten has repeatedly denied any relationship between his client and Epstein, other than Epstein’s Mar-a-Lago membership.

Still, it’s clear that Trump’s association with Epstein runs deeper than just pool days at Mar-a-Lago.

“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump told New York Magazine in 2002. Calling him a “terrific guy,” Trump continued, “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

According to a 2003 profile in Vanity Fair and New York gossip rags that covered the goings-on of Epstein and his famous friends in the late ’90s, Trump would attend dinner parties at the 71st Street mansion. In April 1999, The Mail spotted Trump among the guests at a dinner Epstein threw in honor of Prince Andrew. In 2000, they reported he attended a “hookers and pimps” Halloween party. New York magazine reported Trump’s attendance at a 2003 dinner party thrown in honor of Bill Clinton. Magician David Blaine entertained the “barely clad models” with card tricks, but Clinton never appeared.

“I often see Donald Trump and there are loads of models coming and going, mostly at night,” a neighbor told The Mail on Sunday in 2000.

Then there is the black book , in which Epstein lists 14 phone numbers for Trump, including ones for his future wife Melania. Police evidence shows Trump has called Epstein , flown on Epstein’s plane, and eaten in Epstein’s Florida home.

Garten did not return a request for comment on these connections.

“Mr. Trump’s only connection with Mr. Epstein was that Mr. Epstein was one of thousands of people who has visited Mar-a-Lago,” the Trump attorney told a BuzzFeed reporter in 2015. “That’s it. Mr. Trump has NEVER been accused of having any involvement or even having any knowledge of any of Mr. Epstein’s conduct by anyone.”

That was true until last week. And while the media has been hesitant to report on Katie Johnson’s accusations, stories have emerged in recent days in outlets like the New York Daily News and Gothamist and more may be in the works: Johnson’s attorney says he taped an interview with ABC News and sources spoken to for this story said they had been contacted by other national news organizations.Lisa Larson-Walker

In the days after Donald Trump signed his executive order on immigration, it became clear that Customs and Border Protection officers were not all complying with court decisions limiting the order’s application. How lawless were the actions of these CBP officers? A new complaint, compiled by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the Kathryn O. Greenberg Immigration Justice Clinic at Cardozo School of Law, provides a disturbing answer.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.

The complaint, which was sent to the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, contains 26 declarations and affidavits from immigrants and the attorneys who tried to represent them. Their stories range from disconcerting to shocking. According to these testimonials, CBP officers violated immigrants’ rights, contravened multiple court orders, and acted with reckless disregard to the law. The declarations and affidavits allege that elderly immigrants were denied access to food, that lawful immigrants were forced to sign forms they didn’t understand, and that infants were held for no reason. Multiple people were allegedly deported after judges had forbidden such deportations, and others were allegedly denied access to counsel after judges had required that such access be granted.

Here are summaries of some of the most striking allegations from these declarations and affidavits. You can read the entire complaint here.

Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor who was returning from a brief trip to Saudi Arabia to visit her family, says she was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport for more than 10 hours. Upon her arrival at JFK, Abushamma said, “CBP agents confiscated my passport and threatened to take away my phone. I was not told why my passport was being held and I received no information about how long I would be detained.” She says she “[was] never permitted to speak on the phone with my lawyers while in CBP custody despite my initial and subsequent requests to do so. … [CBP] Agent Lam told me that the only way I was going to leave detention was if I signed a form to return to Saudi Arabia—the country I had flown in from. He showed me a document and told me that I should sign it. I was not allowed to call my lawyer or ask questions about what was in the document.”



“I again told Agent Lam and his supervisor that there were attorneys who were working on my behalf,” Abushamma continued. “I repeatedly begged Agent Lam and his supervisor to give me more time. Agent Lam’s supervisor then told me that an order that would allow me to stay in the United States would need to come from the Supreme Court, and that this would not happen. They told me that my lawyers could not do anything to help me in my situation and so I should just sign the form.”



According to Abushamma, the CBP agent also said that “if I did not sign the form right away, it would mean that I had chosen to be forcibly removed from the United States, and that I would be forced onto the plane anyway, but would then be banned from the United States for five years. … I was so scared. Without being allowed to speak to my attorney on the phone despite my repeated requests, and because of all the negative consequences that Agent Lam had told me would occur if I did not sign the form, and feeling like I had no choice, I signed the form.”



Abushamma says she was given food, and permission to call her family, only after she signed the form. She was subsequently deported to Saudi Arabia.

An Iranian citizen with a family-based immigrant visa, whose son is a U.S. citizen, says he was detained at Los Angeles International Airport for 18 hours. According to his niece, he was not given food or a place to sleep during this entire period. He was asked to sign a document written in English—a language he does not understand—and told that the document said he was leaving the United States voluntarily. He refused to sign it but was then told he had to. He also refused to get on a plane to Dubai; U.S. officials had to physically carry him on. He is now terrified of being returned to Iran for fear of government retaliation.

After a federal judge ordered CBP to let detainees at Washington Dulles International Airport speak to lawyers, attorney Ofelia Lee Calderón attempted to speak to two lawful permanent resident clients who were stranded at the airport. She says that a CBP agent told her there was no right to counsel in the airport and asked Calderón to leave. When she returned later, another officer refused to give her any information about her clients. She eventually learned that her clients had been detained and handcuffed by CBP, forced to sign forms relinquishing their lawful permanent resident status, and sent to Ethiopia. At no point were they allowed access to counsel.

At Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, CBP officers reportedly detained an elderly Sudanese woman suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure, and severe kidney stones. They refused to provide her attorney or her family with any information on her health, status, or whereabouts. Her attorney later learned that CBP officers had demanded that his client withdraw her request for admission into the United States or be barred from entering the country for five years. She signed the document and was promptly deported. Her family never got to see her.

Also at DFW, CBP agents allegedly detained a lawful permanent resident along with her 11-month-old daughter, a U.S. citizen. They refused to let attorneys speak with the mother. When the child’s father came to the CBP office, agents refused to let him see his daughter.

CBP officers at Los Angeles International Airport allegedly deported an Iranian student 90 minutes after a federal judge explicitly barred the deportation of anyone targeted by Trump’s order. They ignored efforts by attorneys to halt the deportation.

CBP officers at San Francisco International Airport allegedly detained an elderly Iranian couple with valid visitor visas for 30 hours. Nineteen of those hours came after a federal judge halted deportations under Trump’s order. One officer informed the couple’s attorney that they might soon be deported. When the attorney explained that this action would violate a federal court order, the officer responded that he was “just following orders.”

An elderly Iranian couple—both of whom were lawful permanent residents—say they were detained for 10 hours at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after returning from their son’s wedding in Iran. The two were denied access to food for the length of their detention. Another elderly person being detained along with the couple was shaking from hunger and nearly passed out. CBP officers refused to inform the couple’s immediate family whether the couple had been allowed to take necessary medications.

At Dulles, attorneys say they repeatedly approached CBP officers with a paper copy of the federal court order requiring that they be allowed to speak to their detained clients. Officers continued to refuse access “on CBP orders.”Screenshot from Hulu

Melissa McCarthy’s devastatingly specific portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer struck a nerve. First, on Super Bowl Sunday, Spicer whined about Saturday Night Live being too “mean” and said that McCarthy needed to “dial back.” Then, Monday night, a Politico article outlined how the White House responded internally—short version: not well—to the sketch. One detail in the report particularly resonated: that Trump was most upset by the fact that Spicer was played by a woman.

Now that we know Trump has a particular hang-up about seeing his staffers portrayed by female comedians, which he allegedly thinks makes them “look weak,” we decided to double down. Twitter has already lit upon one great idea: having Trump archnemesis Rosie O’Donnell play Steve Bannon, who is currently depicted as the Grim Reaper on SNL. Here are 12 actress who should portray the rest of Trump’s inner circle. It seems fitting for an increasingly unfunny presidency that many of these women aren’t even comedians at all.

Margo Martindale as Rex Tillerson (Secretary of State)

Frederic J. Brown/Getty Images and Ben Stansall/Getty Images

Most notably with her Emmy-winning Justified turn, Margo Martindale has demonstrated a real knack for playing opportunistic, slightly sinister power players with a thick Texan drawl. She’ll slip easily into the shoes of Mr. Tillerson, an oil tycoon of similarly villainous mien.

Sarah Silverman as Steve Mnuchin (Secretary of the Treasury)

Mike Windle/Getty Images and Kena Betancur/Getty Images

Former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin is in the uncomfortable position, as a Jewish person, of repping an administration that has already begun dabbling in anti-Semitism and neo-Nazi propaganda. Sarah Silverman, a virtuoso at mining her own Jewishness for comedy, could brilliantly highlight the tension here—and as a passionate Bernie supporter, she’d be the perfect person to skewer Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties, too.

Laurie Metcalf as Reince Priebus (Chief of Staff)

Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images and Mark Wilson/Getty Images

As Reince Priebus finds himself on the outs with Trump’s inner circle, rattled by a Game of Thrones-level power struggle, it’s fun to picture the Chief of Staff—just as reports have depicted him in the past—nearly losing his mind and getting a little unhinged. Laurie Metcalf’s bug-eyed, frantic energy—showcased most recently in HBO’s Getting On—would be a great comedic match for Preibus.

Jessica Lange as Jeff Sessions (Attorney General)

Mike Coppola/Getty Images and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The portrayer of Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama Senator with a transparently racist record, needs to be a chameleon, an actress with the ability to seethe and charm both convincingly and extravagantly. Ryan Murphy muse Jessica Lange gets the call.

Niecy Nash as Ben Carson (Secretary of Housing and Urban Development)

Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images and Ethan Miller/Getty Images

Truthfully, there’s likely no comic who can go more bizarre than Ben Carson himself (though Jay Pharoah came pretty close). Yet the versatile, wildly funny Niecy Nash would at minimum take the character in a fascinating direction. She’s skilled in comedy that’s broad, subtle, and strange—each necessary for a solid Carson impersonation—and she’s particularly well-versed in the performance of clueless authority.

Kathy Bates as Sonny Perdue (Secretary of Agriculture)

Emma McIntyre/Getty Images and A. Messerschmidt/Getty Images

Sonny Perdue served as Governor of Georgia for eight years before transitioning to Trump’s cabinet. One of the less controversial picks on this list (not that that’s saying much), he’s a fairly well-liked, run-of-the-mill Southern conservative who gets by on charm. Kathy Bates, with her proven comic range and booming affability, is a natural fit.

Catherine O’Hara as Tom Price (Secretary of Health and Human Services)

Rich Polk/Getty Images and Mark Wilson/Getty Images

Tom Price tries to hide a lot behind that “modest smile” of his, but it barely masks his ethically compromised character. Catherine O’Hara’s ability to deftly balance chipperness and distress could take the image of Price contently lying under oath to a wonderful, unsettling extreme.

Amy Poehler as Rick Perry (Secretary of Energy)

Frazer Harrison/Getty Images and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Perry’s very presence on the Trump cabinet—leading the department he a) wanted to abolish, b) couldn’t remember existed at a pivotal moment, and c) didn’t understand the function of until after he’d taken a job—is already beyond the realm of parody. It’s not hard to imagine Poehler sinking her teeth into his dim, dull, unnervingly unflappable essence.

Viola Davis as James Mattis (Secretary of Defense)

Kevin Winter/Getty Images and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

James Mattis, who has worked under both President Bush and President Obama, is almost certainly going to spend much of his time as Defense Secretary keeping the erratic, dangerous impulses of President Trump, Steve Bannon, and the like in check. He’s a unique figure in the cabinet, a relatively intelligent and stable official who’ll have to very carefully strive to correct course. Viola Davis is a great dramatic actress, and she could dryly channel Mattis’ brand of no-nonsense patience.

Jane Lynch as Mike Pence (Vice President)

Valerie Macon/Getty Images and Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images

You may have heard already, but Mike Pence has serious problems with LGBTQ people and women (among others). What could be more fitting than a proudly queer and bitingly wry comic taking on the task of satirizing such bigotry? Her brutal deadpan would be the perfect match for Pence.

Natalie Portman as Jared Kushner (Top White House Advisor)

Kevin Winter/Getty Images and Spencer Platt/Getty Images

As Trump’s son-in-law and closest advisor, Jared Kushner brings a long and complicated history to the White House. Concealing everything from high-society pretensions to ideological contradictions to probable daddy issues, he’s built up a fairly inscrutable demeanor in his rise to top advisor. Natalie Portman would capture Kushner’s plasticine good looks and the mannered, slow-burn intensity that previously won her an Oscar (and could earn her a second).

Keri Russell as Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor)

Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images and Win McNamee/Getty ImagesFor years, Andy Zaltzman and John Oliver took on the powers that be in their influential podcast The Bugle. But the show went on hiatus in 2014 when Oliver became the host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight. Now, Zaltzman is rebooting the show at a most opportune moment for satire. “It’s like throwing the javelin of truth into the swamp of corruption,” says Zaltzman. “But javelins in swamps don’t always work out.”The End of “Stick to Sports” Sportswriters have been awakened by Donald Trump’s presidency. Is that what their readers want?

Did you read sports Twitter over the weekend? Notice how your favorite sportswriters were blasting Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration like the protesters at JFK’s Terminal 4? As Trump goes, such resistance is becoming typical. For sportswriters, it could be a watershed. If there was a thin line between sportswriting and political advocacy, this weekend erased it forever. The era of “stick to sports” is over.

These days, when a Republican politician does something obnoxious or destructive, we expect them to be met by an advance guard of sportswriters like Craig Calcaterra, Dave Zirin, David Roth, and somebody from Deadspin. You know, the enforcer types.

But gaze at this (partial) list of writers and personalities who stuck pins into Trump over the weekend: Zach Lowe, Tim Kawakami, Pete Abraham, Charlotte Wilder, Greg Bedard, Pablo Torre, Howard Beck, Sarah Spain, Molly Knight, Stewart Mandel, Jemele Hill, Spencer Hall, Timothy Burke, Joe Vardon, and the proprietors of the MGoBlog. They cover different beats, have different corporate parents, live in different parts of the country, and come from different generations. None of them “stuck to sports.” When Bomani Jones begins to blend into the crowd, something about sportswriting has changed, and we have entered virgin territory.

On the one hand, what’s happening to sportswriters is that Trump is radicalizing them at the same rate he’s radicalizing everyone else. A moral crisis means Super Bowl predictions will have to wait. In October, Seth Davis — son of Clinton consigliere Lanny Davis — wrote on Facebook that he was no longer sticking to sports. “When I realized I was restraining myself for fear of losing Twitter followers, I felt like a hypocrite,” he said. Plenty of people have joined Davis in the breach, though he’s the only one I’ve seen using the hashtag #teamcivility.

Another factor is that Trump’s Tony Montana approach to the issues means he’s bound to touch sports frequently. Last week, Trump compared the ovation he got at CIA headquarters to the one Peyton Manning got for winning the Super Bowl. In a meeting with congressional leaders, Trump justified his obsession with “voter fraud” by telling a story (later revealed to be third-hand) that came from German golfer Bernhard Langer.

But the end of “stick to sports” owes as much to structural changes within sportswriting as it does to Trump himself. After all, when newspapers ruled the world, there was a rich tradition of politically interested writers that stretched from Westbrook Pegler to Robert Lipsyte.

But newspaper staffs are hierarchical. Only three or four columnists are allowed to opine about sports, much less the rest of the world. The internet has made everybody into a de facto columnist. There’s no long apprenticeship before you get a column; at casually edited content farms, hot-taking is the first thing you get to do. (Later, after a few hundred reps, you learn to be a respectable old bore.)

In the newspaper era, even the most woke sports columnist tended to deal with politics only when it entered his or her domain. The columnist wrote about labor law when there was a baseball strike; amateurism when the NCAA and the Olympics had their regularly-scheduled crises; race relations when Tommie Smith and John Carlos stuck their fists in the air.

Another thing the internet did to sportswriting was to make it, once and for all, part of a single, large American subject. Over at The Ringer, you can find a writer like Ben Lindbergh gliding from baseball to Trump to Rogue One. The looseness of the medium allows MMQB’s Peter King to casually reveal he voted for Hillary Clinton in November. Twitter provides a forum to Seth Davis he’d never have on CBS’s college basketball desk. It’s no longer a surprise when you know a sportswriter’s politics. It’s a surprise when you don’t.

A sportswriter doesn’t have to “stick to sports” if the athletes don’t. One of the most remarkable parts of Muhammad Ali’s legacy was the way he persuaded writers to follow him like ring handlers as he swaggered through the ’60s. Similarly, when Warriors coach Steve Kerr calls Trump’s Muslim ban a “horrible idea,” as he did on Sunday, the sportswriter becomes both a chronicler and a political animal simultaneously — I’m just telling you what Coach said!

The end of “stick to sports” is a pleasure for writers who can flex their muscles in a way their elders never could. The thing is, I see evidence that some readers don’t want their favorite Twitter feeds to become free-fire zones for politics. Over the weekend, when Lowe, Bedard, and Around the Horn’s Kevin Blackistone strayed from their beats, they were all commanded to “stick to sports.”

Similarly, the writers’ corporate parents would rather they point their hot takes toward something other than Trump. Recently, one sports TV executive told me his favorite kind of partisan dispute was one personality rooting for the Patriots to win and another rooting for them to lose — a clash that mimicked the theater of cable news but had none of its baggage. Last January, ESPN sent a memo to employees telling them to “refrain from political editorializing … on platforms such as Twitter or other social media.”

This brings us to the final way the internet has changed sportswriting. Vowing to unfollow a writer after every Trump tweet has become a persistent response. But no matter how many readers the politically minded sportswriter turns off, it’s easier than ever to find new eyeballs. There is 53.9 percent of the non-Trump voting populace from which to draw an audience. So even if Trump builds a big, beautiful wall around America, he faces a new annoyance: The wall that once encircled sportswriting has been reduced to rubble.Play Facebook

Embed Trump: Rep. Cummings Wouldn't Meet, 'Probably' Told by Sen. Schumer 1:16 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

President Donald Trump and members of the Congressional Black Caucus both say they are eager to meet and talk about Trump's pledge to help America's urban centers.

But why that meeting hasn't taken place yet depends on whom you ask.

"I would love to meet with the black caucus, I think it's great," Trump said Thursday when asked by American Urban Radio Networks' White House Correspondent April Ryan if the president planned to speak with the group about his campaign pledge.

A short time later, CBC responded on Twitter saying the White House ignored a letter sent the day before Trump's inauguration:

Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We’re the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad! Letter: https://t.co/58KiuHmITF — The CBC (@OfficialCBC) February 16, 2017

During the wide ranging press conference, Trump also accused prominent African-American Rep. Elijah Cummings of cancelling a planned sit down for political reasons.

"I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited and then he said, 'Oh I can't move it might be bad for me politically. I can't have that meeting,'" Trump said.

The president then said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer or "some other lightweight" likely pressured Cummings to cancel the sit down.

Cummings, a former chair of the CBC, denied ever having cancelled a meeting with Trump and said the leader of a different chamber of Congress never spoke to him about it.

"I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today. Of course, Senator Schumer never told me to skip a meeting with the President," Cummings said in a statement. The Democratic congressman said he was looking forward to speaking to the president about the price of prescription drugs.

Also during the press conference, Trump bizarrely asked Ryan, a veteran African-American journalist, if she could help set up the meeting and if the members were "friends of hers."

"Many of the CBC members have contacted me since that answer, that question and answer. They are very eager to meet with this president on the issues, " Ryan said on MSNBC.Click the heart, it's called favoriting. Favorite the stuff you like.

Yes, you could serve squeaky, toothpick-able cheese cubes at your football or Oscars party. And no one would object.

But you could also take that same cheese and make a more metamorphic change: Add spices, herbs, and vegetables, then blend or melt or beer-spike into a dip that's creamy, scoopable, and at home on a variety of "dippers," from tortilla chips to carrot sticks. Suddenly, you've taken that singular, lonely cheese and transformed it into an eligible snack from which hundreds of thousands (or at least a few) spin-off combinations are possible:

"I want to try it," CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. "We could have a restaurant that's focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person."

Puzder's interest in an employee-free restaurant, which he says would be possible only if the company found time as Hardee's works on its northeastern expansion, has been driven by rising minimum wages across the US.

"With government driving up the cost of labor, it's driving down the number of jobs," he says. "You're going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants."

Puzder has been an outspoken advocate against raising the minimum wage, writing two op-eds for The Wall Street Journal on how a higher minimum wage would lead to reduced employment opportunities.

"This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage," says Puzder. "Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?"

As a result, he and others in the fast-food business are investing big in automation.

"If you're making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive — this is not rocket science," says Puzder.

Despite the financial benefits, automating employee duties isn't an easy process.

First and foremost, the technology has to work every time. For the time being, Puzder doesn't think that it's likely that any machine could take over the more nuanced kitchen work of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.

But for more rote tasks like grilling a burger or taking an order, technology may be even more precise than human employees.

"They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case," says Puzder of swapping employees for machines.

While there are bonuses of using machines, there is the secondary issue of customers becoming comfortable using the tech. Younger customers may already have a handle on technology, but many older customers could find themselves confused in a tech-heavy location.

But Puzder says that a restaurant that's 100% automated would have one big plus for millennials: no social interaction.

"Millennials like not seeing people," he says. "I've been inside restaurants where we've installed ordering kiosks ... and I've actually seen young people waiting in line to use the kiosk where there's a person standing behind the counter, waiting on nobody."In December 2016, 5,000 Kenyans doctors drawn from all government hospitals countrywide went on strike to protest the failure of the Kenyan government to implement a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which it had entered into with doctors through their union in 2013.

Several weeks later, the doctors are still on strike and the stand-off has yet to come to an end.

The strike has brought the public health care system to a halt. For example, it was reported that more than 100 patients fled from the main psychiatric hospital in Nairobi when the strike began and a security guard at a hospital in western Kenya was forced to assist a woman give birth.

The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU), a union body that governs all Kenyan doctors, called on all its members to stop work in reaction to the government failing to honor its agreement amidst worsening conditions in public healthcare.

Kenyatta National and Moi Teaching & Referral Hospitals are functionally closed. The GOK must implement the CBA they signed in 2013. — kmpdu (@kmpdu) December 16, 2016

The CBA between the Kenyan government through the Ministry of Health and the doctors’ union was signed on 23 June 2013. It was aimed at repairing the healthcare system in the country which is in deplorable conditions. Most government hospitals lack basic medical equipment and drugs, and the 5,000 doctors are overworked serving a population of 43 million Kenyans.

According to the UN’s 2014 human development report, incomes of the richest 20 per cent of the Kenyan population rose steadily in the past decade to stand at 11 times more than the incomes of the poorest 20 per cent, leaving Kenya as East Africa’s second most unequal society after Rwanda. Although there are private hospitals, they are out of reach for many Kenyans.

The ongoing strike and the terms of the CBA have been misreported by media houses in Kenya, with many saying that doctors are only after a 300% pay raise. However, that is not the only thing contained in the CBA, the CBA proposes the overhaul of the public health care system by equipping all government hospitals, and providing low cost universal healthcare. Most doctors start off on a salary of US$ 400 per month. the patient-doctor ratio remains low at 18:100,000.

In a tweet shared when the strike began, KMPDU shared an infographic breaking down the CBA in a way that Kenyans could easily understand, relate with and share widely.

13. That CBA is what will redeem the healthcare of this country for it has the interest of every kenyan in it pic.twitter.com/hEh5EJmlLc — kmpdu (@kmpdu) January 14, 2017

It is due to this perceived misrepresentation of facts and efforts by the government and some media houses that the union began a strong social media campaign with the aim of sensitizing Kenyans on the actual state of healthcare in the country as well as galvanize the support of Kenyans.

All the media houses have a moral obligation to highlight not only the plight of the patient but that of the doctor too. #LipaKamaTender — kmpdu (@kmpdu) December 18, 2016

Using their Twitter handle @KMPDU, the union has, for nearly two months, shared infographics, memes, photos, cartoons, videos and stories from their union members telling their personal experiences trying to save lives with no medical equipment, lack of drugs and electricity and the overworking of many doctors who sometimes have to go on 36-hour shifts with little rest.

In a photo essay compiled by the website Courageous Stories, one doctor described how they watched a patient die because the hospital’s ambulance had been given to the local politician to pick tomatoes from the market.

The union’s social media campaign has churned a total of 12 hashtags since the start of the strike: #LipaKamatender (meaning: pay like you pay tenders), #ImplementCBA, #DoctorsOnTrial, #DoctorsStrike, #doctorsarehumanstoo, #CBAismorethancash, #offernotCBA, #HealthCrisisKe, #CBAforKenyans, #healthontrial, #SickAt50, #iamatribelessdoctor.

The government has resisted the doctors’ demands. In a live interview on national TV in December, government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said Kenya does not need doctors and the government was planning on importing doctors from India and Cuba.

A few weeks after that statement was made, The Telegraph, an Indian newspaper reported that the Indian prime minister had turned down the request to replace the striking Kenyan doctors with Indian doctors during a visit by the Kenyan president to New Delhi.

Meanwhile, the country's public healthcare system remains at a standstill.Does the 9th Circuit really have an 80% reversal rate?

posted at 8:01 pm on February 10, 2017 by Ed Morrissey

It’s no secret that the Ninth Circuit has a reputation for giving the Supreme Court fits, but is it true that they have an 80% reversal rate? The answer is yes … and really no. Confused? Many are, and the claim of an 80% reversal rate makes its way into many corners of the media. It’s mainly used to support arguments to break up the Ninth Circuit or find ways to circumvent it in order to prevent almost-certain erroneous outcomes.

The Daily Caller is hardly unique, although they did do a better job than most in qualifying the way in which the calculation is made (emphasis mine):

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — which ruled Thursday against reinstating President Trump’s travel ban affecting seven terror-prone countries — has an unusually high reversal rate before the U.S. Supreme Court. Eight of out of 10 cases from the 9th Circuit reviewed by the Supreme Court are overruled, according to a 2010 analysis published by the American Bar Association. The 9th Circuit, which is known for its liberal tendencies, has the second-highest reversal rate of the 13 appellate courts below the Supreme Court.

“Reviewed by the Supreme Court” is the operative qualifier — and it’s a very, very important one. Very few cases actually get reviewed by the Supreme Court from any of the circuit courts, and most of them don’t even generate appeals to the Supreme Court in the first place. Parties file appeals to the Supreme Court, which then has to decide whether the justices want or need to review the case. If fewer than four of the justices think that the appeal has merit, the application for certiorari is denied, keeping the appellate decision in place. This happens in most cases.

What does that mean in practical terms? It means that the Supreme Court’s grant of certiorari tend to favor those cases that are likely to be overturned. It’s a major selection bias, and as we’ll see, it gives a very distorted picture of what happens in the appellate court system.

Let’s take a look at the ABA report that generated this talking point. The study covered ten years (1999-2008) across all appellate circuits. During that period of time, the total number of cases decided by all appellate courts was 604,665. How many did the Supreme Court accept for their review? A mere 660 cases, or 0.109% of all decisions reached by the appellate level. The Ninth Circuit accounted for 175 of the cases reviewed, or about 26.5%, but the same circuit handled 114,199 of all appellate cases — 18.9% of the total.

The surpassingly small number of reviews made it difficult to set up a metric that could distinguish between the courts. Dealing with variant outcomes within 0.109% of an overall data pool makes outcomes statistically insignificant, as the ABA hinted in its report:

Reversal rates for each court of appeals would be very small, in the range of a tenth of a percent, if calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of appeals terminated by that court. Conversely, if the reversal rate is calculated as the total number of cases reversed over the total number of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court, the ratio increases dramatically. So, in the big picture, i.e., considering all of the appeals terminated by each circuit, reversal rates for all courts of appeals could be very low, if calculated by the former method, or very high, if calculated by the latter method.

The ABA decided to use both to some extent, but even the latter method (reviewed cases only) does not show the Ninth Circuit as wildly off the scale. In fact, they’re only second highest in reversal rates, and the distribution is remarkably close to the median:

This is where the selection bias of using only certiorari-granted cases shows up. Every circuit has more than half of its decisions selected by the Supreme Court for review overturned, and the median is 69%. The deviation of performance between the circuits is hardly dramatic.

Perhaps a better metric would be the percentage of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court. In this comparison, the Ninth Circuit ends up a little farther off from the median, but it’s only third “worst”:

The DC Circuit deals with more constitutional issues with federal government, the kind of cases in which the Supreme Court will naturally have a higher interest, which likely accounts for its highest review rate. But the percentages are so low here as to make comparisons insignificant statistically, the very problem that the ABA noted in its own report.

It’s true in a very narrow sense that the Ninth Circuit has an 80% reversal rate for that ten-year period, but it’s also true that they have a 0.123% reversal rate — and that’s actually the more accurate way to view their performance.

However, the ABA report does give evidence of another kind about the performance of the Ninth Circuit. As noted above, that circuit handled 18.9% of all appellate cases, far higher than any other circuit; the next closest was the Fifth Circuit, with 14.1%, and then the Eleventh Circuit with 12.3% of all appellate cases decided. Those three circuits heard slightly over 45% of all appeals, while the rest heard fewer than 10% each. That certainly seems like a good argument for splitting the Ninth Circuit:

Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan is hoping this is the year to bring to fruition a decades-long desire of Western Republicans: splitting up the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

They say it’s overloaded and overly liberal. But they’ll still face the difficulty of getting a plan past California Democrats, who have traditionally wanted nothing of it. Sullivan and Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana have introduced two bills. One establishes a commission to study the appeals court system and find a quick and effective way to divide up the 9th Circuit’s caseload. The other would split the court into two: the 9th Circuit and a newly created 12th Circuit. The 9th Circuit would include California, Guam, Hawaii and the Northern Mariana Islands. The new circuit would include Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

Lawmakers have been kicking around the idea of splitting up the 9th Circuit for decades. A statement Sullivan released with his new legislation notes that there have already been two commissions — in 1973 and 1998. Both found the court to be overburdened, Sullivan said.

The ABA data makes it clear that the burden is much higher on the Ninth Circuit, or at least was between 1999-2008. That’s a better reason to create a new circuit and to shift the burden more equitably, and this Congress should take that up soon.

Update: A couple of followers on Twitter argue that the subset of reviewed cases is a “sample” that shows an overall problem. That’s wrong for a number of reasons. First, to draw conclusions from an audit or sample, the sample has to be random. It also has to be larger than 0.109% of the whole, for the same reasons I stated above — the sample would be so small that a few random adverse examples would skew the overall accuracy of the conclusions, which is exactly what this does here. The subset of reviewed cases (660 out of 604,665) are chosen by the Supreme Court specifically for their likelihood of resulting in a reversal, while many many more are rejected because of their low likelihood of reversal. That’s not sampling at all.

Update, 2/11: Edited slightly to emphasize which method is used for each result.

Related Posts:WASHINGTON — Seeking a surer bet to fill out his Cabinet, President Donald Trump on Thursday moved quickly to name law school dean Alexander Acosta as his new choice for labor secretary — a day after Andrew Puzder abruptly withdrew from consideration.

If confirmed by the Senate, Acosta would be the first Hispanic member of Trump's Cabinet.

Trump and key Republicans highlighted a key detail in Acosta's resume: He has won unanimous Senate confirmation three times — to a seat on the National Labor Relations Board, as the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and as U.S. attorney in Miami.

"He did very, very well," Trump, said in a brief statement to start a White House press conference that was dominated by other challenges facing the new administration. Acosta did not appear with him.

Almost immediately, Acosta's Senate prospects looked better than Puzder's had after months of attacks on his personal life, statements and career as a fast-food CEO.

"Mr. Acosta's nomination is off to a good start because he's already been confirmed by the Senate three times," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate panel that will hold Acosta's confirmation hearing.

Leading Democrats and their allies vowed to hold Acosta "accountable" as the head of an agency charged with enforcing worker protections.

But their reactions were muted compared to the scathing response to Puzder's nomination in December, when his opponents paraded out worker after worker who complained of shoddy treatment at Puzder's company's restaurants, which include Hardee's and Carl's Jr. And they questioned how well Puzder could advocate for workers after a career atop CKE Restaurants Inc.

Puzder withdrew his nomination Wednesday after several Republicans indicated they would not support him, in part over his past employment of a housekeeper not authorized to work in the U.S. Puzder did not pay the related taxes for five years after he fired the worker, only doing so after he was nominated on Dec. 9.

"Unlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acosta's nomination deserves serious consideration," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. "In one day, we've gone from a fast-food CEO who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it."

Sen. Patty Murray, the leading Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, made a passing reference in her statement to having "some initial concerns about his record," but did not name them.

An assortment of Hispanic advocacy groups praised the nomination, including the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Florida International University law school, where Acosta is dean, said he is 48. The Hispanic National Bar Association and others described Acosta as the son of Cuban immigrants.

Other groups pointed out that Acosta was head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division when the agency came under fire for applying political considerations to some hiring decisions. The agency's inspector general report said Acosta "did not sufficiently supervise" an employee to whom he had delegated hiring duties.

"This egregious conduct played out under Mr. Acosta's watch and undermined the integrity of the Civil Rights Division," said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law. "It is hard to believe that Mr. Acosta would now be nominated to lead a federal agency tasked with promoting lawful hiring practices and safe workplaces."

The Harvard-trained Miami native, now dean of the Florida International University law school, clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

"He reminds me of one of those baseball players who can do everything," Alito said as he swore in Acosta in 2006 as South Florida's top federal prosecutor.

While Acosta was South Florida's top prosecutor, his office won the conviction of purported "dirty bomb" suspect and al-Qaida operative Jose Padilla on terrorism support charges; convicted former Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff and a partner on fraud charges involving a gambling fleet purchase; obtained guilty pleas from brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela for operating Colombia's Cali cocaine cartel; and prosecuted Swiss bank UBS for allowing U.S. taxpayers to hide money overseas, resulting in the bank paying a $780 million fine and turning over names of secret account holders to the U.S.

One top Miami defense lawyer, David O. Markus, who represented one of the Cali cartel brothers, tweeted out Thursday that Acosta was a great choice.

"Smart, ethical and a really good guy," Markus wrote.

Starting next March, Playboy will stop publishing photographs of naked women. The cheesecake will be dialed back to a “PG-13” rating, the New York Times’ Ravi Somaiya reported Monday night. Playmate photos will look “more like the racier sections of Instagram” than the adult section of the bookstore. In place of nude women, the magazine will highlight its “tradition of investigative journalism, in-depth interviews and fiction.” It will target “young men who live in cities.” According to Playboy CEO Scott Flanders, the Internet is to blame. “You’re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free,” Flanders told the Times. “And so it’s just passé at this juncture.”

The precise mechanism by which the Internet killed Playboy is a little more complicated than that. It’s true that Internet porn delivers more bang for the buck than Playboy ever did—particularly because Internet porn is free. But the digital dominance has also made smut markedly less cool, especially for members of Playboy’s target audience.

When Playboy debuted in 1953, it was revolutionary to page through a nudie mag. Reading Playboy was practically a political protest against government censorship. Two decades later, catching an erotic flick in a movie theater was a bawdy date for naughty couples. But now, the sexual counterculture is trading erotic GIFs on Tumblr, and the scene is glittering with contributions from gay, pansexual, feminist, and BDSM viewers. Today’s straight guys are unlikely to buy a magazine just to see a naked girl. And today’s literally-everybody-else is unlikely to be thrilled by a brand that sells such an activity as the height of cool—partly because Playboy’s hetero framework is terribly old school, too.

Porn’s digital dominance also made porn consumption more private. It’s now normalized to scroll through porn videos on your phone in bed, but gross and weird to pay to watch it in a public theater. Ditto picking up Playboy on the newsstand (or rocking bunny-eared insignia—as print sales dwindle, retail is central to Playboy’s 21st-century business model). The retro chic image of the Playboy playboy rocking a smoking jacket in a conversation pit has been replaced with that of a geriatric Hugh Hefner bumbling around his mansion while reality show producers pipe in derpy sound effects.

When Playboy made its website totally “safe for work,” the average reader’s age also dropped.

Meanwhile, social media sites, which now determine which magazine content lives and dies, are less amenable to nudity than sidewalk newsstands are (or were). Though Tumblr and Twitter allow nakedness on their networks, Facebook and Instagram—the latter is owned by the former—ban most exposed nipples, with photos of breastfeeding mothers as the exception. In that media landscape, a sex column written by a “sex-positive female” (one feature Playboy editors have teased for the reboot) is a clickier prospect than a nude photograph of said female. Online, Playboy has been PG-13 for more than a year. The magazine found that when it made its website totally “safe for work,” and safe for social media sharing, by dropping nudity, the average reader’s age also dropped—from a late-40s guy to an early-30s dude.French publishers have welcomed Facebook’s and Google’s efforts to work with them to stunt the spread of fake news, though many are wary of how big a burden the projects will be to already stretched-thin newsrooms.

This week, Facebook revealed plans to work with eight media companies in France, including Le Monde, Libération and Agence France-Presse, to fact-check and filter news articles that have been flagged by Facebook users in the run-up to the elections in April and May. Once a user flags a story, at least two of the media partners must agree that it is false, supply links proving so, and then Facebook will flag the article as disputed in the news feed and issue a warning to users before they share it.

Most of the eight publishers are also involved with an earlier initiative, set up by a news coalition facilitated by British not-for-profit company First Draft News and is backed by Google News Lab. This project is called Cross Check and lets users submit questions and gather information from 16 French media partners. Facebook has also supported it, and in time the project may merge with Facebook’s eight-partner initiative, into a single channel, according to Le Monde editor-in-chief Michaël Szadkowski.

All publishers view the collaborations as an important step forward to reducing the plague of fake news, though some are unsure how sustainable it will be. There is even a little resentment in some quarters. “I’m not sure this is enough,” said Liberation’s head of digital, Xavier Grangier. “Journalists have the feeling they are working for Facebook and Google for free.”

The social platform’s approach is also a little more carrot than stick currently.

“Facebook could blacklist some websites or could get involved financially on Cross Check, as newspapers don’t really have that much resource nor money,” added Grangier.

That said, most are content that efforts are being made by the platforms.

“We are very encouraged by Facebook’s tool. But we will test and learn, and if we discover it’s something that needs too much resource, we will go back to them and ask if they can do anything to adjust,” said Gregoire Lemarchand, head of social networks for Agence France-Presse. “Even Facebook doesn’t know how many stories will be flagged — it could be one story a day or 10.”

Top of mind for all involved is figuring out how to reallocate newsroom resources to the experiments. Agence France-Presse will assign five people to overseeing the stories flagged on Facebook’s platform — people who were already dedicated to creating content for social platforms. Daily financial newspaper Les Echos will allocate three people from across print and web products to work on responding to the Facebook and First Draft news initiatives. Four of Libération’s fact-checking team will do likewise, and Le Monde also has a large fact-checking team.

“Newsrooms in France are not in good shape. Everyone works hard, and you’re having to ask some of them to work even more,” said Les Echos digital editor-in-chief Clémence Lemaistre. “But we know how important it is to be part of this; it’s just a work in progress. We will test and learn what works and adapt what resources we need accordingly,” she added.

Le Monde is likely the most advanced publisher in France for its fact-checking, and it has been prolific in its own fake-news crackdown, releasing fact-check products powered by a database of 600 unreliable websites. That means the publisher may be able to repurpose debunking material or articles it has already produced, which would help ease resources.

But it is hard to say just how much attention the Facebook feature will need, as it is reliant on users flagging stories.

“We don’t know how French users will react to the Facebook fake-news tool, nor if the platform has plans to promote it to users,” added Le Monde’s Szadkowski. “We heard from Facebook partners in the U.S. there weren’t so many stories reported by American users. So we will see.”

Publishers aren’t committed to having to write a set number of articles or responses as part of the partnership. Some editors feel strongly that working collaboratively with other media and Facebook on the tool is something that needs to stay in place well beyond the elections, having been haunted by the rise of fake news for years.

“We hope that the initiatives from Google and Facebook are not just for the elections, and that if a terror attack happens in the next year here, that these tools will have an impact on newsrooms to help the fake news during such attacks to not spread,” said Szadkowski.

Lemaistre echoed the importance of retaining the features and of collaborative efforts beyond the May election.

“The election is a great way to start, though fake news didn’t begin with the election. The rising populist atmosphere can be felt everywhere, not just France, and it is not going to stop the day after the elections, no matter who wins,” she said. “It is a very long battle. This is going to be a very long path to educate people who have forgotten that facts are important what fake news is. And we can’t change that in two months.”SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Thursday following President Donald Trump’s press conference to announce his pick for Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh applauded Trump’s performance on his nationally syndicated radio show.

Limbaugh said while the media still won’t warm up to Trump, it was what his supporters wanted to see, which was a willingness to tout his achievements and take on some of the claims from the media.

“You know it is hard to say — you get caught up in the moment,” Limbaugh said. “But this was one of the most effective press conferences I have ever seen. The press is going to hate him even more after this. Don’t misunderstand. When I say effective, I’m talking about rallying people who voted for him to stay with him. He made a point — ‘What chaos? You’re reporting chaos. We’re not in chaos. We’re a well-oiled machine. We got one of the smoothest running machines in the history of machines. We got one of the best administrations in the history of administrations.'”

“And he rattled off the achievements they’ve had here that the media is not reporting because they’re so focused on whether or not Trump worked with Russia to screw Hillary out of the presidency,” he continued. “And he was reassuring the people he’s on top of everything. Nothing has changed. Everything he campaigned on, he is doing. All he is doing is fulfilling campaign promises. And of course, the Democrats don’t like him. Of course, the media don’t like him. It isn’t going to stop him.”

To the extent that the new team can be said to have a focus, it seems to have its gaze primarily on defeating the Islamic State and, perhaps, coming up with a new approach to Iran. Given some of Mr. Trump’s conciliatory statements about Russia, as well as ties between the Kremlin and Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson, it seems likely that the White House will seek improved relations with the country, though they have given no clue as to what shape and strategic goals that relationship will take on.

Beyond that, the members of the Trump team collectively have no executive-branch or diplomatic experience in dealing with other regions of the world or with many of its leading powers, like China, India, Japan, Germany, France or Britain. Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Tillerson’s business experiences will prove of limited value in the new task of conducting affairs of state.

It’s not just their lack of experience that will make for an unstable foreign policy ship. Mr. Trump has, perhaps by design, chosen people who do not know one another, and appear to disagree in personality and worldview. Given his past interests and temperament, it seems likely that Michael T. Flynn, the retired lieutenant general whom Mr. Trump has picked as his national security adviser, will want an action-oriented National Security Council. But the last time the council was geared toward operations, during the Reagan administration, the result was the Iran-contra scandal, which nearly brought down the administration.

One question is who will run the coordinating functions of the National Security Council in the fashion that, say, Brent Scowcroft carried out for Ford and the elder Bush? That job may fall to K. T. McFarland, chosen as the deputy national security adviser, who was once a relatively low-ranking aide to Henry A. Kissinger (and who is now said to be arranging Mr. Kissinger’s visits to Trump Tower).

Strong disagreement seems baked into the team. James N. Mattis, the retired Marine general whom Mr. Trump has chosen as secretary of defense, has voiced support for the Obama administration’s nuclear agreement with Iran, while Mr. Flynn, Mike Pompeo at the C.I.A. and Mr. Trump himself have attacked it. Mr. Pompeo has been a hawk on Russia, in contrast to several of his colleagues.

Reagan was the last Republican president who arrived in Washington challenging the foreign policy establishment of his own party. In its early years, his foreign policy team was notoriously unstable. He replaced his secretary of state after less than 18 months. By the end of his third year, he was working with his third national security adviser. The Reagan cabinet members who stayed on the job the longest, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, frequently engaged in nasty bickering.

Still, Reagan left office with a historic success, the diplomacy with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that helped end the Cold War. But Reagan was a leader who set foreign policy goals and used his advisers’ creative tension to move the country toward them. By most accounts, Mr. Trump has operated with a different style; he seems to prefer letting his inner circle fight it out, after which he picks and advocates for the winner.

This may work well in the business world, where the metrics of success are more or less straightforward. In foreign policy, though, the goal posts don’t just move — when an administration begins, they don’t even exist. It’s up to the president to decide where and how his team should advance. If Mr. Trump doesn’t, then his team of rivals and outsiders will quickly devolve into a battle royal.Donald Trump likes to golf. He owns golf courses around the world, after all. Donald Trump does not like the media. We know this because he talks about it, he tweets about it, and he likely dreams about it. This weekend, the president took another break from Washington and headed south to Mar-a-Lago. On Saturday, Trump suited up to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The weather looks nice enough in Jupiter, Florida, the site of the Trump National Golf Club—mid-70s, bit of cloud cover, but nothing to stress over.

On Thursday, the Washington Supreme Court unanimously rejected a florist’s assertion that she had not discriminated against a same-sex couple when she refused to provide flowers for their wedding—and that, even if she had, she held a constitutional right to do so.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.

The florist, Barronelle Stutzman, rose to fame in 2013 after she informed Robert Ingersoll, a gay customer, that she would not sell him flowers for his upcoming wedding because of “her relationship with Jesus Christ.” Stutzman explained that her religious beliefs precluded her from providing flowers for same-sex ceremonies. Ingersoll and his partner sued under Washington nondiscrimination law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and the state attorney general asked Stutzman to stop discriminating against gay customers. Stutzman refused, and the state sued as well. A trial court ruled against Stutzman, fining her $1001 and ordering her to stop discriminating. She appealed all the way to the state Supreme Court, which has now affirmed the trial court’s judgment.

Stutzman first claimed that she hadn’t actually discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, because she is willing to serve gay customers, just not those who are getting married. The court dismissed this defense as an untenable “distinction between status and conduct” that makes no sense because the conduct (getting married to a same-sex partner) is “fundamentally linked” to status (being gay). Moreover, the court explained, the Washington statute guarantees “full enjoyment” of public accommodations and prohibits “all discriminatory acts,” including those that “directly or indirectly” result in “any distinction, restriction, or discrimination” based on sexual orientation. This sweeping language obviously bars businesses from turning away same-sex couples planning a wedding as such discrimination creates a distinction on the basis of their sexual orientation that directly deprives them of the business’ services.

Next, Stutzman alleged that she has a free speech right to turn away same-sex couples as selling floral arrangements for profit amounts to “expression” protected by the First Amendment. The court determined that making and selling these arrangements is conduct, not speech, but noted that certain expressive conduct still holds some constitutional protection. Creating bouquets, the court concluded, does not fall into this category as it is not “inherently expressive” and does not send a message of any sort. Moreover, the Supreme Court has limited its expressive conduct decisions to noncommercial activity, like marching in a parade. Stutzman sells flowers for money—and “her store,” the court wrote, “is the kind of public accommodation that has traditionally been subject to antidiscrimination laws.”

Stutzman has a very strange backup argument: She insists that the court should create a new “narrow” rule that would let only “businesses, such as newspapers, publicists, speechwriters, photographers, and other artists, that create expression” discriminate against same-sex couples. But as an amicus brief filed by Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out, this rule “would create a ‘two-tiered system’ that carves out an enormous hole from public accommodations laws,” under which “a dime-store lunch counter would be required to serve interracial couples but an upscale bistro could turn them away.” Because this bifurcation of nondiscrimination law has no basis in free speech jurisprudence—and would undermine the very purpose of public accommodation statutes—the court properly rejected it.

Perhaps Stutzman’s least risible defense is her religious freedom claim. Stutzman alleges that Washington has violated her free exercise rights under the First Amendment by forcing her to violate her religious beliefs. Unfortunately for Stutzman, the Free Exercise Clause permits neutral laws of general applicability—even if they have the practical effect of burdening religious liberty. The Washington statute at issue here is obviously such a law. There is no evidence that it was designed to target Christians like Stutzman, and it applies broadly to all businesses. Stutzman sought a new exemption to this rule, permitting discrimination in public accommodations, but the court sensibly declined to create one.

Finally, Stutzman asserted that she holds a right to discriminate under Washington’s own constitution, which arguably provides greater protections for religious liberty than the First Amendment. The court “emphatically” rejected this argument. Even if the court applied the strictest of scrutiny to Washington’s nondiscrimination law, it noted, Stutzman’s defense would still fail because the law is narrowly tailored to serve an overwhelmingly important public interest.

“As every other court to address the question has concluded,” the court held in the decision’s most incisive passage, “public accommodations laws do not simply guarantee access to goods or services. Instead, they serve a broader societal purpose: eradicating barriers to the equal treatment of all citizens in the commercial marketplace. Were we to carve out a patchwork of exceptions for ostensibly justified discrimination, that purpose would be fatally undermined.”Save and organize all of the stuff you love in one place.

I am neither a Southerner nor a biscuit analyst, yet this Instagram from Tom Hirschfeld gave even me pause: an egg in biscuit dough?! Is this proper?

(Spoiler alert: I couldn't determine propriety, but I did test the effect of an egg. Click here to skip to those results.)

Well hello 🌞. I grew up eating a certain kind of biscuit, canned. The kind biscuit found in the dairy section at the grocery. I bet most people do. The thing is, when I started making biscuits I began with what many consider the holy grail, the southern biscuit. I like southern biscuits but to be honest they lack a certain quality I became attached too as a child, they lack flakiness or the ability to pull them apart in layers. Luckily as a born and raised midwesterner I have never been beholden to any southern baking mythology. I can change things up without hundreds of years of "how your momma did it" chasing me around the kitchen. So my simple secret, add an egg to the dough and lower the heat to 375F. #baking #biscuits #midwest ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ #tastingtable #saveur #f52grams #forkyeah #feedfeed #sweer #fresh #saveurmag #homemade #foodgasm #yummy #foodstagram #instagood #yum #foodporn #happytummy A photo posted by Tom Hirschfeld (@tom_hirschfeld) on Jan 3, 2017 at 4:10am PST

For Tom's ideal biscuits—high risers that fan apart in layers (as opposed to crumbling in a soft, squat tenderness)—he adds an egg to the dough and bakes at a lower temperature (375° F).

I couldn't find much precedent for the addition of an egg: not in Alton Brown's biscuits, nor in Edna Lewis', Deb Perelman's, Saveur's, ChefSteps', Bon Appétit's, King Arthur Flour's, Southern Living's, Mark Bittman's, Blackberry Farm's, Beth Kirby's...

A preview of what's to come—read on!

I did find buttermilk biscuits that incorporated egg, however, from Ina Garten and Serious Eats. And while Ina doesn't give much explanation for her egg inclusion, Serious Eats' Marissa Sertich Velie cites several reasons. Eggs, Velie explains,...

Create a richer flavor

Work in tandem with the baking powder to leaven the biscuits for extra height

Tenderize (due to the added fat in the yolk)

Contribute to a more golden-brown color (the additional protein contributes to the Maillard reaction)

The comments section on the Serious Eats article reveal some befuddlement—"And eggs? Whoever heard of such non-sense..."—but also some gratitude—"I found the egg in the biscuit batter odd at first until it was the only way my biscuits turned out right."

There was only one way to determine right from wrong (just kidding: to see how much of a difference the addition of one measly egg could really make)—a biscuit test:

Eggs (left) versus eggless (right). And top to bottom: 375°, 400°, and 425° F.

I doubled the same biscuit recipe (I chose A Cozy Kitchen's Flaky, Awesome, Perfect Buttermilk Biscuits for its simplicity and because it calls for an egg to be whisked into the buttermilk) and baked at three different temperatures 375°, 400°, and 425° F. (A couple relevant notes: I had to add an additional tablespoon or two of buttermilk to get the non-egg dough to come together; I brushed every biscuit with a mixture of egg and buttermilk; and I used the same size biscuit cutter for every cut-out.)

Thanks to the June Oven, a smart oven with a camera inside that connects to a mobile app, I could spy on my biscuits as they baked (and then share those videos here).

Here's how the biscuit test broke down:

375° F

Cooked at 375° F, with egg (left) versus without egg (right).

400° F

Cooked at 400° F, with egg (left) versus without egg (right).

425° F

Cooked at 425° F, with egg (left) versus without egg (right).

Across all temperatures, the biscuits made with the egg were decidedly taller (and, in my view, more beautiful). They were less fragile, with a doughier moistness that the all-butter biscuits were missing.

But the all-butter biscuits had a deeper, more purely buttery flavor, uninhibited by the addition of egg, and required less chewing (the descriptor "meltingly tender," while cringeworthy, is not inappropriate here).

Kristen Miglore, Creative Director and my accomplice in biscuit-tasting, asked a fair question: Are there certain instances in which you'd want a taller, sturdier, but maybe a bit less flavorful, biscuit? Why, yes! Perhaps if you're using that biscuit for a sandwich (and want to be able to cut it in half without it crumbling), or covering it with heavy gravy, or making it into a biscuit Benedict, the lofty flakiness will be of great benefit.

The final verdict: If you're looking for a fall-apart, no-chewing-required softness and a pronounceable butter-flavor, you might do best omitting the egg. If you want a biscuit with impressive looks at great height, whisk an egg into the milk mixture and be on your way.

Baked at 400° F; the biscuits on the left are from the eggy dough.

As for the color, the biscuits were all surprisingly yellow inside and out, even those that were made without the addition of egg. I wouldn't have been able to judge a biscuit egg or no egg by color alone (even if the height and flavor would be dead giveaways).

Dramatic color difference between 400° (left) and 425° (right).

The biscuits that were by far the most golden-brown were those baked at the highest temperature 425° F. Other than that, I had a hard time discerning any significant differences that the baking temperature made: Perhaps those baked at 375° F were a bit drier, as they took an additional five minutes in the oven longer? (Hard to say.) And the biscuits at 425° F had, I think, a discernibly crispier, nearly fried bottom, as the butter browned and bubbled in the oven. (Also hard to say.)

At the end of the day, the most beautiful biscuits were made from an egg-rich batter and baked at 425° F. But I'd gladly eat any (and all) of them.

TVLine.com editor and former Entertainment Weekly scoop-slinger Michael Ausiello revealed that in The Good Wife season finale, which aired May 10, the scene between Julianna Margulies and Archie Panjabi, who appeared together after more than 45 episodes apart, was achieved with technological intervention. Or, as Ausiello breathlessly put it: “Margulies and Panjabi did not shoot that scene together, I have come to learn. Body doubles were employed for the single shots, and the two-shot was spliced together in post-production.” Knowing this, Ausiello said, “I felt like an idiot. I felt duped. … I was disappointed.”

June Thomas June Thomas is a Slate culture critic and editor of Outward, Slate’s LGBTQ section.

Ausiello merely confirmed something that many had suspected when the episode aired. Certainly, the show’s fans were watching closely. When Good Wife showrunners Michelle and Robert King announced back in October that Panjabi would be leaving the show at the end of the season, most of the stories asked if Panjabi’s Kalinda Sharma would film a valedictory scene with Margulies’ Alicia Florick. It was pure fan service to bring them together for one last drink at the bar where they had so many squiffy sessions in the show’s early days. I can only imagine the outcry if they’d skipped a farewell, even a “faked” one, or if they’d made less of an effort with it.

Once you know the truth, it’s hard not to notice that the actresses seem to be looking past each other, but at least the Kings tried to fool us—at one point the two women clink glasses in a way that’s almost but not quite convincing. The bar scene was a lot more believable than the flashback sequence earlier in the season when a shadowy figure stood in for Alicia’s deceased former lover/boss Will Gardner. And it was a lot more satisfying than all the pretexts the writers kept offering for Kalinda and Alicia to communicate by telephone or to just miss each other—as in the antepenultimate episode when Kalinda went to the Alicia’s apartment to “speak to her personally,” only to learn that she was out.

I’m frankly surprised that some viewers feel stung by the finale’s technical deception. I hope no one tells them that all those scenes of people driving around in cars involve no actual movement; that the show’s trials aren’t filmed in a real courtroom; or that the Chicago-set show is made in New York. Superhero movies aren’t the only dramas that use green-screen work, and it seems naive to grumble about it. I suspect that many of the complaints are a pretext to establish that the author is aware of the rumored feud between Margulies and Panjabi, but since no one—not even well-connected Ausiello—knows the cause of the hostilities, The Good Wife team deserves praise for keeping a lid on its personnel issues.

All this isn’t to say that I don’t have my own frustrations with the recently concluded season. I’m glad to hear that Lemond Bishop has decided to leave the drug business, because I simply could not take another run-through of the storyline in which a beloved characters has to choose between a long prison sentence, losing their law license, or certain death at Bishop’s hands. At least three characters have faced this dilemma, and after much huffing and puffing, they all got a sudden, last-minute reprieve. Far too much of Season 6 was dedicated to Alicia’s campaign for state’s attorney—a position she was forced to give up almost immediately after she won it. And for reasons that were even less convincing than the farewell scene, Kalinda had become Bishop’s nanny/school pickup chauffeur. She spent so much time driving his son Dylan around, it’s hard to know when she managed to dig up information to save every single one of Lockhart, Agos, and Lee’s clients.Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images

Donald Trump isn’t accustomed to hearing prospective underlings say “No.” So it came as a shock when retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward—his first choice to replace Michael Flynn as national security adviser—told the president he’d have to think about the offer. It must have been a double shock when, a few days later, Harward turned him down flat.

The rejection is stunning in several ways that go well beyond the scope of Trump’s personal sensitivities. First, it is very unusual—almost unheard of—for a senior military officer, retired or otherwise, to turn down a request from the commander-in-chief.

Second, and largely for that reason, by rejecting the offer, Harward has provided cover to other officers, and to civilian national security analysts with a similar sense of patriotic duty, to turn down this president, too. Service, in this case, is not its own reward and by no stretch worth the sacrifice.

Third, the Financial Times, Washington Post, CNN, and other news outlets are reporting that Harward turned down the offer in part because Trump wouldn’t let him fire several officials who Flynn had hired for his staff and install his own team instead. This suggests that Trump is adamant on keeping certain people loyal to him—including Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News commentator who Trump admired. The news reports don’t mention whether Harward made demands about Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief political strategist who wrote the executive order that placed himself on the NSC Principals Committee and has created a parallel NSC structure called the Strategic Initiatives Group, comprising a few extreme right-wing associates. But any serious person would insist on the dismantling of this weird group as another condition for taking the job.

The national security adviser plays several roles. He or she chairs the Principals Committee, the interagency group of Cabinet secretaries and top military and intelligence officers who help make decisions on high matters of policy; coordinates the NSC staff, which includes a few dozen political appointees and a couple hundred professional analysts; and advises the president, to the extent the president wants to be advised. In other words, to make the job worthwhile, the adviser must have close access to the president and clear lines of authority over the national security bureaucracy.

Trump would not guarantee Harward this sort of authority, so Harward turned the job down. The Post reported that Harward was also reluctant to accept the offer for financial reasons, worried that leaving his job as a senior executive at Lockheed Martin would hurt his family. Yet few military officers—especially retired generals and admirals—let such factors get in the way of serving the president. CNN quoted one of Harward’s friends saying that, in mulling over the decision, he was persuaded most of all by the sheer dysfunction of Trump’s presidency, describing the job he was offered as “a shit sandwich.”

Harward would have come to the job with the experience of a warrior, a commander, an analyst, and a staff officer. In his 38 years as a Navy officer, he had been a SEAL, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, the representative of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the National Counterterrorism Center, and the director of strategy and policy on the National Security Council staff.

In other words, Trump was given a choice: cater to the loyalty and ambitions of his political operatives, who have no competence whatsoever in national security affairs, or install a professional who can build and maintain a functioning national security apparatus. He chose the former.

Harward would also have had a link to Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who was commander of U.S. Central Command when Harward was its deputy. It’s possible that some in Trump’s inner circle, especially Bannon, wouldn’t want there to be these sorts of ties, as they could be used to bypass the White House and circumvent his own power.

Trump may now have a hard time filling the position with anyone whose qualifications or prominence would help calm the jitters of allies worldwide—and foreign policy specialists here—who are wondering what the hell is going on with this president. At the moment, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a competent administrator who had been the NSC’s chief of staff, is the acting national security adviser, and it may be that Trump will have to settle on him as the successor.

Three weeks into his term, Trump heads a White House with three or four vacant power centers. He has no national security adviser, a half-full NSC staff, and hollow Defense and State Departments (where Trump has yet to nominate any deputy or undersecretaries), and the secretaries heading those departments—Mattis and Rex Tillerson—however smart and talented they may be, have never run a federal agency.Salt Lake City's new Indoor Football League team has been named the "Salt Lake Screaming Eagles" in a nod to World War II history.

The team, which left naming in the hands of internet voters, said in a release the moniker derives from the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division nickname. The original "Screaming Eagles" are "one of the most revered infantry divisions in world history" and played a role in both D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge, the release said.

The name was picked out of 300 entries, receiving 60 percent of the vote in the final round after the field was whittled down to 10 options — including "Utah Teamy McTeamface," "Utah Stormin' Mormons," and "Salt Lake Inversion."Video of Peñabots attacking the #SobrinaEPN hashtag

More than 75,000 automated Twitter accounts are being used in Mexico to combat protests and attack critics of the government, according to research presented by writer Erin Gallagher at the Chaos Communication Camp in Zehdenick, Germany earlier this month.

The automated accounts, known as Peñabots, first appeared in 2012 during the election of President Enrique Peña Nieto.

Peñabot activity during the election limited itself to spreading political propaganda in support of Peña's campaign, but, as Gallagher explained in her talk, "Mexican Botnet Dirty Wars," social media manipulation has since taken a darker turn.

Last December, towards the end of the massive but peaceful 1DMX protest in Mexico City in response to the murder of 43 students from Ayotzinapa, an anonymous Twitter user tweeted this map with the hashtag #RompeElMiedo (#BreakTheFear):

19:25 La zona en rojo, repleta de granaderos. Evitar la zona. FOTO: Anonymous HispanoDecember 2, 2014

"The zone in red, full of cops. Avoid the zone."

"This was a warning to tell protesters to avoid that red zone and safely exit the protest area," Gallagher said.

#RompeElMiedo is used by a network of journalists, activists and human rights defenders to document human rights abuses in Mexico during protests, she told the audience. Bots entered the hashtag 20-30 minutes later and filled the hashtag with spam. Gallagher called this tactic hashtag spamming, or hashtag poisoning.

"Arbitrary arrests began shortly thereafter," Gallagher said. "Activists were beaten. Protesters were beaten... In the end, the 1DMX protests ended in brutal police repression."

"It's possible that these folks would still have been beaten regardless of whether they received the notifications or not," Gallagher said, "but clearly this was putting them in real danger by not being able to access this hashtag."

Peñabots are also used to hack Twitter's trending topics in the country.

On February 25, 2015, a peaceful protest in Acapulco by the Mexican teachers' union CETEG ended in police attacking the protestors.

En un país donde los maestros son tratados como escoria y los delincuentes con respeto, algo no está bien. La Guerra se acercaFebruary 25, 2015

"In a country where teachers are treated like scum and criminals with respect, something is not right."

"The police beat the crap out of everyone," Gallagher said. "The injuries were brutal and the pictures went viral."

In response, she said, Peñabots pushed two fake trends. Hashtags #SoyAmanteDe (#ImALoverOf) and #DondeFirmoPara (#WhereDoISignFor) flooded Twitter, pushing the #Acapulco hashtag down to the tenth slot and eventually out of the trending bar.

Inorganic traffic of a fake trend. Image: Revolution News

Gallagher's research suggests that, on average, Peñabots promote 2-3 of these fake trends every day.

A similar tactic was used earlier this year in reaction to hashtag #SobrinaEPN (#NieceEPN). President Peña's niece landed a well-paid job with Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company. Many Mexicans considered this nepotism, and said so on Twitter.

Peñabots filled the hashtag with spam, which, Gallagher said, "is a censor in itself, as it drowns out the real conversation with spammy repeater tweets."

More worrying, however, she said, is that "they are also gaming the Twitter algorithm by gaming the novelty index. This triggers some sort of spam mechanism, causing the hashtag to be kicked out of the trending bar."

According to Gallagher's research, Peñabots also target individual journalists and activists for smear campaigns, death threats, and other forms of harassment.

The problem, she said, is that "social media is the new public square. Mexicans are relying on these networks to get their news out to the world and to communicate with each other... When these networks are manipulated, it is extremely damaging to Mexican society and free speech."

"This is information warfare," she added. "In Mexico, a hashtag is not just a hashtag, it's a way to make the invisible visible."

He made permanent his prior preliminary order preventing the state from carrying out its plan to deny 28 clinics the last $1.3 million in federal funds the state Department of Health had been sending their way for health services not tied to abortion.

The court pointed to the argument from plaintiffs that the loss of funding would endanger their ability to provide sexually transmitted disease and HIV testing, contraception, breast and cervical cancer screenings, infant mortality prevention, sex education, and other health services free of charge to patients.

“Plaintiffs maintain that the requirement to pay even a reduced fee will deter patients from seeking those potentially life-saving services,” Judge Barrett wrote. “Plaintiffs would also no longer have access to the juvenile justice and foster-care systems to teach teenagers about healthy relationships…

“Based on this evidence in the record, this Court finds the irreparable injury is continuing, and there is a lack of an adequate remedy at law because monetary damages could not compensate Plaintiffs for this injury,” he wrote.

The clinics have argued they’ve been singled out because, although all but three of the Ohio clinics do not perform abortions, they do make referrals. The three clinics that perform the procedure are in Columbus, Cincinnati, and the Cleveland suburb of Bedford Heights.

Federal and state laws already prohibit the use of tax dollars to pay for non-therapeutic abortions.

Judge Barrett had originally placed the law on hold in May and has temporarily extended his stay since then while he presided over hearings.

The state had argued that patients would still have access to the non-abortion services from other health clinics that would receive the $1.3 million in federal funding that would be diverted from Planned Parenthood clinics.

It maintained that since Ohio is legally permitted to refuse to directly fund abortions, it follows that it could also refuse funding to abortion providers for other services. Judge Barrett disagreed.

“There is nothing within the scope of these programs related to performing abortions,” he wrote. “Therefore, under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, (the law) cannot condition funding for these programs based on a recipient’s exercise of the right to free speech or association outside of these programs.”Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) sits next to retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn (L) as they attend an exhibition marking the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today) television news channel in Moscow, Russia, December 10, 2015.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump knew for weeks that national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled the White House about his contacts with Russia but did not immediately force him out, an administration spokesman said on Tuesday.

Trump was informed in late January that Flynn had not told Vice President Mike Pence the whole truth about conversations he had before Trump took office with Russia's ambassador to the United States, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.

Pence learned of the "incomplete information" that he received from Flynn when news reports surfaced late last week, spokesman Mark Lotter said on Tuesday.

Flynn quit on Monday after Trump asked for his resignation, and the president hopes to pick a new national security adviser by the end of the week, Spicer said.

The departure was another disruption for an administration already repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas since the Republican businessman assumed the presidency on Jan. 20.

The New York Times reported late on Tuesday that members of Trump's campaign and other associates had contact with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 presidential election, although U.S. officials told the newspaper they had not uncovered any evidence that Trump's associates colluded to disrupt the election.

U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called for a deeper inquiry into not just Flynn's actions but broader White House ties to Russia. Trump has long said that he would like improved relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trump only moved against Flynn because of news media attention, not concern about any wrongdoing.

"The reason they lost faith or trust in General Flynn only last night when they knew for weeks that he had been lying was that it became public," Schiff told MSNBC.

A timeline of events outlined by Spicer and a U.S. official showed that Trump had known for weeks about Flynn misleading the vice president.

Trump, a former reality TV star whose catchphrase was "You're fired!" has often boasted of his eagerness to get rid of subordinates. He was not quick to fire Flynn, a strong advocate of a better relations with Russia and a hard line against Islamist militants.

The Justice Department warned the White House in late January that Flynn had misled Pence by denying to him that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, a potentially illegal act, a U.S. official said.

Flynn did talk about sanctions with the diplomat, whose calls were recorded by U.S. intelligence officials, the official said. But Pence went on television in mid-January and denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Flynn in his early days as Trump's national security adviser regarding his conversations with the Russian ambassador, a White House official confirmed.

Spicer stressed that the administration believed there was no legal problem with Flynn's conversations with Kislyak, but rather an issue over the president's trust in his adviser.

The turning point, Spicer said, was a Washington Post story published on Thursday in which Flynn, through a spokesman, said for the first time he could not say with 100 percent certainty that he had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.

Spicer said the Justice Department sought to notify the White House counsel on Jan. 26 about the discrepancies in Flynn's accounts.

"The White House counsel informed the president immediately. The president asked them to commit a review of whether there was a legal situation there," Spicer told reporters, saying it was a "trust issue."

Flynn's conversations with the ambassador took place around the time that then-President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia, charging that Moscow had used cyber attacks to try to influence the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor.

A U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate in kind for Obama's Dec. 29 order expelling 35 Russian suspected spies and sanctioning Russian spy agencies, that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power.

LEGAL FALLOUT?

Flynn's discussions with the Russian diplomat could potentially have been in violation of a law known as the Logan Act, which bans private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments about disputes or controversies with the United States. There have been no modern prosecutions using the 1799 law.

"The Logan Act is a red herring. The better question is whether he made any false statements to the FBI at any point, which would be a much bigger deal," said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, adding the fallout would likely be "political" in nature.

Flynn could also face legal trouble if it emerges that he violated other federal laws in his communications with the Russians, said Andrew Kent, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in New York. The Espionage Act criminalizes sharing information with foreign governments.

Democrats, who do not have control of Congress, clamored for probes into Flynn, and asked how much Trump knew about his connections to Russia.

U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation of potential criminal violations surrounding the resignation of Flynn.

"What I am calling for is an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal actions," Schumer told reporters, saying such a probe could not be led by newly installed U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions or White House lawyers.

Two leading Senate Republicans, Bob Corker and John Cornyn, said the Intelligence Committee should investigate Flynn's contacts with Russia.

But the highest-ranking Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, sidestepped questions about whether lawmakers should look into Flynn's Russia ties, saying he would leave it to the Trump administration to explain the circumstances behind Flynn's departure.

A broader investigation of the White House and its ties to Russia is not possible without the cooperation either of the Justice Department or the Republican-led Congress.

Russia's aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia make any White House attempt to embrace Putin problematic.

Senator John McCain, a leading Republican voice on foreign relations, said Flynn's resignation raised questions about the administration’s intentions toward Putin’s Russia.

BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENTS

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109 367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:

Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.

Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.

Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.

Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:

(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;

(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;

(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;

(d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and

(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.

Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) "Asylum officer" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).

(b) "Southern border" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.

(c) "Border States" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.

(d) Except as otherwise noted, "the Secretary" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.

(e) "Wall" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.

(f) "Executive department" shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.

(g) "Regulations" shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.

(h) "Operational control" shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.

Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:

(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;

(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;

(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and

(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.

Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.

(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.

(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.

Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as "catch and release," whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.

Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.

Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.

Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.

Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).

(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.

(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.

Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.

(a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.

(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.

(c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).

(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.

(e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.

Sec. 14. Government Transparency. The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily understandable by the public.

Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order.

Sec. 16. Hiring. The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.

Sec. 17. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

January 25, 2017.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

A daily roundup of the biggest stories in right-wing media.

On Monday night, National Security Adviser Mike Flynn formally resigned from his post, following reports that he had communicated with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak—and subsequently lied to Mike Pence about that conversation. “The move comes after Flynn was unable to shake growing calls for his resignation,” Breitbart wrote. For much of Tuesday, the Drudge Report led with a picture of Flynn over a link reading, “Happy Valentine’s Day.”

Breitbart acknowledged “the resignation was warranted,” since Flynn “provided Vice President Mike Pence with ‘incomplete information.’ ” But the piece went on to argue that the sanctions supposedly under discussion were “largely bogus,” since the Obama administration had imposed them “to substantiate the Democratic Party’s sore-loser conspiracy theory that Russia was responsible for electing Donald Trump.” Breitbart warned that the Flynn case points to something more sinister, potentially indicating “that the government was not merely monitoring the communications of Russian diplomats, but of the Trump transition team itself.”

The Daily Caller ran a short post inquiring as to whether Flynn deserved to be fired, quickly concluding that “either way, he is still a genuine American hero, whose ideas are worth listening to” before presenting a four-paragraph promotional description of Flynn’s recent book, The Field of Fight.

Conservative outlets soon turned to speculation about Flynn’s possible replacement, often focusing on the military titles of various candidates. “Trump Eyes Two Generals, an Admiral to Replace Flynn,” a LifeZette headline read, while the Daily Caller reported, “President Donald Trump is considering three former high ranking military officials for the post of National Security Advisor.”

That post noted that one of the names under consideration—David Petraeus—might be a “fraught” choice, “given his current probation for lying to federal authorities about illegally disclosing classified information to his mistress.” National Review expanded on that issue in an article by David French simply titled, “Say No to David Petraeus.” French wrote:

Finally, if the Trump administration wants to maintain a shred of credibility, the same team that hyped and stoked the “lock her up” chant should be the last team to hire (as national-security adviser, no less) a man who actually pled guilty to mishandling classified information. It would be an act of breathtaking cynicism, even for Donald Trump.

Breitbart proposed that other staff shake-ups might be on the way, starting with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. In a lengthy article with reporting attributed to multiple anonymous sources, it linked Priebus to many of the administration’s most public problems, including “the rollout of the immigration executive order,” the timing of Jeff Sessions’ confirmation hearings, and, most critically, the ongoing presence of Obama allies in key positions.* The article, which was teased from the homepage with the headline “WH Sources: Priebus Letting ‘Sleeper Cell’ Obama Holdovers Undermine Trump Admin,” noted:

Many other potential [Sally] Yateses—holdovers from the Obama administration who have found their way into spots throughout the Trump administration—await throughout government.

“They’re hiding like sleeper cells everywhere,” one source said.

Many outlets also echoed a Tuesday morning tweet from the president, who asked, “[W]hy are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?”

The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017

Elaborating, the Daily Caller wrote of the intercepted Flynn call, “The information in the call transcripts is said to not be classified. But the actual transcript reportedly is classified given that it reveals the U.S. government’s methods for surveilling foreign government officials.” LifeZette cited North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows at length in an article titled, “Meadows: Leakers Are ‘People Searching for Power.’ ”

This anti-leaker thread also spread on conservative Facebook pages:Alex Wong/Getty Images

In 2015’s Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court ruled that states must provide marriage rights to same-sex couples “on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.” So it may be rather surprising that in 2017, some conservative states continue to insist that they can deny gay couples the rights and benefits granted to heterosexual couples—simply because same-sex spouses are of the same sex. One particular flashpoint is birth certificates, and the latest battle occurred in South Carolina, where the government claimed it need not list same-sex parents on their child’s birth certificate. Fortunately, on Wednesday, a federal judge shot down this bizarre assertion, ordering the state to list same-sex couples on birth certificates. But this battle is far from over, and its final resolution will likely have to come from the Supreme Court itself.

Before we get into the meat of Wednesday’s ruling, a quick primer on birth certificates is in order. In the United States today, birth certificates are not some mystical recognition of an immutable genetic truth. They are a legal document whose primary purpose is identification of both the individual who was born and the family unit in which he or she belongs. That is why states list adoptive couples on their adopted child’s birth certificate and why states have long listed the birth mother’s husband as the baby’s parent—even if he is known not to be the child’s biological father. These certificates are vital records, and the government views them as proof of a child’s actual parentage, not a literal indication of who sired and birthed the baby.

With that in mind, let’s turn to the South Carolina case, which arose after Jacqueline Carson gave birth to twins. Jacqueline is lawfully married to a woman, Casy Carson. South Carolina typically lists a birth mother’s spouse as the child’s second parent—again, even if that spouse is known not to be the child’s biological parent. But because Casy Carson is a woman, the state refused to list her as the twins’ second parent. The couple sued in federal court, alleging a violation of their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment as interpreted in Obergefell.

And of course, they won, because that’s the outcome that Obergefell plainly requires. As U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis recognized, listing a birth mother’s spouse as her child’s second parent is one of the “terms and conditions” of civil marriage in South Carolina. It is a benefit provided to opposite-sex couples; it therefore cannot be denied to same-sex couples simply because they are gay. Amusingly, South Carolina didn’t bother to argue otherwise in court, declining to contest the Carsons’ assertion that its actions violated the 14th Amendment or to appeal Lewis’ decision. Instead, the state will enter into a consent decree, agreeing to list same-sex spouses on birth certificates moving forward.Alex Wong/Getty Images and Mark Wilson/Getty Images

By design, the U.S. Senate is a deliberative body in which members have every opportunity to speak their minds on the subject at hand. There are exceptions tied to decorum: Attack or impugn a colleague and the chamber reserves the right to strip speaking privileges from the offending member. On Tuesday night, it did just that to Elizabeth Warren, silencing the Massachusetts senator in the midst of final debate over Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Trump’s nominee for attorney general.*

Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent.

This extraordinary step was initiated by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader. “The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the chair,” declared McConnell during Warren’s remarks, invoking a rule that prohibits debating senators from ascribing “to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator.” When Warren asked the chair, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, a Republican, to continue speaking, McConnell raised a second objection, and Daines directed the Massachusetts senator to take her seat. A party-line vote of 49 Republicans to 43 Democrats made the decision final: Elizabeth Warren would leave the floor, silenced from further debate.

What did Elizabeth Warren say? How did she “impugn the motives and conduct” of the senator from Alabama? She read a letter. Specifically, Warren read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King, widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on the subject of then–federal prosecutor Jeff Sessions, submitted in opposition to his nomination for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. It was because of the letter that McConnell sought to silence Warren. And it’s in revisiting that letter that we can see how McConnell was right to be shook. Not because King was mistaken, but because her 30-year-old indictment of Jeff Sessions is now an indictment of the entire Republican Party.

In Sessions, King saw a throwback to the Jim Crow officials who fought to disenfranchise black Americans throughout the South. “Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge," wrote King in her 10-page statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which ultimately rejected Sessions in a 10–8 vote with two Republicans joining eight Democrats in voting against Ronald Reagan’s nominee. “Mr. Sessions’ conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights law, indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and judgment to be a federal judge.”

King went on to describe Sessions’ role in pursuing and prosecuting a trio of black voting rights activists in Perry County, Alabama:

“Mr. Sessions sought to punish older black civil rights activists ... who had been key figures in the civil rights movement in the 1960’s. These were persons who, realizing the potential of the absentee vote among Blacks, had learned to use the process within the bounds of legality and had taught others to do the same. The only sin they committed was being too successful in gaining votes.”

King detailed clear abuses of authority, from selective prosecution—ignoring allegations of similar behavior by whites—to pressuring and intimidating witnesses. “Many elderly blacks were visited multiple times by the FBI who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand jury in Mobile when they could more easily have testified at a grand jury twenty miles away in Selma. These voters, and others, have announced they are now never going to vote again,” King wrote.

For McConnell and his Republican colleagues, King’s critique of Sessions’ work was a personal attack. He saw this well-grounded accusation of racism as worse than the actions it described. And so he called for silence. “She was warned,” said McConnell of Warren. “She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”

Despite the pivotal role the letter played in Sessions’ confirmation hearing in 1986, the then-chair of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, never entered it into the congressional record. If not for thorough digging by the Washington Post’s Wesley Lowery and others, it might have been lost to history. Now that we have the letter, however, we can see how relevant it is not just to Sessions’ bid for the attorney general’s office but as a judgment on the Republican Party as a whole.

Across the country, Republicans have made voter suppression a priority, targeting blacks and other disadvantaged groups, shielded from the Voting Rights Act by a GOP majority on the Supreme Court that gutted the law and opened the gates to a flood of new obstacles and new restrictions. Wisconsin Republicans passed strict ID requirements and closed polling places in the state’s urban centers. Alabama Republicans imposed similar ID requirements and then closed Department of Motor Vehicle offices in predominantly black counties. North Carolina Republicans targeted black Americans with what one court called “surgical precision,” slashing the kinds of voting used by black voters while imposing strict requirements for identification, excluding forms of ID most commonly used by black people in the state. At this moment in Virginia, Republican lawmakers are pushing a constitutional amendment to strengthen the state’s already-harsh felon disenfranchisement law—a law that, as early as 2016, disenfranchised nearly one-quarter of all black Virginians.

Thirty years ago, Republicans seemed embarrassed by Sessions’ efforts to keep black Americans from the polls—embarrassed enough, at least, to capitulate to the Democratic opposition. Today, those efforts are central to the GOP’s agenda, the first steps taken whenever and wherever the party takes power. Already President Trump has promised a commission on the “voter fraud” that he blames for his popular vote loss.

It’s no wonder McConnell sought to silence Warren. More than a critique of a younger Jeff Sessions, King’s letter is an indictment of the present-day Republican Party, a party that has forsaken its heritage as the “party of Lincoln” and adopted the cause of Lincoln’s antagonists—of Lincoln’s enemies. Under Donald Trump, the GOP has completed its transformation into the party of white resentment, the party of white reaction, the party of Redemption.The White House confirmed Sunday it is considering issuing a new order on immigration now that President Donald Trump's travel ban has been halted as it makes its way through the courts.

"Right now we are considering and pursuing all options," presidential aide Stephen Miller told Fox television.

He said the next step would be either filing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, defending the merits of the order in lower courts or issuing a new one.

"The president's powers here are beyond question," said Miller, who is considered one of the driving forces behind Trump's first actions on immigration.

Miller insisted the president has the power to keep some people from entering the United States.

"We are contemplating new and additional actions to ensure that immigration is not a vehicle for admitting people into our country that are hostile to its nation and its values," Miller said.

The order that Trump issued abruptly on January 27 halts resettlement of all refugees for 120 days and that of Syrian refugees indefinitely.

It also bars for 90 days the entry of nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries.

A federal judge in Seattle issued a stay against the order on February 3. Then a three judge appeals panel in San Francisco voted unanimously last week against reinstating Trump's ban. Among other things, it rejected the argument that the president's actions in the area of immigration cannot be reviewed by the courts.

The Trump ban was supposed to be in place while the government comes up with a new system of so-called "extreme vetting" of people seeking entry visas. This could include checks on their social media accounts, according to John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security.

"Our immigration system should not be a vehicle for admitting people who have anything but love in their hearts for this nation and this constitution," said Miller, who is 31.

"It is a message that I want the world to hear today. This country will protect its borders. It will protect its people," Miller said.

The idea of the White House issuing a modified immigration order that would survive scrutiny in the courts does not convince Democrats, who from the outset have charged that Trump's order is simply anti-Muslim and plays into the hands of extremists.

"It will be used as a recruitment for terrorist organizations. It will put Americans at greater risk traveling abroad," said Democratic Senator Ben Cardin.Larry Busacca/Getty Images

Rachel Nichols’ career as a sports journalist has taken her from the Washington Post to CNN to ESPN, where she currently hosts basketball show and podcast The Jump weekdays at 3 p.m. Eastern. Nichols has also covered a number of other sports, including football and hockey, but is perhaps best known for her willingness to spar with powerful figures, as can be seen in her confrontational 2014 interview about domestic violence with the boxer Floyd Mayweather and her testy exchange with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that same year.

Isaac Chotiner Isaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer.

Amidst a very enjoyable NBA season, and with much commentary about the politicization of sports (and sports journalists), it seemed like an opportune time to talk with Nichols. During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed varying responses to women in the sports world, the enormous pressure on LeBron James, and whether athletes will visit the Trump White House.

Isaac Chotiner: How do you think sports journalism has changed since you got into the business two decades ago, and how does that change reflect itself in your work today?

Rachel Nichols: Wow, that’s a huge question. [Laughs.] A good question, but a big one.

This is like a Trump press conference. You can just choose—

I can take out what I want to answer? If it’s really like a Trump press conference—well, I shouldn’t say this for on the record, but you know what I am thinking. I am just going to telegraph that to you.

Yeah, I mean, everything has changed. I went to journalism school thinking I was going to be a newspaper reporter for the rest of my life, and the idea of sports writers on television as a crossover—it was certainly happening, but it wasn’t happening in the way that we see it now. In my head at that time, you went to be a television person and that meant having one set of skills and one sort of focus, or you went to be a newspaper person and that meant having one set of skills and one sort of focus.

There was also a really hard line between reporters and columnists, right? Opinionists versus straight reporters. I think that changed a lot. I think there is a lot more room in the middle now. Not only has the line between newspapers and television blurred to almost unrecognizability, but then of course you have the internet come in and everybody has a television in their pocket. Everybody can be on television in that way if they “broadcast” to enough people on Twitter or Facebook. The barriers to entry for people who are doing things that people like are much lower. I think that everything has changed and everything’s going to continue to change.

Did print journalism change your approach to television or change your approach to interviews?

There’s no question that being a print journalist taught me how to do everything that I do on television today, and that’s part of why I don’t think there is much of a line. To me, it is all one big skillset. On the show that I am the host of, I write what is essentially a column every day and then read that as a monologue on the top of the show. If I didn’t come from a print or writing background, I don’t think I would have been able to wield that the way that I do. I think it definitely affects the way I interview people in a press conference situation, but also in a one-on-one situation. When I sit down with someone for an interview, it’s not just a random series of questions thrown at someone. You are building a story and a narrative and it’s a quest for information.

I am not building anything with this call.

Just a random series of questions? Well, I can’t vouch for everyone. [Laughs.] But to me that is something I definitely picked up in print and carry with me to television today.

How have sports—the players, the coaches, the teams, the associations—changed in the attitude towards female reporters in the past two decades, if you think they have changed?

Yeah, it’s definitely changed. It’s like anything else, right? People are comfortable with what they see and what’s around them, and the more women who have been in sports, the more women athletes and fans see and are around, the more comfortable they feel with us. And I think that has only made the profession and the sports world better.

What about in terms of the place you work, and you don’t need to speak of ESPN per se—

That is where I work, so …

I’ve heard that. I was just wondering how ESPN has changed, or more broadly men in journalism, and has the way they deal with women colleagues changed?

Yeah, I think what I just said for the previous thing. It’s the same answer. Easier to transcribe.

What have you made of the increasing politicization of sports, both in terms of your job covering sports and in terms of journalists themselves expressing opinions?

I think there are a couple intersecting lines that are all meeting up right now. I think one of the big things about sports is that it is one of the few places right now that everyone still meets and participates in. You can look at all the polls. The number of people who go to religious services every week has declined; the number of people who vote, frankly, is not as high as one might hope; the books we read, the movies we watch, the television shows. It is very diversified. Part of that is the separation of people in this country, and part of that is we have so many more choices now. Sports is the one place where you have people from all across the political and ideological spectrum participating. And therefore it is one of the few big tents where you can have this exchange of ideas between people who aren’t just echoing each other.

I think another thing you are seeing is a rise in athlete activism. Certainly there was a time in the 1960s and 1970s where we saw incredible activism from athletes. And then the tendency to do that went more dormant for a while.

As athletes have made more money frankly, and they are less beholden to any one sponsor, they have felt more freedom to speak their minds just like anyone else. I think LeBron James, frankly, has had a big role in that. Because he had been speaking more on social and political issues when he was with the Miami Heat, people thought, Oh, if LeBron can do it, we can follow his lead. And then you have the journalists, with the wave of more opinions in media. Those are three big pillars really coming together to build the building you are talking about.

How comfortable are you expressing your own opinions?

Well, I now have a job where I am supposed to do that. It is part of what I get paid to do, so obviously I am going to want to do that. There was a time in my life where I was a more straightforward reporter, and I wouldn’t have done that. I also think there is a huge distinction between commenting on social issues, or issues that have moral implications, and “politics.” So much gets shoved under that umbrella of politics. I still don’t think you will go on any sports television channel and hear any host or commentator or anchor picking out a particular politician or lobbying for a particular bill. It is not that targeted. It’s more big issues and things that target the moral fabric of our society.

After the Muslim ban, it seemed like there were a lot of journalists at ESPN and elsewhere who were making comments that were anti-Trump because they felt like the policy was connecting to larger moral issues.

“You just can’t say, ‘We can’t talk about it, it’s politics.’ It’s actually affecting people who play.”

There is a big difference between commenting on a policy, and the moral implications of it, and commenting on, “This person is an idiot.” Those personal attacks—you see that on your friends’ Facebook pages; I don’t think you see that on television as much from sports people. But yeah, when the Muslim travel ban was put into effect, it affected the NBA. You are talking about a league where people cross the border—the Toronto Raptors—all the time, several times per week.

You are talking about a couple players who have passports from countries that were on the banned list. And when the State Department put out its initial guidelines, there was obviously a lot of confusion, but there were several State Department officials telling reporters that people with dual passports would be not allowed to come back and forth, and one of those players was out of the country at the time because he was playing the Toronto Raptors. You just can’t say, “We can’t talk about it, it’s politics.” It’s actually affecting people who play the game.

Do you think the NBA team that wins the title will go to the White House?

I don’t know. I am curious to see. My guess is that it will probably be a lot like what is happening with the Patriots, where different people will make their own decision, and if enough of the team doesn’t want to go, then maybe you will see the whole team decide not to go. I imagine you will see sports organizations leave it up to their individual players, as by the way they [did] when the last president was in office.

Some quick basketball questions: Why does the media keep saying that Carmelo Anthony is so good at basketball?

Why does the media keep saying that Carmelo Anthony is so good at basketball? Uh, I don’t even know how to answer that question. Because he is good at basketball? [Laughs.]

Is he really, though? I’m a Rockets fan.

I’m standing 20 feet from Tracy McGrady right now.

He’s my hero, please let him know. Do you think the media has, broadly speaking, been unfair to LeBron James over the past 15 years?

I think LeBron is probably the most scrutinized athlete of his generation because he came up in an era of increased media and social media. I have always been impressed with the way he has handled it. I think this whole generation of athletes has a lot more on their plate, and when we compare eras, one thing I don’t always see being taken into account is that a guy like LeBron James has to play with the kind of scrutiny from much more media and social media and from Joe-on-the-corner chiming in in a way that Michael Jordan didn’t have to. It’s a lot, but hey, it comes with the territory, and they get paid a lot of money to do it.

If you are ever elected president and have to staff your Cabinet with one NBA player, who would it be?FLINT, MI -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County -- something researchers have sought throughout the Flint water crisis.

But instead of closing the book on what caused the outbreak that killed 12 people in 2014 and 2015, the scientific matches instead raise new questions about whether Flint's water system was the source of the outbreak.

Molecular testing by the CDC in late 2016 established the connection between a water sample taken from McLaren-Flint hospital and three sputum samples from patients who were diagnosed with Legionnaires', officials with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services told MLive-The Flint Journal.

State orders McLaren to turn over any requested Legionnaires' records

DHHS learned of a genetic match between the water and Legionnaires' patients only last month, and days later, notified McLaren and the Genesee County Health Department that each may be required to turn over additional water samples and other records to the state.

But while the state has focused on McLaren since the genetic links were found, other experts say the three matches, including one victim who was never a patient at McLaren, suggest that Legionella thrived throughout the Flint water system, making it the real culprit in Legionnaires' deaths and illnesses in 2014 and 2015.

Seventy-eight people in the county contracted the disease during those two years, during parts of which the city used the Flint River as its source of water without treating it to make it less corrosive to lead pipes and plumbing.

"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread," said Dr. Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a national expert on the disease. "The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system."

On Tuesday, Feb. 14, the state ratcheted up pressure on the hospital, ordering McLaren to turn over information related to its Legionnaires' cases and releasing a letter from a hospital contractor that claimed "the supply water coming from the city of Flint is not contributing to the Legionella issues at McLaren and any issues are likely internal to the hospital system."

Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014

Stout was hired by McLaren to assist the hospital in defending itself against a $100-million lawsuit and against state claims that its failings caused what the state calls the "largest healthcare-associated Legionnaires' outbreak known" in the United States.

Amy Pruden, a Virginia Tech university professor and one of five authors of a July 2016 peer-reviewed study on Legionella in Flint water, said the three genetic matches could represent how widespread the bacteria was in city water.

Pruden's study found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient who's clinical isolates -- or bacteria -- matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there "suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere."

The state confirmed the CDC testing showed the lack of a connection between one of the three patients and McLaren, but the agency has not previously released details of that case.

Bureaucrats developed warning about Legionnaires' outbreak, but never made it public

In contrast, MDHHS used the genetic matches between the hospital and the infected patients who stayed at McLaren as one reason for an order issued Feb. 14 that claims McLaren-Flint's water system "is a nuisance, unsanitary condition, or cause of illness" in the community.

Angela Minicuci, a spokeswoman for MDHHS, said state medical officials were told of the CDC testing, which matched a clinical sample from from a November 2016 Legionnaires' patient to a water sample taken in August 2016 at McLaren.

Clinical samples from two other Legionnaires' patients, both diagnosed in 2015, "were also highly related to the McLaren water sample," Minicuci said in an email to MLive-The Flint Journal.

The CDC declined to answer questions about its testing, the results of which were turned over to DHHS in January, according to Minicuci.

Legionnaires' survivors still picking up pieces after deadly outbreak

Dr. Eden Wells, the state's chief medical executive, said DHHS hasn't been able to determine with certainty how the Legionnaires' patient never hospitalized at McLaren was exposed to the same bacteria strain found in hospital water, calling it an open "medical detective case (that) requires a lot of sleuthing."

"Do we know what the linkage is?" Wells asked. "Not at this time."

Among the possible explanations for the genetic match, according to DHHS, are an association that was never identified during the case investigation, such as a visit to McLaren rather than a hospitalization or exposure to the hospital's cooling towers.

"Cooling towers are always high on our list of concerns when trying to identify a potential Legionella exposure source," Minicuci said. "We don't have any indication or environmental samples to show that this strain is elsewhere in the community, though that's not impossible, but we do have two healthcare-associated cases over a two-year period that match the the McLaren sample, as well as this case strain."





Clinical samples from all three patients came from the infected sputum -- their infected phlegm -- that's typically collected by a cough into a cup or obtained by a hospital from the throat or lung, after which it is cultured for routine bacteria with a specialized culture for Legionella, according to DHHS.

A clinical isolate is a bacteria, or other infectious agent such as a virus or a parasite, that is isolated or grown from a patient's specimen.

Pruden said even though the water sample matching the patient isolates was collected months after Flint discontinued use of the Flint River, the same strain of the bacteria can persist in plumbing even after Flint was switched back to Lake Huron water.

The professor said the genetic matches are "very relevant to the continuing conversation of demonstrating whether or not switching to the Flint River water triggered the countywide spike in Legionnaires' and working toward figuring out exactly where and how the patients were likely exposed and infected with the disease."

"Despite the difference in time, it shows that a strain that is native to McLaren plumbing matched the strains found in patients," Pruden said in an email. "It shows the that strains of Legionella living in Flint tap water matched with strains found in patients. However ... we don't know if this same strain is found widely in other parts of Flint."

Pruden's report on Legionella and Flint last year studied both single-story homes and businesses in Flint and Flint Township and at Hurley Medical Center and McLaren, both of which are located in areas of the city where water is more likely to be stagnant.

DHHS says McLaren was associated with 21 Legionella cases in 2014, 29 in 2015, and two in 2016; the vast majority of hospital-related Laegionnaires' cases; and 10 of 12 deaths from the disease.

Although no Legionella was found in Flint Township, which never used Flint River water, the bacteria was found in Flint tap water at various locations, the study says, supporting the theory that interrupted corrosion control in Flint caused a release of iron, nutrients and depleted chlorine residual into the entire distribution system, driving the abundance of Legionella.

Minicuci said the Flint water system should have been assumed to have Legionella, "and high-risk facilities should closely monitor the water coming into their facility and take steps to prevent exposures to their vulnerable patients."

Hospitals and large institutional buildings are known to be particularly susceptible to Legionella colonization, according to Pruden's study.

McLaren said in a statement Feb. 14 that the state "provided absolutely no support in 2014 and 2015" as evidence piled up that Legionella was a problem in Flint water.

Not only was the city being run by a state-appointed emergency manager when the decision was made to change water source, special prosecutors also allege that employees from the state Departments of Environmental Quality and DHHS allowed problems with lead and Legionella to occur and continue by failing to do their jobs in accordance with state law.

"Now that criminal charges have been made against several state and city employees and additional indictments are possible, the state is taking an aggressive role in retroactively casting blame for cases it knew about -- and did nothing about -- for years," McLaren's statement says.

"Despite the fact that dozens of Legionnaires' disease cases have been reported in patients that have had absolutely no contact with our facilities, and despite the growing consensus among public health and infectious disease specialists that the city's use of the Flint River as a water source is the prime contributor to our community's Legionnaires' disease epidemic, the state refuses to broaden its perspective and hold itself and others accountable for the inaction of prior years," the hospital's statement says.

Public health officials identified the Flint River as a potential source of the city's Legionnaires' outbreak as early as 2014, but city, county, state and federal officials never told the public until more than a year later.

Gov. Rick Snyder also claimed he was left in the dark about the possible connection, and his emergency managers continued to use the river as a source of water until connections between spikes in lead levels and in the blood of Flint children were uncovered late in 2015.In just the first few weeks of the new administration we have seen significant changes to policy. But here’s one you might have missed: Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. and Terrell McSweeny of the Federal Trade Commission write in Future Tense that basic consumer-privacy rules enacted by the Federal Communications Commission just a few months ago are already under threat. They write, “Broadband providers potentially have access to every bit of data that flows from a consumer. That type of access demands a set of rules that matches the long held expectations of Americans—that we should have the freedom to control access to the most sensitive information about our daily lives.”Photo: Larry Busacca/Getty Images

For a ceremony that unironically asks people to refer to it as “music’s biggest night,” this year’s Grammy Awards sure felt like a referendum on its own place in the business. For years we tossed the Recording Academy the keys to the kingdom of music-industry prestige, and frankly, they did whatever they wanted, getting as much right as they did glaringly wrong. In 1973 America beat the Eagles for Best New Artist. In 1989, Jethro Tull beat Metallica to the inaugural Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Performance award, a move that upset fans so badly it was split in two the next year. Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley never won Grammys. Taylor Swift has taken home Album of the Year twice.

The last five years have seen an uptick in pushback between artists, fans, and the Academy with regard to representation for artists of color, who had begun to feel squeezed out of both cross-genre categories like Album, Record, and Song of the Year, as well as genre-specific ones. In 2014, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’s The Heist swept all of the rap categories when many felt Kendrick Lamar’s critically revered good kid, m.A.A.d city deserved the merit, sparking an awkward, public exchange between both rappers and a dialogue about the stewardship of the show that seemed to lead to better balance the next year (Taylor’s 1989 Album of the Year victory over Kendrick’s inarguably superior To Pimp a Butterfly notwithstanding).

Lately, the Grammys’ most vocal critic has been Kanye West. West criticized last year’s show with a withering string of tweets full of earnest concern (“I think the Grammys are important!!!” “Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again”) to withering disapproval. News that Kanye would be skipping the show this year despite multiple nominations for last winter’s The Life of Pablo suggested that his input wasn’t heeded. West’s absence, taken with Frank Ocean’s refusal to submit his music for awards and the no-shows of Album of the Year nominees Drake and Justin Bieber, felt like a vote of no confidence that, as the night unfurled, would prove prescient.

The Grammys made do with the remaining talent in strange ways. Puzzlingly, this meant doubling up star power on nearly all of the performances, forcing big-deal Grammy Moments that collapsed under the weight of their expectations when they weren’t confounding viewers with the randomness. Country singer Kelsea Ballerini and Danish soul act Lukas Graham performed a mash-up of their singles “Peter Pan” and “7 Years” that ended in singer Lukas Forchhammer overpowering the plaintive Ballerini, even though hers was the better song. Later, Alicia Keys was brought out during country newcomer Maren Morris’s “My Church,” where she ran up intensity and pitch problems in equal measure. The best mash-up was the weirdest: Lady Gaga joined Metallica on their recent “Moth to Flame” and killed it, although problems with James Hetfield’s mic left him upset enough to throw his guitar across the stage to a tech as he left the stage.

Just as quirky as the mash-ups were the tribute performances. Bruno Mars and the Time served Prince well, but not everyone had so firm a grasp on their source material. An all-star tribute to the Bee Gees turned into a wail-off between Demi Lovato and Tori Kelly, before the performance was brought back to earth by Little Big Town, a vocal group that understands the legendary Gibb brothers’ disco and AOR pop underpinnings despite working primarily within the confines of country music. Adele led a George Michael tribute with a shockingly dour reading of his bubbly 1996 single “Fastlove” that she restarted partway through, fearing a repeat of last year’s technical difficulties. The reboot didn’t lift the mood or shake the inappropriateness of playing a song so clearly about the joys of free love and gay cruising like a plodding tearjerker.

Crowning Adele would turn out to be the theme of the night, as she swept Record, Song, and Album of the Year, among others. But her performance of “Fastlove” and the unimaginatively staged show-opening trip through the ages-old “Hello” offered proof that she’s a bit of a bore as a pop star in 2017 while revealing her as catnip for an Academy membership that seems to run more musically conservative than the general public. Beyoncé, on the other hand, arrived very pregnant and took the show by siege with a ten-minute arrangement of poetry, special effects, back-up dancers, and Lemonade ballads that solidified her guiding hand in the new ways people absorb event pop albums … only to get shut out of all the major categories. Adele herself could barely stand to accept the Album of the Year nod over Lemonade, and sobbed through her speech while Beyoncé cried gracefully in the front row, having lost in all the music categories she was nominated in but one, in spite of producing one of the year’s most indelible cultural artifacts.

The fallout trickled downward: The attempt both to placate Bey’s audience with an R&B category win while spreading accolades between Drake, Solange, Maxwell, and others ultimately meant shutting out Kanye, Rihanna, and Anderson .Paak. Rap and R&B fans won’t be the only angry ones today: talk to a country fan about outsiders Pentatonix winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance or any of the dozen rock fandoms shut out by the corrective, posthumous near-sweep of the rock and alternative categories pulled by David Bowie’s genius Blackstar after over 30 years of the Academy stiffing the living legend on music awards.

See, the better your genre gets in a year, the more of a bloodbath the Grammys become. The excellence of one album can come at a cost to peers, although sometimes a sweep is well deserved. Chance the Rapper is an example of the Grammys bending with the times and getting something very right; after successfully petitioning the Academy to kill the for-sale clause in the Grammy eligibility rule book, he took home three awards for the still-free Coloring Book and thanked mixtape maestro DJ Drama for his service to the medium. In a perfect world this opens up an avenue for further acclaim for mixtapes, although it would be foolhardy to expect an Academy that awarded Drake Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Hotline Bling,” a song that doesn’t contain any raps, to get it more than they do now.

Chance’s Best New Artist windfall was heartening, but the nagging sense that a landmark year for black music couldn’t pull cross-genre wins past it recalls a remark Kanye made at a Grammy post-show event the last time Beyoncé lost out on Album of the Year, when Beck’s passable Morning Phase beat out the vastly superior Beyoncé in 2015: “At this point we tired of it, because what happens is when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats in music, you’re disrespectful to inspiration.” In a recent back-and-forth with Grammy producers who insulted his 2013 ceremony performance, Frank Ocean was more pointed: “Use the old gramophone to actually listen, bro, I’m one of the best alive. And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it.” Minutes after the show was over, Solange tweeted Frank’s Grammy rebuke in solidarity. Where do we go from here? Back to basics.

1989 was the first year a rap artist was awarded a Grammy, but true to form, the show asked for more than it intended to give. The Academy wanted hip-hop to be a part of the show but had no intention of airing the presentation of its inaugural hip-hop award. In response, a group of rap’s biggest artists at the time — including Will Smith, who won the award as one half of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Public Enemy, Salt-n-Pepa, and more — announced they were skipping the show. “You go to school for 12 years,” Smith said allegorically, “they give you your diploma, and they deny you that walk down the aisle.” In 2017, hip-hop gets to walk the aisle, but there aren’t enough diplomas. Perhaps it’s time for a bigger walkout.Image copyright Getty Images

US President Donald Trump has agreed to honour the long-standing "One China" policy after previously placing it in doubt. The BBC explains this hugely sensitive diplomatic tightrope.

What is the 'One China' policy?

It is the diplomatic acknowledgement of China's position that there is only one Chinese government. Under the policy, the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day.

The One China policy is a key cornerstone of Sino-US relations. It is also a fundamental bedrock of Chinese policy-making and diplomacy. However, it is distinct from the One China principle, whereby China insists Taiwan is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day.

The US policy is not an endorsement of Beijing's position and indeed as part of the policy, Washington maintains a "robust unofficial" relationship with Taiwan, including continued arms sales to the island so that it can defend itself.

Although Taiwan's government claims it is an independent country officially called the "Republic of China", any country that wants diplomatic relations with mainland China must break official ties with Taipei.

This has resulted in Taiwan's diplomatic isolation from the international community.

How did it come about?

The policy can be traced back to 1949 and the end of the Chinese civil war. The defeated Nationalists, also known as the Kuomintang, retreated to Taiwan and made it their seat of government while the victorious Communists began ruling the mainland as the People's Republic of China. Both sides said they represented all of China.

Since then China's ruling Communist Party has threatened to use force if Taiwan ever formally declares independence, but it has also pursued a softer diplomatic track with the island in recent years.

Initially, many governments including the US recognised Taiwan as they shied away from Communist China. But the diplomatic winds shifted as China and the United States saw a mutual need to develop relations beginning in the 1970s, with the US and other countries cutting ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing.

Many however still maintain informal relations with Taiwan through trade offices or cultural institutes, and the US remains Taiwan's most important security ally.

When did the US subscribe to it?

Image copyright Getty/AFP Image caption Jimmy Carter (L), seen here with China's Deng Xiaoping (R) in 1987, formalised relations with Beijing

After years of warming relations, the US established formal diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter.

As a result the US had to sever ties with Taiwan and closed its Taipei embassy.

But that same year it also passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which guarantees support for the island. Crucially, this act states that the US must help Taiwan defend itself - which is why the US continues to sell arms to Taiwan. The US has also said it insists on the peaceful resolution of differences between the two sides and encourages both sides to pursue "constructive dialogue".

It maintains an unofficial presence in Taipei via the American Institute in Taiwan, a private corporation through which it carries out diplomatic activities.

Who are the winners and losers?

Beijing has obviously benefited the most from the policy, which has cast Taiwan out into the diplomatic wilderness.

Taiwan is not recognised as an independent country by much of the world nor even the United Nations. It undergoes extraordinary naming contortions just to participate in events and institutions like the Olympic Games and the World Trade Organization.

But even in its isolation, Taiwan has not entirely lost out.

It maintains vibrant economic and cultural ties with neighbours, and leverages on its long-term emotional relationship with the US to extract concessions.

It employs a small group of powerful lobbyists in Washington DC including former senator Bob Dole, who US media reported helped to arrange contacts that culminated in a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen.

As for the US, it can benefit from formal relations with China - its biggest foreign lender and a top trade partner - while quietly continuing to maintain strong ties with Taiwan.

The One China policy is a delicate balancing act that the US has perfected over the decades. How Washington can continue doing that under Mr Trump remains to be seen.Listen to Culture Gabfest No. 439 with Stephen Metcalf, Dana Stevens, and Julia Turner with the audio player below.

This podcast was produced by Benjamin Frisch. Our intern is Daniel Schroeder.But the uncertainty that Trump has brought to the United States is spilling into even the places that he hoped to do business with.

As soon as news reached Moscow that Trump’s National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had resigned after it became clear he had lied to the vice president about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, hawkish Russian lawmakers began to hyperventilate. Shadowy elements in Washington were trying to ruin not just Flynn, but the entire Russian-American relationship, they said. Leonid Slutsky, the head of the Duma’s foreign-affairs committee, put out a statement, reported by The Washington Post, saying Flynn’s ouster was a “kind of a negative signal for normalizing the Russian-American dialogue.” “Flynn was forced to leave after an aggressive campaign by U.S. mainstream media. ‘Daily News’ front page ‘Russian for the exit’ tells it all,” tweeted Alexey Pushkov, a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, in English. In another, Russian tweet, he called the investigations into Flynn “a witch hunt.” In yet another, he suggested that “the next target is Trump himself.”

It was a rather extraordinary display: Russian officials defending an American national security adviser as if he were one of their own. Flynn’s resignation seemed to have caught not just Washington, but Moscow, off-guard. And now that Flynn, a paid speaker at Russia Today’s anniversary dinner and, apparently, a frequent interlocutor of the Russian ambassador to the U.S., was gone, whither the Trump administration’s special relationship to Russia? But it’s too soon for critics of Trump’s policy to celebrate, much as it was too soon for conservative Moscow to celebrate Trump’s election and swearing in. Flynn’s resignation is certainly a setback for the Russians. “I think it’s a loss for Moscow in the sense that Flynn is a person who was in contact with the ambassador and maybe someone else, I don’t know, and so they had developed some kind of common language, which is very useful to starting negotiations,” says Gleb Pavlovsky, an independent political consultant in Moscow who once advised Putin. “He’s a firm person, and is that kind of conservative that is beloved in Moscow. He’s easy to understand.” With Flynn gone, it would appear that Moscow had lost an “in” to the Trump administration. “Reset with Russia is one of Trump’s signature issues, and is very unlikely to evaporate.” But that would overstate the case. “They have other entrees,” one senior State Department official told me. Flynn was just a messenger, in other words, and there are other people in the West Wing who are equally motivated to strike some kind of grand bargain with Putin, including White House adviser Steve Bannon and the president himself. And if Trump and Putin both want the deal done, it won’t be too hard to find another go-between. The one real problem, Pavlovsky points out, is timing. If the Kremlin and the White House don’t move quickly, “America and Russia could lose the opportunity to lower the pressure on the relationship,” he said. “If there’s no agreement in six months, then it will never be reached because then our presidential campaign begins”—Putin is up for reelection again in 2018—“and Putin won’t be able to be soft.” Otherwise, Pavlovsky added, “I don’t see a big loss in this.”

In a note to clients, Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group and head of its Eurasia practice, expressed a similar sentiment. While Flynn’s resignation will “increase short-term obstacles,” he wrote, it is “unlikely to yield major changes in the substance of US foreign policy. … [S]upport for a détente with Russia runs much deeper in this administration than Flynn. Exhibit A is President Donald Trump. He has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and a desire to improve relations since at least the beginning of the campaign. Reset with Russia is one of Trump’s signature issues, and is very unlikely to evaporate.” In the end, Flynn’s resignation didn’t even make the Russian evening news. The larger issue here is that Putin has gotten a handful with Trump, and that his election has brought new and unforeseen problems for the Kremlin. Despite all the over-the-top pleasantries, sanctions against Russia haven’t been lifted and Trump has run into quite a bit of resistance on the Hill, even among fellow Republicans. Trump’s saber-rattling on Iran and occasional, though inconsistent, threats to cancel the Iran deal have apparently made the Russians nervous, according to American and Russian sources. Russia helped negotiate that deal and does not want to see it undone, with the Iranians then possibly hurtling toward a nuclear weapon. Moreover, Iran is an old ally of the Russians, and Trump’s bluster has put Putin in the awkward position of being stuck between a potential new partner maligning an old and trusted one.Still taken from the video

Paul Ryan has big plans. He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, privatize Medicare, and cut taxes, and to do so, he’ll need to stay in the good graces of Donald Trump—whatever the cost to his integrity. Samantha Bee dedicated a segment of Full Frontal to the speaker of the House on Wednesday, tracking his path from a principled social and fiscal conservative to President Trump’s “faithful husky.”

Ryan was once considered the conscience of the Republican Party—or to put it another way, he was at least willing to feebly denounce the racist things Trump said and did during the campaign, though without ever actually condemning Trump himself. “Watching Ryan play moral watchdog was like watching Taylor Swift pretend to be surprised at awards shows. Bland and fake, but weirdly compelling,” noted Bee, playing side-by-side clips of the two. “Take another cue from Taylor Swift, Mr. Speaker: Know when to dump the guy you’ve only been pretending to like to help your career.”

Now, though, Trump is president of the United States, and nothing, not even the blatantly unconstitutional and immoral Muslim ban, will make Ryan speak up and risk upsetting the president—because doing so would mean jeopardizing his own agenda. “Paul Ryan would put Cthulhu in the White House if it would let him privatize Medicare,” said Bee. “Sure, it’s an eldritch creature of infinite darkness, but it can sign 20 tax-cut bills at once.”How important is it really to run antivirus software? That’s a question that has been asked by many people: your average user who might question the effort required to install it or keep their subscription up-to-date, the tech-savvy user who feels their knowledge and safe Internet skills are enough to keep them out of trouble, and the technology decision-maker who has to justify the cost to their business are just a few examples.



However, every single one of those people who question the importance of antivirus has to admit that it’s much easier to prevent infection than to clean up after it. So, how much difference does antivirus software actually make when faced with prevalent malware threats?



Research that we developed for Volume 14 of the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, released today, includes a detailed analysis to help answer that question. Based on data from more than a billion systems worldwide in the second half of 2012, the study found that unprotected computers – those without up-to-date antivirus software installed – were 5.5 times more likely on average to have an infection than protected computers.



We carried out this research using data from the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), which runs every month along with Windows and Microsoft Updates. Recent releases of the MSRT collect and report details about the state of real-time antivirus software on the scanned computer if the machine has been opted-in to provide data to Microsoft.



Infection rates are represented by the number of computers cleaned per mille (CCM). This is the number of computers cleaned after an infection for every 1,000 computers scanned by the MSRT. The CCM for unprotected computers ranged from 11.6 to 13.6 each month during the last half of 2012, while the CCM for protected computers ranged from 1.4 to 3.8.



Figure 1: Infection rate CCM for protected and unprotected computers each month during the last half of 2012.





Between July and December 2012, on average we found 24 percent of computers scanned with MSRT were not protected.

Figure 2: Percentage of unprotected computers during each month during the last half of 2012.

In addition to the overall 5.5 times higher CCM infection rate for unprotected computers we identified two key trends: in countries or regions where there is a high percentage of unprotected computers, infection rates were higher for both protected and unprotected computers. Furthermore, the infection rate gap between protected and unprotected computers in those countries/regions is much higher than average. This is illustrated by the trends observed in countries or regions with high and low malware infection rates.

For example, in the country of Georgia on average 33 percent of computers were unprotected, which is almost ten percentage points higher than the worldwide average. Infection rates were higher in Georgia as well: the CCM infection rates for protected computers ranged from 4.6 to 6.4 and unprotected computers ranged from 75.0 to 95.5! Unprotected users were 14 times more likely to be infected in Georgia, but even protected users had a higher than average infection rate. It’s likely that the large unprotected population with a high infection rate had a negative impact on protected users there.

On the other side of that coin, Finland boasts a below-average rate of unprotected computers – a mere 14.6 percent. Unprotected computers in Finland had infection rates ranging from 1.9 to 5.4, which is lower than protected computers in Georgia! Meanwhile protected computers in Finland had infection rates of 0.2 to 0.8. Clearly, the lower the percentage of unprotected computers, the lower the infection rate. Thus, everyone benefits from the protection running on the protected computers.

The other trend we found was that for computers running Windows XP SP3 – which doesn’t have the security features of modern operating systems – being protected didn’t offer the same benefit as on modern platforms with greater security features. On average, unprotected Windows XP SP3 users were only 4.6 times more likely to be infected than protected users, which is about one point lower than the global average.

If that wasn’t enough to convince you to take action and install antivirus software, we found still more compelling information. For computers that were cleaned during the last half of 2012, unprotected computers were about 2.5 times more likely to be infected with multiple different malware families than protected computers. Not only are unprotected users more likely to be infected, but when they are infected, the impact is more likely to be higher.

Figure 3: Percentage of cleaned computers with more than one malware family during the last half of 2012.

Although there’s no perfect solution, it’s clear that antivirus products offer crucial value. Running real-time antivirus products and keeping them up-to-date is an essential step in reducing the risks from malware. Simply installing and using real-time antivirus software can help individuals and organizations reduce malware infection by more than 80 percent. In addition, if you do have an infection you reduce your chances of being infected with multiple malware families by 56 percent. Have a look at our list of Consumer security software providers for vendors that provide consumer security software solutions for Windows.

This research does raise a few questions: is there a difference in infection rates between computers with out-of-date antivirus software and computers with no antivirus software at all? How is the infection rate affected when users change from one antivirus vendor to another?



Given that having more protected computers generally results in lower infection rates, is there a percentage of protected computers that will make malware development too expensive to be worth it? My colleague Bill Pfeifer and I will attempt to answer these questions at a presentation at the Virus Bulleting 2013 conference in Berlin in October.

National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”

On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)

Flynn’s contacts with the ambassador attracted attention within the Obama administration because of the timing. U.S. intelligence agencies were then concluding that Russia had waged a cyber campaign designed in part to help elect Trump; his senior adviser on national security matters was discussing the potential consequences for Moscow, officials said.

[FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit]

The talks were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said. In a recent interview, Kislyak confirmed that he had communicated with Flynn by text message, by phone and in person, but declined to say whether they had discussed sanctions.

The emerging details contradict public statements by incoming senior administration officials including Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. They acknowledged only a handful of text messages and calls exchanged between Flynn and Kislyak late last year and denied that either ever raised the subject of sanctions.

“They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence said in an interview with CBS News last month, noting that he had spoken with Flynn about the matter. Pence also made a more sweeping assertion, saying there had been no contact between members of Trump’s team and Russia during the campaign. To suggest otherwise, he said, “is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”

Neither of those assertions is consistent with the fuller account of Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak provided by officials who had access to reports from U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies that routinely monitor the communications of Russian diplomats. Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.

“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.

A third official put it more bluntly, saying that either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke. An administration official stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn. The sanctions in question have so far remained in place.

The nature of Flynn’s pre-inauguration message to Kislyak triggered debate among officials in the Obama administration and intelligence agencies over whether Flynn had violated a law against unauthorized citizens interfering in U.S. disputes with foreign governments, according to officials familiar with that debate. Those officials were already alarmed by what they saw as a Russian assault on the U.S. election.

U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.

Officials also cited political sensitivities. Prominent Americans in and out of government are so frequently in communication with foreign officials that singling out one individual — particularly one poised for a top White House job — would invite charges of political persecution.

Former U.S. officials also said aggressive enforcement would probably discourage appropriate contact. Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that he was in Moscow meeting with officials in the weeks leading up to Obama’s 2008 election win.

“As a former diplomat and U.S. government official, one needs to be able to have contact with foreigners to do one’s job,” McFaul said. McFaul, a Russia scholar, said he was careful never to signal pending policy changes before Obama took office.

On Wednesday, Flynn said that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. Kislyak helped coordinate that trip, Flynn said.

Flynn said that he spoke to Kislyak on a range of subjects in late December, including arranging a call between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Trump after the inauguration and expressing his condolences after Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated. “I called to say I couldn’t believe the murder of their ambassador,” Flynn said. Asked whether there was any mention of sanctions in his communications with Kislyak, Flynn said, “No.”

Kislyak characterized his conversations with Flynn as benign during a brief interview at a conference this month. “It’s something all diplomats do,” he said.

Kislyak said that he had been in contact with Flynn since before the election, but declined to answer questions about the subjects they discussed. Kislyak is known for his assiduous cultivation of high-level officials in Washington and was seated in the front row of then-GOP candidate Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April of last year. The ambassador would not discuss the origin of his relationship with Flynn.

In his CBS interview, Pence said that Flynn had “been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That’s exactly what the incoming national security adviser should do.”

Official concern about Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak was heightened when Putin declared on Dec. 30 that Moscow would not retaliate after the Obama administration announced a day earlier the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and the forced closure of Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York.

Instead, Putin said he would focus on “the restoration of ­Russia-United States relations” after Obama left office, and put off considering any retaliatory measures until Moscow had a chance to evaluate Trump’s policies.

Trump responded with effusive praise for Putin. “Great move on the delay,” he said in a posting to his Twitter account. “I always knew he was very smart.”

Putin’s reaction cut against a long practice of reciprocation on diplomatic expulsions, and came after his foreign minister had vowed that there would be reprisals against the United States.

Putin’s muted response — which took White House officials by surprise — raised some officials’ suspicions that Moscow may have been promised a reprieve, and triggered a search by U.S. spy agencies for clues.

“Something happened in those 24 hours” between Obama’s announcement and Putin’s response, a former senior U.S. official said. Officials began poring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications and diplomatic cables, and saw evidence that Flynn and Kislyak had communicated by text and telephone around the time of the announcement.

Trump transition officials acknowledged those contacts weeks later after they were reported in The Washington Post but denied that sanctions were discussed. Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said Jan. 13 that Flynn had “reached out to” the Russian ambassador on Christmas Day to extend holiday greetings. On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

Other officials were categorical. “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever,” a senior transition official told The Post at the time. When Pence faced questions on television that weekend, he said “those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.”

Current and former U.S. officials said that assertion was not true.

Like Trump, Flynn has shown an affinity for Russia that is at odds with the views of most of his military and intelligence peers. Flynn raised eyebrows in 2015 when he appeared in photographs seated next to Putin at a lavish party in Moscow for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network.

In an earlier interview with The Post, Flynn acknowledged that he had been paid through his speakers bureau to give a speech at the event and defended his attendance by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels, including CNN.

[Trump adviser Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and why Russia Today is just like CNN]

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn served multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — tours in which he held a series of high-level intelligence assignments working with U.S. Special Operations forces hunting al-Qaeda operatives and Islamist militants.

Former colleagues said that narrow focus led Flynn to see the threat posed by Islamist groups as overwhelming other security concerns, including Russia’s renewed aggression. Instead, Flynn came to see America’s long-standing adversary as a potential ally against terrorist groups, and himself as being in a unique position to forge closer ties after traveling to Moscow in 2013 while serving as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Flynn has frequently boasted that he was the first DIA director to be invited into the headquarters of Russia’s military intelligence directorate, known as the GRU, although at least one of his predecessors was granted similar access. “Flynn thought he developed some rapport with the GRU chief,” a former senior U.S. military official said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say they have tied the GRU to Russia’s theft of troves of email messages from Democratic Party computer networks and accuse Moscow of then delivering those materials to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published them in phases during the campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival.

Flynn was pushed out of the DIA job in 2014 amid concerns about his management of the sprawling agency. He became a fierce critic of the Obama administration before joining the Trump campaign last year.

Beyoncé lost. Again.

By now, you know what happened. For the third time, Beyoncé Knowles lost the Grammy for Album of the Year. But this time, it seemed beyond disbelief, not because she happened to lose to Adele for 25, but because Beyoncé’s album Lemonade—the best and most important work of her career—still couldn’t find a way to win.

What more is Beyoncé supposed to do?

A recap: This year it was 25 over Lemonade. In 2016, Taylor Swift’s 1989 won AOTY over Kendrick’s To Pimp a Butterfly. In 2015, it was Beck’s Morning Phase over Beyoncé. In 2014, Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories beat Kendrick’s Good Kid, MAAD City. And 2013, Mumford & Sons’ Babel beat Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange.

It’s a pattern too blatant, too in your face to ignore.

In the history of the Grammy Awards, only ten black artists have won Album of the Year. That’s a stat that has been cited many times over the past two days, but simply stopping there drastically oversimplifies what it actually means. When you look at those ten artists (who accounted for 12 wins in total; Stevie Wonder won three times in four years), and understand who they were and what their albums represented, it’s a sobering reminder that the Grammys are just a metaphor for this country, and that even the richest and most celebrated black people still are very much black.

For starters, of those 12 albums, five have an asterisk. In 1991, Quincy Jones won for Back on the Block, an album featuring a who’s who in R&B and jazz, with some rap sprinkled in. It was a true flex for Quincy, showing how he was undeniably the connective tissue for three (or four) generations of black music. The next year, Natalie Cole won for Unforgettable … With Love. The album is gorgeous, and it is also primarily a covers album of songs performed by her father, Nat King Cole. In 1994, The Bodyguard soundtrack won, featuring one half Whitney Houston songs (including Dolly Parton cover turned Whitney classic “I Will Always Love You”) and another half songs by other artists, from Kenny G to Lisa Stansfield to Joe Cocker. In 2005, Ray Charles’s Genius Loves Company won, an album of duets with other popular singers (he won posthumously). And in 2007, Herbie Hancock won for River: The Joni Letters, a Joni Mitchell tribute album.

Those are all good albums. But none of them are forward facing. Three are basically lifetime achievement awards. Most of them celebrate yesteryear, with the majority defined by the term “Various Artists.” And a decent amount of the music on these black albums are performed by white artists.They live in a completely different category from something like Lemonade, a singular piece of work by a black solo artist.

If we ignore those, the number of black artists that have won Album of the Year is cut in half to five: Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Lauryn Hill, and Outkast.

Four of those five artists deserved to win Album of the Year. Lionel Richie’s win for Can’t Slow Down over Prince’s Purple Rain in 1985 was a glaringmistake. Lionel’s win is akin to 1989 beating To Pimp a Butterfly, or if Drake’s Views would have bested Lemonade for AOTY—both reminiscent of some of the mistakes of the past decade: a pop album with little weight triumphing over a classic album built to stand the test of time.

Removing Lionel from the list and there were four artists—six albums total—that you can say were albums by black artists that deserved to win Album of the Year—and did. What else do these albums have in common? They are among the most classic albums in the history of recorded music.

Stevie won in 1974, 1975 and, 1977 for Innvervisions, Fulfillingness’ First Finale, and Songs in the Key of Life. Those three albums are part of what’s commonly known as his “classic period”—1972 to 1976—when he made five consecutive classic albums. His first two, Music of My Mind and Talking Book, were not nominated for Album of the Year. Innervisions, his first nomination and win, was Stevie Wonder’s 16th album. The Grammys eventually got it right with Stevie, but it wasn’t just that he made the best albums of those years that he won—he had to release “Best Albums of All Time”–level material to finally be recognized.

Michael Jackson’s Thriller won in 1984, but his first classic, Off the Wall (a better album), wasn’t even nominated for Album of the Year. He lost twice more for the award, in 1988 for Bad and 1996 for HIStory: Past, Present, Future. The Grammys got it right once for Michael, but again, only after they missed a classic. In order for Michael Jackson to win, he had to make the highest-selling album of all time.

Do you see a trend? Does this trend feel familiar in your own black life? Oh, it does? Of course it does. But there’s more.

Lauryn Hill won in 1999 for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. This album, her solo debut, dominated the entire year leading up to the awards. It’s widely regarded as a classic, one of the great albums of the 1990s, finding the balance between R&B, hip-hop, and pop in a way very few have ever pulled off. It was a landmark year for the Album of the Year category: all five nominees were women, including Madonna, Shania Twain, Sheryl Crow, Lauryn Hill, and Garbage (fronted by Shirley Manson). Lauryn won, and she deserved to win, and again, another black artist won Album of the Year, with an Album of the Decade.

Finally, there’s Outkast. Similar to Stevie, Outkast made multiple classic albums that were ignored by the Grammys. Their fourth album, Stankonia, was nominated in 2002, but lost to the O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack. But then they finally—rightfully—won one, for Speakerboxxx/Love Below, an album that was too massive too ignore, even if it wasn’t their true masterwork as a duo.

But that album, a double-album consisting of (basically) an André solo album and a Big Boi solo album, changed hip-hop forever. Yes, it was the Album of the Year, but it was also a landmark moment for an entire genre of music, which is what it took for them to win—changing music forever.

And that’s it.

All of this is important to consider when attempting to answer the question of how Beyoncé could win.

Beyoncé and Lemonade are great, important works of art. It feels like we might look back on this time as the beginning of Beyoncé’s classic period, something very few artists have. The unfair, fucked-up part of it all, however, is that it’s actually going to take Beyoncé making an album as earth-shattering as Innervisions or Songs in the Key of Life to beat the next collection of Taylor Swift songs about road trips for the Album of the Year Grammy. In order to be celebrated as the artist that made the best album in one year, black artists have to make an album that stands up for 30 years.

The only reason the Grammys still matter is because they’re a reminder of surface-level progressions serving as a convenient smokescreen for one of the stories of America—the never-ending push to keep so many of us in our place. Beyoncé and Kendrick’s alternating losses for AOTY over the past four years stink of reminders of what happens when we don’t stay in our lane. And their losses serve as a reminder that making “important” music—art that mirrors the discomfort of our times, art that disrupts the status quo—is not what these Grammy gatekeepers hold at a premium, or to some degree, even appreciate.

It’s the plight of the nonwhite artist in the present day—responsible for critically carrying the load for an entire country while still not reaping the benefits of that hard work, of that self-induced trauma, beyond a pat on your sore, tired back.

Be it something as trivial as the Grammys or as relatable as getting a job, the gatekeepers still thrive on maintaining imbalance. And this will never change, until someone at the table finally steps up to the gatekeepers, risking their own comfort for the sake of others.

I truly thought that moment was coming, when Adele—appreciated for her genuine lack of a filter—won for Album of the Year. But, even in a speech thanking Beyoncé—a woman she clearly is inspired by and strives to be like—it wasn’t.

Adele’s win, which you can’t blame her for, is a Grammy issue, but Adele’s preparation for that moment is an indictment of the privilege of not understanding a world in which you, Adele, could probably beat Beyoncé. Yes, you can be shocked as hell, but to not understand why you may end up winning is to not understand this world you live in, and how your world differs. If you like Beyoncé, you cry, you salute her with pleasantries, you talk about how you don’t deserve it and you break your statue in half out of tribute to her. But if you love Beyoncé, you prepare yourself for a moment in which you could beat her, and if you do, you address the Grammys and tell them that they have been fucking up for a long time now. And that it wasn’t about her and that it wasn’t about Beyoncé, it was about the gatekeepers of the Grammys, using their power to keep people—and messages—in their place.

But loving Beyoncé is loving black people, because Beyoncé is black people. And that’s easier said than done, truly loving black people. It’s hard work, it’s uncomfortable, it’s challenging, it’s tiring. Which is why, when those big moments happen, and you’re looking for that white person in your life that likes you so much to just stand up for you—just to once take the emotional load off of you—instead of fighting, they’ll so often break you off a little something, cheer you on, pat you on the back, and then turn around and walk away.The NRA just persuaded Congress to legalize the killing of bear cubs in wildlife refuges

The U.S. House of Representatives voted Thursday to legalize the killing of black bear cubs and their mothers at their dens in Alaska’s national wildlife refuges.

The controversial measure, backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), overturns a ‘Fair Chase’ rule, promulgated by the Obama administration, that also limited baiting, trapping, and the use of airplanes to track and shoot bears and wolves on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands in Alaska.

The vote was met with an outpouring of criticism from wildlife and conservation groups.

“Alaska’s extreme predator control policies lack scientific support, contravene conservation mandates on national wildlife refuges and defy traditional wildlife management principles,” said Jenny Keatinge, federal lands policy analyst with Defenders of Wildlife. “H.J. Res. 69 would cede federal management of iconic wildlife to the state’s misguided program on over 76 million acres of national wildlife refuges that belong to all Americans.”

Safari Club International, a group that has been criticized by both sportsmen and animals rights groups for advocating “canned” or captive hunting and elite trophy hunting, joined the NRA in pushing Congress to overturn the Fair Chase rule. In a letter to House members, the groups claimed the rule preempts the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s authority on national wildlife refuges.

The Obama administration rule Congress is seeking to overturn, however, does not prohibit hunting in wildlife refuges, and allows both subsistence hunting as well as science-based predator control. However, it limits certain practices, such as using rotting meat and pet food to lure bears for an easy kill, which some hunting groups say violates the ethics of fair chase.

A similar controversy arose in Maine in 2014 when a ballot measure would have limited bear baiting in the state. While the ballot measure narrowly lost, hundreds of organizations, businesses, and opinion leaders, including many hunters, spoke out against bear baiting.

“Hounding, baiting, and trapping lack the very skill that draws most hunters to the sport: the challenge of tracking and finding the bear,” Mary Moulton, an avid hunter and supporter of the ballot measure, explained in 2014. “These practices give hunting a bad image by mocking the notion of sportsmanship and fair chase.”

The hunting practices the House voted to legalize on Thursday are considered cruel by many Alaska residents. Recent polling shows that by a two-to-one margin, Alaskans don’t support baiting or trapping in national wildlife refuges.

The National Wildlife Refuge System is the only network of federal lands and waters dedicated to wildlife conservation. The system is made up of 566 national wildlife refuges, including 16 in Alaska.

A companion resolution in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK), has not yet been scheduled for a vote.The Soft War has remained of great importance to the Iranian regime, with a particular surge in activity after the controversial 2009 elections, five months after which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stated: "Today, the country's priority is to fight the enemy's soft war."



There has been much discussion, by international civil society, as well as groups and individuals within Iran including members of the Iranian establishment itself, of an ‘Iranian Cyber Army’ (ICA) – an organised group with official oversight and support of the Iranian government. The origin and structure of this group are extremely difficult to establish, but there is clear evidence of online actors and tactics, whose actions and goals often align with those of the Iranian authorities, even shifting with that political agenda. Individuals and groups targeted by this group are often civil society, activists, and political opposition groups, though diasporic Iranians have also been targeted, as well as state entities seen as oppositional or a threat (potentially including the US Department of Justice).

There are two distinct types of online activity which contribute to the hegemony of state ideology and discourse: the first is the content of the Soft War itself online– the production and promotion of state-sanctioned ideological content, with the restriction of content perceived to threaten tradition Iranian cultural and political values.

Those who express dissent, including social activists and human rights campaigners, (who frequently fail to adopt necessary online security precautions such as complex passwords and online anonymity) are monitored and even arrested. In subsequent interrogations they are often subjected to torture and other ill-treatment: the authorities thus obtain key information – communications, online account details, web histories – which enables the persecution of other targets of interest. This has been one of the most effective techniques in gathering information on human rights activists.

The second type of activity is cyberattacks i.e. hacking: intrusive malware, monitoring, and, for example, DDoS attacks carried out on actors perceived to be in opposition to state ideology: the targets are suspected to be selected by state actors, and civil society and political opponents have been shown to be primary targets of such intrusive tactics. This not only directly interferes with both the activities and publications of organisations deemed to oppose the government, but can also lead to information used to arrest and prosecute dissenting individuals or groups. It is important to note the difficulty in researching hacking actions and groups, especially in determining the attribution and intent of intrusive online actions.

Perhaps the greatest success of the Iranian government’s online campaign, at least domestically, is the ‘chilling effect’: the establishment of a climate of fear that surpasses actual surveillance capabilities and encourages online communicators and activists to self-censor. It would be impossible to maintain a catch-all censorship or monitoring programme, but by instilling in Iranian citizens a sense of fear, the surveillance and blocking do not have to be comprehensive.

This report aims to provide insight into the online tactics and networks active in Iran’s Soft War, using a combination of primary sources, interviews, and metadata collection.EAST RUTHERFORD -- American Dream has teamed up with a big name in the mountain industry known for its partnerships with famous resorts such as Aspen, Whistler and Killington to bring year-round ski-town life to North Jersey.

The developers of the long-stalled Meadowlands project, Triple Five, announced Monday that Snow Operating will run "Big SNOW America," a 12-story indoor ski and snowboard park in East Rutherford.

Featuring lessons, ski chalets, and an "apres ski lounge," the resort promises to offer a "guest experience like no other."

Meadowlands megamall delayed again

The 180,000 square-foot facility will be surrounded by a number of alpine retail stores selling ski and snowboarding equipment and accessories dubbed "The Shops @ Big SNOW."

Snow tubing, indoor snow play and an event space will also be offered.

Snow Operating also works with Mountain Creek in Vernon as well as a few Pennsylvania resorts, such as Camelback, Hidden Valley and Blue Mountain.

"Big SNOW America together with our indoor DreamWorks waterpark, theme park and other first class attractions is what will make American Dream a true destination for locals and tourists alike," said Don Ghermezian, the president of Triple Five.

The American Dream has already recruited a number of businesses and entertainment options to fill its directory. Over the last year, businesses such as Lego Land, an aquarium, a '4D' dine-in movie theater and a series of restaurants and retailers have announced they will join the project.

The complex has experienced some recent delays over a bond offering, however the developer still expects the $3-billion mega-mall to open in 2017.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention genetic testing may help prove that untreated Flint River water contributed to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in and around the city, the MLive site reports.

More than 100 individuals, of whom 12 have died, have contracted the bacterial disease in the Flint area since the outbreak began in 2014. Michigan state officials suspected in early 2015 that Legionnaires' cases may have been linked to Flint's 2014 decision to begin using the Flint River as a source of tap water but didn't make that suspicion public until nine months later. City, state, and federal officials' failures to properly treat and monitor Flint's tap water after the Flint River switch are also believed to have caused an epidemic of lead contamination.

The relevant CDC test found that a sample of water taken from the McLaren Flint hospital matched a sample taken from a Legionnaires' patient who is not known to have received services at the hospital. The reason that's important is because the state of Michigan is attempting to make the argument, disputed by McLaren officials, that the high number of Legionnaires' cases during the outbreak that involved the hospital were attributable to the failures of its own internal water system. If bacteria found at McLaren match a patient who never spent time there, however, one logical possibility is that both the McLaren sample and the patient sample derive from a third, original source—like untreated Flint River water.

An independent study published in July found elevated levels of Legionella (the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease) in Flint tap water, though that study did not attempt to link specific patients' cases to specific water samples.Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in midtown for the Women's March. Ida Siegal reports. (Published Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017)

What to Know Hundreds of thousands of protesters came to the rally and march.

The rally included a who's who of women, including New York City's first lady Chirlane McCray, Whoopi Goldberg and Dame Helen Mirren.

The march goes from the United Nations headquarters to Trump Tower

Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, joined by celebrities and politicians, flooded midtown streets Saturday with pink hats and homemade signs to show Donald Trump they won't be silent over the next four years.

People chanted "This is What Democracy Looks Like" and "Not My President" in a march that snaked from the UN headquarters on the East Side, across 42nd Street and up Fifth Avenue to President Donald Trump's home.

"Trump, although he is a New Yorker, does not reflect the values of this city," said Vanessa Weber, who marched and lives in New York City.

About 400,000 people participated in the rally and march, according to Mayor de Blasio, who thanked the NYPD in a tweet for keeping everyone safe.

Many held homemade signs with messages such as "Fight Like a Girl," and "Stop Tweeting, Start Tweeting." One sign said "Can't Comb Over Misogyny."

"I'm here to fight for families and women because all of us, our rights are being threatened," said Wendy Most, of New York City.

Rosie Perez, Whoopi Goldberg, and Taylor Schilling of "Orange is the New Black" helped kick off the march.

The demonstration started just before 11 a.m. with a rally and choral performance by the HERmonics, an informal women's choir, at One Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza. Streets started filling up about 90 minutes before the choir began.

Perez emceed the Saturday morning event. The native Brooklynite walked on stage to cheers and applause as she announced each speaker, which included notable city officials like Comptroller Scott Stringer and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who represents New York's 14th district.

"When women succeed, America succeeds," said Maloney as she addressed the fired-up crowd.

The rally included a who's who of women, including New York City's first lady Chirlane McCray, Whoopi Goldberg and Dame Helen Mirren, who proudly proclaimed herself as a New Yorker to a loud roar of cheers and whistles.

In Pictures: Thousands Attend Women's March on NYC

"We are not rolling back the tarp on the progress that we have made," said "Sex and the City" actress Cynthia Nixon, who spoke at the rally. "To every woman here who won't give up, women make the change."

"When you chose an administration that is all male, pale and stale, you are not going to unify this country," Stringer said. "We are going to organize, we are going to agitate, we're just getting started."

Public Advocate Letitia James drew up some laughs when she joked that Inauguration Day gave new meaning to "the morning after."

An all-female drumline led the procession from the United Nations headquarters near 42nd Street and FDR Drive to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets.

Fifth Avenue was completely shut down for blocks as demonstrators pumped homemade picket signs in the air to a steady drum beat. The loud roar of ralliers' cheers could be heard for blocks.

In a show of force, hundreds of thousands of women massed in the nation's capital for the Women's March long before its 10 a.m. start. America Ferrera addressed the sea of people, who flooded the entirety of the National Mall in pink hats. White and neon-colored picket signs bobbed through the traveling crowd as marchers held hands.

Hundreds from the tri-state area traveled down to participate in the D.C. march, including Senator Cory Booker.

Over 300 sister marches are taking place nationwide. That's before taking into account the numerous rallies that have taken place since Friday in international cities, including Berlin, London, Nairobi, Paris, and Tokyo.WASHINGTON, D.C. ― “This is what democracy looks like,” chanted men, women and children as they marched down Constitution Ave. on Saturday Jan. 21. If democracy looks like the Women’s March on Washington, it looks energized, creative, diverse, joyous and ready to fight like hell for equality.In the spring of 1999, Vogue ran a six-page spread featuring model Audrey Marnay wearing a number of Queen Amidala’s gowns from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.

The buzz surrounding the film had already reached a fever pitch, but the Vogue editorial made it clear that the first Star Wars film(s) to be released in 22 years would be iconic, if only for the fashion.

Though Episodes I-III have gone down in history as some of the least well-received Star Wars movies, Padmé Amidala’s wardrobe is perhaps one of the few things that made watching the trilogy worthwhile.

To get the full effect of just how big a deal Amidala’s looks still are to this day, we’ve collected a list of each and every single outfit she wore in The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith. Naturally, we ranked them.

#30: The Very Normal Nightgown

This is not a nightgown from a galaxy far, far away. This is a nightgown from Sears. Amidala wore it, sure, but this was probably laundry day.

#29: The Fig Dress

This dress wasn’t given its fair share of screen time or closeups. From afar, it appears to have plenty of body, structure, and texture, but unfortunately we never get to see it.

#28: The “I’m wearing the drapes” Dress

This dress is not a dress so much as it’s a set of drapes masquerading as a garment. Padmé’s better than this and she knows it.

#27: The Desert Fainting Cloak

At some point, someone must not have informed Amidala that Tatooine was a dry desert planet where people literally have to farm water. The cloak is regal, yes, but it’s also the sort of thing that would cause immediate dehydration.

#26: The Turquoise On Tatooine Dress

This dress was meant to be breezy and casual for Padmé’s visit to Tatooine, which it is. It could have stood for a bit of contouring, though.

#25: Not Another Maternity Cloak

Like much of Padmé’s maternity wear, this dress just doesn’t do a whole lot for her. Sure, it hides the fact that she’s pregnant, but it’s also just not particularly interesting.

#24: The Leather Affair

This dress is actually PHENOMENAL, but we never actually get a chance to see it full on in any of Padmé’s scenes. Unlike most of the things she wears while spending time with Anakin, this was the one time where she might have been thinking, “You know what? This black leather thing might not be so bad.”

#23: The Sick of Your Shit Nightdress

There are times when Padmé’s just like, “I can’t deal with the white foundation makeup or the hair pieces or the jewelry. Piss off.” This is one of those times.

#22: The Nightmare Nightdress

When Anakin decides to reveal to Padmé that he’s ben having prophetic nightmares about her death, we see that her nightgown of choice is adorned in metal and an inordinate amount of beadwork. Metal + beads = uncomfortable to sleep in, girl.

#21: The Birthing Gown

There’s not a lot to say about this one. It’s the dress she gave birth in. It was white, which seems sort of impractical?

#20: The Crescent Maternity Gown

Most of the maternity clothing that Amidala wears during the films is purposefully oversized and shapeless because she has to hide per pregnancy from the public. Her relationship with Anakin is forbidden, and could be used against her as blackmail within the Senate.

Still, though, the entire affair is drab, lifeless and lacks any sense of Naboo’s love of couture.

#19: The Picnic Sun Dress

As a general rule of thumb, you can count on Padmé to wear disproportionately cheery things whenever she’s alone with Anakin. She’s convinced that he’s not that bad a guy (despite being the only Jedi to wear black leather) and this is her way of showing it.

#19: The Handmaiden’s Smock

Why Padmé chose to wear two layers of thick, cotton-like clothing and baggy, heavy pants to a swelteringly hot desert planet is unclear. But she did. And it didn’t look very good.

#18: The Cyrene Silk Mourning Dress

Neither Amidala’s hair game nor her dress game were on point here, but you have to take into account that Naboo had just been invaded and her people were all in a state of mourning.

#17: The Impractical Velvet Battle Dress

Both Padmé and her decoy are wearing dresses meant for battle. Let that sink in for a second. As if a flowing dress on the battlefield weren’t ridiculous enough, these gowns just so happen to be made out of velvet, far from an ideal fabric for a combat situation.

#16: The Casual Spaceflight Gown

The words “opulent” and “aubergine” come to mind when looking at this dress. It has all the hallmarks of a classic Amidala look—body and varied textures—but it misses the mark in terms of making her seem poised to act at a moment’s notice.

#15: The Preparing to Escape Dress

One imagines that as she was packing for her trip to Tatooine, Padmé pulled out this puffy-shouldered affair and requested the frybread variant of her hair-bun look in order to work through some decisions. This isn’t a solid look by any means, but rather it’s a visual manifestation of her decision to choose better outfits in the future.

#14: The Final Resting Dress

In addition to being a gorgeous, river-inspired gown, Padmé’s funeral dress is also a clever deception meant to hide the fact that her newborn twins, Luke and Leia, are alive and safe. A fake baby bump was woven into the dress and prominently displayed during the ceremony.

Bonus: this scene also included a shot of Queen Jamillia, Padmé’s successor who, though mourning, was stunting on everybody.

#13: The Mustafar Maternity Outfit

By Episode III, Padmé is quite pregnant and increasingly suspicious that her husband might just be in the process of becoming a Sith Lord. Never one to take people’s advice about Anakin, Padmé travels to see him on a lava planet in a very sensible combat outfit customized to accommodate her belly.

#12: The Thousand Moons Refugee Disguise

Usually, when on the run from people trying to murder you, one wears clothes that make you difficult to spot or recognize. Of course, Padmé Amidala’s no average person, and so she decides to wrap herself in a beautiful, attention-grabbing floor-length gown with a crescent headdress. In her defense, the dress does have a hood that she can use to obscure her face.

Bonus: here’s the headdress from another angle and Queen Jamilla, who succeeded Padmé.

#11: The Villa Retreat Dress

In her more carefree moments, Amidala tends to go for airy, flowing gowns with impractical trains and plenty of shoulder breathing space. This dress is no exception to the rule, but it’s one of the only ones she wears to incorporate multiple shades in a single piece of fabric.

#10: The Secret Wedding Gown

Amidala was trying very, very hard to ignore the fact that she was marrying a man who’d just murdered a bunch of children on his home planet when she was wearing this dress. One imagines that it wasn’t all that hard to do, because the dress is dripping in pearls and lace.

#9: The Naboo Victory Celebration Gown

Compared to most of Amidala’s other looks, this dress has a recognizable real-world inspiration: Elizabethan fashion. This look went on to inspire RuPaul’s Drag Race season 6 contestant Trinity K. Bonet.

#8: The Decoy Deathbird Gown & The Handmaiden Disguise

There’s a lot going on here. Padmé, disguised as a handmaiden, is listening as one of her decoys shares the official opinions of the queen that she’s no doubt been trained to recite. The decoy’s dress is a bold blend of Black Swan terror and Lydia Deetz soft-goth.

#7: The Embroidered Tatooine Wrap

So here’s the thing about Padmé. When she’s not voting, reigning, or fighting separatists, she’s actually pretty chill and very into core strength. She chose to highlight all of this during a visit to Tatooine with Anakin while he went off to murder a village of people.

#6: The Naboo Pilot Disguise

Amidala’s many costume changes actually play a vital role in the plots of Episodes I-III. As a major political power player, Amidala’s under constant threat of assassination, necessitating her to move about the galaxy stealthily.

While on her way to Coruscant to cast her vote regarding the Military Creation Act, she disguised herself as a regular Naboo fighter pilot and chose Cordé, one of her handmaidens, as her decoy.

Cordé looked fantastic. But then this happened. Well played, Padmé. RIP Cordé.

#5: The Loyalist Meeting Gown

Immediately following a foiled assassination attempt, Amidala rolls with the punches, pulls her hair up and back into a cornucopia and dons this very sensible, high-collared dress and jacket combination. It’s right on the cusp of her Naboo-inspired “loud” looks and her more subdued personal taste.

#4: The Geonosis Fugitive Jumpsuit

By the time Amidala makes her way to Geonosis, the infamous Clone Wars have begun and she’s become a battle-ready senator on the run. As a queen, she was luxurious and opulent to the point of being cartoonish at times, but as a fighter for the Republic, she’s sleek, chic, and ready to throw down.

#3: The Coruscant Kimono

Even when she’s relaxing a home with her handmaidens, Amidala opts for an intricate, embroidered kimono complete with flattened, fanned hair and a Veda pearl-encrusted headdress. Is it practical? Hardly, but that’s never really Amidala’s thing.

#2: The Galactic Senate Dress

While representing Naboo to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant, Amidala typically chooses to take things up a notch and pull out her most striking, intimidating looks. The cloak’s oversized shoulder pads are both fantastic and frighteningly garish. Her extensions, as one would expect, are sickening.

#1: The Original Amidala

Even though it’s not Padmé’s most elaborate look, this is the gown that started it all. Before we knew how big a role Amidala would play in the larger Star Wars universe, the combination of this dress, headdress and hair piece(s) defined the character in a way that none of her dialogue ever could.

Does the Government Fund Planned Parenthood?

With all the talk in Washington these days about “defunding Planned Parenthood,” you might think there’s a specific, Planned Parenthood line item in the federal budget that Congress and the president can just zero out.

Turns out, nothing could be further from the truth.

Most of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding is from Medicaid reimbursements for preventive care, and some is from Title X. There’s no keep-Planned-Parenthood-running part of the federal budget.

Here’s where “defunding” comes in:

At least 60% of Planned Parenthood patients rely on public health programs like Medicaid and Title X for their preventive and primary care. So, when you hear extreme politicians talking about “defunding” Planned Parenthood, they really mean blocking patients who rely on public health care programs from getting their care at Planned Parenthood centers — patients like Casey.

Legislation that “defunds” Planned Parenthood immediately blocks patients like Casey from accessing care at Planned Parenthood health centers.

And that would have devastating consequences for millions of people — particularly people of color, people with low incomes, and people in rural communities who already face barriers to care.

Say It With Us Now: Most Federal Funding is Through Medicaid Reimbursements for Preventive Health Care

To really understand what federal funds pay for at Planned Parenthood, you first need to know that federal tax dollars don’t pay for abortions. A decades-old, unfair law already prohibits that (except in cases of rape, incest, or when a woman’s life is in danger).

Again, most federal funding comes to Planned Parenthood in the form of reimbursements through Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance plan for people with low incomes.

Just like other kinds of health insurance, Medicaid reimburses Planned Parenthood’s doctors and nurses for the preventive medical services they provide, including life-saving cancer screenings, HIV testing, and birth control. There are no special favors here.

The majority of federal funds come through Planned Parenthood health centers via reimbursements for the medical services that they provide to patients who either have Medicaid coverage or qualify for other publicly funded health care programs (like Title X).

Planned Parenthood’s health centers also get federal funds for delivering vital services through Title X, the nation’s family planning program — funds that can only be used to support family planning health care.

Planned Parenthood serves 1.5 million of Title X’s over 4 million patients each year, helping people who often don’t have access to family planning care anywhere else. Without Planned Parenthood, many of these patients wouldn’t get the health care they need to take control of their lives.

In talking about funding, it’s important to note that:

The government saves $7 in Medicaid-related costs for every dollar invested in publicly funded family planning programs like Title X.

Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office projects that barring Planned Parenthood health centers from being reimbursed through Medicaid would result in a net cost of $130 million to taxpayers over 10 years due to an increase in unintended pregnancies without the high-quality contraceptive care that Planned Parenthood provides.

It is estimated that Planned Parenthood health centers prevent at least 579,000 unintended pregnancies a year.

Got That Now?

Just to reiterate: The federal government doesn’t cut a blank check to Planned Parenthood.

The public funds that Planned Parenthood’s health centers receive are mostly reimbursements for preventive services, which often aren’t available anywhere else. Without Planned Parenthood, there just aren’t enough health care providers to deliver the millions of medical services it provides each year.

No wonder poll after poll shows Americans strongly support Planned Parenthood.

And that’s not just Blue America — it cuts across Republican and independent voters too. In fact, nearly half of Trump’s own supporters don’t want to see Planned Parenthood “defunded” either.



Learn how “defunding” will hurt those most in need and lead to a national health disaster.

Impact Shutting Down Planned Parenthood

If politicians out to “defund” Planned Parenthood have their way, they will block millions of patients who depend on Medicaid and other public health care programs from accessing care at Planned Parenthood health centers.

And we all know their ultimate goal: To shut down all Planned Parenthood health centers. If that happens, it would cause a national health care disaster. Many Planned Parenthood patients — nearly half of whom are people of color, and many of whom live in rural areas — would have nowhere else to turn for health care.

We won’t let that happen. Are you ready to fight back and stand with Planned Parenthood?

Join the fight!

The Associated Press (along with Japan Times and the Voice of America’s China Service) reports that President Trump, “after suffering rejection after rejection in China’s courts,” has finally gotten something “that he has been trying to get from China for a decade: trademark rights to his own name.”

In 2006, Trump applied for a trademark for “Trump” in connection with a company providing construction services in China. China’s Trademark Office rejected the application, on the grounds that someone else (Dong Wei) had filed a similar application about two weeks earlier, and had priority under China’s first-come-first-served trademark rule.*

* There are, apparently, more than 200 other “Trump” marks on the Chinese trademark register — for everything from Trump toilets to Trump pacemakers, Trump condoms and even a “Trump International Hotel” — that have been claimed by persons other than Trump (or any of the Trump Organizations). This, as all good trademark nerds will recognize, is a concrete illustration of a common problem in “first-to-file” jurisdictions, where it can be relatively easy to “reserve” a mark by filing an application, without evidence that you are actually using the mark in question.

Trump appealed the adverse ruling to the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board, then to the Beijing Intermediate People’s Court, and finally to the Beijing High People’s Court, but his appeal was rejected at every turn. He also instituted a separate action to invalidate Dong’s trademark, but the Trademark Office, and the Review Board, ruled against him on that one as well.

The latest of these adverse rulings was in May 2015, the month before Trump declared his candidacy for president.

Then, in April 2016, with Trump’s presidential campaign in full swing, Trump’s lawyers went back to the Review Board, and asked it to reconsider its earlier ruling and to invalidate Dong’s trademark.* This time, it worked; On Sept. 6, the Trademark Office announced that it was voiding Dong’s trademark. Trump’s competing mark was then published in China’s Trademark Gazette on Nov. 13 — less than a week after he won the presidential election — and it became effective Tuesday.

* At around this time, Trump also submitted 49 new trademark applications for the “Trump” mark in China in connection with a wide variety of goods and services. Those applications are all still pending.

So there you have it. An agency of the Chinese government has granted our president a valuable benefit, in the form of a trademark for “Trump construction services.”

Let’s review the Constitution, Art. I Sec. 9 (the “foreign emoluments clause”):

No Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States] shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. [emphasis added]

We’ve been hearing a lot about the meaning of “emolument” over the past few weeks, and we will, I predict, be hearing a great deal more in the coming months. Much of the discussion to date has centered on whether a market exchange — the Kuwaiti government, say, renting out the Trump International Ballroom at the going rate for a function there, or China’s state-owned bank renting out an entire floor of Trump Tower in New York City — constitutes an “emolument” under this clause.

Trump’s spokespersons have said that it does not. I think — for the reasons set forth here in a paper by Norm Eisen, Richard Painter and Laurence Tribe — that it does, that the word, as understood in the 1790s, encompassed any “conferral of a benefit or advantage, whether through money, objects, titles, offices, or economically valuable waivers or relaxations of otherwise applicable requirements.”

But put that question aside for the moment. This Chinese trademark matter raises a different issue regarding the meaning of “emolument.” The Chinese government hasn’t engaged in a like-for-like market exchange with Trump; rather, it has conferred a legal benefit that has some, non-trivial value, on him. Is receiving trademark rights a constitutionally-prohibited “emolument … of any kind whatever … from a foreign State”?

I think it is. I’m even willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt here, and to assume that everything that has taken place here is on the up-and-up and strictly by the book, i.e., that there’s been no quid pro quo, that this is simply a case where Trump received a benefit to which he (or anyone similarly situated) would be lawfully entitled under the relevant provisions of Chinese trademark law, and that it is simply a coincidence that, after a number of rejections, the application was approved after Trump was elected president of the United States.

Why do I think this is an “emolument”? The meaning of “emolument” — an “archaic term,” as the Office of Legal Counsel noted in a lengthy analysis, back in 1982, and one that may well have already been somewhat antiquated in the 1790s — is, to be sure, not crystal clear. My Webster’s Unabridged tells me that it comes from the Latin emolumentum, or “gain, profit, or advantage,” and it defines it as “the profit arising from office or employment,” with the “archaic” meaning of “advantage, or gain in general.”

Nobody disputes that it covers gifts; one of the practices that the framers clearly were targeting was the practice of several foreign monarchs — the French King Louis XVI was a particular offender — of giving valuable gifts to officials of the newly-independent United States. (Both Franklin and Jefferson, for example. received diamond-encrusted snuff boxes from the king while they were serving in ambassadorial positions in Paris, and this had become something of a scandal).

But “emoluments” must cover more than just gifts; the Clause already prohibits receiving “present[s],” so by ordinary rules of textual interpretation, “emoluments” must include something additional.

One clue to what it means comes from asking: What were the Founders concerned about? What’s the purpose of this clause (and its sister “domestic emoluments clause” in Art. I Sec. 7)? What’s the harm — a harm serious enough to include in the new Constitution? Why shouldn’t Jefferson be allowed to take a nice snuff box from the French king?

The answer, as Hamilton put it, is that the receipt of the gift would “weaken his fortitude [and] corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice,” giving him a “pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution.” Men are avaricious; give them a nice snuff box and they’ll be more likely to treat you with special favor down the road, perhaps out of a desire not to show ingratitude, perhaps out of a desire to obtain additional valuable gifts, perhaps both. In either case, dealing with the foreign sovereign will be compromised, no longer having the interests of the people of the United States as the sole motivating factor in all decisions and actions.

It’s not bribery, exactly, that we’re trying to prevent in this clause. We don’t need a special constitutional provision prohibiting office-holders from taking bribes, because taking bribes is already illegal under the common law, and it is also one of the “high crimes and misdemeanors” for which office-holders can be impeached.

But it’s a close cousin to bribery; accepting an emolument introduces an improper element — personal gain — into the decision-maker’s calculus, less obviously and overtly than in cases of actual bribery, but no less serious for that.

And that is precisely the situation Trump is now in. He has 49 additional applications pending before the Chinese Trademark Office. He has been given a nice, valuable gift, and he could be forgiven for thinking that other similar gifts could follow (if he behaves himself well).

You might object by saying that it’s not a “gift” at all. Not like those snuff boxes. He’s just been given what he’s legally entitled to — the trademark rights — under Chinese law.

And it’s true, of course, that it is not a gift. He’s legally entitled (as we’re assuming — see above) to the trademark; they’re not giving it to him as a present.

But why should that matter for purposes of the foreign emoluments clause? If France had had a law that gave all visiting Americans a snuff box (if they came at a certain time to the Hotel de Ville and submitted an application), would Jefferson have been able to keep his? Wouldn’t it have been just as troublesome in those circumstances as an outright gift would have been?

With the Trump presidency in crisis mode already and at some risk of unraveling completely, violating the foreign emoluments clause is hardly the most serious charge that can be leveled against the president. If I were sketching an outline of a preliminary Bill of Particulars for an impeachment proceeding, it would certainly not top the list, which might include such more worrisome matters as discussing and displaying classified information in a public restaurant, or running a campaign that may well have been colluding with foreign governments to sabotage the election. But it would be on there somewhere — the violation of an express constitutional prohibition is a serious matter, and I just hope that it is not getting drowned out amidst all the other noise.If anyone thinks Donald Trump hasn’t been given a fair shake, just review the tape. Time and time again, the president has attempted handshakes with domestic and foreign leaders using his signature herky-jerky motion, leaving a trail of only despair. It was even the subject of a “Last Week Tonight” segment that aired Sunday.

But that was before this meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

On Monday, Trudeau bravely stepped up to the president and grabbed him by the shoulder to brace against Trump’s unorthodox movements. The prime minister left the encounter with his arm intact. It was nothing short of incredible.

To understand the importance of the moment, just look to John Oliver. Merely hours before Trudeau’s meeting with Trump, the HBO host aired a whole segment about Trump’s tragic handshakes.

Oliver first pointed to the expression on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe’s face after escaping Trump’s death grip.

”That is the prime minister of a country known for awkwardly long formal displays of respect, and even he is going, ‘Oh, fuck this shit,’” said Oliver.

The comedian then played a lowlight reel of Trump’s other awkward handshakes, unintentionally summing up why Trudeau’s shake was so significant.

Because then a hero came along, with the strength to carry on ...

Actually, the hero lies in Trudeauuu!Space Poop Problem-Solvers Take Home Cash Prizes From NASA

On Wednesday morning, NASA rewarded five members of the public — two doctors, a dentist, an engineer and a product designer — for their creative ideas for how to poop in a spacesuit.

Yes, it sounds a little bit funny. But unmet toilet needs could have life or death consequences for an astronaut in an emergency situation.

That's why thousands of people spent tens of thousands of hours on the "Space Poop Challenge," brainstorming, modeling, prototyping and number-crunching to come up with a crowd-sourced solution to the problem of human waste in a spacesuit.

Currently, astronauts on spacewalks rely on diapers, which is a feasible solution for only a few hours at a time. As we explained in November, NASA is imagining a situation where an astronaut is stuck in a spacesuit for days — like during an emergency on future Orion missions, which could take astronauts far from Earth.

The super-portable-bathroom solution has to work quickly, easily, in micro-gravity, without impeding movement, for both men and women, for solid and liquid waste. It can either store waste in the suit or expel it. And it has to be comfortable ... for up to six continuous days.

Since the project launched on the HeroX crowdsourcing site in October, nearly 20,000 people, from all over the world, submitted more than 5,000 ideas. They were competing for a total of $30,000 in prizes.

The winning solution came from Thatcher Cardon, an Air Force officer, family practice physician and flight surgeon. He says his design was inspired by minimally invasive surgical techniques — and a strong desire not to store the poop.

"I never thought that keeping the waste in the suit would be any good," he told NPR. "So I thought, 'How can we get in and out of the suit easily?' "

[In] less invasive surgeries like laparoscopy or arthroscopy or even endovascular techniques they use in cardiology, they can do some amazing things in very small openings.

"I thought about what I know regarding less invasive surgeries like laparoscopy or arthroscopy or even endovascular techniques they use in cardiology — they can do some amazing things in very small openings.

"I mean, they can even replace heart valves now through catheters in an artery. So it should be able to handle a little bit of poop!"

He designed a small airlock at the crotch of the suit, with a variety of items — including inflatable bedpans and diapers — that could be passed through the small opening and then expanded. His design even allows an astronaut to change underwear while inside the spacesuit, through the same small opening.

Cardon used an old flight suit to try some physical prototyping, and his kids helped gather supplies. They were "totally excited," he says. "They lost their minds when I told them I won."

Second place went to a trio from Houston — a physician, an engineering professor and a dentist (who also served as the team's illustrator). All three had studied chemical engineering in college.

Stacey Louie, the environmental engineer on the team, said the different areas of expertise on the team were central to their solution. But before they fine-tuned their design, they had to discard a lot of ideas.

For instance, doctor and team leader Jose Gonzales says that he immediately thought of some medicine-inspired strategies that would be effective — but not at all comfortable.

"You have to take into consideration, 'Is the astronaut going to be OK with this design?' " Katherine Kin, the dentist and artist, notes. "You have to have something that's psychologically comfortable."

So internal catheters were out. Instead, Gonzales says, they used an air-powered system to push waste away from the body to store it elsewhere in the suit. "More specifically, that air is created by passive and active normal body movements of the astronaut," Gonzales says.

A product designer from the U.K., Hugo Shelley, placed third. He usually works with electronics and tech products, but he says for this contest, he went in the other direction — and tried to build a solution with as few electronic parts as possible.

"I think we're all aware of the dangers of things going wrong in space," he says. A simple design seemed safer, he says.

"My mother's a textile designer so I think I started off really thinking about materials," he says. "Making something as comfortable as possible I thought was fairly important ... a lot of your mechanism really has to be in, effectively, the first few millimeters away from the skin."

His solution, the "SWIMSuit — Zero Gravity Underwear," disinfects and stores waste inside the suit, like the second-place design does.

Cardon won $15,000, while the trio from Houston took home $10,000 and Shelley netted $5,000.

The next step is for NASA to start prototyping the ideas, and get working versions of a waste-management system up to the International Space Station for testing.

Dustin Gohmert, the Orion crew survival system project manager at NASA, explains that NASA will combine existing ideas with elements of the winning designs to create a solution that will, indeed, go into space.

"Optimistically this will never be used, because it is a contingency scenario that something catastrophic has happened," he said. "But this will be on Orion and should something happen, and should it be called on to save the crew, this will be there and at their disposal."

Shelley, the product designer, notes that research on how to improve waste management inside a spacesuit could also be useful in "earth-bound applications" — for people with incontinence or in high-pressure, critical job situations.

It's an amusing thing to think about, but still it's a part of a spacesuit — and there's something incredibly thrilling about the space missions.

And while it was "kind of odd" to think about poop in space for weeks at a time, he says the project was "quite exciting."

"Yes, it's an amusing thing to think about, but still it's a part of a spacesuit — and there's something incredibly thrilling about the space missions," he says.

And, he notes, "you can't fully appreciate being an interplanetary explorer if you've constantly got to use the bathroom and you can't."Colossal, the latest effort from Oscar-nominated filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo (Timecrimes), starts out not unlike a good chunk of broad American comedies: Gloria (Anne Hathaway), a washed-up party girl, loses her job and boyfriend and moves back home to pick up the pieces in her life. From there, however, the film proves to be anything but typical. Rather abruptly, Colossal unveils itself as a delightfully bizarre monster movie.

In what can reasonably be described as her most interesting role in some time, Hathaway plays a woman who comes to a realization that her own mental breakdown is, in some way, connected to and responsible for a giant kaiju rampaging through Seoul, Korea. Along those lines, the movie balances laid-back humor with its extraordinary premise, and according to the reaction out of its well-received Toronto International Film Festival debut last year, it’s also full of surprises. This first trailer doesn’t give too much away, but it does shine a light on Hathaway thoroughly enjoying her monster-related character, and should hopefully serve as a reminder that in addition to being a great dramatic actress, she can be pretty funny too.Former national security adviser Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U.S. officials said.

The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense. But several officials said it is unclear whether prosecutors would attempt to bring a case, in part because Flynn may parse the definition of the word “sanctions.” He also followed his denial to the FBI by saying he couldn’t recall all of the conversation, officials said.

Any decision to prosecute would ultimately lie with the Justice Department.

A spokesman for Flynn said he had no response. The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment.

Flynn spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak following Trump’s election and denied for weeks that the December conversation involved sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia in response to its purported meddling in the U.S. election. Flynn’s denial to the FBI was similar to what he had told Trump’s advisers, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

(Reuters)

In a recent interview with the Daily Caller, Flynn said he didn’t discuss “sanctions” but did discuss the Obama administration’s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats it said were “intelligence operatives.” The move was part of the sanctions package it announced on Dec. 29.

Earlier, in an interview with The Post, he denied discussing sanctions but later issued a statement saying “that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Trump asked for Flynn’s resignation Monday night following reports in The Washington Post that revealed Flynn had misled Vice President Pence in denying the substance of the call and that Justice Department officials had warned the White House that Flynn was a possible target of Russian blackmail as a result.

[Justice Department warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail, officials say]

One day after his dismissal, the Defense Intelligence Agency suspended Flynn’s security clearance. Officials said the spy agency was reviewing Flynn’s adherence to security procedures in part due to FBI concerns about his conduct.

Two days after the FBI interview, then-acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates and a career national security official informed Donald McGahn, Trump’s White House counsel, about the contents of the intercepted phone call in a meeting at the White House. Yates and other officials were concerned that Russia could not only exploit the mischaracterization of the call — which Pence had repeated on nationwide television — but also did not think it was fair to keep Pence in the dark about the discrepancies, according to officials familiar with their thinking.

At a news conference Thursday, Trump called Flynn a “fine person” and said he had done nothing wrong in engaging with the Russian envoy. Trump said he did not direct Flynn to talk to Kislyak. However, the president added, “I would have directed him because that’s his job.”

(Daron Taylor,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)

Trump said he had asked for Flynn’s resignation because of what the national security adviser had told the vice president about his communications with the Russian diplomat. “I was not happy with the way that information was given,” Trump said.

The president said the real issue in the Flynn saga was the divulging of classified information. “It’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.”

[The Michael Flynn situation just went from bad to worse for Flynn — and the White House]

Senior officials who have reviewed the phone call thought Flynn’s statements to Kislyak were inappropriate, if not illegal, because he suggested that the Kremlin could expect a reprieve from the sanctions.

At the same time, officials knew that seeking to build a case against Flynn for violating an obscure 1799 statute known as the Logan Act — which bars private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes — would be legally and political daunting. Several officials said that while sanctions were discussed between Flynn and Kislyak in the December call, they did not see evidence in the intercept that Flynn had an “intent” to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

“It wasn’t about sanctions. It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out,” Flynn told the Daily Caller in an interview just before he resigned and published Tuesday. “So that’s what it turned out to be. It was basically, ‘Look, I know this happened. We’ll review everything.’ I never said anything such as, ‘We’re going to review sanctions,’ or anything like that.”

It is not clear when the FBI began to probe Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Senior members of the Obama administration learned in early January that the FBI was investigating the relationship, according to former officials.

On President Barack Obama’s final full day in office, Yates, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and CIA Director John O. Brennan recommended informing the Trump team of the Flynn matter. But FBI Director James B. Comey pushed back, arguing that doing so could interfere with the bureau’s ongoing investigation. The FBI is examining contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Comey dropped his objections after the FBI interviewed the national security adviser.

After Yates informed McGahn, the White House counsel informed Trump and then conducted an internal review of the matter, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

[Who is Donald McGahn?]

While McGahn and Trump were briefed on the matter on Jan. 26, it does not appear that they informed Pence. A spokesman for the vice president said he first learned that he had been misled when The Washington Post on Feb. 9 disclosed that Flynn had, in fact, discussed sanctions with Kislyak, contrary to the vice president’s public statements.

Flynn said in his resignation letter that he had “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador.”

The timeline of Michael Flynn’s resignation just looks bad for the Trump White House

National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials, officials say

Michael Flynn has absolutely nothing to fear from the Logan ActJames S. Brady Press Briefing Room

1:15 P.M. EST

MR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Happy Valentine's Day. I can sense the love in the room. (Laughter.)

First off, last night, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control -- OFAC -- labeled the Venezuelan Vice President as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act.

Before I continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions, I want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questions.

Secretary Mnuchin.

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office. Yesterday, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. El Aissami's primary frontman, Venezuelan national Samark Lopez Bellow was also designated.

These designations follow a multi-year investigation into El Aissami's criminal activities. And President Trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the Department of Treasury, the Department of State, as well as the National Security Council and many people throughout law enforcement.

Following the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels, this action demonstrates the President's seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the United States. In addition, he wants to send a clear message to the people of Venezuela that America stands with them.

And with that, I'm happy to take two or three questions specifically about this.

Q Secretary Mnuchin, since sanctions are directly relevant, obviously, to the Treasury Department, which is an agency that you now oversee, can you talk a little bit about plans to sanction Russia and if you'll keep Obama-era sanctions against Russia?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Our current sanctions programs are in place, and I would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries. But it's a very important program within the Treasury Department.

Q And for Russia specifically?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: The existing policies are in place.

Q Mr. Secretary, are you contemplating any additional sanctions against Iran? And can you tell us what you think the bottom line will be at these particular sanctions you announced yesterday and are referring to today with the Venezuelan Vice President? What's it going to mean?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, first, let me just comment -- again, this is as a result of a very long effort --

Q Did you (inaudible) the implication, by the way?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes, this was underway. This was a very long effort. But the implication is quite significant. We expect that there will be frozen tens of millions of dollars and, again, that sanctions are a very important way of us sending a message that we will not stand for illicit activities, whether they're drug trafficking or terrorism.

Q On Iran, sir?

Q Secretary, including sanctions, what other tools are you looking at?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I can't comment on all the tools, but, again, let me just reinforce that sanctions are a very important tool within the department and we will use them as appropriate.

Q What about freezing assets?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: In this case, we did freeze assets -- again, as I mentioned, tens of millions of dollars of assets. And that will have a very big impact on this.

So I'll take one more question please. Yes, in the back.

Q During the campaign, the President had made comments about Janet Yellen and whether -- basically inferring that she was being too political and that she should be ashamed of herself. Do the folks at the Treasury Department and within the administration feel confident with Mrs. Yellen at the helm and to be able to set monetary policy going forward?

SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just comment. I'm really here today, again, to talk about the Venezuelan situation. But let me just say that there is a tradition of the Secretary of Treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve, and I look forward to that now that I'm in office doing that and spending time with her.

Thank you very much, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here on my first day.

MR. SPICER: All right, let's get back to the fun. We've been reviewing -- and I want to address the events of last night, first and foremost. We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth. We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where a level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.

The President was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the Vice President and others. He was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisors -- like China, North Korea and the Middle East -- that the President must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position.

The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the President to ask for General Flynn’s resignation. Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House Counsel of the situation, the White House Counsel briefed the President and a small group of senior advisors. The White House Counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue.

During this process it’s important to note that the President did not have his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who he trusts immensely, approved by the Senate. When the President heard the information as presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsel’s review corroborated that.

It is not ordinary* [unordinary] for an incoming National Security Advisor to speak with his counterparts about the issues of concern to them. In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his counterparts throughout the transition. As Charles Krauthammer said last night, it is “perfectly reasonable for him to do so.” The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynn’s relationship -- misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation.

That’s why the President decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it. The irony of this entire situation is that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia. He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia. His Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea. As Ambassador Haley said at the time, the “dire situation in Eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.”

President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea. At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia, unlike previous administrations, so that we can solve many problems together facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS and terrorism.

The President is currently evaluating a group of very strong candidates that will be considered to fill the National Security Advisor position permanently, and is confident in the ability of General Kellogg, a decorated and distinguished veteran of the United States Army, until that person is ultimately chosen.

Before I get into the President’s schedule for today, a quick recap of the President’s activity over the last few days, since we haven’t had the honor of spending so much time together.

The President has been keeping a close eye on the Oroville Dam situation in California. We’ve worked closely with Doug LaMalfa, who represents California’s First District, where the dam is located, and other state officials to help people who have been impacted. The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress. Dams, bridges, roads, and all ports around the county have fallen into disrepair. In order to prevent the next disaster, we will pursue the President’s vision for an overhaul of our nation’s crumbling infrastructure.

We hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue, and we’ll be working alongside with FEMA and appropriate government entities to make sure that we are doing everything we can to attend to this matter.

The President was honored also to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan last week from their first official meeting at the White House to their joint press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- excuse me, their joint press conference and their time together at Mar-a-Lago. The President and the Prime Minister had a productive visit that reaffirmed their determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and economic relationship.

At Mar-a-Lago, the President was proud to stand behind Prime Minister Abe on Saturday to convey the United States’ unwavering support for our Japanese allies in the face of North Korea’s most recent missile launch. On Sunday, the President met with now-Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Mr. Steve Wynn before returning to Washington.

Yesterday, the President had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, focusing on our shared commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and the problems throughout the world. Our countries share a profound economic interest with more than $2 billion in two-way trade flowing across our border every day.

The President was pleased to launch the Canada-United States Council for the Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders by holding a roundtable discussion here at the White House. Together with Prime Minister Trudeau, his daughter Ivanka, the President discussed the unique challenges that women face in the workplace with an incredible group of successful and respected female business executives from both countries. A full list of the participants is available through the pool.

In addition to his in-person meetings with the prime ministers of Japan and Canada, the President also recently had phone calls with the presidents of Tunisia, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia and South Africa. Readouts are available on all of those calls.

Finally, following the Prime Minister's visit yesterday, the President met with Chairwoman McDaniel and Co-Chairman Paduchik of the Republican National Committee. In the afternoon, the President participated in a pinning ceremony for Major Ricardo Turner, one of his military aides. The aides to the President are mid-grade officers, one from of each of the services. They provide direct support to the President in his role as Commander-in-Chief, and their primary responsibilities are to serve as an emergency action officer, aide-de-camp, and ceremonial aide. It's a longstanding tradition that when the President's military aide is promoted to the next higher grade, the President conducts that promotion. Major Ricardo Turner, the President's military aide, was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and the promotion was held in the Oval Office.

The President also spoke yesterday with Maureen Scalia on the one-year anniversary of her husband's passing. The President and Mrs. Scalia discussed her late husband's incredible legacy, and how the President is making every effort to carry it on by nominating Judge Gorsuch, who shares the love of the Constitution, to succeed him on the bench.

Last night, the President obviously hosted the swearing-in of Secretary Mnuchin in the Oval Office. Secretary Mnuchin is a world-class financier whose decades of experience with financial and monetary matters make him the ideal person to spearhead the President's plan to develop a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans. We're glad to officially have him on board.

Now, moving on to the schedule for today -- this morning, the President and newly confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos held a parent-teacher conference meeting with parents and educators from public, private, charter, and home schools this morning. The President opened the meeting by congratulating Secretary DeVos for her toughness and staying the course throughout her confirmation process. He then discussed his vision for all Americans to have an opportunity to climb the ladder of success, starting with making quality education available to every child no matter their zip code.

Under the current system, the President believes too many of our children are trapped in failing schools, especially in the African American community. The President told the group to begin addressing this problem, which he views as a civil rights issue. He wants parents to be able to decide what educational options are best for their children. The group launched into a wide-ranging discussion that included public and charter schools, home-schooling, dropout prevention, and the BASIS Schools Program, states' responsibilities, and the current state of the U.S. Department of Education.

The President's ultimate goal is to create safe communities, great schools, and well-paying jobs. He believes that each of these goals is linked to the others, and the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to achieve them all.

The President also spoke on the phone earlier today with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, continuing the productive conversation they started during her visit earlier this year. A readout on that call should be coming soon. The President then had lunch with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his wife regarding combatting drug use.

At 2:00, the President will sign House Joint Resolution 41 in the Oval Office. The resolution is a start of rolling back harmful Obama-era regulations, which have cost the American business consumers a staggering $890 billion, making our companies less competitive and even driving some of them out of business. The American free enterprise system is the greatest engine for economic prosperity in the world, but for too many, to reach its maximum potential, we must remove the barriers to productivity that are holding back our great workers and businesses.

Misguided federal regulations, such as the SEC rule addressed by HJR 41, inflict real cost on the American people and put our businesses, especially small businesses, at a significant disadvantage. It's a priority for the Trump administration to fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances American productivity and wellbeing without imposing unnecessary costs and burdens. Signing this joint resolution is one more step towards achieving this goal.

Later this evening, the President will meet with Secretary Kelly and Attorney General Sessions to continue discussions on potential options for addressing the very clear national security threats we're facing in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling.

Tomorrow, the President is pleased to be welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East. They will consult on a range of issues -- regional issues -- including addressing the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, the crisis in Syria, and countering ISIS and other terrorist groups.

As the President has made clear, his administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security. The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister. They will hold a joint press conference tomorrow, as well, and further guidance will be coming on the time and location.

Looking ahead to Friday, the President will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. This visit will give the President an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America’s number-one exporter and the millions of American workers involved in aerospace. This trip has been months in the making, and we’re thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing plane.

With that, I’d be glad to take some of your questions.

Jonathan Karl.

Q Back in January, the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians. Now, today, can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election?

MR. SPICER: My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period -- well, we were very clear that during the transition period, he did speak with the ambassador --

Q I’m talking about during the campaign.

MR. SPICER: I don’t have any -- there’s nothing that would conclude me -- that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.

Q And why would the President -- if he was notified 17 days ago that Flynn had misled the Vice President, other officials here, and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the Russians, why would he be kept on for almost three weeks?

MR. SPICER: Well, that’s not -- that assumes a lot of things that are not true. The President was informed of this. He asked the White House Counsel to review the situation. The first matter was whether there was a legal issue. We had to review whether there was a legal issue, which the White House Counsel concluded there was not, as I stated in my comments. This was an act of trust. Whether or not he actually misled the Vice President was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to the President asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn. That’s it, pure and simple. It was a matter of trust.

We went through a very deliberative process, a very thorough review. The first part of it was clearly to understand the legal aspect of this, and that was simply concluded there was no legal aspect. And then what happened is the President evaluated the trust aspect of it.

Major.

Q When the President was asked on Air Force One yesterday -- I mean, on Friday, rather, traveling down to Mar-a-Lago, about reports about conversations with the Russians about sanctions, he said, “I don’t know about it. I’ll look into that.” Was he being truthful?

MR. SPICER: What he was asked specifically is was he aware of a Washington Post story. He hadn’t seen that at the time. Of course, he was involved; I just said that he was aware of the situation right after the White House Counsel informed him back in January.

Q And his inquiry to the White House Counsel was strictly about the legalities involved, not the propriety of the conversations between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador?

MR. SPICER: Well, initially, just to be --

Q Do you have any criticism of the merits of those conversations about sanctions before the Trump administration had been inaugurated?

MR. SPICER: So just to be clear, the acting Attorney General informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a “heads up” to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had sent the Vice President out in particular. The White House Counsel informed the President immediately. The President asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there. That was immediately determined that there wasn’t. That was what the President believed at the time, from what he had been told, and he was proved to be correct.

The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust. And the President concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security advisor over --

Q But was it proper for the incoming national security advisor, not part of an administration, to be discussing an issue as sensitive as sanctions with the Russian ambassador?

MR. SPICER: His job is to discuss issues with his counterparts. I mean, Charles Krauthammer put it perfectly last night -- that’s what he’s supposed to be doing. I mean, that’s his job. We would constantly read out throughout the transition who he was speaking to, how he was getting ready. The President was receiving congratulatory calls from around the world. We would read out the world leader calls.

The job of the incoming NSA is to sit down with the counterparts and start that dialogue, and that’s exactly what he did. So the question wasn’t did he do anything improper or legal, it’s a question of could he be trusted further. And that trust, or the erosion of that trust, was, frankly, the issue.

Q Did the President instruct him to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador?

MR. SPICER: No, absolutely not. No, no, no. But that -- no. And there’s no -- that’s never --

Q So would he have preferred he had not done that?

MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President had no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be doing. He had an ability to talk about issues that were important, whether it was that or the 30 other countries that he spoke to. That was part of his job, as has been noted by many people. That’s what the national security advisor and, frankly, other positions do -- they begin the process of preparing their incoming job by talking to counterparts, people who have previously held the job, et cetera. If he had not done that, there would be questions as to whether he’s properly prepared on day one.

Q So he (inaudible) one conversation about sanctions.

MR. SPICER: No, the issue isn’t whether or not -- what he discussed. There’s been a complete legal review of that, and there’s no issue with that. The issue is whether or not he failed to properly inform the Vice President -- or not be honest with him, or not remember it.

But that’s the plain and simple issue. And when he lost trust with the President, that’s when the President asked for and received his resignation.

Q Thanks a lot, Sean. Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said that the President continued to have trust in General Flynn.

MR. SPICER: Right.

Q What happened between yesterday morning and yesterday evening that led the President to lose confidence in General Flynn?

MR. SPICER: Well, I’m not going to get into the specifics of what the President’s thinking was, but I will just say, as I noted in the opening statement, that it was an evolving and eroding process.

And so at the end of the day, the President made a decision, as he does on all subjects, and asked for and received the national security advisor’s -- but he is one of those people that we’ve noted before -- when he is ready to make a decision, he makes it, whether it’s hiring somebody or asking for someone’s resignation. Once he has determined that he’s made a decision on any subject, that’s when he informs his staff.

So going into the day, it was an evolving situation. He made a determination late in the day, and he executed on it.

Yes, Alexis.

Q He’s an extremely loyal person, General Flynn. Was it a difficult decision for the President to let General Flynn go?

MR. SPICER: Well, sure. I mean, General Flynn is a dedicated public servant. He’s headed the DIA, he has been an outstanding member of the Army, both as an officer and then as a flag officer. He’s served this country admirably. And I think the President appreciated his service to his nation, his commitment to his campaign, and his service to this country so far.

But at some point, the decision came down on whether or not that that trust had eroded. The important matters, as I mentioned, that are before the President when he’s dealing with issues of world matters, of all of the issues -- friends and allies, foes, hot spots -- he needs to rely on a national security advisor to give him sage advice. And I think at a certain point, that guidance, that trust, eroded. And the President, as he does on all matters, ultimately decides that when he's ready to make a decision, he executes.

Alexis.

Q Sean, two questions. Does the President believe that anything that he discussed with General Flynn during the transition might have been construed by the General as a request or an encouragement to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? That's question number one.

MR. SPICER: So -- oh, we're going to pause. So, on the first, again, as I made clear, there's nothing that the General did that was a violation of any sort. He was well within his duties to discuss issues of common concern between the two countries. I will say it again: What this came down to is a matter of trust. The President was glad that he was out there conducting his job, preparing for his job, going back and forth with his counterparts throughout the world, much as the President had done with all of these world leaders calling the President, congratulating him, looking to set up calls for him once he was inaugurated.

Similarly, General Flynn was beginning that process with his counterparts throughout the world. That was never of a concern to the President, from day one that he was briefed from the White House Counsel. The issue, plain and simple, came down to a matter of trust. And once that occurred, it was over.

Q On question number one, just to clarify, the President does not believe that any discussion that might have taken place -- and we know from intel, it did, on sanctions -- creates a problem for the President in any way -- that that is not a problem, that General Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russians?

MR. SPICER: No, there is -- I can't say it clearly enough. There was nothing in what General Flynn did, in terms of conducting himself, that was an issue. What it came down to, plain and simple, was him misleading the Vice President and others, and not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that. That's it.

Q Question number two. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle would like to investigate or probe or ask more questions about this. Does the President hope to cooperate with those investigations? Would he instruct members of his staff who worked for him here and in the administration to cooperate with those investigations?

MR. SPICER: Well, we're going to comply with the law. I think the President feels very confident the review that was conducted by White House Counsel was very thorough and concluded very conclusively, as he had first come to -- instinctively come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong. So people are free to do what they wish, but I think that they will find exactly what the President first believed and what the White House Counsel concluded. And, frankly, I believe a couple publications even reported that there was no investigation for a reason -- because there was not an issue of law, it was an issue of trust.

George.

Q When do you expect to have a replacement in place? And secondly, on another topic, there was a report yesterday that one of your colleagues said the White House is keeping dossiers on reporters. Can you say if that's true or not?

MR. SPICER: That is absolutely not true. There are no dossiers being kept. It's just a binder that I put right here, that's about it. That was a joke. Hold on one second. And then, I'm sorry, George, the first part?

Q Timetable on a replacement.

MR. SPICER: Just like the way he handled this situation, the President will meet with individuals, and when he's ready to make a decision and he feels as though the person is qualified and can properly advise him on the issue, he'll make that decision. But that, as all decisions, rests with him.

I'm just going to go to my first Skype seat. John Huck of WKVVU out of Las Vegas.

John.

Q Thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity to join you today. As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession -- more so than perhaps any other city in the country. As the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you make to Nevadans that those actions won't lead banks and investments banks to re-engage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks out?

MR. SPICER: Thanks, John. I think one of the things -- if you look at the intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we didn't have institutions that were too big to fail. And frankly, it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail. Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do. And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41 that the President is signing today, this is another example of the President taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are, frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation's banks and businesses than helping them.

I think the President is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually intended to do. But right now, we actually, through Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off. We've created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authority.

John Roberts.

Q Let me go back to what you said at the beginning. You said the White House Counsel's Office reviewed this and determined that there was nothing illegal. What evidence did they look at in making this determination? And secondly, Democrats up on the Hill say that they want an investigation of this. They're looking into what did the President know and when did he know it. So can you tell us what evidence you looked at the White House Counsel's Office, and what did the President know about all of this and when was he aware of it?

MR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned, the first day that the Department of Justice made White House Counsel available -- or sought to notify White House Counsel was January 26th. The President was immediately informed of the situation. As I said, based on the information that was provided at the time, the view was that this was not a violation. He was proved instinctively correct. And White House Counsel at that time undertook an extensive review both of materials and questioning --

Q Did they --

MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the specifics. What I will tell you is, on multiple occasions they had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of General Flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided to them, or materials that were provided to them to review. I'm not going to get into the details of that, but I will just say that there was an exhaustive review.

And again, the thing that's important to note is the Vice President and myself -- in fact, I think the first time I brought this issue up was January 13 -- the Department of Justice didn’t notify the White House or the White House Counsel at that time in the transition phase until 13 days later.

So I think it's important to understand something very, very important: This idea of why did it take so long -- I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this. They were aware of this. We were making statements based on what General Flynn was telling us, starting on January 13th. The Vice President went out on the 15th, right? They didn’t notify the White House Counsel's Office until January 26th. At that time, there was an immediate -- the President was immediately informed of that and then asked the White House Counsel to conduct a very, very thorough review. The first part of that review was focused on whether or not there was any legal issue -- that's it. Once that became the issue, then there was a -- it shifted into phase two, which is whether or not there was trust still maintained. Then that became a separate set of issues that were --

Q I understand. I'm speaking to the actual evidence, that the FBI has transcripts of these intercepts, which I assume were done by the NSA via a FISA Court order. Was there any communication between the White House Counsel's Office and the FBI? Did those transcripts ever enter --

MR. SPICER: I will say that obviously -- there was obviously communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel's Office. I'm not going to get into the specific nature of that. I think it would be inappropriate because of the nature of the information that was being discussed.

Yes.

Q Why not dismiss the General on January 27th? Why, if the question was of trust, and immediately you have on the 15th, he's on "Face the Nation" saying that -- the Vice President on "Face the Nation" saying that this is what General Flynn told me, and then January 26th you hear the opposite -- why not immediately act? Why wait another two and a half weeks?

MR. SPICER: I don’t understand how that's a due process. Because what the -- the Attorney General didn’t come -- the Acting Attorney General -- come in and say that there was an issue. She said, we wanted to give you a head's up that there may be information, okay? She could not confirm there was an investigation. And so it would be unbelievably short-sighted and wrong to go in and dismiss someone immediately. In fact, what the President did was take decisive action to make sure that the White House Counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted the situation. He took immediate, decisive action. And if you look at the timeline in terms of what he did and how that expanded, the White House Counsel's first and foremost goal was to make sure that there was not a legal issue at hand. Once that was concluded, then it became a phase of determining whether or not the General's action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined his trust in the President. But the President, from day one, from minute one, was unbelievably decisive in asking for and demanding that his White House Counsel and their team review the situation, first and foremost, to question whether it's a legal issue. And what they immediately determined -- not immediately, but within several days, was that, after review, that there was not a legal issue, and then it moved into a second phase.

Mara.

Q So wait -- because the President tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks -- illegal leaks.

MR. SPICER: It is leaks. But if you think about this -- understand that all of this information was leaked. I mean, I got to -- and again, I know we've got me lecturing you about what the story should be, but I think that there's a real story here. The idea that not just in this administration, but the Obama administration going back to the Bush administration and back, that we have an issue where classified information, of which this would be, is handled in such a way that it is being given out.

And I know in some cases it's a good story, and I understand that, and that's to some degree your responsibility to write that. But I think there's also a story here, with the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out. That's a real concern for this President; that when he's talking on the phone with a world leader, that when he's making key decisions that are in the interest of protecting this country, that we have to wonder whether or not people who work for our government, who are entrusted with classified information and decision-based materials are leaking that information out. That, I do believe, is a big story that should be reported. I also believe that the President is, rightly so, very, very concerned about this, because it's not just something that is plaguing the current situation, but it goes back through the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration. When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security, frankly.

Trey.

Q Hold on --

MR. SPICER: Sorry, I apologize, Mara.

Q I know you just forgot. I have a question, but I want you to clarify something you just said to John. Are you saying that no one has read the transcripts of the calls, or you just don’t want to tell us whether they --

MR. SPICER: I said that I'm not going to comment on it.

Q Okay. So my question is about sanctions. You were very specific in talking about the sanctions against Crimea and that he doesn’t want to lift them until Crimea is returned. But the sanctions that Flynn was discussing were the sanctions for the election hacking.

MR. SPICER: Right.

Q That's something the President could remove on his own if he wanted to. Is he committed to keeping those?

MR. SPICER: I think Secretary Mnuchin commented on that. There's no change in our current sanctions strategy with Russia, and I've got nothing for you on that.

Trey.

Q Given that the current story is leaks, what is the President willing to do to investigate further to determine where these leaks are coming from?

MR. SPICER: Yeah, again, I think this goes back to the same way he negotiates. Telling people what we’re going to do to cover up additional leaks wouldn’t be a very sound strategy when it comes to making sure that that doesn’t happen again. The President has been very clear, whether he’s negotiating or dealing with an issue like this, you don’t telegraph to people how you’re going to handle it.

Q Sean --

MR. SPICER: Hold on, Trey gets a follow-up. Everyone else got one.

Q So he is going to take some sort of steps to investigate these leaks that the administration --

MR. SPICER: I would just say that the President, as I said, is clearly upset about this. He understands the threat that they pose to our national security, and he’s going to make sure that he continues to take action to make sure that that stops.

Yes.

Q Thank you. So you’ve mentioned time and time again that this is an issue of trust. You also said that it was an evolving issue, and that the issue of the trust that the President had for Flynn came down to this deception that happened with the Vice President but also a host of whole other -- of other issues. What were the other issues? And was the Vice President the only person that was misled by Flynn? Were other people misled?

MR. SPICER: I mean, I think I've stood before you before and explained what General Flynn had conveyed to me. I think there were some others that he had similarly expressed that to, as well. So that’s why it’s others, because it wasn’t just people who went out and made public pronouncements and a series of questioning that was rather exhaustive over a long period of time. He continued to maintain that that had not occurred, and I think that’s where the President continued to -- and that’s why the President was very clear that it was an eroding issue. Because it was after a series of issues and a series of statements and pronouncements that the President came to that conclusion.

Q Were there other issues outside of this call and the deception over that that led to the mistrust with Flynn?

MR. SPICER: I think the statement is very clear that it was this and a series of issues.

With that, let me go to Jason Stevens of the Federalist Paper in Ashland, Ohio.

Q Thank you. What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the American Founders. One of those principles, in the Declaration of Independence, is the consent of the governed. So my question is this: What are the President’s future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state, most of which are the product of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything, let alone make law?

MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jason. I think, as I mentioned today, the President, in just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR 41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect to the SEC in particular.

He is going to continue -- last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation, two must be gotten rid of. The President’s commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government, I think, is unwavering and unquestionable. So you’re going to continue to see this President undo a lot of that government overreach.

Jim.

Q Yeah, just a quick question. You said earlier in your comments that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia. How is that possible? He has made comment after comment over the course of the campaign, the transition, where he defended Vladimir Putin. He had an interview with Bill O’Reilly where he, when he was asked if Vladimir Putin is a killer, he said, well, America hasn’t been that much better in this regard also.

To me it seems, and I think to a lot of Americans it seems that this President has not been tough on Russia. How can you say that?

MR. SPICER: Because I just walked through it. I think there’s a difference between the President wanting to have an understanding of how a good relationship with Russia can help us defeat ISIS and terrorism throughout the world.

Look, the Obama administration tried to have a reset with Russia. They failed. They tried to tell Russia not to invade Crimea. They failed. This President understands that it’s in America’s national and economic interests to have a healthy relationship. If he has a great relationship with Putin in Russia, great. If he doesn’t, then he’ll continue on. But he’s not going to just assume that because it wasn’t able to happen in the past -- I think you’ve seen, with Prime Minister Abe in particular and others, that the reset that Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about tomorrow -- so many of these countries from around the globe are looking forward to resetting the relationships that this country has with them; that they feel as though they were abandoned over the last eight years, and that they are excited about the prospect of a new U.S. relationship under a Trump administration.

But with respect to Russia, I think the comments that Ambassador Haley made at the U.N. were extremely forceful and very clear that until --

Q That was an announcement from Haley, not the President.

MR. SPICER: She speaks for the President. I speak for the President. All of us in this administration. And so all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this President. So I don’t think we could be any clearer on the President’s commitment.

Katie Pavlich.

Q Quick little follow-up, because I haven’t had any follow-ups or questions in a while. But anyway --

MR. SPICER: Really?

Q No -- the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled. Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation?

MR. SPICER: No, look, the trust is given by the President. It’s a relationship between he and any individual. And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because -- I don't know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isn’t just --

Q Isn't that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about --

MR. SPICER: But that’s the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation.

Katie Pavlich.

Q Sean, on the trust issue and the eroding of trust, last night, in General Flynn’s resignation letter, he said he inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information.

MR. SPICER: Right.

Q Considering his role in advising the President on national security matters, is the White House concerned that he maybe briefed the President-elect, Vice President-elect with incomplete information on other matters of national security in addition to his phone calls with the Russian ambassador?

MR. SPICER: Well, when you look at the team, it’s not one person in isolation, Katie. It’s several. You’ve got General Kelly on the homeland security front, General Mattis on the DOD front -- he’s got an entire national security staff and apparatus that briefs him -- you know, Director Pompeo at the CIA, and others from the DNI’s office that come in and brief him on a whole host of issues. So it’s not a single position.

Q So was his situation an isolated incident of giving incomplete --

MR. SPICER: Well, yeah. Regardless of whether it’s a single situation, it’s not as though there’s one person briefing him. And the President synthesizes a lot of information, both written and stuff that is briefed to him, and ultimately it is he who makes that decision based a lot on what he already knows, what he is presented with. So the President gets information from a lot of people -- generals, admirals, people in the military community, ambassadors, people in the State Department, an exhaustive team at the National Security Council, and then makes an ultimate decision based on that and what he already knows to be the case.

Q Sean, you’ve been asked a couple times about these transcripts of calls. Will the White House declassify those and release them?

MR. SPICER: Looks, it is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time. Right now, the focus is on some of the evolving issues that were going around the globe, as you know.

Q Will you be open to it?

MR. SPICER: Let me answer the question. It is not an issue that has come up. I think the President right now is focused on replacing his national security advisor, making sure that he’s presented with the best possible information to make these key decisions.

But at this time, we also have got to be careful that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of national security. And the review, as I mentioned, was done and then immediately last night when the President felt as though it was time for a decision, made it. That’s where we are in this iteration of the process. If we have anything further for you, we will update you.

I want to go to Joyce Kaufman of WFTL Talk News in Palm Beach, Florida.

Q Thank you so much for this opportunity. I’m approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago right now, and the President met with Prime Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. And besides giving us traffic and security nightmares, there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the Prime Minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area. There is already video of this surfacing. Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining areas, these public places? And one last question. When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the embassy, and settlements?

MR. SPICER: On the second one, I’m not going to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s discussion with the President. We’ll have a readout. After that, there will be a press conference.

With respect to the first, there is a SCIF at Mar-a-Lago. And just to be clear, the briefing -- the President was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner. He went with his national security team. They briefed him on the situation in North Korea. Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed. There was simply a discussion about press logistics, where to host the event. And then after the dinner, the President went back into the SCIF to get a further update from his team.

So I’m not really sure where people jumped to conclusions. There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President by his national security team the situation in North Korea. And then the President subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware.

Margaret.

Q Sean, can you just clarify, because I got a little turned around -- did President Trump, or President-elect Trump at the time, know of General Flynn’s discussion of the sanctions while he was NSC-designate? And if not, when did he finally learn about them? And if so, why was he okay with that?

MR. SPICER: So, no, he was not aware, as he’s not back-briefed on every conversation that his national security team has or other staffers. They were performing their duties, as other people were in terms of getting up to speed, conveying with counterparts and previous members of their team.

That being said, when he was made aware of it, once the White House Counsel briefed him on concerns the Department of Justice had -- and at that point, as I mentioned, what he asked and what he believed at the time and was confirmed by White House Counsel was that there was no legal issue here. Discussing the issue didn’t violate anything; it was appropriate in the normal course of action to discuss that. And he immediately asked the White House Counsel to further confirm what his instincts were at the time.

Thank you, guys. Have a great one. We’ve got everybody for a bill signing. We’ve got a bill signing.

Q I didn’t get my --

MR. SPICER: Oh, he’s got -- Margaret gets a follow-up, but he’s got --

Q Are you -- is the administration undertaking any sort of effort, either Cabinet-wide or, like, inside the shop to make sure that everyone comes forward who had any communications with the Russians about sanctions or otherwise?

MR. SPICER: There’s no other information. I mean, as far as we are aware, that is an isolated incident that occurred. And again, the key point in this isn’t that there were discussions. There was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions. It purely came down to a matter of trust. That’s it.

Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow. Happy Valentine’s Day.

Vince Neil‘s arena football endeavor was not over when his team, the Las Vegas Outlaws, folded back in August earlier this year. The Motley Crue singer and two others have been accused of defrauding investors and are being sued by Sohrob Farudi for fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, conspiracy and defamation according to Courthouse News Service.

Farudi is filing the lawsuit against Rockstar Investment Group along with Neil, who was chairman and CEO at the time, president Mark Daniels and treasurer and vice president Robert Hewko. Collectively, they claimed the Las Vegas Outlaws were fully funded with $3 million and sought a $500,000 investment from Farudi in August of 2014 in exchange for 150 of 1,000 shares of the team. Daniels and Hewko had previously told Farudi they owned the Arena Football League team the Jacksonville Sharks, which was unfounded, and had been awarded the Las Vegas team.

Things went awry when payments and fees due to the league bounced or were not paid whatsoever. Upon informing the AFL that the team’s finances were not being handled properly, the league commissioner ordered Daniels and Hewko to be suspended from the daily operations of the team and the AFL seized control of the franchise on July 14, 2015.

According to the Courthouse News report, Neil had also falsely reported to the Las Vegas Sun, “The investor was the managing partner who paid the bills and ran the team, business dealings, sponsorships and finances. That wasn’t our responsibility.”

It has been a rough week for the singer as he was also cited for excessive water usage in drought-stricken California, violating the regulated limit at his Danville residence. Neil was reportedly using over twice as much water on a daily average than the 1,000 gallon limit allowed. When he learned of the violation, he claimed he had not even been living at that house for the last five years.

Vince Neil Sings National Anthem at Las Vegas Outlaws GameAccidental Queens

Spoiler warning: This article reveals surprise elements of the games A Normal Lost Phone, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Gone Home.

At first, the game A Normal Lost Phone looks like a series of simple puzzles: The player is presented with a lost phone and must snoop through it to learn about its owner. But there's something more happening under the surface.

Poking through emails, texts, and dating apps, a story begins to emerge. “I’m getting a little tired of my family telling me ‘you’re a man now,’ ” writes Sam, the phone’s 18-year-old owner. That sounds like a fairly normal complaint for a teenager, but then the player finds a second account in a dating app. Sam’s been presenting as a girl whose description is similar to Sam’s male appearance. Later, players find a text message that threatens, “Don’t ever set foot back in this club or I’ll have to tell your little secret to everybody.”

By the time the player discovers a forum for gender-questioning teens in the browser, it’s no surprise to see that Sam wrote, “I don’t really know what I am, and I’m feeling kinda lost at the moment.”

A Normal Lost Phone was developed by Accidental Queens, a small team that has essentially built a meet-a-trans-kid simulator. The game, which can be played on desktop or mobile devices in about three hours, features around 25,000 words of text to flesh out a world in which the player sees Sam struggle to break up with their girlfriend, confess their fear of being disowned, and investigate hormone therapy. This all plays out against the backdrop of a larger mystery—why did Sam lose their phone on the night of their 18th birthday, what happened to them, and are they all right or did something terrible take place?

“We wanted to deliver a message on a specific subject, working especially on the empathy that could be expressed by the player in this kind of game,” said Diane Landais, programmer and co-founder at Accidental Queens, via email. “Placing the player as a witness rather than an actor (as is most common in video games) lets us present a situation not as an example to follow, but rather as a whole situation to analyze. ... If there’s one thing the game is encouraging, it’s playing the game as oneself: There’s no player character, there’s no avatar, only the player and their phone playing themselves.”

This is the latest addition to an emerging genre of game that highlights queer experiences in the context of gameplay. Past examples include Gone Home, in which players explore what looks at first like an abandoned haunted house but turns out to be the home of a young woman struggling to understand her sexuality. In that game, the dark turmoil of the environment mirrors the stress of the character; and as with A Normal Lost Phone, players never encounter another person but instead learn about characters exclusively by reading materials they've left behind.

In the game Dragon Age: Inquisition, the player encounters a character named Krem who indicates that he binds his chest, which can lead to lengthy branching dialogue in which players can ask invasive questions about Krem’s transition. Between epic battles, the game runs through many of the difficult questions that cis people often have; and by providing a simulated trans friend, it allows cisgender players to pose questions without risk of offending a real person. Crucially, Krem is also a gesture to trans players that they’re welcome in the game world.

Of course, these games are not without controversy, with some players complaining that the revelation of a queer storyline in Gone Home amounted to “propaganda” and “deceit.”

“im not a homophobe, but im not really interested in roleplaying any sexual preference that i personally find... ackward,” wrote one player in a forum post.

While not an ideal response, even that reluctance to engage may be a promising sign. The mainstream game industry has lagged somewhat behind television and film in terms of depicting LGBTQ characters; and now that game content is growing more inclusive, player feedback harkens back to the ways that audiences responded to the Ellens and Will and Graces of the late ’90s. Gay characters on television caused a nationwide freakout two decades ago; it was through ongoing visibility over the intervening years that Ellen moved from a polarizing figure to a mainstream talk-show host.

We know that one of the best ways to move the needle of public opinion on LGBTQ people is simply exposure and conversation. David Fleischer of the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Leadership Lab has pioneered research into effective messaging when reaching out to voters. His findings hinge largely on empathy: finding a connection between people who might not otherwise have expected to see eye-to-eye. In his studies, canvassers went door-to-door, guiding people to put themselves in the place of someone who is or who knows LGBTQ people. His findings were that when voters are asked to imagine the lives of queer people, they're less likely to vote for policies that harm queer people.

Similarly, games like A Simple Lost Phone, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Gone Home all have the potential to bridge a gap by allowing players to envision interactions they might never otherwise have. Through the games, they can learn to become allies, that they're not alone, or simply how it feels to know someone who is out.

There’s no research to compare the impact of Fleischer’s canvassing with the impact of queer content in games. But they're providing similar opportunities to participants: “We think there’s a potential for actual education in the content of the game,” said Landais. “We never intended the game to be played and enjoyed only by a queer community.”HBO

Reese Witherspoon played Tracy Flick in Election 18 years ago, in a performance so towering it birthed an archetype and had the power to typecast Witherspoon forever—not in other movies but in our minds. In the years since Election, Witherspoon has appeared in and produced over 20 other films, assiduously avoiding playing anyone as distastefully Type-A (infamously the name of Witherspoon’s production company) as Flick, anyone as button-cute and implacably relentless, as simultaneously undeniable and detestable. And yet Tracy Flick hovers in the background of all Witherspoon’s choices, a superpower she refuses to deploy.

Willa Paskin Willa Paskin is Slate’s television critic.

A certain steely competence is as much a part of Witherspoon as her defiant chin, but she has spent the years since Election exploring this quality indirectly. Flick is to Witherspoon as the North Pole is to a compass: always exerting an invisible pull even as Witherspoon navigates in every direction but toward it. In Legally Blonde, Witherspoon dressed up her competence in pink, softening her formidable intelligence with a feather boa of ditziness. She won an Oscar as June Carter Cash in Walk the Line, going grounded, sensible, and nurturing with occasional bursts of charming sass. In Wild, she played a woman who had lost herself, the very fact of said woman being played by Reese Witherspoon a kind of promise of her future sanity. She has appeared in half-baked rom-coms and romances and buddy films (Sweet Home Alabama, Just Like Heaven, How Do You Know, This Means War, Water for Elephants, Hot Pursuit) but refrained from starring as Amy in David Fincher’s high-profile Gone Girl, a film that she produced, despite seeming to be the perfect choice to play a scheming, vengeful sociopath masquerading as an appealing everywoman.

All of Witherspoon’s non–Tracy Flick roles have been in conversation with Tracy Flick, murmuring something like, “No, no, no, not you again, not yet”—until now. In HBO’s Big Little Lies, an excellent seven-episode miniseries that gets away with being about the traumas of the obscenely wealthy by being just as rich in character development, Witherspoon has finally given in, donning her own personal Batman suit and playing gloriously to indomitable type. Witherspoon co-stars alongside Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley as Madeline Martha Mackenzie: a mother, community theater enthusiast, and moderately unbearable force of nature.

Madeline is seen by her neighbors as, basically, a stay-at-home Tracy Flick, a woman to be endured and feared, but the audience is invited to know her more intimately, not just her anxieties and flaws but her warmth, her loyalty, her humor, her charming too-muchness. Madeline is the kind of woman who says, only half-joking, that part of the reason she’s a stay-at-home mom is that she just enjoys pissing the working moms off, a bit of childishness copped to so knowingly that its endearing. Madeline’s overinvolved and overinvested, but she’s not selfish or brittle. Underneath her bluster, she’s kind of a square who can’t help but act like she’s larger than life. Witherspoon waited all this time for the chance to take her archetype and make her human.

Big Little Lies, based on the book by Liane Moriarty, is set in the impossibly wealthy beach town of Monterey, California, among a group of women whose children are all in first grade at the fantastic local public school. As the show begins, Woodley’s Jane Chapman has just moved to town with her son Iggy, chasing down secrets from her dark past. She meets Madeline on the first day of school as Madeline screams at her 16-year-old daughter about texting and driving, and then sprains her ankle, her queen bee 6-year-old sitting in the car. Jane—younger, poorer, and more low-key—is wary but swiftly and irrevocably taken under Madeline’s surprisingly generous wing anyway. Jane soon becomes friends with Madeline’s best friend Celeste Wright (Nicole Kidman, also fantastic), a gorgeous mother of twins in what appears to be an idyllic and intensely passionate marriage to the younger Perry (Alexander Skarsgård), but that is much more twisted. Rounding out the relevant mothers is Laura Dern’s Renata Klein, a hotshot CEO who is endlessly needled by Madeline, and Bonnie (Zoë Kravitz), the only underdeveloped character of the bunch, as the beatific, enlightened new yogi wife of Madeline’s ex-husband.

The show is framed by a murder. Someone—and through six of the seven episodes, even the victim’s identity is not revealed—has been killed at the swanky school fundraiser. The show cuts between scenes leading up to the event featuring the aforementioned women and to the present, where Monterey’s other residents, acting as the bitchy Greek chorus, sit in an interrogation room opining on those past events, to which they have been paying attention with the singlemindedness not of overinvested neighbors but a rapt TV audience.

The murder plot is a high-concept hook that the show almost could have done without. (Give the pacing of the first six episodes, it will almost certainly be wrapped up too quickly to be satisfying.) The real precipitating violence is more mundane: One of the first-graders is bullying Renata’s shy daughter Amabelle, who on the first day of school, fingers the sweet Iggy for unclear reasons. Thanks largely to Madeline, the first-grade class is soon drawn into battle lines: decadent 6-year-old birthday parties, trips to see Frozen on ice, and the town production of the controversial Avenue Q all lead to an incredible ratcheting-up of tension between adults, 6-year-olds, and adults behaving worse than 6-year-olds.

This description may make Big Little Lies sound like an intentional satire of affluence and status parenting a la Desperate Housewives, or an unintentional parody of affluence and status parenting a la The Slap. Remarkably, given the current moment, Big Little Lies is not embarrassed to be about exactly what it is about: the travails of immensely privileged people. It does not camouflage itself as a convincing thriller or a pop distraction or an attempt at anthropology. The catty comments of the Monterey hoi polloi do give the series a gossipy gloss but as directed by Wild and Dallas Buyer’s Club’s Jean-Marc Vallee, Big Little Lies is an empathic drama, a remarkably astute and deep series of character and relationship studies. (The exception here is the radical underdevelopment of Kravitz’s Bonnie, also the only major character of color. Her relative opacity stands out like a sore thumb—if it’s not a red herring or a major clue.)Known for their athleticism, postage-stamp skirts and persuasive enthusiasm, cheerleaders have many qualities the drug industry looks for in its sales force. Some keep their pompoms active, like Onya, a sculptured former college cheerleader. On Sundays she works the sidelines for the Washington Redskins. But weekdays find her urging gynecologists to prescribe a treatment for vaginal yeast infection.

Some industry critics view wholesomely sexy drug representatives as a variation on the seductive inducements like dinners, golf outings and speaking fees that pharmaceutical companies have dangled to sway doctors to their brands.

But now that federal crackdowns and the industry's self-policing have curtailed those gifts, simple one-on-one human rapport, with all its potentially uncomfortable consequences, has become more important. And in a crowded field of 90,000 drug representatives, where individual clients wield vast prescription-writing influence over patients' medication, who better than cheerleaders to sway the hearts of the nation's doctors, still mostly men.

"There's a saying that you'll never meet an ugly drug rep," said Dr. Thomas Carli of the University of Michigan. He led efforts to limit access to the representatives who once trolled hospital hallways. But Dr. Carli, who notes that even male drug representatives are athletic and handsome, predicts that the drug industry, whose image has suffered from safety problems and aggressive marketing tactics, will soon come to realize that "the days of this sexual marketing are really quite limited."

But many cheerleaders, and their proponents, say they bring attributes besides good looks to the job - so much so that their success has led to a recruiting pipeline that fuels the country's pharmaceutical sales force. T. Lynn Williamson, Ms. Napier's cheering adviser at Kentucky, says he regularly gets calls from recruiters looking for talent, mainly from pharmaceutical companies. "They watch to see who's graduating," he said.

"They don't ask what the major is," Mr. Williamson said. Proven cheerleading skills suffice. "Exaggerated motions, exaggerated smiles, exaggerated enthusiasm - they learn those things, and they can get people to do what they want."

Approximately two dozen Kentucky cheerleaders, mostly women but a few men, have become drug reps in recent years.

While there are no statistics on how many drug representatives are former or current cheerleaders, demand for them led to the formation of an employment firm, Spirited Sales Leaders, in Memphis. It maintains a database of thousands of potential candidates.

"The cheerleaders now are the top people in universities; these are really capable and high-profile people," said Gregory C. Webb, who is also a principal in a company that runs cheerleading camps and employs former cheerleaders. He started Spirited Sales Leaders about 18 months ago because so many cheerleaders were going into drug sales. He said he knew several hundred former cheerleaders who had become drug representatives.

"There's a lot of sizzle in it," said Mr. Webb. "I've had people who are going right out, maybe they've been out of school for a year, and get a car and make up to $50,000, $60,000 with bonuses, if they do well." Compensation sometimes goes well into six figures.

The ranks include women like Cristin Duren, a former University of Alabama cheerleader. Ms. Duren, 24, recently took a leave from First Horizon Pharmaceuticals to fulfill her duties as the reigning Miss Florida U.S.A. and prepare for next year's Miss U.S.A. pageant.

Onya, the Redskins cheerer (who asked that her last name be withheld, citing team policy), has her picture on the team's Web site in her official bikinilike uniform and also reclining in an actual bikini. Onya, 27, who declined to identify the company she works for, is but one of several drug representatives who have cheered for the Redskins, according to a spokeswoman for the team, Melanie Treanor. Many doctors say they privately joke about the appearance of saleswomen who come to their offices. Currently making the e-mail rounds is an anonymous parody of an X-rated "diary" of a cheerleader-turned-drug-saleswoman.

"Saw Dr. Johnson recently," one entry reads. "After the 'episode' which occurred at our last dinner, I have purposely stayed away from him. The restraining order still remains."

Federal law bans employment discrimination based on factors like race and gender, but it omits appearance from the list.

"Generally, discriminating in favor of attractive people is not against the law in the United States," said James J. McDonald Jr., a lawyer with Fisher & Phillips. But that might be changing, he said, citing a recent ruling by the California Supreme Court, which agreed to hear an employment lawsuit brought by a former L'Oreal manager who ignored a supervisor's order to fire a cosmetics saleswoman and hire someone more attractive.

But pharmaceutical companies deny that sex appeal has any bearing on hiring. "Obviously, people hired for the work have to be extroverts, a good conversationalist, a pleasant person to talk to; but that has nothing to do with looks, it's the personality," said Lamberto Andreotti, the president of worldwide pharmaceuticals for Bristol-Myers Squibb.

But Dr. Carli, at the University of Michigan, said that seduction appeared to be a deliberate industry strategy. And with research showing that pharmaceutical sales representatives influence prescribing habits, the industry sales methods are drawing criticism.

Dr. Dan Foster, a West Virginia surgeon and lawmaker who said he was reacting to the attractive but sometimes ill-informed drug representatives who came to his office, introduced a bill to require them to have science degrees. Dr. Foster's legislation was not adopted, but it helped inspire a new state regulation to require disclosure of minimum hiring requirements.

Ms. Napier, the former Kentucky cheerleader, said she was so concerned about the cute-but-dumb stereotype when she got her job that she worked diligently to learn about her product, Prevacid.

"It's no secret that the women, and the people in general, hired in this industry are attractive people," she said. "But there so much more to it."

Still, women have an advantage with male doctors, according to Jamie Reidy, a drug representative who was fired by Eli Lilly this year after writing a book lampooning the industry, "Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman."

In an interview, Mr. Reidy remembered a sales call with the "all-time most attractive, coolest woman in the history of drug repdom." At first, he said, the doctor "gave ten reasons not to use one of our drugs." But, Mr. Reidy added: "She gave a little hair toss and a tug on his sleeve and said, 'Come on, doctor, I need the scrips.' He said, 'O.K., how do I dose that thing?' I could never reach out and touch a female physician that way."

Stories abound about doctors who mistook a sales pitch as an invitation to more. A doctor in Washington pleaded guilty to assault last year and gave up his license after forcibly kissing a saleswoman on the lips.

One informal survey, conducted by a urologist in Pittsburgh, Dr. James J. McCague, found that 12 of 13 medical saleswomen said they had been sexually harassed by physicians. Dr. McCague published his findings in the trade magazine Medical Economics under the title "Why Was That Doctor Naked in His Office?"

Penny Ramsey Otwell, who cheered for the University of Maryland and now sells for Wyeth in the Dallas area, says she has managed to avoid such encounters.

"We have a few of those doctors in our territory," said Ms. Otwell, 30, who was a contestant on the CBS television show "Survivor." "They'll get called on by representatives who can handle that kind of talk, ones that can tolerate it and don't think anything about it."

But there have been accusations that a pharmaceutical company encouraged using sex to make drug sales. In a federal lawsuit against Novartis, one saleswoman said she had been encouraged to exploit a personal relationship with a doctor to increase sales in her Montgomery, Ala., territory. In court papers responding to the lawsuit, Novartis denied the accusation. The company has also said it is committed to hiring and promoting women.

For her part, Ms. Napier, the TAP Pharmaceutical saleswoman, says it is partly her local celebrity that gives her a professional edge. On the University of Kentucky cheering squad, Ms. Napier stood out for her long dark hair and tiny physique that landed her atop human pyramids.

"If I have a customer who is a real big U.K. fan, we'll have stories to tell each other," Ms. Napier said. "If they can remember me as the cheerleader - she has Prevacid - it just allows you do to so many things."Dark Tower

Ivana Trump once accused the real-estate tycoon of ‘rape,’ although she later clarified: not in the ‘criminal sense.’

Donald Trump introduced his presidential campaign to the world with a slur against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of being “rapists” and bringing crime into the country.

“I mean somebody’s doing it!… Who’s doing the raping?” Donald Trump said, when asked to defend his characterization.

It was an unfortunate turn of phrase for Trump—in more ways than one. Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used “rape” to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt “violated” by the experience.

Michael Cohen, special counsel at The Trump Organization, defended his boss, saying, “You’re talking about the frontrunner for the GOP, presidential candidate, as well as a private individual who never raped anybody. And, of course, understand that by the very definition, you can’t rape your spouse.”

“It is true,” Cohen added. “You cannot rape your spouse. And there’s very clear case law.”

Ivana Trump’s assertion of “rape” came in a deposition—part of the early ’90s divorce case between the Trumps, and revealed in the 1993 book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump.

The book, by former Texas Monthly and Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III, described a harrowing scene. After a painful scalp reduction surgery to remove a bald spot, Donald Trump confronted his then-wife, who had previously used the same plastic surgeon.

“Your fucking doctor has ruined me!” Trump cried.

What followed was a “violent assault,” according to Lost Tycoon. Donald held back Ivana’s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.

“Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified… It is a violent assault,” Hurt writes. “According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, ‘he raped me.’”

Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there “crying for the rest of night.” When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.

“As she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: ‘Does it hurt?’” Hurt writes.

Donald Trump has previously denied the allegation. In the book, he denies having had the scalp reduction surgery.

“It’s obviously false,” Donald Trump said of the accusation in 1993, according to Newsday. “It’s incorrect and done by a guy without much talent… He is a guy that is an unattractive guy who is a vindictive and jealous person.”

Cohen acknowledged Monday that he has not read the entire deposition but said he had read the two relevant pages of it, including the rape accusation.



“It’s not the word that you’re trying to make it into,” Cohen told The Daily Beast, saying Ivana Trump was talking about how “she felt raped emotionally… She was not referring to it [as] a criminal matter, and not in its literal sense, though there’s many literal senses to the word.”



Cohen added that there is no such thing, legally, as a man raping his wife. “You cannot rape your spouse,” he said. “There’s very clear case law.”

That is not true. In New York, there used to be a so-called marital rape exemption to the law. It was struck down in 1984.

Trump’s lawyer then changed tactics, lobbing insults and threatening a lawsuit if a story was published.



“I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we’re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don’t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know,” Cohen said. “So I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?”

“You write a story that has Mr. Trump’s name in it, with the word ‘rape,’ and I’m going to mess your life up… for as long as you’re on this frickin’ planet… you’re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you’ll never know how to get out from underneath it,” he added.

When Lost Tycoon was about to be printed, Donald Trump and his lawyers provided a statement from Ivana, which was posted on the first page of the book. In it, Ivana confirms that she had “felt violated” and that she had stated that her husband had raped her during a divorce deposition. But Ivana sought to soften her earlier statement.

“During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” the Ivana Trump statement said. “[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.”

The statement, according to a “Notice to the Reader” in the book, “does not contradict or invalidate any information contained in this book.”

Nevertheless, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, said that “there is nothing reasonable about you wanting to write a story about somebody’s usage of the word ‘rape,’ when she’s talking [about how] she didn’t feel emotionally satisfied.”

“Though there’s many literal senses to the word, if you distort it, and you put Mr. Trump’s name there onto it, rest assured, you will suffer the consequences. So you do whatever you want. You want to ruin your life at the age of 20? You do that, and I’ll be happy to serve it right up to you,” he added.

“I think you should go ahead and you should write the story that you plan on writing. I think you should do it. Because I think you’re an idiot. And I think your paper’s a joke, and it’s going to be my absolute pleasure to serve you with a $500 million lawsuit, like I told [you] I did it to Univision,” Cohen continued.



The 1990 divorce case between the two Trumps was granted on the grounds of Donald’s “cruel and inhuman treatment” of Ivana. The settlement, under which the Trumps agreed on the division of assets, was finalized in 1991. Her divorce involved a gag order that keeps her from talking about her marriage to Donald Trump without his permission.

Divorce records in New York state are not open to public inspection. But some of the legal documents surrounding the contract dispute over the Trumps’ prenuptial agreement are still available and were reviewed by The Daily Beast.

In one such document, Ivana Trump’s lawyers claim that in the three years preceding their divorce Donald Trump, “has increasingly verbally abused and demeaned [her] so as to obtain her submission to his wishes and desires” as well as “humiliated and verbally assaulted” her. The New York County Clerk’s records office couldn’t locate at least one box of documents relating to the contract dispute. (It’s not uncommon for court files to go missing.)

Ivana Trump did not respond to a request for comment.

Donald Trump has a history of grandstanding on rape. His controversial campaign-trail comments this year about Mexicans were hardly the first time he has waded into the hot-button issue of sexual assault.

Two years ago, Trump weighed in on the alarming rate of sexual assault and rape in the military—and in doing so, pinned the blame on the presence of women.

“26,000 unreported sexual [assaults] in the military—only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?” he tweeted in 2013. “The Generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically [correct]!” he continued.

In 1989, the real estate mogul placed a full-page ad in four New York City newspapers calling for the execution of the five alleged rapists of Trisha Meili, the Central Park jogger who was put in a coma by her assailants. The defendants received different sentences and served between six and 13 years behind bars before new evidence of coerced confessions emerged that led to their convictions being vacated in 2002.

“Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!” Trump’s 1989 ad blared. “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!”

Trump’s other public statements on rape cases range from tone-deaf to offensive. In 1992, he floated the idea that convicted rapist and boxer Mike Tyson should be allowed to pay “millions and millions” of dollars to rape victims instead of serving jail time. Trump’s modest proposal did not go over well.

“How offensive,” shot back Dollyne Pettingill, spokeswoman for the mayor of Indianapolis, where Tyson committed the assault. “We have a judicial process for these matters and it’s not for sale.”

Whether Trump’s comments about rape—or the accusation of assault from his ex-wife—will hurt his burgeoning political career is an open question. So far, Trump has been able to shake off the sorts of scandals that would destroy any other campaign for president. Dissing Mexican immigrants and prisoners of war has not cost him his campaign, nor has his history of giving to Democratic campaigns. In the latest CNN poll, Trump leads all other candidates in the Republican presidential field, with 18 percent support.

Update 7/28/15 9:50 AM: Ivana Trump released a statement Tuesday morning to CNN.

“I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president.”Donald Trump in his office, Midtown Manhattan, Nov. 17. (Photo: Gordon Donovan/Yahoo News)

Donald Trump is already planning his palace on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Whether or not his campaign is successful, the Republican billionaire will have a presence on the street where America’s president lives. Trump is currently building a Washington, D.C., hotel about a half mile from the White House. When Yahoo News visited his New York City office on Tuesday afternoon, he was discussing the property with one of his closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka.

Trump’s D.C. hotel isn’t scheduled to open until next year in the historic Old Post Office Pavilion. Yet, in his characteristic way, Trump has already made his presence felt in the nation’s capital. Outside the construction site, there’s a massive billboard that reads “COMING 2016: TRUMP.” With the candidate in the midst of shaking up the Republican presidential primary race, this advertisement and its potential double meaning has attracted quite a bit of attention.

“It’s kind of phenomenal, right?” Ivanka said of the sign. “We were joking it’s probably the only project on Pennsylvania that’s ever been ahead of schedule and under budget. … We’ll keep it that way. A few months to go.”

But on Tuesday afternoon, the pair were discussing one feature of the project.

“I don’t think the lighting is going to go through solid marble” Trump observed, as Ivanka elegantly leaned over his desk and pointed at a series of photos depicting various possibilities.

“It’s a light panel system,” Ivanka explained. “It goes through solid marble and actually decently well, but it makes everything else black.”

Trump gave his approval.

“Honey, just do it. It’s the right way,” Trump said to his daughter. “You always backlight.”

Indeed, backlit marble is emblematic of the brand Trump has built for himself as a real estate developer and reality television star. Bold. Brash. Luxe.

Trump has brought his trademark swagger to his presidential campaign. He shocked the political establishment and liberals around the country by becoming a frontrunner after barging into the Republican primary in June with over-the-top insults for his opponents and controversial policy pronouncements for the public at large.

This no-holds-barred approach was on full display in a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo News on Tuesday. During the discussion, Trump weighed in on the presidential race, calling Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., “a communist” and hinting at his plans to go after Hillary Clinton, should he win the nomination. He also discussed the “unthinkable” security measures he believes will be necessary to monitor America’s Muslims in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, the “safe space” and racism controversies on college campuses, and his favorite parts of Latino culture. The conversation concluded with Trump playing a word association game where he shared his opinions on Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian and Charlie Sheen, among others.

Though he stayed true to his ostentatious brand, Trump initially tried to strike a humble note when he assessed his chance of victory.

“I always want to think of myself as an underdog. I never want to think of myself as even leading,” Trump said, before breaking his momentarily modest stride a breath later. “I am leading. I’m leading substantially.”

Trump pointed to a pair of new polls that were released Tuesday. Morning Consult showed him with a 19-point lead in the GOP primary nationwide. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that, in the wake of last week’s Paris attacks, voters were split between Trump and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton as the candidates best prepared to deal with terrorism (though Clinton had the edge). These numbers come after a brief spell in which Trump saw his average standing in Republican primary polls dip, as former neurosurgeon Ben Carson rose in the ranks.

Early states’ polls also continue to show good news for Trump. The most recent polls in the first two primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire, all show Trump ahead. But while he has shouted these numbers from the rooftops, he also says he tried not to focus on them.

He uncharacteristically stumbled a bit while trying to explain the contradiction between how he promotes himself and the mentality he is trying to maintain to secure a victory.

“I’m leading everywhere. I still — I don’t — I don’t even think about it,” Trump said. “I just put my head down and get to — you know, I know how to win and I like to win.”

Trump finally settled on an explanation he found satisfactory.

“Well, look, right now I’m the favorite, let’s face it,” Trump said. “I mean, you know, I can be as politically correct as possible, but every poll says I’m winning by a lot. So, I’m the favorite, but I don’t like to think of myself as the favorite. I guess that’s a better way of saying it.”

Trump suggested some of his rivals who are not performing as well have the wrong mindset.

“A lot of people don’t like to win. They actually don’t know how to win and they don’t like to win because down deep inside they don’t want to win,” Trump said. “It’s a deep, deep secret, but they don’t want to win and they don’t think they should be there. And we have some people that are very good and we have some people that shouldn’t be wasting a lot of time, including their own time.”

Trump’s audacious style and his improbable rise leave him with little patience for his weakest opponents.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal dropped out of the race a few hours after Yahoo talked with Trump, leaving 14 people still vying for the Republican nomination. Trump would like to see the GOP take action to thin the herd even more.

In particular, Trump singled out former New York Gov. George Pataki as someone who no longer belongs in the primary.

“You know, honestly, I think the party should take guys like Pataki … guys like Pataki who couldn’t get elected, you know, to anything right now — he’s got zero in the polls — and some others, they should not be allowed to go forward,” declared Trump, adding, “They haven’t even filed in certain states.”

Asked about Trump’s comments, Pataki spokesman Dave Catalfamo accused Trump of having “an unnatural obsession with Pataki.”

“I don’t understand his unhealthy obsession with Pataki, but he should focus on his own circus, carnival, campaign or whatever he calls it,” Catalfamo said.

But for Trump, jabs at Pataki aren’t gratuitous political violence. Elbowing the lesser candidates out of the way could mean their undercard debates will stop taking time on the national stage away from Trump.

“It’s really, I think, very unfair to the rest of the candidates because we all want more airtime,” said Trump. “I mean, I’ve been really happy with the debates. I’ve obviously done well in the debates because, since the last debate, I’ve gone even higher. And I’ve enjoyed the whole debate process, but frankly, I think, you know, more time should be given.”

Brutal attacks on his Republican rivals have been a hallmark of Trump’s candidacy. Last Thursday, Trump called Carson ‘“pathological” and compared him to a “child molester.” Trump has mocked businesswoman Carly Fiorina’s physical appearance and called Ohio Gov. John Kasich “desperate.”

Trump has also relentlessly bashed Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, calling him “low energy,” and needling him for the way his brother, former President George W. Bush, led the nation to war in Iraq. This assault preceded a drop in the polls for Bush, who was once seen as the inevitable and invincible Republican frontrunner. Trump also has taken credit for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker making surprisingly early exits.

Trump says he’s not taking his eyes off the Republican primary yet, but he expects Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination — and he’s bullish about his ability to take her out, too, when the time comes.

“I haven’t put my sights on Hillary yet. We have 15 people in the race. We had 17. We have 15 people in the race and my sole focus is the 15 people right now,” Trump said. “When I put my sights on Hillary like I did various other people who are now gone, I think that Hillary will fail and I think she’ll fail badly. She’ll fail on her record. I don’t think she has the strength. I don’t think she has the stamina to be president. I don’t think she has the strength or the stamina to be president.”

As for Clinton’s main Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Trump dismissed him as “over.”

Trump claimed Sanders “lost” when he failed to attack Clinton during the Democratic debate last month for the controversy over her use, as secretary of state, of a private email account. At that forum, Sanders had one of the most widely talked about moments of the evening when he said people want to discuss other issues and are “sick and tired of hearing about” Clinton’s “damn emails.”

“He had a great opportunity to do some serious damage, and in order to be politically correct, and in order to be nice, and in order to get a good sound bite that lasted about 10 seconds with the applause — it wasn’t even a very big applause — he gave up the whole email scandal,” Trump said of Sanders. “He just lost the election right there. He just lost his election. No. He’s gone. He’s gone now.”

Trump also had harsh words for comments Sanders made in the most recent Democratic debate, which focused on the terror attacks that killed 129 people in Paris on Nov. 13. On a stage in Des Moines Saturday, Sanders declared “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.” Trump described Sanders’ remarks as “off the wall,” though the Defense Department in 2014 issued a report predicting climate change would act as a “threat multiplier” that would exacerbate the risk of terrorism. In fact, Trump said, Sanders, who describes himself as a “democratic socialist,” isn’t really a Democrat at all.



“I think he’s a communist. I think he’s actually a communist with a socialistic bent,” said Trump, adding: “Anybody that would say that the Paris attacks were caused by global warming, there’s something missing. Even the most ardent global-warming believers aren’t buying that one.”

Trump’s presidential bid has been built on three things: verbal missiles aimed at his opponents, bold promises and controversial policies, including calling for a massive wall along the Mexican border.

Physically, Trump’s campaign is housed in a series of sparse, partially-constructed rooms with exposed ceilings in his Manhattan headquarters, Trump Tower. In typical Trump fashion, the walls of these offices are covered in massive pictures of his face and cocky slogans rendered in all capital letters: “THINK BIG AND KICK ASS,” “TRUMP POR PRESIDENTE,” and, of course, the campaign’s main motto, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”

Trump’s eponymous skyscraper is the epitome of his signature style. It’s on a marquee block on New York’s Fifth Avenue, and features pink marble, dramatic lighting, cascading waterfalls, gilded escalators, and, most importantly, massive golden letters on the outside bearing the Trump name. His corner office is on the 26th floor with a view of Central Park, walls festooned with his awards and framed magazine covers bearing his likeness. Trump holds court surrounded by trophies and gifts in a red leather chair that sits behind a massive desk piled high with paperwork.

Trump’s take on the Paris attacks fits with the rest of his doctrine. He’s promised to “bomb the shit out of” the jihadist group ISIS, which is based in Syria and has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Trump has also vowed to take an aggressive approach with Muslims here in the United States and suggested there should be a national effort to monitor mosques. He has spoken wistfully of the New York City Police Department’s mosque surveillance program, which was abandoned last year after generating substantial controversy.

Trump told Yahoo the architect of that program, former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, is someone he might think about for a position in a Trump presidential administration.

“Ray’s a great guy,” Trump said. “Ray did a fab job as commissioner and, sure, Ray would be somebody I’d certainly consider.”

After Paris, Trump said “security is going to rule” in the United States, in order to take on what he calls “radical Islamic terrorism.” America has currently agreed to take in 10,000 refugees from the ISIS stronghold in Syria. However, if he is elected, Trump said he would deport any Syrian refugees allowed to enter this country under President Obama.

“They’re going to be gone. They will go back. … I’ve said it before, in fact, and everyone hears what I say, including them, believe it or not,” Trump said of the refugees. “But if they’re here, they have to go back, because we cannot take a chance. You look at the migration, it’s young, strong men. We cannot take a chance that the people coming over here are going to be ISIS-affiliated.”

Yahoo News has reported that about half of the approximately 2,000 refugees from Syria who have come to the U.S. so far have been children. Another quarter are more than 60 years old. The Obama administration has maintained that the extensive screening process for these refugees makes the program safe to maintain — not to mention a reflection of America’s core values.

But Trump doesn’t buy it. He also has concerns about the larger Muslim community here in the U.S., he said.

Yahoo News asked Trump whether his push for increased surveillance of American Muslims could include warrantless searches. He suggested he would consider a series of drastic measures.

“We’re going to have to do things that we never did before. And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule,” Trump said. “And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we’re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.”

Yahoo News asked Trump whether this level of tracking might require registering Muslims in a database or giving them a form of special identification that noted their religion. He wouldn’t rule it out.

“We’re going to have to — we’re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely,” Trump said when presented with the idea. “We’re going to have to look at the mosques. We’re going to have to look very, very carefully.”

Trump has never shied away from saying what he described in this instance as the “frankly unthinkable.” His campaign launch included a moment where he described immigrants from Mexico as “not the right people.” Trump would later warn that immigrants from south of the border included rapists and other criminals. These remarks sparked a national firestorm. At multiple points in his conversation with Yahoo News, Trump expressed exasperation with political correctness.

While critics have accused Trump of being racist, he predicts he will win both the Latino and the black vote.

Trump was a star athlete in high school and he played soccer. When asked whether he could recall relationships he had with Latinos and other minorities from his youth, Trump claimed he had “great relationships” with the “Hispanics” at his high school, the New York Military Academy, through the soccer team.

“I had great relationship with the Hispanic — we had a lot of Hispanics in the school actually from different countries, Venezuela, from Brazil, and they all played soccer, and I was on the soccer team and I developed great relationships with them,” Trump said. “Terrific people, terrific spirit, great spirit and some went on to success and some are no longer with us. I mean, they were literally killed in some of the, you know, tough areas.”

Trump also touted his poll numbers among Latino and African-American Republicans.

“I had great relationships with the Hispanics, always have had and I do today,” Trump said. “Don’t forget, I’m leading in Nevada with Hispanics. I’m leading in a lot of places with the Hispanics. People don’t realize that I’m also leading with the African-Americans big, and I think you’ll see some interesting stuff come out.”

Polls do show Trump leading among Republican primary voters in Nevada, which has a large Latino population. But multiple other polls show that Trump would lose the black vote in a general election matchup.

So, what is Trump’s favorite aspect of Latino culture? When asked, he praised the Latino “spirit” — and used the opportunity to take another shot at Jeb Bush.



“Well, I like — I love the culture. I think the people have tremendous spirit. There’s a great energy that they have, the opposite of Jeb. There’s a great energy that they have, a tremendous, it’s a tremendous strength and energy,” Trump said. “You know, I have thousands of employees over the years, tens of thousands of employees, many have been Hispanic and they really are terrific to work with. And, frankly, I always look at it that I work with my employees as opposed to them working for me.”

Trump believes his lack of political correctness is a large part of what has helped him appeal to voters. He pointed this out when discussing the growing activism on college campuses where many students are calling for “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings” to protect them from offensive commentary and disturbing educational content. Trump has no patience for this trend.

“It’s gotten out of control. It’s all gotten out of control. … First of all, you’re really tampering with freedom of speech when you do that. At the same time, it’s trying to be politically correct and that is so bad,” Trump said. “I think it’s one of the reasons I’m leading by so much in the polls, because we don’t have time to be so politically correct in this country and we have much bigger problems, as you can see.”

One of the main battlegrounds for the new college activism is the University of Missouri, where the school’s president and chancellor announced they would resign earlier this month. Their exits came after widespread protests of an alleged climate of racism at the school.

For his part, Trump thinks the school’s leaders made the wrong choice and that their departures will only encourage future student uprisings.

“Well, I thought that the people that resigned from University of Missouri were weak and ineffective people. I think they sent the absolutely wrong signal when they resigned so sheepishly. … It just showed such grotesque weakness and that just sent a signal to go out and do whatever you want to do, and now you’re going to see this problem all over,” Trump said.

Trump doesn’t believe there was racism on campus in Missouri. Still, if he led the school, he said he would stand up to both the demands of the protesters and any discriminatory behavior.

“I would have handled things differently. First of all, I would have made sure there was no discrimination or any of that — and I don’t think there was. But I happened to look at the list of demands, those demands were crazy,” Trump said. “Many of those demands were absolutely — not all — but many of those were absolutely over the top. And to watch these two men grovel and resign like two babies — whoever paid them in the first place?”

This is the Trump brand. Everything is big, loud, lit from the back. He’s has a showman’s lack of fear about weighing in on any issue with his unabashedly un-P.C. opinions. That’s part of the reason Yahoo News decided to close out our conversation with a little word association game where Trump shared the first thing or two that came to mind when we brought up a series of topics.

Ben Carson?

“Nice man,” said Trump.

Bill Clinton?

“Monica Lewinsky,” Trump said with a satisfied smile.

Trump’s word for ISIS?

“Evil.”

Trump had to think for a moment when asked about one of his primary rivals that he actually has a good relationship with, Sen. Ted Cruz.

“Supportive — very strong supporter of what I say,” Trump declared. “I’d say very supportive.”

He doesn’t have such kind words for Sen. Marco Rubio.

“A lightweight,” said Trump of Rubio.

And what about the world outside of politics? Trump still has plenty of opinions and is willing to share them all.

Taylor Swift?

“Terrific,” said Trump.

Charlie Sheen?

“Sad,” Trump said.

Jay Z?

“Good guy,” said Trump.

The only person in our conversation about whom Trump seemed to hold back was Kim Kardashian. When asked about her, he didn’t fire off a quick one- or two-word description.

“Well, look, she was so nice to me. I mean every time I see her she’s just — I’m just going to say she was always nice to me,” Trump said.

And what about himself? What is the one word he’d use to sum up the Trump brand?

“Make America great again,” Trump said, turning to his campaign slogan.

Before we left, Trump also offered three words for Yahoo News and the rest of the media.

“Treat me good,” he said.“I like you. You and me, we’re going to be best friends.”

It is early January, and Eric Schneiderman is sitting in his 25th-floor office above Lower Manhattan, doing his best Donald Trump impression, puckering his lips into a duck face, scrunching up his nose and lowering his voice into something that resembles the president’s outer-borough growl.

Story Continued Below

Schneiderman is recalling his meeting with Trump in 2010. Back then, Schneiderman was running for attorney general of New York, and Trump was still in his pre-birther, reality TV host phase. Trump had donated money to one of Schneiderman’s opponents in the Democratic primary. Schneiderman managed to pull off a come-from-behind victory, and after the race, he went to Trump Tower to ask for a donation for the general election. Trump coughed up $12,500 to the Democrat, and Schneiderman went on to beat his Republican opponent and win.

But Trump and Schneiderman did not become best friends. That meeting was the beginning of a long and increasingly bitter saga between the two. Schneiderman took up the state’s existing case against Trump University—New York wanted the school to drop the “university” from its name, since it was not chartered as an institution of higher learning and lacked a license to offer instruction—and as he pursued it over the next five years, he became the target of a relentless series of personal attacks from the Trump camp. Trump filed an ethics complaint alleging that Schneiderman offered to drop the suit in exchange for donations; he went on television to denounce Schneiderman as a hack and a lightweight, and said he was wasting millions of taxpayer dollars when he should have been going after Wall Street. (Never mind that Schneiderman had already been declared “the man the banks fear most” by the liberal magazine The American Prospect.) “The whole scorched-earth strategy towards those who would challenge him, we got a preview of,” says Schneiderman.

Schneiderman is a slender, slightly built former corporate lawyer, the only son of a New York philanthropist whose last names adorns several city cultural institutions. One never senses from him the kind of comfort and ease that people from his position tend to radiate, but rather a twitchy impatience, as if the vein on his forehead is going to pop while he busts some of the high-priced glassware in the political china shop. In the six years after he won that race, Schneiderman has emerged as perhaps the lefty media’s favorite lawyer, tangling with mortgage bankers, ExxonMobil, and national retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, J Crew and The Gap. And on November 9, he was handed what might become his largest target when Donald Trump, his longtime nemesis, was elected president.

The Trump University suit eventually was settled for $25 million days after the election, despite the then president-elect’s repeated pledges never to settle. Schneiderman could have left it at that. But Schneiderman has let it be known that Trump is still in his crosshairs. In the days since November 9, Schneiderman fired off a letter warning Trump not to drop White House support of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, introduced a bill in the state Legislature to give New Yorkers cost-free contraception if the Affordable Care Act is dismantled, threatened to sue after Trump froze EPA funding of clean air and water programs, and joined a lawsuit that argues that Trump’s executive order on immigration is not just unconstitutional and un-American, but it brings profound harm to the residents of New York State.

He has a record of going not only after Trump, but going after people now in Trumpworld. He’s on the opposite side of the Clean Power Plan fight from Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, since named head of the EPA, and who Schneiderman labeled a “dangerous and unqualified choice.” He’s gone after Rex Tillerson, who as CEO of ExxonMobil defended his company from a Schneiderman investigation; since the election he’s begun investigating a reverse-mortgage business once led by Steven Mnuchin, the nominee to be the next Treasury secretary.

Schneiderman doesn’t think that the fact he has already appeared in court against Trump necessarily prepares him for what is about to come, but he has little doubt that something will come. Congress remains in Republican hands, and for the foreseeable future looks unwilling to provide much in the way of a check or a balance on the presidency. Governors and mayors can scream and protest, but beyond “setting an example” for other policymakers, the effect of their actions will be limited to their constituents.

Schneiderman, though, effectively leads a law firm of more than 650 lawyers, one with a two-decade tradition of taking its fights national. Now he faces an administration in Washington that is not just “pro-fraud,” as former Maine Attorney General James Tierney put it, but one helmed by someone very used to using the courts to get his way. “He’s not playing hide the ball,” Schneiderman said when asked about what he learned about the new president from his earlier tangle with him. “He’s not that different offstage from how he is on stage. This is him. He is a complicated guy in some respects, but he is used to making his own rules and he plays a very aggressive game. When he wants to get something done he will use every tool at his disposal.”

If Governor Eliot Spitzer became known as the “sheriff of Wall Street,” and Gov. Andrew Cuomo vowed to clean up Albany and become the “sheriff of State Street,” Schneiderman could very much become the next sheriff of Pennsylvania Avenue.

Schneiderman had seen dirty pool in his years as the state’s chief law enforcement officer, but his fight with the Trump Organization was, he says, “on the outer edge of normal.”

Two years into Schneiderman’s investigation of Trump University, Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against the company with charges of fraud; Trump himself retaliated by filing a complaint against the AG with the New York State board of ethics. He alleged that Schneiderman and his aides several times approached Trump, his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner for a contribution and for “the aid of their influence and celebrity status to secure other favors and preferential treatment in furtherance of Mr. Schneiderman’s political aspirations.” Schneiderman also promised several times to make sure that the messy investigation into Trump University went away, according to the complaint.

In an interview, Schneiderman says that nothing of the sort happened, and, in fact that after assuming office, he was expressly outlawed from soliciting Trump, since the developer was involved in all sorts of litigation with the state. Trump’s complaint was dismissed, but it was just one piece of a larger counteroffensive. “We got a preview of what everyone else got a few years later,” Schneiderman says.

Some of the assault came via Twitter: “Lightweight NYS Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is trying to extort me with a civil lawsuit,” Trump tweeted in August 2013. When Schneiderman toured Syracuse University that month with President Barack Obama to promote low-interest college loans, Trump went on Good Morning America and The Today Show to accuse Obama of paying Schneiderman off to take the suit. That fall, a new website appeared, 98percentapproval.com, that said on its homepage that it was “created to bring to the public’s attention the gross incompetence of New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman.” The domain was registered by Trump’s attorneys.

A screen-grab of the anti-Schneiderman website 98percentapproval.com.

Perhaps most remarkably, in February of 2014, Schneiderman was the target of a lengthy, ferocious cover story in the New York Observer – the newspaper owned by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner—published in the midst of the dispute. The headline read, “The Power and Politics of AG Schneiderman: Will Righteous Eric bag big prey? Or will Reckless Eric come undone?” and it portrayed the attorney general as the Malcolm McDowell character from A Clockwork Orange—an unredeemed sadist in too much eye makeup. (The eye makeup was a specific dig at his appearance: The attorney general takes a glaucoma medication that makes his lashes appear thicker and darker than normal.) The article itself was a thinly sourced anti-Schneiderman op-ed, 7,200 words long, that spent almost half of its pages defending Trump. The story became a bit of tantalizing New York media gossip when it was revealed that the famously under-resourced society paper spent eight months on the story, and its editor, a Kushner family loyalist, had found the manager of an ice cream shop in suburban New Jersey without a single previous byline to report and write it. (The ice cream shop manager, it should be noted, eventually begged off when the story seemed too much like a hit piece, and The Observer found someone more credentialed to do it.)

By November 2016, it seemed as though Schneiderman would have Trump all to himself. Polls showed the reality TV star losing the presidential race, and he looked set to return to New York, where liberals were prodding Schneiderman to make his return to private life miserable. There was the ongoing litigation involving Trump University, which Trump pledged to never settle, and a new investigation of the Trump Foundation.

Then came November 8. Schneiderman had spent the evening at various VIP suites at the Hillary Clinton election night party, when it started becoming clear that his tormentor was not only not returning as a constituent, but was about to become the leader of the free world. A Democratic official turned to one of Schneiderman’s aides and said: “I guess it’s going to be up to you guys now.”

The next morning, as the office’s lawyers stumbled into work in a fog of exhaustion and worry, Schneiderman called a meeting. In the room were his senior staff and some of the bureau chiefs. There were tears. There were lawyers who couldn’t believe that Donald Trump—Donald Trump!—was about to become the next president of the United States. Schneiderman urged calm. Don’t just rush out and do. Take a deep breath, he told them. Let the moment wash over you. We can’t do everything at once, so prioritize. We are going to have to do more—not with less, necessarily, but with no greater resources.

The New York Observer's Clockwork Orange-themed presentation of the anti-Schneiderman piece.

Schneiderman ordered a top-to-bottom review of all his office’s outstanding business with the U.S. Department of Justice, both for and against, expecting that in the former cases that the federal government would be likely to switch sides, which would mean a loss of resources and knowledge-sharing. Another mission was to prepare rearguard actions to protect New Yorkers against whatever onslaught might come from Washington, including laying out new sanctuary city guidelines, and possible responses if the administration defunded Planned Parenthood or the EPA. They also began to lay the groundwork to fill in as regulators in areas where the federal government might stop enforcing laws already on the books, from labor laws, to securities regulation, to clean water and clear air enforcement. And he began to free up staff for what the attorney general’s office refers to internally as “Bet The House Litigation”—the kind of thing that would require a massive redeployment of the office’s resources, such as fighting a Muslim registry, or blocking an executive order to reinstitute some kind of stop-and-frisk program.

It was becoming clearer to liberal America in the days after the election that any real resistance to Trump would have to come from the states, especially those that went big for Clinton. At David Brock’s post-election donor retreat in Florida, former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm introduced Schneiderman as “the dean of progressive AGs.” He made the rounds on CNN and MSNBC and was singled out for praise from Mark Ruffalo and The Nation’s Katrina Vanden Heuvel. And he traveled around the state, appearing at town halls with grass-roots activists where he urged them not to despair. They were in the early stages of a new movement for civil rights, he said, and would prevail in the end.

It’s not just a question of blocking Trump’s policies: Schneiderman is one of the names that arises when it comes to the great liberal dream: finding something in Trump’s web of conflicts that prohibits him from serving out the remainder of his term. That Trump was a resident of New York and until recently ran his businesses there—and still owns those businesses—would appear to give Schneiderman a big target. Plus, in September, in the heat of the election, Schneiderman announced that he was beginning an investigation into the Trump Foundation for, among other things, using foundation money to make a donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi soon after she announced that her office would not investigate Trump University. After the election, Trump attempted to dissolve the charity as part of his transition, and Schneiderman ordered him not to. The investigation is continuing.

Earlier this week, Schneiderman appeared on a call-in radio show on a New York City public radio station when a caller asked whether any of Schneiderman’s investigations could lead to Trump’s eventual impeachment. The attorney general demurred, saying he doubted that anything related to Trump’s foundation or his university would rise to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

“There are a lot of reports of egregious acts he’s taken in the course of his business: his sexual assaults and other things—that’s all fair game,” he added. “We’re not—you know, we’re not out to get Mr. Trump. We’re just out to enforce the law. And if he’s broken New York law, we will enforce the law.”

When I visited Schneiderman’s office last month, I asked him a version of that same question—whether Trump’s tangled business interests, many of which were housed within a few miles of where we were sitting, meant that the attorney general of New York had a particular role to play in investigating the president. On his desk, between a tiny Buddha figurine, a bumper sticker reading “ASSUME NOTHING” and a handful of other files, was a report from the Brookings Institution on the Emoluments Clause, a once obscure constitutional provision that prohibits federal officeholders from accepting gifts from foreign states.

“I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but we are so far off the map in terms of any litigation that has taken place,” Schneiderman said, waving around a copy of the report. “We are not dealing with case law here. What are the examples you got of violations of this? Oh, American emissaries to the Court of Louis XVI were tortured and he bestowed on Benjamin Franklin a snuff box bearing the royal portrait of—I mean, this is the precedent?” I don’t want to overstate what I can do.”

***

Nationally, Schneiderman is taking advantage of something of an empowerment wave among state AGs. Over the past few years, the network of Democratic attorneys general has become more cohesive and more professionalized. In 2014, a number of other Democratic AGs decided that they wanted the group to become on par politically with the Democratic Governors Association, or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. They hired Sean Rankin, a DC-based political consultant, as executive director and hired a staff of a dozen.

Though Schneiderman has served only since 2011, he is now one of the more senior Democratic attorneys general in the country—the Obama years weren’t kind to statewide Democratic officeholders—and he has been organizing his more left-leaning counterparts into something like a cohesive force, recently meeting with Josh Shapiro, the newly minted attorney general of Pennsylvania, Xavier Becerra of California and Maura Healey of Massachusetts to plot strategy. Because the office is so large, and because New Yorkers have come to expect an activist attorney general, New York is often the lead state when the group drafts a letter to Congress or files an amicus brief, a strategy that allows him to shape the direction the group goes in.

People who knew Schneiderman from his days in the New York State Senate, where he represented the ultra-liberal Upper West Side, wouldn’t exactly have picked him as a unifying force. In fact, he was almost immediately so disliked by his colleagues that Republicans and Democrats alike redrew him into a 55 percent Latino district that stretched through West Harlem and Washington Heights. He learned Spanish, won reelection anyway and served for 10 more years in the Legislature. But the reputation of not playing well with others has been one he hasn’t quite been able to shake. It was solidified when he refused to join the Obama administration’s 2011 mortgage settlement, one that 49 other AGs had already signed off on, instead holding out for more money and a less forgiving deal. In the end, the settlement broke his way—his intransigence helped win another $6 billion and a tougher agreement—and Obama named Schneiderman to co-lead a commission investigating the banks.

When speaking with other attorneys general around the country, it is possible to pick up on a slight air of resentment that Schneiderman’s proximity to New York City television studios grant him a larger audience than he would otherwise receive. But in the Trump era, with a White House run by an aggressive, take-no-prisoners rule-breaker, his style suddenly looks like an asset. “It’s a New Yorker thing—the brashness, the sharp elbows,” said an aide to another attorney general. “It’s hard not to notice the atmospherics when he takes on Trump.”

Through the new national AG network, the New York attorney general’s office was able to jump out quickly last week with a statement co-signed by 15 other state AGs when Trump’s Muslim ban went into effect at the airports. Schneiderman’s office had been preparing for just such a moment—it was why Schneiderman offered guidance to “sanctuary cities” after the election on how to handle any moves by the new administration—and worked through the weekend with AGs around the country on how to react. In the letter, which called the measure unconstitutional and un-American, Schneiderman demanded that the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Enforcement release the names of anyone being held. He then went on CBS This Morning to accuse the administration of unleashing chaos and not being forthcoming about the number of people detained at airports around the nation. The actual lawsuit, however, was filed by the attorney general of Washington, hoping to get a better hearing in the 9th Circuit on the West Coast. (Similarly, the Connecticut attorney general struck first after the inauguration, taking the lead on a lawsuit defending the constitutionality of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, a strategy on the part of Democratic AGs to share manpower and resources.)

At a post-election town hall, Schneiderman said his immediate role after the election was in talking people off the ledge. If there is a sanguinity to him these days, it is because Schneiderman sees this as a moment when Democrats can at last learn the lessons that Republicans have internalized over the past 70 years: that the real power in the Constitution lies in the states. The long-term political project he envisions is building a progressive grass-roots answer to what the right has been building for decades—not in the halls of Washington, but in “sexy towns like Tallahassee and Columbus and Madison and Albany.” That last one is instructive. New York’s state Senate remains in Republican hands, largely because a rogue group of centrist Democrats caucus with them, a group propped up by Cuomo, a longtime foil of the attorney general and of liberals throughout New York.

“We have to be a lot tougher. We have to be as demanding of our elected officials as conservatives are of theirs,” Schneiderman told an audience in the weeks after the election. “Nice words are not enough anymore. You have to deliver rewards. If you can’t deliver rewards on climate, on human rights, on protecting immigrants, on unwinding our failed experiment in mass incarceration, well, we love you and we will help you find another job, but right now, we have to find someone else that can do the job.”

Schneiderman has consistently denied that he is running for governor, a denial that seems to have helped smooth over the relationship between him and Cuomo and given Schneiderman more room to operate. When he talks of tossing the party-changers out of the temple, though, he certainly sounds like someone with political ambition.

The New York AGs office is known as a springboard for the ambitious, and in New York political circles the knock on Schneiderman has been that he’s slightly underplayed his hand there, retreating after the mortgage case in 2011 and 2012 and keeping quiet even if notching up victories. “He’s been perfectly fine if not spectacular,” said one local political operative close to him. “We are used to seeing Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo in that office, and he just hasn’t risen to that level yet.” In part, this is because Cuomo made it clear early on that he didn’t want anyone to upstage him in Albany, creating a new office dedicated to regulating financial services and installing a close ally to help run it. The two battled for the early part of Schneiderman’s tenure, but the feud has cooled in recent years as Cuomo has turned his attention to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Schneiderman has also had to work alongside a crusading U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, a charismatic presence who has used his office to target exactly the kind financial and political bad actors that both Spitzer and Cuomo made life difficult for. And in part, this is because of circumstances—both Spitzer and Cuomo spent the bulk of their time battling a Justice Department helmed by George Bush appointees. “I think he is probably as good a lawyer as they have had in that office in a long time,” said Tierney, “But you just don’t get the kind of splashy cases with an Obama presidency. Democratic AG’s are going to largely agree with his agencies and his Department of Justice.

***

All of that changes now. What Schneiderman can do—one state AG, or even a number of state AGs—against the leader of the right-populist wave in the White House remains to be seen. On the policy level, lawyers in his office are confident that so much of what Trump has proposed so far is so poorly written, and even more poorly thought out, that it opens itself up to all kinds of lawsuits.

“We don’t know what the legal consequences are yet of a lot of these executive orders,” said Healy, the attorney general of Massachusetts and a close Schneiderman ally. “But we do know that you are going to see a federal administration that is going to be rolling back consumer protections, labor protections, environmental protections, and looking to dismantle rights that have been put in place. The way you address that is you uphold the law through the courts, and that is the job of state AGs right now.”

Among Schneiderman’s New York troops, there is the unmistakable sense of suddenly fighting on new terrain. The office feels like it is in the middle of campaign season, with the other side rolling out a series of unpredictable attacks over the course of the week, leaving New York to figure which to fight back on and how. Applications for new positions have soared, even from private-sector lawyers willing to forgo hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay to help take on Trump.

“We are the backstop,” added Alvin Bragg, a top deputy in the office. “The system is set up in a certain way, that if the federal government doesn’t do certain things, we have to step up and push back. If they leave things wide open, we have to step into the void.”

At a standing room-only town hall in midtown Manhattan weeks after election, Schneiderman sounded like someone ready to lead the charge. Although few probably wanted to hear it, he painted a picture of an election that amounted to a clarifying moment for the left: it was time to clean out its hidebound notions and some of its own slow-moving elected officials.

“We are facing a crisis, not over conservative or liberal, but a crisis over whether or not the rule of law is respected or not, over whether the Constitution is respected or not, and whether the central American notion of equal justice under the law and that everyone be treated with dignity and equality and fairness—all that is at issue now,” he told the crowd.

But don’t despair, he hastened to add. “There is good news, too: Those who were asleep,” he said, “are now awake.”

The crowd loved it, nodding along, cheering and clapping at Schneiderman's urging. He left as soon as his speech was over, but everyone else stayed behind. The real work, it seemed, had not yet begun.

WASHINGTON — President Trump went off script during a surprise press conference at the White House on Thursday, turning what was supposed to be a mundane announcement of his new labor secretary nominee into a circus.

The president listed his accomplishments in office thus far and touched on a number of subjects — his approval rating, radical Islamic terrorism and “the dishonest media” — during a 20-minute opening statement.

“Many reporters will not tell you the truth,” Trump said from the East Room of the White House. “They do not treat the people of our country with the respect they deserve. Unfortunately much of the media in D.C., New York and Los Angeles speak, not to the people, but for the special interests and those profiting. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. The level of dishonesty is out of control.”

“I ran for president to present the citizens of our country,” he continued.

“I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking — and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure; we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say — they’re honest and fantastic.”

WATCH:



Trump said what is published in the news is not representative of what is happening in the White House.

“I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos — chaos,” he said. “Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved.”

Then the president moved on to ISIS, which he said has “spread like cancer.”

“That’s another mess I inherited,” he said.

“And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great from Congress, generally.”

After that, Trump returned to his Cabinet nominations, or lack thereof.

“We have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about and we can’t let that happen,” Trump said.

“So, if the Democrats who have — all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.”

Multiple reporters asked Trump about his, or his campaign’s, connections with Russia, which he fervently denied.

“I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.”

“I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.

“Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine — seriously — can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair.”

Follow Kaitlan on TwitterCalifornia’s bullet train could cost taxpayers 50% more than estimated — as much as $3.6 billion more. And that’s just for the first 118 miles through the Central Valley, which was supposed to be the easiest part of the route between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

A confidential Federal Railroad Administration risk analysis, obtained by The Times, projects that building bridges, viaducts, trenches and track from Merced to Shafter, just north of Bakersfield, could cost $9.5 billion to $10 billion, compared with the original budget of $6.4 billion.

The federal document outlines far-reaching management problems: significant delays in environmental planning, lags in processing invoices for federal grants and continuing failures to acquire needed property.

The California High-Speed Rail Authority originally anticipated completing the Central Valley track by this year, but the federal risk analysis estimates that that won’t happen until 2024, placing the project seven years behind schedule.

The report, the most critical official assessment of the project to surface so far, is labeled a “confidential-draft deliberative document for internal use only” and was presented by senior Federal Railroad Administration executives to California rail authority board Chairman Dan Richard and Chief Executive Jeff Morales on Dec. 1 in Washington.

This analysis puts the state on notice that it could face bigger cost overruns than anticipated and much longer delays than have been made public, a troubling critique by an agency that has been a stalwart supporter and longtime financier of the nation’s largest infrastructure project.

The point of doing this analysis is to identify the challenges and work through them. — Jeff Morales, chief executive of California High-Speed Rail Authority

Morales cautioned in an interview that the numbers in the analysis are only projections and estimates that do not account for intervention by the rail authority, and he asserted that the construction in the Central Valley will cost less than the risk analysis indicates. The estimates, he said, are based on a lot of assumptions that the authority wants to ensure are correct.

“The point of doing this analysis is to identify the challenges and work through them,” he said. “They are not conclusions and not findings.”

The Federal Railroad Administration is tracking the project because it has extended $3.5 billion in two grants to help build the Central Valley segment. The administration has an obligation to ensure that the state complies with the terms, including a requirement that the state has the funding to match the federal grants.

Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock), chairman of the House rail subcommittee, said Friday he would conduct an oversight hearing in the near future and fight any further federal funding.

“Despite past issues with funding this boondoggle, we were repeatedly assured in an August field hearing that construction costs were under control,” he said in a statement. “They continue to reaffirm my belief that this is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.”

The railroad administration’s analysis shows that the state authority could lose $220 million in one of the federal grants this year if it cannot submit paperwork by June 30, to meet the Sept. 30 deadline of the Obama administration’s stimulus act.

To hit those milestones requires spending $3.2 million per day, a very high rate of construction spending. But Morales said the rail authority’s construction progress and spending rate ensure that all of the grant funds will be used. So far, the authority has spent $2.2 billion of the grant, leaving $300 million to spend.

Federal Railroad Administration spokesman Matthew Lehner did not answer specific questions about the risk analysis but said that it “is a standard oversight tool used on major capital projects — not just California.”

Lehner said that he’s confident the state can meet its deadline, “with continued focus and hard work.”

Other recent documents, however, paint a dark picture of California’s ambitious transportation project and help explain some of the performance problems.

Audit reports last year, for example, found that the rail authority lacks consistent management processes, takes on unnecessary contract risks, does not have orderly records and is short on clearly defined responsibility for its top officials.

And an internal report obtained by The Times notes a just-completed survey in which employees complain that morale is low and has declined in each of the last three years. Employees interviewed by The Times say turnover is consistently high, leaving staff overworked. The rail authority’s senior deputy, its chief administrative officer and its top information technology executive recently left.

Rail authority spokeswoman Lisa Marie Alley said that the authority takes the issue seriously and that it is “currently making changes that we expect will help in that regard.”

About 80% of all bullet train systems incur massive overruns in their construction, according to Bent Flyvbjerg, an infrastructure risk expert at the University of Oxford who has studied such rail projects all over the world. One of the biggest hazards of such mega-projects is a government agency that is attempting to do something highly complex for the first time.

The California system is being built by an independent authority that has never built anything and depends on a large network of consultants and contractors for advice. Engineering and construction experts have warned that early cost and schedule problems will be difficult to reverse and that early cost increases likely will drive up the final cost of the project.

Proponents of the project, including many veteran transportation experts, have said that California’s massive economy can handle higher costs for the project — even more than $100 billion — by increasing sales taxes or making firm commitments for additional future funding from the state’s general fund.

But the Legislature already has balked at giving the rail authority the ability to borrow against future state revenues, saying it would have to make do with existing allocations. And that was before Gov. Jerry Brown warned Tuesday that California’s projected 2017-18 budget shows a $1.6-billion deficit.

Proponents say short-term financial concerns are more than offset by the future value of a transportation system connecting the state.Mary Kouw/CBS via Getty Images

Join the discussion of this episode on Facebook.Andrew Puzder, President Donald Trump's labor secretary nominee, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid growing resistance from Senate Republicans centered primarily on Puzder's past employment of an undocumented housekeeper.

The collapse of Puzder's nomination threw the White House into further turmoil just two days after the resignation of Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, amid revelations that Flynn had spoken repeatedly, and possibly illegally, with the Russian ambassador last year about lifting U.S. sanctions.

Puzder's fate amplified the deteriorating relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill, where bipartisan support grew Wednesday for expanded investigations into ties between Trump, his presidential campaign and Russian officials.

The White House, including Trump, offered no comment on Puzder's withdrawal nor any indication of whom the president would nominate in the restaurant executive's place. Puzder issued a statement saying he was "honored" to have been nominated. "While I won't be serving in the administration, I fully support the President and his highly qualified team," he said.

A top Trump campaign supporter, Puzder had attracted widespread criticism regarding his business record and personal background. He was set to testify Thursday at a confirmation hearing that had been delayed for weeks to allow for the completion of an ethics review of his vast personal wealth.

Critics have railed against Puzder's positions against minimum-wage increases and more generous overtime benefits. Some have also accused him of sexism, pointed to a rancorous divorce that involved later-recanted allegations of domestic abuse as well as racy TV ads run by his restaurant chains that featured scantily clad women eating hamburgers.

But it was Puzder's hiring of an undocumented worker for domestic work - as well as his support for more liberalized immigration policies - that pushed several Senate Republicans away, they said.

Puzder had told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions this month that he had been unaware of the housekeeper's immigration status when he hired her and that he paid federal and state back taxes after terminating her employment.

Similar revelations have forced Cabinet nominees to withdraw dating to at least Bill Clinton's presidency, but it was less clear this year, in the unpredictable, rule-breaking era of Trump, whether that norm would apply. In the end, the revelation was particularly troubling to lawmakers because of the job Puzder was seeking: running the Labor Department.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., a member of the Senate health committee, said Wednesday that revelations about Puzder's personal employment practices gave him "serious concerns" that he had conveyed to Senate leaders. Three other GOP senators on the committee, Susan Collins (Maine), Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), had also publicly voiced doubts.

In the hours before Puzder withdrew, 12 Republican senators "at a minimum" were withholding support, according to a senior Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid political retribution. The quick erosion of support compelled Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to tell the White House on Wednesday that Puzder lacked the support needed to survive, according to two senior Senate aides who requested anonymity. Shortly after that, Puzder withdrew.

Senators may yet face another contentious confirmation vote Thursday, when Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is scheduled for a final vote on the Senate floor. On Wednesday, Mulvaney lost the backing of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who objects to Mulvaney's support for military spending cuts.

Puzder has spent much of his career in the restaurant industry speaking out against wage and labor regulations. The former commercial trial lawyer has been a staunch opponent of rules finalized by the Labor Department last year - and since put on hold - that would have expanded the number of people eligible for overtime pay. He also has been critical of substantially increasing the minimum wage, arguing that it could push companies to cut jobs and encourage businesses to invest more money in automation.

As a result, Puzder's nomination immediately came under intense scrutiny from unions, labor groups and consumer advocates who worried the executive would prioritize businesses over workers. As recently as this week, workers from his fast-food chain and advocates for a higher minimum wage marched outside of CKE's restaurants to protest the nomination. Worker advocates had also hand-delivered petitions to senators' local offices and organized trips for CKE employees to travel to Capitol Hill and share their grievances with senators.

Democrats cheered Puzder's withdrawal and sought to take credit for helping pressure Republicans to withdraw support.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called Puzder's decision "a victory for the American worker. Puzder should never have even been nominated to lead the Labor Department, and Senate Republicans clearly recognized this, too." He called on Trump to nominate someone who "champions workers' rights rather than suppresses them."

Progressives and Democrats said they hoped Trump's next pick for labor secretary would be someone with a clear willingness to speak up for disadvantaged workers.

"We need a labor secretary in the mainstream who supports the workplace protections that he or she would be charged with enforcing - and who cares about workers," said Emily Martin, general counsel for the National Women's Law Center, which opposed Puzder's nomination because of "sexist" advertising run by Carl's Jr. and Hardee's - two of Puzder's restaurant chains - and reports of harassment from employees working for the chain.

Several names that had emerged on Trump's shortlist for labor secretary late last year began recirculating Wednesday. Among them: Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. After Puzder's withdrawal Wednesday, Walker tweeted: "The future is too bright in WI for me to do anything other than being Governor."

Puzder would have been the first labor secretary since the Reagan era to take the job without some experience in public service. He made a minor foray into politics in 2011, when he served as an economic adviser and spokesman for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who recently endorsed his nomination.

In 2016, Puzder was an avid Trump supporter. In addition to serving as an economic adviser to his campaign, he and his wife, Deanna Puzder, contributed a total of $332,000 to Trump's bid, joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission.Win McNamee/Getty Images

In a surprise move, the Department of Justice is now saying that Donald Trump “intends in the near future to rescind” his executive order on immigration, and will “replace it with a new, substantially revised” order. If the DOJ's lawyers are correct about Trump’s plans—and they might not be—it could mean that all litigation stemming from Trump’s immigration ban will come to a halt and that the administration intends to essentially ctrl-alt-delete its efforts to institute new border restrictions against refugees and visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries.

The government’s new position was revealed in a DOJ filing with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which dealt Trump a decisive blow last week when a panel of three judges upheld a temporary restraining order against the immigration ban. The primary purpose of the filing was to inform the 9th Circuit that the government does not want the court to revisit its decision en banc—a process that would have put the case in front of a wider panel of judges. Instead, the DOJ seems to have decided that “the most appropriate course would be for the Court to hold its consideration of the case until the President issues the new Order and then vacate the panel’s preliminary decision.”

Though the filing sounds an awful lot like a surrender—the words “SEE YOU IN COURT” do not appear—there is no certainty that Trump won’t continue fighting for his original order even as he prepares a new one. Indeed, at a press conference held Thursday, Trump seemed to contradict the DOJ, telling reporters that his administration was “appealing” the 9th Circuit decision and would continue that fight while also issuing a new executive order next week. “We’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that,” Trump said. “At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people.”Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images

What is Facebook? It’s a question that seems like it ought to become easier to answer over time. Instead, it has become more difficult. CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s latest and most lengthy attempt to define the service that he created—a 6,000-word open letter to the Facebook “community”—instead underscores just how murky its purpose and agenda have become.

Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter.

When Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004, the concept was simple. It was a social network in the classic sense: a place to post a personal profile, connect to other people’s profiles, and interact with them online. Over the years, the news feed evolved from metaphorical to literal as Facebook became the dominant online platform for reading and sharing news, opinion, and other content from around the wider web. It turned out that online friend networks were a singularly potent way for ideas to spread.

The downsides of this arrangement emerged more gradually. But the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in which Facebook served as a vector for fake news and sensationalism and a force for ideological polarization, helped to distil them. That, and a series of more or less related controversies in the United States and elsewhere, prompted founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to embark on a countrywide listening tour that many interpreted as a signal that he planned to one day run for office.

A careful read reveals a lot about how Zuckerberg views Facebook.

More likely, it was a signal that he’s rethinking Facebook’s role in society. On Thursday, that soul-searching bore fruit in the form of a lengthy and high-flown open letter addressed to “our community.” The letter’s title: “Building Global Community.” Yes, the word community features prominently throughout, as does the phrase “social infrastructure,” which I’ll get to in a moment. As The Verge’s Casey Newton points out, the sprawling epistle essentially becomes Facebook’s new manifesto, modifying and complicating its well-known mission to “make the world more open and connected.”

Read the letter and you’ll see why critics have accused it of using a lot of words while saying rather little. Jargon is rife; specifics are scarce. Still, a careful read reveals a lot about how Zuckerberg views the site he created and how he hopes it will evolve. It’s been obvious for some time now that Facebook is much more than a social network. But just what it is—a media company? A tech company? A utility?—has become a matter of debate.

Zuckerberg’s letter tries to settle that question in many ways, but perhaps the most direct is exemplified by his persistent use of the phrase “social infrastructure.” The sole sentence that appears entirely in bold is this one (italics mine):

In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.

Zuckerberg never explicitly defines “social infrastructure,” despite deploying the phrase 15 times—an oversight typical of his unrigorous armchair philosophizing. You could be forgiven for concluding that it doesn’t really mean anything, except that Facebook has found a clever new way to answer the question of what it is without making any particular commitments. But we can glean a little more than that if we try.

By choosing “infrastructure” as the noun, Zuckerberg shows that he still views Facebook as a technology—a set of tools—rather than a media company responsible for creating or curating published content. This is consistent with Facebook’s past attempts to define itself, including that widely mocked 2012 TV ad in which the company compared itself to chairs. It implies that Facebook will continue to shun political controversy and disclaim responsibility for the content that its users post and share, at least in cases where doing so would run counter to the company’s interests.

On the other hand, Zuckerberg’s manifesto makes it clear that he no longer views Facebook as fully neutral. He recognizes—at last?—that his technology molds how its billion-plus users read, communicate, organize themselves, and form ideas about themselves and the world. And he no longer views openness and connectedness as ends in themselves.

“Social infrastructure,” then, must mean something different from mere “communications infrastructure.” It means that Facebook sees its purpose as facilitating certain kinds of interactions and social arrangements. Namely, Zuckerberg sees Facebook’s purpose as building communities with five particular characteristics: supportive, safe, informed, civically engaged, and inclusive.

Zuckerberg also states repeatedly that he wants to build a community that is “global.” As the New York Times’ Mike Isaac notes, this places Facebook in surprisingly explicit opposition to the tides of nationalism and isolationism that have swept the likes of Donald Trump and Theresa May into power.

Who but a misanthrope could dispute the value of safety, civic engagement, or inclusion?

That pointed exception aside, Zuckerberg’s goals for Facebook’s communities sound relatively anodyne. Who but a misanthrope could dispute the value of safety, civic engagement, or inclusion?

The rub, however, is essentially the same as it has always been with Zuckerberg: He’s trying to have it both ways. He wants Facebook to play a more active role in shaping conversations and communities for the better. Yet he still wants to call it infrastructure.

Sure, infrastructure can shape conversations and communities. Highways, irrigation systems, cellular data service: They all affect how societies organize themselves, in one way or another. But the key questions of how and where to deploy infrastructure, for whose benefit and at what cost, are inherently political. A highway that makes some people feel included can leave others feeling isolated. An irrigation system can secure one community’s water supply while depriving another. And a Facebook post that makes some people feel civically engaged could make others feel unsafe. In all cases, there are tradeoffs—a concept Facebook and Zuckerberg have always been loath to acknowledge.

The manifesto does provide some clues as to how Facebook will adjudicate conflicting claims among its users. It states that Facebook will “try to reflect the cultural norms of our community,” while also giving individual users the power to control their own experience, where possible. Those are both fine principles. But implementing them will necessarily involve a level of political decision-making on Facebook’s part that Zuckerberg’s letter does not fully reckon with.

Making the world more open and connected was a radical idea, and a substantive one—and, ultimately, a dangerous one. On one level, it implied a strong bias toward freedom of expression and against provincialism and repression. At the same time, it implied that it was none of Facebook's business exactly what kinds of ideas and speech flourished on its platform. Paradoxically, then, a bias toward freedom of expression could conceivably end up empowering those who would quash it.

Technology is at its most dangerous when it is created thoughtlessly.

Facebook’s new manifesto is either far less radical or far less substantive than its famous mission statement, depending on how you read it—but not necessarily any less dangerous. If, as some critics allege, it’s largely pablum designed to appease the company’s collective conscience without committing it to any particular ideals, then it’s less substantive. On the other hand, if it’s really about strengthening distinct communities and upholding existing cultural norms, it’s substantive, but also deeply conservative. It implies, for instance, a bias in favor of free speech and against repression only in cultural contexts where those biases are already present. That’s not making the world a better place. It’s entrenching the status quo.

To be clear: Zuckerberg and Facebook thinking seriously about their impact on the world is a good thing. Technology is at its most dangerous when it is created thoughtlessly, for its own sake or for the sake of profit. It’s at its most manageable when its political agenda is transparent and explicit, because then it can be openly debated, supported, or opposed. Zuckerberg’s manifesto makes it clear that he does care about Facebook’s role in society. Yet as a statement of values, it is compromised by the undefined jargon, the unacknowledged conflicts, and the uncritical optimism about Facebook’s ability to meet the needs and desires of all of its users at once.The International Rescue Committee (IRC) today announced its first-ever emergency appeal focused exclusively on aiding refugees already in the United States and supporting the critical services the IRC provides to ensure the newest Americans – most of whom are women and children – can reclaim their lives.

The $5 million initial appeal will cover anticipated funding gaps tied to the Trump Administration’s executive order banning all refugee arrivals for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. This emergency funding will support those who look to the IRC’s 29 offices across the U.S. for necessary and immediate aid on arrival and beyond—including housing, cultural orientation, health care, education, employment, and immigration services. Contributions will also support the work of IRC’s dedicated field teams who are crucial to ensuring clients are provided with a solid foundation so they can build on it and successfully integrate into American society.

Founded in 1933, the IRC is unique as it supports both refugees in conflict zones across the world, as well as refugees resettling in cities across the U.S. The IRC urges donors to help those who have arrived in the U.S. looking to begin anew and contribute to their communities.

Note: throughout the report we have redacted, where necessary, names and email addresses of individuals and organizations targeted in order to protect their identity and safety. We have also obscured wherever possible the pictures utilized by the attackers on the fake social media profiles, as they have been likely stolen from people with no involvement in these attacks.

Our investigation revealed that unidentified attackers have purposefully created and maintained what appears to be a fake online persona, named “Safeena Malik”, in order to regularly engage in conversations with the selected targets, and at different times and with different pretenses try to lure them into giving away their credentials to their Gmail account through the use of phishing attacks.

Phishing is a hacking technique that often consists of mimicking popular online services (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin) and credibly replicating their login pages, with the goal of stealing usernames and passwords from the designated victims by luring them into mistakenly authenticating through such pages.

This type of attack is extremely popular, and often used against members of civil society. It is relatively easy and cheap to orchestrate, and if successful it grants the attackers access to victims’ personal and professional email accounts, which can obviously reveal very sensitive information. For example, having an activist’s email account phished might lead to the reconstruction of their network, exposure of sources’ identities, as well as abuse of their accounts for impersonation. By comparison, phishing attacks are likely significantly more common than malware attacks.

Phishing attacks are normally delivered through emails soliciting the target to open a link and login to, for example, a Google-like page. The strategies used to make this solicitation credible can vary. Often, for example, the email would falsely inform the victim that their account has been hacked, urgently requiring a password reset.

“Safeena Malik” has a full presence on social media but her twitter account, created in December 2014 has only one visible tweet, dating from 23 December 2014, a simple “hi”. We believe it is possible that the operators of Operation Kingphish might have acquired a set of pre-registered (or stolen) social media profiles online. The accounts “Safeena Malik” follows show a clear pattern: a large number of Middle East-based journalists for international publications, staff of international human rights organizations and trade unions, and various campaigns for migrants’ rights in Qatar.

Their Facebook account appears to be more active, and their LinkedIn profile, has 500+ connections.

The various social media accounts communicated regularly with several of the victims we identified, often for many months. It appears that the attackers may have impersonated the identity of a real young woman and stole her pictures to construct the fake profile, along with a professional biography also stolen from yet another person. The emails and messages sent by the fake “Safeena Malik” would normally be timed around — before, and following — the delivery of yet another attempt at phishing the credentials of the designated victims.

Case 1: Fake Google, real Google

For example, in the exchange below, “Safeena” tried to lure the target by purporting to be seeking help on some important research on human trafficking.

In the course of this email correspondence, the attacker — “Safeena” — then sent what appeared to be invitations to access several documents on Google Drive.

The links and buttons contained in the emails would direct the victim to a webpage that looked something like this:

Note: the profile picture has been manipulated to protect the identity of the target.

The page is designed to mimic a standard Google login page, with a high degree of accuracy. While most common phishing pages would only provide an empty form to enter an email address and password, this one instead is configured to display the profile picture, the account name, and the email address of the victim. This is obscured in the above screenshot to protect the privacy of the victim.

This design effectively replicates a real Google login page, which would similarly display the same information if you had previously logged into your account from a computer. The attackers were meticulous in making their phishing page as credible as possible.

Interestingly, after the victims would have entered their Google account credentials, they would be redirected to an actual document hosted on Google Drive, effectively recreating a normal browsing experience in order to avoid suspicion. In the example below, the target would have been redirected to a PowerPoint presentation on human trafficking. Amnesty has identified that this presentation had also been stolen from another source.

Case 2: Making friends and connections

Among the targets of this campaign is the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). ITUC is a trade union federation based in Brussels and among the largest in the world, counting over 170 million members. ITUC has been very outspoken in recent years about migrant labour rights in Qatar, and is behind the “Re-Run the Vote!” campaign against the award of the organization of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar.

Both in the attacks against ITUC and in other occasions, the attackers approached selected targets over social media, prominently Facebook, and engaged in chat conversations with them on and off, sometimes over a period of several months. At times the attackers behind the profile would just have a short casual conversation, while at others they attempted an attack. Possibly in order to identify further targets, “Safeena Malik” found her way into several Facebook groups dealing with migrant workers and forced labour.

Similarly to attempts described previously, in this case the attackers also invited the targets to open a document seemingly shared on Google Drive. This time the document purported to be about the involvement of the Emir of Qatar in funding ISIS, which was seemingly copied from a website critical of Qatar.

Once the target would provide their credentials through the fake Google login page, they would also be automatically redirected to an existing document hosted on the legitimate Google Drive.

While it might not appear significant, this attention to detail is what, in our experience, sets apart these phishing attempts from more common ones, as they demonstrate a level of experience and care that is both unusual and remarkable.

Case 3: Hanging out

Similar tactics are exemplified by yet another case we’ve become aware of and portrayed in the picture below, where the fake “Safeena Malik” profile is conversing with a prominent activist from Nepal working on migrant workers issues, soliciting them to give away their Gmail address.

Interestingly, the attackers tried to leverage common Facebook friends in an attempt to convince the target of their legitimacy. This is a tactic we’ve observed the attackers utilize on numerous occasions across their conversations with some of the targets we know of, which explains the time and effort spent in building a large social graph.

In this case, the attackers very credibly pretended to have been inviting the targets to participate in a Google Hangout (a videoconferencing service operated by Google).

Again, when clicking on the button the target would be presented with a Google-like login page.Carlos Barria/Reuters

So Michael Flynn is gone from a job that he should never have had in the first place. The question now is whether his departure marks the final gasp of a political scandal or just the beginning of a crisis that could conceivably oust Donald Trump from power.

As we now know, in late January, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House counsel that Flynn’s phone calls with Russian officials were of such a nature that he had opened himself up to blackmail. Yates and the Justice Department’s investigators had discovered, from intercepts of those phone calls, that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions policy—essentially telling them not to react to President Obama’s economic penalties against Russia, or to his expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s manipulation of the election, because Trump would reverse the measures after he took office.

This we know. But what if Trump knew the subject of Flynn’s conversations at the time? What if he had authorized Flynn to discuss sanctions relief or had been otherwise complicit in the arrangement? Then Trump himself would be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. This has been the underlying concern in the various probes of Trump’s possible financial ties to Russia. It was the essence of the “dossier” assembled by the British ex-spy Christopher Steele, detailing the kompromat—the term in Russian intelligence circles for compromising material—that the Kremlin allegedly had on Trump.

The probes of Trump’s financial ties have not panned out. Steele’s dossier is as yet unverified, though U.S. law-enforcement agents are finding it increasingly plausible, as many of the meetings it recounts—the names, dates, and places—match the real records. Flynn’s fate—the revelation that he had discussed sanctions policy with Russian officials, that he lied about it to Vice President Mike Pence and others, and that Trump did nothing about this for weeks after the acting attorney general warned him to beware—greatly boosts the odds that more investigations will take place, whether by the FBI, various counterintelligence agencies, Congress, or all of the above.

If there’s more to be discovered, it is now more likely than before that it will be discovered. If Flynn’s scandal sticks to Trump, or if it turns out that Flynn was acting at Trump’s instigation all along, and if Trump’s motives seem to resemble what the dossier suggests, then Trump is in trouble. Congressional Republicans and their base have managed to overlook, reinterpret, or dismiss Trump’s many lies, evasions, and acts of carelessness in the brief span of his presidency so far. But one thing that they might not be able to ignore, the thing that might go a bridge too far for all but the most diehard of his supporters, would be clear evidence that the president of the United States is secretly beholden to a foreign power.

Whether or not this scenario comes to pass, Trump’s White House, chaotic from the outset, is currently in turmoil. In Flynn’s wake, the president’s foreign policy apparatus, which has been spinning in several directions, is rudderless, and his already severe isolation is intensified.

Flynn was the ultimate loyalist, a retired three-star general who abandoned the officers’ apolitical creed to join the Trump campaign in full lather, to the point of retweeting the craziest anti-Clinton conspiracy screeds and screaming at the Republican National Convention, “Lock her up! Damn right!” Through the election, the transition, and the first few weeks of Trump’s presidency, Flynn was a constant presence, one of the few fully trusted insiders, the only confidant whose sole portfolio was national security, and Trump seemed to rely on him for more than that. According to the Huffington Post, Trump once phoned Flynn, of all people, at 3 a.m. to ask whether a strong dollar was good or bad for the economy. (Flynn didn’t know, and why should he?)

Tensions were already emerging between Flynn and Trump’s secretary of defense, retired four-star Gen. James Mattis. Many in the foreign policy community, and in Congress, had put huge hopes on Mattis as a counterweight to Flynn’s influence. The hopes have so far borne fruit as Mattis convinced Trump to back away from a draft executive order—which Mattis learned about from a newspaper report—that would have reopened CIA black sites for detainees and reconsidered the ban on torture. Flynn was the main force behind the order; Mattis was on record as firmly opposing the idea.

What happens now? Retired Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg, the National Security Council’s chief of staff, has taken over as acting national security adviser. Kellogg is a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf wars with experience at staff jobs in the Pentagon and the White House. And he was listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump during the campaign, though they aren’t seen as having a close relationship.

Kellogg is reportedly one of the names on a shortlist of replacements for Flynn. But the most intriguing, even provocative name is Gen. David Petraeus, who is said to be meeting with Trump this week. Petraeus, of course, comes with baggage. In 2013, he resigned as CIA director after it was revealed he was having an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. The following year, he was charged with sharing classified material with her and for making false statements to the FBI. (He pleaded guilty to reduced misdemeanor charges, was fined $100,000, and is still on probation.) The national security adviser does not have to undergo Senate confirmation, but given concerns about the mishandling of classified information by Flynn, Hillary Clinton, and Trump himself after his high-profile briefing about North Korea’s missile test in the middle of the Mar-a-Lago dining room, this may weigh against his chances.

Then again, Petraeus is widely admired in the foreign policy community, whose denizens are increasingly disturbed by Trump’s judgment and competence. Petraeus may be a route to relief. He has actually participated, alongside Cabinet secretaries, as a member of the NSC Principals Committee. He has global experience in national security policy and has a strategic mindset.

But this experience may end up a debit. Petraeus is a consummate operator, and, despite his discrediting in some circles, he still has connections throughout the national-security bureaucracy. When President Obama was considering Petraeus as possible chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, White House aides advised against it, seeing him as too independent, too politically savvy, and too invested in his own agenda. Trump’s advisers may have the same concerns. Especially in this administration, where the president and his inner circle know little about foreign policy, and where so many senior positions are still unfilled in the State and Defense Departments, Petraeus could run the show—manipulating Trump far more than the other way around. Finally, Petraeus was on good terms with Hillary Clinton, even sitting in on a campaign advisory council. Though he never endorsed her, this could be the crucial blow against him in Trump’s eyes.

In that sense, a possible compromise candidate—and another name on the list—is Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a former Navy SEAL who has served as director of defense issues on the NSC staff, as the Joint Chiefs’ representative at the National Counterterrorism Center, and as deputy commanding general of U.S. Central Command. This last post may be most significant of all as the commanding general at the time was Mattis, and the two got along well. If Trump relies on Mattis’ recommendation, Flynn’s replacement may well be Harward.

But who knows? Newspapers have printed supposed shortlists for various top slots in the Trump administration, and sometimes they’ve turned out to be false. Remember when the secretary of state was going to be Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, or John Bolton?

So how about this as a wild card for Flynn’s replacement? Robert Gates—former secretary of defense, CIA director, and deputy national security adviser: respected in all corners.

Trump asked Gates for advice on nominating a secretary of state—and he took it, naming Rex Tillerson, whom he’d never met before. Gates probably doesn’t want the job. He loathes much about Washington: His tell-all memoir, Duty, was so brutal about so many people, it amounted to a plea and a warning to future presidents not to give him a job in the capital again. And yet a close acquaintance of Gates’ told me in a phone conversation Tuesday that he could see Gates taking the job if Trump offered it. “Being asked to serve the country by presidents is his Kryptonite,” the acquaintance said. “It’s the one thing he is helpless against.”

Whoever replaces Flynn, his biggest challenge won’t merely be to stabilize the USS Trump in stormy waters but to keep the whole ship from capsizing.CBS

Notwithstanding the greatness of Bob Odenkirk’s performance as Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul’s Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill, it’s a little alarming to consider that there may be prestige-drama fans unaware of Odenkirk’s storied sketch-comedy past. Fortunately, Odenkirk’s most recent project is the Netflix black comedy Girlfriend’s Day, which freed him up to engage in some classic Mr. Show mindbending on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.

In the Late Show bit, Odenkirk informs Colbert that he’s starring in the forthcoming Late Show: The Movie, playing none other than Stephen Colbert. And what do you know, he has a clip. Given that said clip shows a scowling Odenkirk-as-Colbert taking the Late Show stage and sneering “Clap, you pigs,” Colbert is understandably taken aback, but then he remembers: He’s also in Late Show: The Movie, playing … Bob Odenkirk.

Q. Oral equality: I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year, and we enjoy a great sex life. He really enjoys performing oral sex on me and does it frequently. I, on the other hand, really do not enjoy performing oral sex and never have. It makes me feel very uncomfortable and often elicits a gag reflex/panic response. He mentioned recently that he has accepted the fact that “I just don’t do” that particular act for him and that he’s OK with it because it’s harder for me to achieve orgasm than him and he prefers sex to oral sex. Still, I can’t help but feel guilty and that this is something I should force myself to be doing for him since he does it for me so often. Is there some kind of unspoken equality when it comes to oral sex? Should I feel obligated to do something in bed that I don’t enjoy to make things “equal” between us in this area?

A: Reciprocating oral sex is, in general, a very good idea! You have, however, what sounds like a legitimate, lifelong difficulty with performing it; you’re not trying to get out of pleasing your partner because you’re uninterested or indifferent. You two have discussed this issue and come to a mutually agreed-upon compromise, which is a great start. As long as you don’t think he’s just pretending not to mind for your sake, it sounds like he has truly accepted that blow jobs are too difficult and painful for you to perform, and he’s still very satisfied with your sex life. Take him at his word.

If this is something you’d truly like to work on, not out of a sense of guilt but because you would enjoy occasionally reciprocating, there are a wealth of resources out there for the enthusiastic amateur (you are far from the only would-be blow-jobber whose spirit is willing but gag reflex is weak). You have more options than “no blow jobs, ever” and “regular whole-hog sessions to completion that result in vomiting.” Good luck!

Q. Enough potlucks already: I’ve always brought something when invited to somebody’s home, but these days, every party or dinner I go to seems to require me to make and bring something, and it’s usually something expensive and complicated. I’ll get invitations to drinks from people I barely know, and they’ll say “BYOB” or “bring a good Malbec” and include a link to a Food Network recipe. And then you get there and nobody eats anything because there’s too much food. We’re not in college. I’ve stopped asking, “Can I bring anything?” because it results in a shopping list. Is there a polite way to say, “If you want to entertain, make your own damned food?”

A: I don’t think there is! If you don’t like potlucks, the solution to your problem is “don’t go to potlucks,” not “insist other people don’t have them.”

Q. Time to cut and run?: My boyfriend of three years doesn’t include me in any plans with his close-knit Italian family. In general, I don’t expect a great deal of contact with his family, but I do feel excluded when I’m not invited by him to major family events and holidays. I’ve told him I’d like to be included in holidays, as it is important to me. His response: He loves me and I’m a priority, but he doesn’t want to have to answer difficult questions from his “nosy family members” about what is going on with our relationship. He’s also recently told me he feels my presence would “slow him down” at the events, as he’d have to take time to introduce me, to take care of me, etc. In a talk about the holidays this year, he told me that if we aren’t getting married, I’ll NEVER meet his family (I do want to get married, and he knows that). I took that as pretty much the defining wall-handwriting-moment that this relationship is never going to progress anywhere. He says otherwise and tells me we’re meant to be together. His actions and words just don’t seem to align. Should I just cut my losses and move on or attempt to talk with him again?

A: You would slow him down at ... family dinners? What could that possibly mean! “Darling, I’d love for you to meet my parents, but I couldn’t possibly take the time to introduce you. It would slow me down, and speed is of the essence in these troubled times.”

Here is the breakdown, as best as I can tell, of your situation:

1. You would like to meet his family and also get married.

2. He would introduce you to his family if you were getting married, but for aerodynamic and efficiency reasons, does not currently have any time to do either of those things.

It does not bode well, in my professional opinion, but I think it’s worth having a final conversation about. You’ve been dating for three years; you’d like to marry him someday; and before doing so, you’d like to meet his family. Tell him it’s something you take very seriously and are considering ending your relationship over; if he still hems and haws about introducing you to his relatives after that, I think it’s a fairly clear sign that he doesn’t want the same things that you do, and you should walk away.

Q. No-longer-welcome house guest: A friend of mine posted on social media in a way that led me to believe she was in danger in her relationship with a live-in boyfriend. Because I was worried about her safety, I offered her a temporary place to stay. (I live alone, in a tiny studio apartment, for a reason.) A few days into her staying at my place, she admitted that he hadn’t threatened her physically but that she had kicked and punched him repeatedly. There have been numerous occasions where she talked about breaking up with this guy, and almost as many times I’ve watched her go back to him. Prudie, I figured they’d be back to their dysfunctional coupledom within a couple of days, but she’s been here a full week now with no signs of finding her own place. What can I do to get my place back to myself?

A: She’s not only lied about being physically abused; she’s physically abusing her boyfriend. I hope very much that she doesn’t return to him. It’s absolutely fair to tell your unwanted roommate that you offered her a place to stay out of a misguided concern for her safety—frankly I’m more worried about his—and now that you know she’s not in danger of violence, she’ll have to find another place to live.

Given what you know of her behavior, it’s very likely that she will not graciously accept your request and may try to make removing her from your apartment extremely difficult. I think I am going to open this one up to the commenters! What’s the best way to approach this? Should the OP consider her legal options? Should she contact the ex-boyfriend and offer her support, now that she knows her friend has been abusing him? Should she be worried about her own safety? What say you?

Q. Too close for Christmas: I am celebrating Christmas with my fiancé for the first time, and I am very uncomfortable. His ex and her husband bring the kids over and stay, along with an ex-girlfriend whose son he helped raise for five years. And they are all OK with it! I was fine with the backyard barbecues and school plays, but this is too much for me. My fiancé says since his house is big enough for everyone to have a bed, it makes sense for everyone to stay over and enjoy the holiday without rushing around to different locations. I am not worried about him fooling around on me, but the situation seems too odd. Am I crazy?

A: Lesbians do it all the time! It sounds delightful. (Sorry for perpetuating the harmful stereotype that queer women always stay friends with our exes!)

Q. Re: No-longer-welcome house guest: Attorney here. Be very careful, and get this person out as soon as you can. Depending on your state you may, if you let her stay long enough, create what is called a “tenancy at sufferance,” which means she becomes entitled to notice (30 or 60 days) AND possible the full rights of the formal eviction process (meaning you have to go to court to get her out).

A: Thank you! Tenancy laws can be so complicated; I want to make sure OP is protected as much as possible.

Q. Am I being overly sensitive?: Several months ago a co-worker’s mother died. I bought a card and sent it around the department. Everyone in our department of 30 people generously donated cash so we could “upgrade” the arrangement that the company sends. Several weeks ago my father passed away suddenly. When I returned from work, I found an open card on my desk with three signatures, as if someone had started it and given up. My manager was supposed to notify the company to send an arrangement but was apparently too busy to do so, so nothing was sent.

I feel forgotten and unappreciated, and several times I have burst into tears and had to leave the office. I can barely look my boss and co-workers in the eye. It’s not about a card or flowers, but if I say something it will sound greedy, and people will feel bad. I’m considering looking for another job over this. Am I overreacting?

A: Oh, I’m so enormously sorry. How awful to feel both slighted and then guilty about being slighted in the wake of your father’s surprising death. A half-hearted gesture of condolence can be more painful than none at all, and it’s no wonder you’re feeling bewildered and hurt. You’re absolutely not being overly sensitive to this thoughtless oversight. You’re going through the middle of something incredibly painful right now, and you’ve just been handed insult to injury. I hope that if you’re not in grief counseling already you’re able to find a counselor soon; this is something you need to be able to share with someone who doesn’t work with you. It may not be a good idea to bring it up with your boss, especially so recently after your bereavement when feelings are running high. I’d recommend talking about it with a loved one or a therapist before making any decisions.

Q. Re: No-longer-welcome house guest: That person is not your friend. She manipulated you into giving her a place to stay. Her boyfriend may have kicked her out, which would be the right thing to have done after the assault. You clearly realize that you have to usher her out of your apartment, too. Be prepared to be guilt-tripped over this. Change your locks. Your friendship may end, but if she assaulted her boyfriend, she is probably beyond the stage where you can help her.

A: Absolutely change your locks after she leaves. You don’t want her “forgetting” to return your key and letting herself back in.

Q. I guess they had to wash the sheets anyway: Last Thanksgiving I met my boyfriend’s parents, who are lovely people and welcomed me with grace and warmth. When we left, we were going to stop by his friend’s to drop off a bottle of wine as a gift, which we forgot. He called his friend to tell him we’d be late, but not his parents to tell them we were coming back, and he sent me in to get it while he played with his phone in the driveway. When I got to our bedroom to get the wine, I saw his parents in the middle of an act of almost terrifying intimacy and trust on the bed where we’d just slept. I just grabbed the gift bag, and they didn’t see me. I didn’t say anything to my boyfriend about it. We’re going back this week to stay again. I’m guessing I just shouldn’t say anything to him or them, but I just can’t get that image out of my mind, and I’m afraid I’m going to say something awkward. Any ideas?

A: Don’t say anything to your boyfriend’s parents. Feel free to tell your boyfriend what you saw, in as much detail as you can muster, so he never sends you into his parents’ house to run errands for him again.

Q. Mom is feisty but making bad choices: My mother is 82 and is becoming more dependent due to health issues—high blood pressure, emphysema, and kidney problems. She has stopped going to the gym and eating well or going out much with anyone but me. I find myself resenting her dependence because she’s not doing anything to take care of herself except taking her medication. I love her but wish she would do more for herself—go back to the gym or eat less fast food. I’ve suggested and volunteered to join her to grease the wheels, but she refuses. I just had to hang up because even though her blood pressure is through the roof she stopped at Taco Bell on her way home from the doctor. What can I do to lessen my resentment and help her?

A: It is frustrating, I think, when our parents insist on being people and making decisions we disagree with (I don’t say that to dismiss your concern; I genuinely sympathize). Your mother is 82 years old; the fact that she has been going to the gym until very recently is incredible. As long as she’s not neglecting herself—it doesn’t sound like she’s eating cheeseburgers for every meal or taking to her bed for days on end—whether she eats Taco Bell or like a probiotic monk is not going to change the fact that she is nearing the end of her life. If it brings her joy to eat fast food and skip the gym, don’t waste your last few years together trying to harangue her into yoga and cruciferous vegetables.

Her diminished social life is something of a different story—she may feel less up to going out and seeing friends than she used to. You could help her organize something in her own home; maybe ask her friends or family to come by for a casual get-together so she doesn’t exhaust herself trying to entertain. It’s difficult to balance these desires—you want your mother to have excellent quality of life for as long as possible, but you must also acknowledge that her life is her own and she may not value the same things you do, so close to the end of her life.Andrew Burton/Getty Images

States eager to defund Planned Parenthood might as well just take several hundred thousand dollars from government coffers and set them on fire. Mississippi learned this lesson on Thursday, when U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III (a George W. Bush appointee) blocked the state’s attempt to ban Medicaid reimbursements to several Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics—none of which, by the way, perform abortions. In a brief ruling, Jordan arrived at the same conclusion reached by every other court to consider this question: State-level efforts to defund Planned Parenthood are obviously illegal. Whether Mississippi will continue to burn money on its futile court battle, like Ohio, or simply give up, like Florida, remains to be seen.

There are two reasons why these state-level efforts to defund Planned Parenthood keep failing in court. The first reason—and the one relied upon by Jordan—is that they directly violate federal law. Medicaid’s “free choice of provider” requirement allows patients to obtain medical care from any facility that is “qualified to perform the service or services required.” States are permitted to set “reasonable standards relating to the qualifications of providers,” but these qualifications must pertain to the facility’s ability to perform safe, competent, legal care. An ideological disagreement with the facility’s affiliates, like opposition to abortion, is not relevant to a provider’s “qualifications.”

For now, this defense has proved ironclad for Planned Parenthood. It’s also proof that its health care providers are not substandard, contra the smear campaign against the organization. If a state could actually demonstrate that Planned Parenthood facilities are unsafe, then it would be legally permitted to defund them for being “unqualified.” But there’s a problem with the free-choice-of-provider rationale: States can request Medicaid waivers from the federal government, requesting permission to bypass the free-choice-of-provider rule. Obviously, the Obama administration would not seriously entertain these requests. But a future Republican president would almost certainly let states like Mississippi bypass the requirement and defund Planned Parenthood.

That brings us to the second reason anti-abortion states keep losing these battles: The U.S. Constitution also provides Planned Parenthood with a strong legal defense against defunding efforts. Under the First Amendment doctrine, the government can’t deprive a group of funds just because it exercises a fundamental right that the government dislikes, or because it promotes an idea the government opposes. Federal judges in Florida and Ohio, as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, have cited a version of this “unconstitutional conditions” doctrine in blocking state efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. Each court has held that these states are trying to punish clinics for affiliating with an organization that promotes abortion rights—a penalty for speech and association that cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.Ever since his epic 19-second-long handshake with a visibly bewildered Shinzo Abe of Japan, Donald Trump’s unusual handshake style has been under the microscope.

In a drafty arena on the outskirts of Salt Lake City, near the end of a full-pads training camp practice for an expansion, eight-on-eight indoor football team, I think I may have witnessed the future of sports.

It wasn’t a 470-pound tight end with a 9-foot vertical and a 3.2 40, or a genius new spread formation that aligns the center behind the tailback. It was just a few dudes with an app and a dream who, if all goes to plan, could fuse the gap between live sports, massive multiplayer videogames, and fantasy geek analytics. They are the minds behind the Salt Lake Screaming Eagles—the newest franchise in the 10-team Indoor Football League, where tickets start at $5 and players make $250 a game—and they’re embarking on the first steps of a seasonlong experiment in what is being termed “interactive football.”

A couple weeks ago, a few rows up in the near-deserted stands of the Maverik Center—a minor-league hockey rink where the Screaming Eagles will play their home games—I watched a dozen or so nonathletic folks in jeans and parkas thumb their iPhones and Android devices. They’d been waiting for a scrimmage at the close of practice to run a live beta test, and now showtime had arrived. “OK, pick your play!” shouted a man in a hoodie sitting in the hockey penalty box, glancing at a laptop screen. Using the play-calling function on the Screaming Eagles mobile app, this test group—comprising team owners, employees, and a few pals—scrolled through diagrammed play selections, not unlike the kind you’d see while playing a Madden NFL video game. Each voted for his or her favorite run or pass.

Meanwhile, down on the sideline, the Screaming Eagles’ burly, bearded head coach stared at a separate laptop, impatiently awaiting the results. Once the leading vote-getter locked in (in this maiden effort, the winning play was a simple curl route), the coach barked the call to his quarterback as the 25-second play clock ticked. The QB broke the huddle, sprinted to the line of scrimmage, and—having been issued marching orders by the people in the seats—completed a curl to a receiver who was tackled for a short gain.

Get Slate in your inbox.

Not much to look at, footballwise. The players still seemed wary. But shouts and cheers exploded from the stands, with phones raised triumphantly in the air. Then noses immediately returned to screens. No time to gloat—the coach and QB were antsy, peering upward, waiting for the fans’ next call as the play clock ticked down again.

It didn’t take long before the Screaming Eagles offense had driven the length of the field—in the IFL, it’s just 50 yards from end zone to end zone—and punched the ball in for a touchdown. “I voted for that play!” laughed a hefty guy in a baseball hat. “That was my play!”

“You called that? Great call!” shouted one of the Screaming Eagles players, pointing up into the seats.

Sohrob Farudi, the team’s majority owner, looked on with a wide, almost disbelieving grin. “This is exactly what we wanted,” he marveled. “The players thanking the fans for calling their number! This is just how we dreamt it.”

Farudi is a 39-year-old Los Angeles entrepreneur who, back in 2011, sold a company called Flipswap that he’d built around a real-time pricing engine for used mobile phones. Although he didn’t clear enough to fulfill his childhood dream of buying the Cowboys, in 2014 he did become a minority owner of the Arena Football League’s Las Vegas Outlaws. “That was the worst experience of my life,” he says now. His six-figure investment resulted in a still-ongoing lawsuit and a bitter public feud with co-investor Vince Neil—better known as the bleach-tressed lead vocalist of hair-metal rockers Mötley Crüe. The Outlaws went kaput after a single season.

Farudi vowed to try football ownership again, but this time he had a far bolder idea in mind. He longed to wed sports with mobile technology to somehow create a team that was completely interactive—run entirely by its fans. He found a few other folks entranced by the idea, formed an ownership group, and went hunting for a team to mess with. They settled on the IFL, which had been formed in 2008, because it let them start with a blank slate by buying the right to launch an expansion franchise. And so, in October 2015, Farudi’s group plunked down the $75,000 fee. And the wackadoo experimentation began.

When Farudi said he wanted the franchise to be run entirely by its fans, he meant that he wanted the franchise to be run entirely by its fans. He started by putting the new team’s geographic location up for a vote. Both Oklahoma City and Salt Lake were viable options, he’d determined, so he put up a poll on the team’s website. Once Salt Lake won, he asked the public to bestow a nickname on the team. About 36,000 votes came in, with “Screaming Eagles” beating out options like “Teamy McTeamface” and “Spaghetti Monsters.” Farudi says he was actually disappointed in the conservatism of the online hordes. He was rooting for a more offbeat choice to win because it would garner easy publicity, plus offer early proof that he’d respect the fans’ wishes no matter how unconventional.

Farudi’s a bit unconventional himself. His main business ventures currently include a wholesale marijuana edibles startup and an outfit that sells specialty cooking charcoal to restaurants. He’s young and clever, bored by the thought of running a regular old team, and absolutely tickled by the notion of introducing something wholly new to the world of sports. Guided by his thirst for novelty, he kept pushing forward, searching for more things that fans could vote on.

This is, in essence, a melding of mind sports with live sports.

Screaming Eagles partisans chose the head coach, based on a selection of résumés and some interviews the team uploaded to YouTube. Fans chose a portion of the players on the roster, based on college stats and footage from training camp practices. For a small fee, Farudi let folks dial into a weekly conference call, giving input directly to the team’s president as “virtual general managers.”

But his driving vision has always been to let the fans call plays. Farudi didn’t want this to be a one-time gimmick, like voting on whether to receive or defer on the coin flip or letting a local celebrity call pass or run on the first snap after kickoff. He was determined to allow regular fans to choose every offensive play, in every possession, all game long. He’d also try to give them final say on any other in-game decision that could feasibly be put to a vote. Boot the next kickoff deep or attempt to onside it? Kick the extra point or go for two? Everything was fair game.

Farudi was convinced he could make it work, technologywise. Certainly the fans in the arena could watch the game live and make quick play selections on their phones, choosing between a few tailored options. In the training camp session I watched, spectators got 15 seconds to lock in their picks, which left 10 seconds on the play clock for the offense to get to the line and hike. Sure enough, after initial hiccups, the team fell into a rhythm and had little problem executing the beamed-in calls.

Streaming delays would prevent people watching a game online from voting in direct reaction to video footage. The fix for that was a quickie text readout within the mobile app—updating the current down-and-distance and time remaining—which would let fans vote without having to wait for the action to catch up on their live streams.

Until after the ball was snapped, only the Screaming Eagles coaches would be allowed to see the vote results. Otherwise an opponent’s defensive coordinator could simply look at his phone and know what play was coming. It’s true he could see which options were on the table for fans to vote on, but these would include enough variation to keep him guessing.

Perhaps the greater danger would be opposing fans hacking the process. What if they ganged up to click the Eagles into suboptimal play calls? What if they swamped the vote with demands to onside kick every time or go for a two-point conversion when a simple extra point would win the game? Farudi acknowledged there’d be no easy way to stop them. You can give the reins to the fans, but you can’t pick which fans take them.

The Eagles’ head coach, William McCarthy, won the gig with a 0.6 percentage point margin in the fan voting, mostly on the strength of a camera-ready, WWE-style personality that he unleashed in YouTube appearances. He’s a huge, bald, bearded guy, radiating toughness. Yet to watch McCarthy on the sideline is to observe a man who vacillates, moment to moment, between dictator and serf.

McCarthy’s coached for other IFL teams and various college squads, and when the team is on defense, he’s in his element. (Defensive play calls are not subject to the whims of Screaming Eagles rooters; there’s no time for fans to call defensive plays in reaction to the other team’s formation.) When his quarterback goes under center, though, he is suddenly, and very awkwardly, rendered powerless. He simply stares at a screen to see which play has been chosen, relays this info through his radio mic to the quarterback’s in-helmet earphone, and then prays that the wisdom of crowds applies to the gridiron.

The coach can tweak around the edges. For instance, were fans to call the same play three consecutive times, he might disguise it by varying the pre-snap motion of the receivers. In the final minute of the half or the game, he’s also permitted to seize control with a hurry-up offense that needn’t wait for fan input. And, before the game begins, McCarthy helps choose the fans’ menu of possible plays, in concert with the app designers and the team’s analytics chief (a former private equity analyst brought in by Farudi). Various down-and-distance situations each get buckets of plays, any of which McCarthy would theoretically be comfortable calling in that context. If he wants to make halftime adjustments after noting the other side’s weaknesses, he can ask the techies to ramp up how often fans will be offered the option of, say, a bubble screen

Still, compared with the tyrannical status enjoyed by most football head coaches, there’s a lot of passivity baked in to McCarthy’s role. And here one is tempted to muse on the risks of direct democracy and the perilous downsides of castrating expertise while empowering the unwashed masses. Because the single biggest impediment to a fan-run offense will almost certainly be the fans.

It’s a good bet that a fan collective will opt for a radically higher pass-run ratio than a professional football coach would. They’ll surely be more game to roll the dice on onside kicks and to go for two when the extra point would suffice. Sabotage by opposing fan bases could be entirely unnecessary—the Screaming Eagles fans might well sabotage themselves.

This could lead, in the end, to some interesting experiments in game theory, crowd psychology, and behavioral motivation. Suppose the team learns, through analysis of data from the first couple games, that fans are most likely to choose the play placed in the top right corner of the selection array? Would it start dropping the coach’s preferred choice in that precious on-screen real estate? If fans start voting for onside kicks all the time, the team could raise the threshold for a vote—requiring, say, 90 percent approval to attempt one. Should fans accept this? Would they rebel against these nudges? If they don’t, is the whole crux of the exercise diminished, ripping the power back out of the fans’ grip?

And what if you’re an opposing coach game planning for the Screaming Eagles? Will it be easy to analyze their tendencies, keeping spreadsheets of how fans have voted in given situations? Would you encourage your own fans to cross over and flood the ballot box?

This isn’t quite traditional sports, where coaches and athletes have autonomy. This isn’t e-sports, where gamers’ thumb dexterity determines their success inside a virtual world. This is, in essence, a melding of mind sports with live sports. From the app-wielding fan’s point of view, a Screaming Eagles football game is akin to a crowdsourced hand of poker or a committee playing one side of a chess match. The truth is, we’ve never really seen anything like this before, so we simply don’t know how it will turn out.

* * *

The Screaming Eagles’ ambitions shouldn’t obscure the reality that this is an arena-league football team, subject to the typical indignities that come with such an endeavor. The mascot wears an eagle costume copped secondhand for $2,500. The 66 yards of FieldTurf—$120,000 when bought by the now-defunct Richmond Raiders two years ago, then scooped up for $30,000 by Farudi when he needed to carpet the Maverik Center—is weirdly wrinkled in spots, bubbling up in an alarming manner. And then there’s the biggest buzzkill: For all your internet innovations, the fate of your franchise still depends on football players bashing into each other in meatspace.

This turned out to be the Screaming Eagles’ downfall on Thursday night, when they took the field for their first-ever game. Players danced onto the field to DMX’s “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem”—chosen by the fans, natch. The players had their Twitter handles sewn on the backs of their jerseys, instead of their names, because INTERACTIVE. There was a hype man who whipped the crowd into a frenzy. But once the whistle blew, things went south.

The Eagles’ initial offensive series ended with a fumble in their own end zone, recovered by the Nebraska Danger for a touchdown. I was watching the YouTube stream of the game, and the chat box got real snarky, real fast.

“That wasn’t the play I called,” typed one wag.

“I don’t remember ‘drop the ball in the end zone’ as a play option in the app,” replied another.

Facing fourth-and-15 from the Eagles’ own 1-yard line on the team’s next possession, fans voted to attempt a 57-yard field goal. Due to its low trajectory it was easily blocked and returned for a second Danger touchdown.

There were fun moments. When the Eagles scored their inaugural touchdown, spectators were invited to storm the field and participate in the post-TD celebration. Why not? They called the play. (The resulting penalty didn’t help the overall cause.)

The game ended with a score of Danger 78, Screaming Eagles + Screaming Eagles Fans 47 Like the game itself, the app experience was less than perfect. It was hard to feel directly engaged—particularly voting from a couple thousand miles away—when each play looked equally chaotic and equally likely to end in a failed quarterback scramble. That was less the fault of the fans than of the Eagles’ offensive line. Even so, voting for each play became a bit tiresome after a couple quarters. Seeing in-app updates that read, rather abruptly, “Your play won—interception,” did not ramp up my enthusiasm.

But this was one game in a long season. And it was the tentative debut for a wide-ranging new theory about how to manage a franchise. The app will improve. The Eagles’ pass protection might, too.

My bet is that this sort of interactivity will soon come to minor league baseball.



If all of Farudi’s ambitious plans come to fruition, it’s easy to imagine an array of new opportunities. Instead of the tiny, regional fan bases endemic to most second-tier athletic leagues, an interactive team might lure in sports geeks from across the country, or even around the globe. What stats-obsessed, all-22-film-watching pigskin head wouldn’t be intrigued to play offensive coordinator, analyze practice tapes, and pick which players will start and which will sit? In chat rooms, he might sway other fans to help test his theory about surprise onside kicks in the first quarter, by convincing them to vote en masse for a sneak attack right after the second offensive series.

And oh, the monetization possibilities. A fan could conceivably make in-app purchases that would inflate the value of his votes. Or he might shell out a hefty sum to call one play all by his lonesome. (For now, fans can earn Screaming Eagles “Fan IQ” points by answering trivia questions and reading news items about the team. Those with the most points will eventually be given various perks, and maybe have greater stature in the play-call voting.)

Farudi and his partners—their Santa Monica, California–based company is called Project Fanchise—have already bought another IFL team, the Colorado Crush, and are planning to make it into a second fan-run team before the season’s end. Farudi thinks he can convince every IFL team to go fan-run next year, transforming the acronym to mean Interactive Football League. He envisions it as a sports-tech playground, with sensors in the balls and cameras on the helmets.

Whatever happens with the Screaming Eagles, or the fan-dominated IFL Farudi pines for, I do think the future of sports lies in here somewhere. The early mistakes will be corrected. Someone will surely figure this out.

My bet is that this sort of interactivity will soon come to minor league baseball. The sport has lots of long breaks in the action that would make voting easy. It’s also rife with crucial yet relatively noncomplex decisions like whether to pull a pitcher or to pinch-hit for a batter. Wouldn’t you want to vote on something like that?

In reaction to President Trump’s executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the NBA has contacted the State Department to try to determine how the order could potentially impact the league.

Two NBA players — Milwaukee Bucks forward Thon Maker and Los Angeles Lakers forward Luol Deng — have Sudanese roots, and the league does a significant amount of work overseas through its Basketball Without Borders program.

“We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement Saturday night. “The NBA is a global league and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world.”

While a judge granted a request from the American Civil Liberties Union to stay the order on Saturday night, it remains to be seen if the order will wind up having an impact on either Deng or Maker as the season progresses. The Lakers have already played their one game of the season in Toronto, and given Los Angeles currently has one of the NBA’s worst records, barring a trade, it seems Deng will have no issues.

[Judge stays deportations; Trump order barring refugees, migrants from Muslim countries triggers chaos, outrage]

Milwaukee, as it happened, played in Toronto on Friday night, though Maker, who left Sudan — one of the seven countries on Trump’s list — as a small child and has an Australian passport, was able to return to the U.S. with his teammates without incident. The rookie forward started his second game of the season Saturday in an overtime loss at home to the Boston Celtics, scoring four points to go with two rebounds in 10 minutes.

“No,” Bucks Coach Jason Kidd told reporters in Milwaukee when asked if Maker had issues getting back into the country. “He’s starting. There are no issues.”

While the Bucks have now completed their regular season series in Toronto, there remains a very real possibility of the two teams meeting in the Eastern Conference playoffs, which could leave Makers’s status for future games in Toronto unclear.

Meanwhile, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, a second-year forward for the Brooklyn Nets who is Muslim, spoke out against Trump’s action before the Nets played in Minnesota on Saturday night.

“We try to teach people not to point the finger, blame a whole [group],” Hollis-Jefferson told reporters in Minneapolis before the game. “You can’t judge a whole group by one’s actions at the end of the day. And I feel like that’s not right. That’s definitely not right. You can’t speak for all Muslims, because all Muslims’ hearts aren’t like that. Most of them are pure, really believe in a different way and a different livelihood.

“I kind of feel like things could be handled differently. Me being Muslim, me knowing a lot of Muslims, it’s definitely, definitely heartbreaking to see. A lot of my college friends are Muslims, and their families are in some of those countries. Just seeing that, my heart goes out to them, how they feel about it and everything. It’s definitely a tough situation to put people in.”In the age of Trump, America’s biggest foreign creditors are suddenly having second thoughts about financing the U.S. government.

In Japan, the largest holder of Treasuries, investors culled their stakes in December by the most in almost four years, the Ministry of Finance’s most recent figures show. What’s striking is the selling has persisted at a time when going abroad has rarely been so attractive. And it’s not just the Japanese. Across the world, foreigners are pulling back from U.S. debt like never before.

From Tokyo to Beijing and London, the consensus is clear: few overseas investors want to step into the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market right now. Whether it’s the prospect of bigger deficits and more inflation under President Donald Trump or higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the world’s safest debt market seems less of a sure thing -- particularly after the upswing in yields since November. And then there is Trump’s penchant for saber rattling, which has made staying home that much easier.

“It may be more difficult than usual for Japanese to invest in Treasuries and the dollar this year because of political uncertainty,” said Kenta Inoue, chief strategist for overseas bond investments at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo. “Treasury yields may rise rapidly again in the near future, which will continue to discourage them from buying aggressively.”

Nobody is saying that foreigners will abandon Treasuries altogether. After all, they still hold $5.94 trillion, or roughly 43 percent of the U.S. government debt market. (Though that’s down from 56 percent in 2008.) A significant drawdown can harm major holders like Japan and China as much as it does the U.S.

And, of course, homegrown demand has of late been able to absorb the pickup in overseas selling. Since reaching 2.64 percent in mid-December, yields on benchmark 10-year notes have come back and are essentially flat this year. They were at 2.43 percent on Monday.

Lasting Consequences

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Nevertheless, any consistent drop-off in foreign demand could have lasting consequences on America’s ability to finance itself cheaply, particularly in light of Trump’s ambitious plans to boost infrastructure spending, cut taxes and put “America First.” The president has singled out Japan and China, the two biggest overseas creditors, as well as Germany, for devaluing their currencies to gain an unfair advantage in trade.

In December, Japanese investors reduced their investments in U.S. debt by 2.39 trillion yen ($21.3 billion) after a smaller pullback in November. While only a fraction of Japan’s $1.1 trillion of holdings, they were first the back-to-back declines since the start of 2014. China, which owns just over $1 trillion of Treasuries, has been selling since May. Its holdings are at a seven-year low.

For now, risk-averse bond buyers like Daiwa SB Investments’s Shinji Kunibe are cutting back on Treasuries, despite some clear advantages.

Like many institutional money managers that invest abroad, Kunibe, Daiwa SB’s head of fixed-income management, likes to hedge away the risk of the dollar’s ups and downs. And right now, it makes sense. After accounting for hedging costs, 10-year Treasuries yield about 0.9 percent, roughly 10 times the return offered by Japanese government bonds. Going back to the 1980s, Treasuries have rarely enjoyed such a big edge over JGBs.

However, he sees U.S. yields rising further as Trump pursues expansionary fiscal policies and takes a protectionist stance on trade.

“Yields are going to be in an uptrend,” he said.

Big Losses

And investors like Kunibe can ill-afford more losses. Last quarter, Japanese investors who hedged all their dollar exposure in Treasuries suffered a 4.7 percent loss -- the biggest in at least three decades, data from Bank of America showed. The same thing happened in Europe, where record currency-hedged losses also stung euro-based buyers.

“It was a deer in the headlights moment,” said Zoltan Pozsar, a research analyst at Credit Suisse.

Combined with the unpredictability of Trump’s tweet storms, interest-rate increases in the U.S. could further sap overseas demand. Mark Dowding, who helps oversees about $50 billion as co-head of investment-grade debt at BlueBay Asset Management in London, says the firm has already moved to insulate itself from further losses due to higher rates.

What’s more, central bankers in Japan and Europe are still experimenting with monetary policies that may benefit bond investors locally.

Right now, it’s just “much easier to stay home than go abroad,” said Shyam Rajan, Bank of America’s head of U.S. rates strategy.The Democrats and the news media have been obsessed with this Trump-Russian connection since U.S. intelligence agencies reported that the Kremlin ran an interference campaign during the 2016 election. That is not the same thing as a hack. State-funded media outlets and trolls flooded social media with propaganda. Disconcerting—yes—but, again—not a hack. Still, it’s something that’s been on every liberal’s mind: did the Trump campaign collude with Russian intelligence to screw Hillary Clinton out of the White House? Well, The New York Times had the scoop, sort of (no, not really):

Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials. American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time that they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation. But the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. At one point last summer, Mr. Trump said at a campaign event that he hoped Russian intelligence services had stolen Hillary Clinton’s emails and would make them public. The officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other associates of Mr. Trump. On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the Russian government outside of the intelligence services, the officials said. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified. So, some of the president’s aides had contact with Russian intelligence before the election—but there’s no evidence of collusion. And it’s from sources that are anonymous because the investigation itself is classified. I think it’s best to sit on this for a bit before any other conclusions are drawn. Oh, and about the dossier from the former British intelligence operative—well, it’s still unsubstantiated: As part of the inquiry, the F.B.I. is also trying to assess the credibility of information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative. The dossier contained a raft of salacious allegations about connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government. It also included unsubstantiated claims that the Russians had embarrassing videos that could be used to blackmail Mr. Trump. The F.B.I. has spent several months investigating the leads in the dossier, but has yet to confirm any of its most explosive allegations.

CNN reported a few days ago their update, which was that investigators were able to corroborate that Russian government officials spoke with other Russians, but we (the public) don’t know what they said:

None of the newly learned information relates to the salacious allegations in the dossier. Rather it relates to conversations between foreign nationals. The dossier details about a dozen conversations between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals. Sources would not confirm which specific conversations were intercepted or the content of those discussions due to the classified nature of US intelligence collection programs.

With the Michael Flynn fiasco about to embroil the Trump White House, let’s also look at another aspect that ties these two stories together: the leaks. Flynn misled the vice president and for that he needed to go. Guy wrote about the allegation that Obamaites actually had a prolonged campaign to unset Flynn due to his staunch opposition to the Iran Deal. It seems like his own conduct in this matter ended his tenure in the Trump administration, not to mention there were other principals in the Obama administration who were privy to the details that Flynn threatened to go public with—and those people, as Guy noted, have called for a tough response to Iran’s serial cheating and violation since agreeing to this shoddy agreement.

Yet, let’s get back to the leaks. Something is going on here—and everyone should be very concerned, maybe even more so that Russian election interference, at the allegations that intelligence officials who care collecting classified information are leaking it to hamstring the Trump presidency. Eli Lake of Bloomberg, who feels that Flynn was “thrown under the bus,” and Damon Linker of The Week wrote columns expressing their concern:

Via Eli Lake, who warns more heads could roll:

Normally intercepts of U.S. officials and citizens are some of the most tightly held government secrets. This is for good reason. Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do. […] Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told me Monday that he saw the leaks about Flynn's conversations with Kislyak as part of a pattern. "There does appear to be a well orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration," he said. "From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level FISA Court information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern." […] In normal times, the idea that U.S. officials entrusted with our most sensitive secrets would selectively disclose them to undermine the White House would alarm those worried about creeping authoritarianism. Imagine if intercepts of a call between Obama's incoming national security adviser and Iran's foreign minister leaked to the press before the nuclear negotiations began? The howls of indignation would be deafening. In the end, it was Trump's decision to cut Flynn loose. In doing this he caved in to his political and bureaucratic opposition. Nunes told me Monday night that this will not end well. "First it's Flynn, next it will be Kellyanne Conway, then it will be Steve Bannon, then it will be Reince Priebus," he said. Put another way, Flynn is only the appetizer. Trump is the entree.

Linker states that he’s no fan of Flynn, but this use of “weaponized spin” to manipulate public opinion by the intelligence community from documents obtained covertly is wrong:

These leaks are an enormous problem. And in a less polarized context, they would be recognized immediately for what they clearly are: an effort to manipulate public opinion for the sake of achieving a desired political outcome. It's weaponized spin. This doesn't mean the outcome was wrong. I have no interest in defending Flynn, who appears to be an atrocious manager prone to favoring absurd conspiracy theories over more traditional forms of intelligence. He is just about the last person who should be giving the president advice about foreign policy. And for all I know, Flynn did exactly what the anonymous intelligence community leakers allege — promised the Russian ambassador during the transition that the incoming Trump administration would back off on sanctions proposed by the outgoing Obama administration. […] In a liberal democracy, how things happen is often as important as what happens. Procedures matter. So do rules and public accountability. The chaotic, dysfunctional Trump White House is placing the entire system under enormous strain. That's bad. But the answer isn't to counter it with equally irregular acts of sabotage — or with a disinformation campaign waged by nameless civil servants toiling away in the surveillance state.

No one is saying leaks are abnormal. Leaks happen in every White House, but these have a special flavor to them. I agree that Flynn needed to go—but the second layer to this concerning the targeted leaking of sensitive material to claim scalps or disrupt this White House from governing is probably more worrisome than unsubstantiated dossiers and allegations of Russian hacking. We can’t verify the claims (dossier). And there is no evidence of Russian hacking, even the Obama White House accepted the results and noted that the Department of Homeland Security saw no spikes in malicious cyber activity on election night. We do, however, have evidence that someone is leaking highly sensitive intercepts to undercut this administration.

Elections have consequences. Trump won. Clinton lost. Those in the electorate and the government need to deal that there’s a new sheriff in town. If they don’t like it, well, they have to wait until 2020 to vote Mr. Trump out of office. That’s how our constitutional republic works.

Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump's embattled pick for secretary of labor, has tapped out. As it became increasingly obvious Wednesday that his nomination would die on the Senate floor, the fast food CEO withdrew himself from consideration, making him the administration's only cabinet selection to collapse in Congress so far.

Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.

Progressives are celebrating. Activists have badly wanted to derail Trump's nominees, and Puzder's public profile was especially detestable. (You almost had to wonder if our Twitter troll of a president had picked him just to antagonize fast food workers, organized labor, and feminists.) As the the chief executive of CKE Restaurants—parent of burger chains Hardee's and Carl's Jr.—Puzder argued against minimum wage increases and talked eagerly about replacing workers with kiosks. (“They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,” he once said of the machines. Classy!) A Huffington Post investigation found that Hardee's franchises were rife with wage-theft violations, which, while common in the fast food business, suggested that Puzder might not be a stickler about enforcing labor law. His company ran fratty, sexist TV spots featuring models chowing down on burgers while wearing bikinis. (“I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American.” he explained.) During their divorce in the 1980s, his ex-wife accused him of domestic abuse and appeared in disguise on Oprah to talk about her experience. (She recently recanted the allegations).

And now lefty groups are doing their version of a sack dance. My inbox is full of celebratory emails from organizations like Public Citizen, declaring “Puzder’s Withdrawal a Win for Working Families.” Even NARAL—the pro-choice group—felt compelled to tweet, showing that this isn't merely being interpreted as a win for labor, but for the broader anti-Trump #resistance.



Take note: Organizing is powerful. Resistance WORKS. ✊ Let's keep it up! #AntiLaborSecretary #Resist #JoinTheResistance pic.twitter.com/TehDMvis1g — NARAL (@NARAL) February 15, 2017

Symbolically, that may be true. But substantively, Puzder's demise may turn out to be a subtle defeat for the left.

Get Slate in your inbox.

Despite his business credentials, many conservatives have been uncomfortable with Puzder because they viewed him as soft on immigration. This is because he was, in fact, extremely soft on immigration. A vocal advocate of comprehensive reform—he loved the old Gang of 8 bill that went nowhere during the Obama administration—he was prone to waxing rhapsodical about America as the land of opportunity for those brave and determined enough to journey here. He also liked that immigrant workers at his restaurants were just thankful for “the fact that they have a job,” and weren't prone to cause trouble. He wasn't an ideal voice for America's undocumented workers by any means; advocating for immigrants so you can exploit their labor doesn't make one a great ally. But in an administration dominated by white nativists, Puzder was poised to be the only notable dove on this issue. Best yet, it was conceivable that he might exert some influence on the president, whom he had advised and fundraised for during the campaign. Both men are wealthy, outspoken businessmen with a habit of objectifying women and a love of fast food, not to mention a record of hiring immigrants. They spoke the same language.



This irked immigration hard-liners, since the Department of Labor is responsible for administering and overseeing various controversial guest worker programs. Slate's own Reihan Salam argued that Puzder was the one Cabinet nominee Republicans should absolutely vote against. Puzder ultimately tried to push back against his image as the administration's potential open-borders advocate. “My job as a business person is to maximize profits for my company, employees and shareholders,” he said in a statement. “My job as the Secretary of Labor, if confirmed, is to serve U.S. citizen workers—that is my moral and constitutional duty.“ But it didn't help matters when reports broke that Puzder had hired an undocumented maid—even though he wasn't the only Trump Cabinet pick possessing that particular trait.

In the end, Puzder's nomination seems to have been sunk by the combined weight of his flaws, but it's hard to shake the sense that immigration was the decisive issue. Two of the first Republican senators to back off of him were, notably, women—Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—who had watched footage of his ex-wife's appearance on Oprah. But other GOP members voiced concerns about his housekeeper. Meanwhile, Republicans are still standing pretty much in lockstep behind the alleged sexual predator whose ex-wife once accused him of abuse during a divorce who currently occupies the Oval Office. Given that, it seems Puzder might have survived had he hired a different cleaning lady.

Looking forward, whomever Trump picks to replace Puzder will almost certainly be just as bad on labor rights and worse on issues like immigration. One likely contender right now is Peter Kirsanow, who as a member of the National Labor Relations Board under George W. Bush had a habit of siding against workers. Kirsanow, who is black, testified before Congress that, “Not only do illegal immigrants compete for jobs with African-Americans, but that competition drives down wages for the jobs that are available.” He has other opinions that are sure to enrage the left—among them, he's a critic of affirmative action and seems to think there should be religious exemptions to rules barring discrimination against gays and lesbians. “In our constitutional order, the first reason that religious liberty takes precedence over sexual liberty is that this is enshrined in our Constitution,” he wrote last year while sitting on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.

Kirsanow may not turn out to be the nominee, but chances are whomever Trump picks will fit his profile more closely than that of an immigration-loving burger exec. Puzder's public attitudes toward workers and his alleged history of marital violence may have been loathsome. But the man still might have been the best we could expect from this administration.

Ironically, he might not have even been the nightmare on workers' rights progressives imagined. As one key Labor Department official told me: “If the staff he brought in are a reflection of the kind of Secretary he would have been, he would have been someone who could be open to reasonable labor policies.”Win McNamee/Getty Images

Ryan Murphy was unusually forthcoming about the upcoming season of American Horror Story during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live on Wednesday, announcing that the theme of the new season will in fact be the most horrifying imaginable: the 2016 election.

“Well, I don’t have a title,” Murphy began, “but the season that we begin shooting in June is going to be about the election that we just went through.” Andy Cohen, seeming a bit stunned, followed up to ask whether that means Donald Trump will be a character. “Maybe,” said Murphy.

Murphy is already getting political for season 4 of American Crime Story, which will focus on the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But American Horror Story usually plays more coy about the new season’s theme—just look at the many teasers released for season 6, Roanoke, which were a masterful exercise in misdirection. Perhaps Murphy’s revelation was fueled by the news that there’s another miniseries about the election on the way, this one from Zero Dark Thirty writer Mark Boal and producer Megan Ellison. (Or maybe he was inspired by Slate’s suggestions for who should play the members of Donald Trump’s administration.)

BEIJING — There may never be a real Trump hotel in Beijing, but a recent Chinese government ruling now means there won’t be a fake one either.

President Trump was finally given the formal legal ownership of the “TRUMP” brand to supply construction services in China this week, after a decadelong battle.

Let’s be clear: The notification was not a surprise. In fact, the decision to rule in Trump’s favor predates his election as president, and this week’s announcement was essentially a legal formality.

Nor does it seem likely that Trump will benefit financially from this decision while he remains president — in fact, the opposite could well be the case. While his organization does have long-standing plans to open hotels in China, real estate experts here say political sensitivities and the risks of upsets in the Sino-U.S. relationship mean investors will be steering well clear of his brand for the time being.

It does suggest, though, that China’s trademark laws are moving closer to international norms.

[Trump Hotels has had its eye on China — but the door hasn’t opened]

The news has also been used to reignite the debate about whether his business interests conflict with his role as president, and about whether his success in securing trademark rights violate the Constitution’s bar on receiving benefits from a foreign state.

Under Trump, U.S. relations with China have already been on something of a roller-coaster ride, with early tensions over policy toward Taiwan eased last week when Trump spoke by telephone to Chinese President Xi Jinping. The trademark case, though, appears to have proceeded independently of this process.

The decision to back Trump’s trademark claim for construction services relating to residential, business and hotel real estate was first flagged by China’s Trademark Office back in September, when a long-standing rival claim by a Chinese man called Dong Wei was invalidated.

The next step was the publication of Trump’s application for the ownership of the brand in China’s Trademark Gazette on Nov. 13, with the bureau declaring that it would be formally registered three months later if no further objections were received.

On Feb. 14 that finally happened, and Trump’s registration, lasting 10 years, was confirmed on the website of the China Trademark Office on Wednesday.

Over the past decade, Trump has lodged 126 trademark applications in China for the TRUMP name, on everything from pet-care products to computer software to lingerie to golf clubs, according to records at the Trademark Office. Some 77 have been registered, while 49 remain pending.

But there are plenty of other people out there in China who are also using the Trump name, with trademarks also registered for Trump condoms, Trump toilets, Trump pesticide and Trump paint, none bearing any direct business relation to the President.

The construction trademark registered by Dong Wei in 2006 had been a long-standing thorn in Trump’s side, and the subject of a protracted court battle and many setbacks.

But as we reported back in December, Trump’s attorneys in China insist there are sound legal reasons for their victory, lying in a provision of Chinese trademark law prohibiting the use of a public figure’s name as a trademark, as this can cause “confusion” and impact the person negatively.

In 2006, when Dong’s application was first approved, few people in China had any idea who Trump was. By 2016, Trump clearly passed the test as a public figure whose name deserved protection.

So while Trump’s newfound fame may have played an indirect influence on his September victory, there was “no direct influence from his position,” said Zhou Dandan of Unitalen Attorneys at Law in Beijing, who acted on his behalf.

“It is not possible that President Trump got favors from Chinese government,” she added.

Trump’s pending trademark claims may also benefit from a tightening of China’s trademark laws that has long been in the works, and mirrors a broader, steady improvement in the protection of intellectual property rights here.

As part of that process, the Supreme People’s Court issued guidelines in January on the handling of trademark cases specifically outlawing the use of the names of public figures in areas including politics, economy, culture and religion.

The new rules state that trademarking public figures’ names is forbidden, due to the “negative influence” on the public interest and social order that it could cause, state news agency Xinhua reported, adding the decision underlined the court’s determination to “foster an honest business environment and deal with malicious trademark infringements.”

Trump is far from the only foreign public figure to have fought trademark battles in China, a country where faking foreign brands has long been a profitable business practice.

Nevertheless, times are changing. In December, Michael Jordan won a victory of his own here, when the Supreme Court revoked the right of sportswear-maker Qiaodan Sports to use his last name written in Chinese characters, ruling that Jordan’s name is “well-recognized” here and that he should have the legal right to it.

Similarly, it would be wrong to suppose the guidelines issued in January were “tailored for Trump,” said Bao Zhongdong, a trademark infringement lawyer with the Longan Law Firm in Shanghai, explaining they had been through a long drafting and review process.

“It is not possible they were drafted, reviewed and announced just because of Trump,” he said. “It is possible that the frequency of name infringement trademark lawsuits in recent years, like Michael Jordan’s case and Trump’s case, garnered more attention and signaled the urgency for more functional legal guidelines. But the new guidelines were not determined by one or two people’s cases, no matter who they are.”

In an email to the Associated Press, Alan Garten, chief legal officer of the Trump Organization, said Trump’s trademark activity in China predates his election and added that Trump has turned management of his company over to his children and a team of executives in order to remove himself from his business and its trademark portfolio.

“The only mark we were seeking was one in the related class of construction which someone was improperly squatting on,” he wrote.

Trump has also promised that his business will do “no new deals” during his presidency.

But Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama, argued that China could use Trump’s desire to control his brand to influence policy, especially as its courts and bureaucracy reflect the will of the Communist Party.

“There can be no question that it is a terrible idea for Donald Trump to be accepting the registration of these valuable property rights from China while he’s a sitting president of the United States,” Eisen told the Associated Press. “It’s fair to conclude that this is an effort to influence Mr. Trump that is relatively inexpensive for the Chinese, potentially very valuable to him, but it could be very costly for the United States.”

Eisen is involved in a lawsuit alleging that Trump’s foreign business ties violate the Constitution. Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as “totally without merit.”

They need four seats and the presidency or five seats to win back control of the Senate and 32 seats to win back control of the House of Representatives. They only control 18 governor’s mansions. There are 31 GOP-controlled state legislatures, 11 Democratic-controlled ones, and eight are split. There are currently about 1,000 more Republican state legislators than Democratic ones.

The 2010 and 2014 midterm elections clear-cut a generation of Democratic rising stars; the Democrats’ hopes of winning the Senate hinge on a lot of old retreads coming back and riding a Democratic wave: former senator Russ Feingold in Wisconsin, former governor Ted Strickland in Ohio, former governor and senator Evan Bayh in Indiana. Democrats have to hope 2016 is an anti-incumbent year but not an anti-insider year, as the other half of their hopes hinge on House members: Tammy Duckworth running in Illinois, either Alan Grayson or Patrick Murphy in Florida, and Ann Kirkpatrick in Arizona.

“No guarantees, there never are, but the odds are more like than not that we will take back the Senate,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said at a forum sponsored by the Washington Post Thursday afternoon. Schumer will be the next majority or minority leader of the Senate Democrats, depending upon how November unfolds. He suggested that the electorate’s sense of economic gloom was actually working to his party’s advantage: “The electorate is moving in a more Democratic direction. When middle class incomes decline, people tend to move in a more progressive direction.”

Schumer’s optimism is driven more by national demographics than by the specific traits of his candidates. He contends that Millennials, or voters aged 18 to 35, will be the largest age group voting in this year’s electorate, even if they don’t turn out in massive numbers.

“The number one factor in whether we retake the Senate is whether Hillary Clinton does well, and I think she’s going to do really well,” Schumer says of his former fellow New York senator. He notes that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Senate Republicans in difficult races to localize their elections, rather than get too tied to Trump’s positions and comments and scoffs, “Sorry, Mitch, this is a national election if there ever was one.”

At least publicly, Schumer has no worries about his party’s dwindling fortunes among working-class white voters. “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.”Spencer Platt/Getty Images

In December, Masayoshi Son, the founder of Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank, met with then-President-elect Donald Trump and pledged to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 new jobs in the process—an announcement that, on the surface, was of a piece with Trump’s heartland-baiting, job-saving pageantry throughout the presidential transition.

On Tuesday, Son made a start on at least one part of his pledge. He bought … a faded hedge-fund operator?

SoftBank’s plan to buy Fortress Investment Group, a giant, once-mighty, publicly traded firm, for $3.3 billion won’t do anything for factory workers in the Midwest, obviously. Instead, it will provide some balm to the bruised egos of financial operators in midtown Manhattan. It couldn’t be a more perfect symbol of what the Trump era means for doing business.

Almost precisely a decade ago, Fortress Investment Group made a big splash by becoming the first hedge-fund management company to sell shares to the public. Fortress was a darling of the Bush-era credit boom. Thanks to its sharp elbows and smart performance, the firm had amassed $35 billion in assets. The stock offering was priced at $18.50. But such was the enthusiasm among investors—here was a chance to own a piece of a remarkably successful business!—that the stock opened at $35. Fortress’ principals, Wesley Edens and Michael Novogratz, a hard-charging, former helicopter pilot and a Goldman Sachs alum, became billionaires. The entire company was worth about $14 billion.

And then they piloted their high-flying aircraft into a wall.

In theory, hedge funds are supposed to provide noncorrelated performance—when markets crash, they’re supposed to break even, or even gain. Fortress turned out to be a leveraged play on a highly leveraged financial system. The typical way hedge funds get paid—a fixed, 1 percentage fee on the value of assets under management, and performance fees of 20 percent on the gains they manage to produce—magnifies both gains and losses. When the rolling crashes came in 2008, Fortress’ investment returns faltered, driving down the management fees it collected on a proportional basis, and wiping out the performance fees entirely.

As a result, from February 2007 to January 2009 Fortress’ stock lost a stunning 97 percent of its value—hitting a low of about $1.25. In the years since, Fortress has recovered along with the broader markets. But neither the company nor its stock has recovered its swagger. On Tuesday, before the SoftBank deal was announced, the stock was trading at $5.82. In its 10 years as a public company, Fortress’ shares fell about 80 percent, while the S&P 500 has risen more than 60 percent.

During this bull market, the company successfully raised new funds and posted some decent results. But in an age of low volatility and crowded trades, it has been hard for many hedge funds to post returns better than an investor can get by buying an index fund. Fortress looked for new angles by diversifying into private equity, bonds, real estate—all the major food groups. But the mashup has led to poor performance. And when the principals tried to make big bets, they often faltered. Novogratz, who personally oversaw $2 billion in assets, left the firm last year after getting caught on the wrong side of bets on Brazil and the Swiss Franc. As he noted: “But we have had an extremely challenging two years, and I do not believe the current environment is conducive to achieving our best results."

And while the firm manages some $70 billion in assets, it has been plagued by redemption and stagnant performance. In the 2016 third quarter, Fortress said the assets it managed on which it earned fees were down 6 percent from the year before—this at a time when markets were broadly rallying.

So why is Son interested in Fortress? Well, it does allow him to make a down payment on that commitment to invest $50 billion. But there may be deeper motives at work. Son is in the process of creating a gigantic $100 billion investment fund. SoftBank Vision Fund, backed in large part by Saudi Arabia, will be investing in technology, startups, and big companies. So in addition to gaining $70 billion in assets to manage (a business that should be profitable), Son is acquiring the services of a large number of investment professionals who could theoretically help with the new endeavor. It’s not unlike the acquihires that Silicon Valley companies often do—buying small startups for big prices so they can get access to the engineering talent. Here SoftBank is getting financial engineering talent.Immigration officials arrested an El Paso woman who alleged she was a victim of domestic abuse, according to multiple reports.

And the tip that got her arrested may have come from her alleged abuser, according to the El Paso Times.

The Times story also noted that a criminal complaint filed in district court indicated that someone with the same name as the alleged victim might have a history of deportation and domestic violence.

Officials are alarmed the case will scare undocumented immigrants from reporting crimes to police and that undocumented victims of abuse will stay in abuse.

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

“Our clients come to us at the lowest point in their lives,” El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal told the El Paso Times. “Many of them are so frightened of coming to us because of possible immigration concerns.”

Last week, ICE launched a "targeted operation" to detain several hundred undocumented immigrants across the country. An official told The Texas Tribune this past weekend that officers were looking for people who had committed crimes or did not honor a previous deportation order.

But in at least one Texas instance, an undocumented immigrant was arrested in Central Texas last week in what may be a case of mistaken identity.

"We'll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we're spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans," he added.

(CNN) Republican Sen. Rand Paul said Tuesday an investigation into the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn would be excessive and it would not make sense to investigate other Republicans.

"I think that might be excessive. It looks like the President has handled the situation, and unless there's some kind of other evidence of malfeasance, this sounds like something that was internal White House politics and it looks like the President's handled it," Paul told the "Kilmeade and Friends" radio show.

Flynn resigned Monday evening amid revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had in December with Russia's ambassador to the US about sanctions placed on Russia. Pence had defended Flynn on television and denied he discussed sanctions after initial reports of the conversations.

And while several other Republican senators have called for investigation of the incident, Paul said it would not make sense to have more investigations, especially of fellow Republicans.

12:55 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student. Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed -- did very, very well. And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.

And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved -- weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer has just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, "Never Trump." And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party, and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.

I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time -- we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.

And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we'll do some questions -- unless you have no questions. That's always a possibility.

I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.

A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it -- let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that's good. Now it means that's good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.

I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay too.

Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people -- tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.

I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic. But much of it is not -- the distortion. And we'll talk about it, and you'll be able to ask me questions about it.

But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess -- it’s a mess -- at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places -- low-pay, low-wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea -- we’ll take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.

Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders -- much of it you've covered -- to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.

We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom -- and meetings -- Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.

I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis -- he’s over there now, working very hard -- to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world. They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer. Another mess I inherited.

And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they're the world’s top sponsor of terrorism. And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now. It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.

I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I’ve had great support from the Senate. I’ve had great support from Congress generally. We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it, I talked about it at every stop. Depleted -- it’s depleted. It won’t be depleted for long.

And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.

At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders. Well, that's what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half -- strong borders. They're so surprised -- "oh, you're having strong borders." Well, that's what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.

One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lie to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.

I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before. So that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.

In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason. But a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.

I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos! Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coates whose there -- one of the most respected men of the Senate -- he can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague, highly respected -- brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it -- but waiting for approval.

So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now -- the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.

Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals -- bilateral. We’re going to have one-on-one deals.

We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit -- it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense -- and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection. It's not going to take years. But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.

We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.

We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others -- taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.

We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we’re going to have a wall that works. We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.

We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are -- release. We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And we've even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.

We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe -- including reporters safe -- and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are. I can tell you that.

Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I've heard 80 percent -- I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard -- that they're overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that and we are going further.

We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.

We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thousands and thousands of jobs -- and put new "Buy American" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen. We want them to use American steel. And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that. And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea. We put it in.

To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It's a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare -- I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our representatives are representing. So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. We're bringing our jobs back to this country big league. It's already happening, but big league.

I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson -- he's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.

Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade -- not free -- fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.

Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know -- you were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.

Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we're naming.

Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades and decades and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.

And one more thing. I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution -- highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats -- you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.

This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it -- there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week.

So we’re just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.

Mara. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.

Q Did you fire Mike Flynn?

THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who -- there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.

He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- they know nothing about it. They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news.

The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara -- and I think it’s very important -- the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s -- I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call. All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.

The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I’m saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed.

Yes, go ahead.

Q Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?

THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to be -- and he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways -- I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He’s doing the job.

You know, he was just doing his job. The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.

But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.

Yes.

Q President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story -- I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part -- I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him, ever. And he thought it was a joke.

The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia -- but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way -- who's, by the way, a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody. But everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.

So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders -- almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that's the extent.

Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there -- because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA. James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one. And he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.

And just while you're at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday. And it talked about -- you saw it, front page. So, Director of National Intelligence just put out -- acting -- a statement: “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” -- this was just given to us -- “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.”

So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal -- top -- and they just wrote the story is not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest -- because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me -- front page. Big massive story. And it was nasty.

And then they called. They said, "We never said that. We like Mr. Trump." They called up my office -- we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you -- totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And, frankly, I then went on to other things.

Go ahead.

Q Mr. President --

THE PRESIDENT: You okay?

Q I am. Just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m talking about Republican. Yes.

Q President Obama, 332. George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust --

THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told -- I was given that information. I don't know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin.

Q I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know. I was given that information. I was given -- actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?

Q You're the President.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you. That's a good answer. Yes.

Q Mr. President, thank you so much. Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn -- there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?

And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.

THE PRESIDENT: We are.

Q Can we ask what you're doing to do? And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position. So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.

As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came -- Don McGahn, White House Counsel -- and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong. He really didn't think -- it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don't see -- to me, he was doing the job.

The information was provided by -- who I don't know -- Sally Yates -- and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call -- in fact, I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.

So -- and I do -- and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.

Yes, Jon.

Q On the leaks, sir --

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.

Q Sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today --

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we're looking at it very, very seriously. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies. I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act.

You know what I say -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen. But that wasn't that important to call, it was fine. I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world -- the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important. But then I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information -- very important, very -- I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?

So I don't want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I'm dealing with Mexico. I'm dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We've got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.

Yes, Jon.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said -- you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.

So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit -- than reporters, than good reporters. It's very important to me, and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true. And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN -- it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don't watch it anymore because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's okay, Jim. It's okay, Jim. You’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.

But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be -- I think that it would actually be better.

People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter, is that one right? Because you know, I think they have lower -- I heard, lower than Congress.

But honestly, the public would appreciate it. I’d appreciate it. Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking -- some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.

And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean -- I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that’s okay. That’s fine.

But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it.

Yeah, go ahead, Jim.

Q The first part of my question on contacts. Do you definitively say that nobody --

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.

Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give -- they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates -- which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.

Can you imagine -- seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair, okay? “He should be put in the electric chair.” You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, Jon.

Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim. I’ll do you next. Yes?

Q Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to clarify one other thing.

THE PRESIDENT: Sure.

Q Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn’t. No, I didn’t.

Q (Inaudible.) (Off mic.)

THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn’t.

Q Did you fire him because (inaudible) --

THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me -- no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.

And it came out that way -- and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job. And I agreed with him. And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.

No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?

Jim.

Q Mr. President, thank you very much. And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you. If you could pass that along.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?

Q If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, not too many. We do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.

Q They're pretty good right now, actually.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead, Jim.

Q If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that at one point.

THE PRESIDENT: I was okay with it.

Q You said you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails. I’m wondering, sir, if you --

THE PRESIDENT: Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.

Q Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.

THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.

Q If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, fair question. Ready?

Q So if I may ask you that -- if I may ask a follow-up --

THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but are you -- let me do one at a time. Do you mind?

Q Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: All right. So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information.

But in one case you’re talking about classified. Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.

The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked, and terrible things came. And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things, I said -- I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page. It wasn’t even in the papers.

Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been the headline in every newspaper.

I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself. Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, "I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job"?

Q And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about -- you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there is a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the reporting is fake. Look, look --

Q And if I may ask -- I just want to ask one other question.

THE PRESIDENT: Jim, you know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t -- they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it’s true or false because they're not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.

I just see many, many untruthful things. And I tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word “tone.” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that. The tone is such hatred.

I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say “Fox & Friends” in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It’s the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets --

Q (Off mic.)

THE PRESIDENT: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.

Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off -- I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN.

I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.

Now, they’ll take this news conference. I’m actually having a very good time, okay? But they’ll take this news conference -- don't forget that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.

Q (Off mic.)

THE PRESIDENT: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure.

But I am having a good time. Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you, you're dishonest people. But -- but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves. I’m not ranting and raving.

Q If I may just --

THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.

Q One more follow-up because --

THE PRESIDENT: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter?

Q Just because of this --

THE PRESIDENT: Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down.

Q Just because of the attack --

THE PRESIDENT: We’ll get it.

Q Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir --

THE PRESIDENT: I’m changing it from fake news, though.

Q Doesn't that undermine --

THE PRESIDENT: Very fake news now. (Laughter.)

Q But aren’t you --

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.

Q Real news, Mr. President. Real news.

THE PRESIDENT: And you're not related to our new --

Q I am not related, sir, no. (Laughter.) I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.

THE PRESIDENT: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.

Q I’m sure you checked that out, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: No, I checked it. I said -- they said, no, sir. I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.

Q But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like “fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don't like?

THE PRESIDENT: I do that.

Q When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence --

THE PRESIDENT: No, I do that. No, no, I do that.

Q -- in our news media.

THE PRESIDENT: Here’s the thing.

Q Isn’t that important?

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, I understand -- and you're right about that except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed. I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter -- not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad.

And when they change it and make it really bad -- something that should be positive. Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay. They’ll even make it negative. So I understand it because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who is saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me.

Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know. But they don't believe you.

If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world -- including bad stories about me. But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN -- I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing: Chaos. There’s zero chaos. We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine. And Reince happens to be doing a good job. But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.

I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks. But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, we won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators. We got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.

And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room -- I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. They're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care. He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody -- for whatever reason. And I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair. And that's why the public sees it -- they see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart. They understand it.

Okay, yeah, go ahead.

Q We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible). But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And secondly --

THE PRESIDENT: I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public would. That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now, tomorrow you'll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. It's not terrible -- it's good.

We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It's this thing called nuclear weapons and other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton -- that was a reset. Remember? It said "reset."

Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me. Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great. That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.

Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things. I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people -- the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said, you know -- he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story. Okay? And that's a shame. Because if we could get along with Russia -- and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone -- if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.

Q Tax reform --

Q Mr. President, since you --

THE PRESIDENT: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare -- we're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like -- frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March. And after that, we're going to come up -- and we're doing very well on tax reform.

Yes.

Q Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay.

Q You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.

THE PRESIDENT: Not good.

Q There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation --

THE PRESIDENT: Not good.

Q -- of the agreement between the two countries. And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.

THE PRESIDENT: Not good.

Q I listened to you during the campaign --

THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen? It happened when -- if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States. There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the -- you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful. But I know you well enough. Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that. Look, of all --

Q I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those --

THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.

Q I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.

Go ahead.

Q How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them?

THE PRESIDENT: Just the way I said it.

Q Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?

THE PRESIDENT: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.

Yes, I think that I've already --

Q Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.

Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might, we might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.

If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I've been briefed. And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.

If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

Q So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are --

THE PRESIDENT: Who did I say is not good?

Q No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they're not good.

THE PRESIDENT: No, it's not good, but they happened.

Q But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay.

But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all the valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia. I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.

Q Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. "We are going to attack Mosul in four months." Then three months later: "We are going to attack Mosul in one month." "Next week, we are going to attack Mosul." In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things. You’re going to be surprised to hear that. And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you --

Q There will be a response?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.” I don’t have to do that.

Q There will be a -- in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?

THE PRESIDENT: I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship -- the Russian ship, as an example -- I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything. But I’m not going to tell you. Okay.

Q Thanks.

Q Can I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President -- the Trump --

THE PRESIDENT: Where are you from?

Q BBC.

THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Here’s another beauty.

Q That’s a good line. Impartial, free, and fair.

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure.

Q Mr. President --

THE PRESIDENT: Just like CNN, right?

Q Mr. President, on the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned --

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do. I do. And let me tell you about the travel --

Q Were there any mistakes in that?

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned -- again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time. A lot. We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime. But we had a bad decision. That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.

You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.

Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing -- and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones. You do agree, there are bad people out there, right? They’re not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there.

So Kelly said, you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it. I said, how about one week? He said, no good. You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in. Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.

Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.

Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.

Q Just a brief follow-up. And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce --

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.

Q Thank you. I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing -- as he should have been --

Q During the election?

THE PRESIDENT: No, no, nobody that I know of.

Q So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?

THE PRESIDENT: Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?

Q Can you just say yes or no on it?

THE PRESIDENT: Russia is a ruse. Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election -- I told you this -- and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one -- lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.

Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.

Q But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?

THE PRESIDENT: I have -- you know what, he said no. I can only tell you what he -- now, he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way -- Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.

How much longer should we stay here, folks? Five more minutes, is that okay? Five?

Q Mr. President, on national security --

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, let’s see, who’s -- I want to find a friendly reporter. Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait, wait -- watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Q So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine. And (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We have an understanding of (inaudible).

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

Q However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to --

THE PRESIDENT: You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not. It’s not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question.

So here’s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism -- the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.

Q (Inaudible.)

THE PRESIDENT: Quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something -- that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday -- did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.

So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.

Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

Q Thank you. I’m Lisa from the PBS --

THE PRESIDENT: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.

THE PRESIDENT: Good.

Q On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines? Will it be focused on specific countries?

THE PRESIDENT: It’s a very fair question.

Q And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan? Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?

THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases -- not in all cases. In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids -- I would say mostly -- they were brought here in such a way -- it's a very, very tough subject.

We are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.

But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me. Because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know, the law is rough. I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law is very rough. It's very, very rough.

As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay?

Q Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q And she does a lot of great work for the country as well. Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country? And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?

THE PRESIDENT: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very nice. Who are you with?

Q (Inaudible.)

THE PRESIDENT: Good. I'm going to start watching. Thank you very much.

Melania is terrific. She was here last night. We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans. And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding. That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center -- in other words, touring of the White House.

She, like others that she's working with, feels very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties, very, very strongly. And she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned. The things they say -- I've known her for a long time. She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- and I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.

I'd just tell you this: I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money. They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because they feel it, both of them. And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Thank you. That's a very nice question.

Go ahead.

Q Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that's okay.

Q No, it's not going to be a bad question.

THE PRESIDENT: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.

Q Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you -- you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign.

THE PRESIDENT: Fix the inner cities, yes.

Q Fixing the inner cities. What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?

THE PRESIDENT: That was very professional and very good.

Q I'm very professional.

THE PRESIDENT: We'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.

As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And, by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.

So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know it takes a long time. It's taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.

But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education. And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it. In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So we’re going to be very, very strong.

It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there -- Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell.

I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts. So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.

Q Well, when you say -- when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your --

THE PRESIDENT: Am I going include who?

Q Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as --

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting?

Q No, no, no.

THE PRESIDENT: Are they friends of yours?

Q I’m just a reporter.

THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead, set up the meeting.

Q I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now.

THE PRESIDENT: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great -- the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone. Very nice guy.

Q I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.

THE PRESIDENT: He wanted it. But we called, called, called, called -- they can’t make a meeting with him. Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him. Because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that -- some other lightweight -- he was probably told -- he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics. And that’s part of the problem of this country.

Okay, one more. Go ahead.

Q Yes, Mr. President, two questions --

THE PRESIDENT: No, no. One question. Two, we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.

Q (Inaudible) it's not about your personality or your beliefs. We’re talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name. What do you --

THE PRESIDENT: And some of it -- and can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight. No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay.

Go ahead.

Q You are the President now. What are you going to do about it?

THE PRESIDENT: Who is that? Where is that? Oh, stand up. You can --

Q What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I’m working on it. No, I’m working on it very hard.

Q Are you going to give a speech?

THE PRESIDENT: No, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama. Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided. I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.

We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions that was asked -- I thought it was a very good question -- was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education. We’re going to work on lack -- you know, we’re going to stop -- we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials. We’re going to try and stop crime. We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime.

But it’s very important to me. But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that.

I want to thank everybody very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.)

It’s Friday night again, and scientific research suggests we should brace for some unusually crazy tweets from the president of the United States. Here's some stuff to read while you wait:

Gabriel Roth Gabriel Roth is a Slate senior editor and the editorial director of Slate Plus. Follow him on Twitter.



From Slate

Jamelle Bouie points to the Trump administration’s “frighteningly coherent political ideology”: white nationalism. Also from Bouie: the Coretta Scott King letter that Elizabeth Warren attempted to read on the Senate floor cuts to the heart of the modern Republican Party.

Here’s Deadspin’s gloss on that story: "According to a report by Politico, corned-beef dirigible Donald Trump, a skill-free inheritance baby with a virtually unbroken lifelong track record of incompetence and failure, has found that running the United States government is a tougher job than lending his name to mail-order steak delivery scams run by other people.”

Very Short Q-and-A

Please welcome new Slate Plus associate editor Chau Tu! She’s answering this week’s personal question.

Slate Plus: Chau! You come to us from public radio's Science Friday, where you reported stories for the website and radio program. What is the most surprising scientific fact you learned while you were there?

Tu: One of the most useful facts I learned in my reporting at SciFri was that, despite the common presupposition, monosodium glutamate is generally not bad for you! The basic component of MSG is a naturally occurring amino acid. It seems that people think they have negative reactions to MSG based on old, bad research that doesn’t account for how we actually consume it. There’s almost never enough MSG in a meal to pose a health threat.

Thanks, Chau—welcome aboard!

And thank you for your Slate Plus membership, which makes our journalism possible. See you next week!Dear Abby: My wife and I were walking our terriers one evening when one had to answer nature's call. Being responsible dog owners, I picked up the "deposit" with a bag we carry for such occasions.

It was garbage pickup day and the neighbors' trash cans were out at the curb, so at the next house I placed the bag in the trash can. My wife, family and co-workers all think this was not appropriate — that I should have carried it home and disposed of it in our trash can.

Abby, we were 15 minutes from home, but given the choice, I would rather not carry that bag and figured a garbage bin is a garbage bin. I'll abide by your answer and admit I was wrong if you say so.

— Pooped Out in North Carolina

Dear P.O.: As long as the bag was securely sealed, I don't think adding it to someone's trash bin was a social no-no. But I do have one suggestion: Keep your water cooler conversation at a higher level and you'll get less poop from your co-workers. Your wife is another story.

Dear Abby: My 22-year-old son is involved with a 22- year-old girl who is married. He has moved in with her, her husband and their 4-year-old son. He says he's happy with the arrangement.

I have tried to accept this even though I don't approve. I don't want to alienate my son, but I see no good coming from this lifestyle. Abby, please help.

— Disgusted Mom In Henderson, Nev.

Dear Disgusted Mom: You do not have to "accept" the arrangement, and as your son's mother you are entitled to tell him you don't approve and why. But he is over 21, and some lessons have to be learned the hard way. So remain calm and bide your time because, sooner or later, the husband's tolerance will wear thin or your son will realize that he deserves to rate higher than No. 2.

Dear Abby: I have a gripe I haven't seen addressed in your column. I receive labels, free gifts and even money from charities asking for donations. Why aren't they using all that money for the charity?

I thought I'd done the right thing by sending annual contributions to one charity. Then I get frequent appeals from them that they have run into extra expenses and want more! Americans are generous people, but these groups are bleeding us dry. I'm on the verge of not contributing to any of them.

— Turned Off In Topeka

Dear Turned Off: Charities (and causes) hire specialized companies that analyze what kind of "appeals" generate the most money. They have figured out that people who receive "gifts" feel "obligated" to reciprocate — hence the labels, notepads, etc.

As to being solicited more than once a year, this is done because many people can't remember exactly when they last donated and, in my opinion, it's a way of taking advantage. That said, with the economy in the shape it's in, many charities are genuinely suffering. The need is great — so please do not stop giving altogether.

In 1985, renovators of the Treasury Building made an unexpected discovery. Behind the walls of the old office of the Treasurer, they had stumbled across the forgotten armored vault that used to guard the U.S. government's cash.

The old vault was designed in 1864 by Isaiah Rogers and employed a creative "burglar-proof" design. A double layer of large ballbearings were sandwiched between a metal housing—the theory was that an attacking drill bit would just penetrate one layer and get caught in the spinning balls. In any case, a retinue of 20 guards used to watch over the space to ensure that it never came to that.

By 1881 the Rogers vault was crammed with $1 billion in securities, $500 million in bonds and several million in gold and silver coins, as well as paintings, photographs, furniture, artwork, and other strange treasures. A pioneering female journalist named Emily Edson Briggs got a look inside in 1870 and reported on discovering several forgotten items including a bottle of rose oil (sent to Martin Van Buren by an Indian prince), hundreds of jewels, a snuff box, counterfeit coins and dies, and a hoard of Confederate currency.

The vault fell into disrepair by the turn of the century, and a Congressional inquiry blasted it as "a disgrace to the government and of such obsolete character and inferiority of construction and minimum of security as would cause them to be rejected as unfit for use by any country bank in a backwoods town." The Congressional report highlighted the Treasury guards as the vault's most effective defense.

The Rogers vault was replaced by a larger cash room in 1909 under the Treasury Department's south plaza. The newer subterranean space had double-story shelving, similar to library stacks. According to the Washington Post, the only way to get in was "by way of a tiny hydraulic elevator, which is protected by an iron door, opening almost at the elbow of the chief of the division of issues, who keeps the key in his desk."

Contemporary newspaper articles fawned over an advanced-for-the-time alarm system. The walls of the room were lined with a dense mesh of wires that, if disturbed from the outside, would send an electronic alert to a nearby guard station. The alarm would also activate if the connection between the guard post and vault were interrupted. The alarm "checked in" with the guard post every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day.

The government moved its gold and silver reserves in 1935, per the Treasury policy to move large gold deposits out of cities exposed to enemy attack. The so-called "deep storage" loot is now stored at Treasury facilities in Fort Knox, Denver, and West Point. Contrary to some conspiracy theories, we know exactly how much gold is at each location.Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images

Russell Westbrook is having one of the most extraordinary seasons of all time. As the star player on an otherwise mediocre team, the Oklahoma City Thunder point guard has accrued an absurd collection of box score numbers. Some of those stats, though, are more absurd than others. Westbrook is averaging 30.8 points per game, which is very impressive, but plenty of guards (33, to be exact) have matched that kind of production over a full season. As the main distributor on his team, he’s also piled up 10.2 assists per game. That figure is also spectacular, but far from unprecedented on its own. What makes Westbrook’s season so extraordinary are his 10.6 rebounds per game. If he finishes the year with more than 10 boards per contest, he’ll be one of only four guards to hit that mark. And if he finishes the year averaging double figures in points, assists, and rebounds, he’ll match an achievement that’s been accomplished only once before, by Oscar Robertson in the 1961–62 season.

Given the relative lack of talent around him, it would be hard to argue that Westbrook is hurting his team by averaging a triple-double. It is possible, though, that he’s padding his stats, especially his rebounds. Those rebounds are the astounding part of Westbrook’s season, the missing piece of the triple-double that guards almost never achieve. Rebounds require height, wingspan, and proximity to the basket, making them difficult for guards to haul in by comparison with their taller and more rim-adjacent counterparts. Westbrook, who is listed at 6-foot-3, defies that notion. He’s taking in 17 percent of his team’s available boards, the highest for a guard with more than 20 games played since 1971. (Next on the list: Wiley Peck of the 1979–80 San Antonio Spurs, at 15.6 percent).

It seems logical that Westbrook is grabbing more rebounds this season. Since Kevin Durant left, the Thunder has predictably fallen to sixth in the Western Conference, and Westbrook has had to play heroically to keep his team from dipping even further in the standings. But while one could imagine Westbrook making a heroic effort to supplement the rebounding abilities of his less-talented teammates, there’s little evidence that’s what’s happening. According to play-by-play data, the Thunder scoops up just more than 1 percent more of the available rebounds when Westbrook is on the floor compared with when he’s on the bench. Altogether, that amounts to an extra rebound or two per game when he’s on the court, a margin similar to what he produced last year.

Westbrook isn’t achieving his insane rebound totals at the expense of the Thunder’s opponents. He’s grabbing all those rebounds from his own teammates. As a Reddit user recently pointed out, most of the increase in Westbrook’s rebounding this season comes on uncontested defensive rebounds—those for which no opposing player makes an attempt at the ball. Westbrook leads the league in that stat, coming in ahead of big men like Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, and Hassan Whiteside.

Get Slate in your inbox.

If several Thunder players can grab the ball, why is Westbrook always the one who does? It may be a matter of scheme or coaching rather than selfishness. Whether they’ve been told to clear the runway for Westbrook or not, Westbrook’s teammates are certainly on board. “We’d rather it be him [getting the rebound],” Steven Adams told ESPN’s Royce Young earlier this year.

Might this be a smart strategic choice? Westbrook is an offensive dynamo, so getting the ball in his hands as quickly as possible could help create fast-break opportunities and open shots. The numbers, though, don’t suggest that Westbrook’s defensive boards are especially valuable. In general, we know that uncontested boards are worth about half as much to an NBA team as contested ones. With regard to Westbrook specifically, the Thunder averages 1.079 points per possession after he grabs a defensive rebound. When someone else on the team gets the rebound with Westbrook on the floor, the team gets 1.065 points per possession. That’s a difference of a little more than 1 point per 100 possessions—small enough to be inconsequential. And if you look at other indexes of offensive success (like turnovers or shooting percentage), there is no ironclad statistical evidence that Westbrook grabbing the defensive board helps the Thunder offense in any way.

Then again, there’s no sign that Westbrook’s vulturing of all those uncontested rebounds harms the team, either. Westbrook, then, is stat padding in the sense that he’s vacuuming up boards that might normally go to the team’s big men. But it’s with their permission, and it doesn’t seem to be doing any damage—if anything, it seems to help the Thunder, albeit in an extremely minimal way.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan walked a delicate line on the issue of immigration — one considerably more delicate than President-elect Donald Trump’s — during a nationally televised town hall meeting hosted by CNN on Thursday.

Confronted by an undocumented Oklahoma woman, who is protected from deportation under an Obama administration program, Ryan (R-Wis.) said he was working with Trump’s transition team to find a “good, humane solution” for the families protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said there would be no “deportation force” coming for her family.

“Do you think that I should be deported?” the woman, Angelica Villalobos, asked Ryan with her daughter at her side.

“No,” Ryan said, before Villalobos even finished her questions. “I can see that you love your daughter, that you’re a nice person that has a great future ahead of you, and I hope your future’s here.”

He gave that assurance moments after telling the mother of a police officer killed by an illegal-immigrant drunk driver that he intended to carry out Trump’s main immigration priorities areas: “deporting criminals and securing the border.”

“Are you going to stand up for America, Speaker Ryan?” asked the mother, Arizona resident Mary Ann Mendoza, after describing the threat she saw from “sanctuary cities.” The Obama administration’s policy is to pursue the deportation of illegal immigrants who commit serious crimes, and more than a half-million have been expelled since 2013, but local authorities in some cities do not actively cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Trump is promising to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and deport millions of immigrants that he says are criminals.

“He’s telling us, ‘It’s one of the top six things I want to get done in this year’s Congress,’” Ryan said of Trump’s border plans. “We said absolutely. … We support that, agree with that, and not only that, now we’re working on how to execute that in this new Congress.” He mentioned implementation of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which has been the focus of behind-the-scenes discussions on carrying out Trump’s plans for a border wall.

[Congress looks to start building a Mexican border wall within months]

Before becoming speaker, Ryan was a major proponent for a bipartisan immigration-reform deal with Democrats — one that would have beefed up border security but also given illegal immigrants, such as Villalobos, a path to legal status in the United States. Those plans generated a fierce backlash among the Republican base, who dismissed any such deal as an unfair “amnesty” for immigrants who have broken U.S. laws.

What was clear Thursday night was that although Ryan might no longer openly back a comprehensive reform deal, he would like to see the tough border measures favored by voters like Mendoza followed with a path to legal status for immigrants like Villalobos. That stands in stark contrast to Trump, who says that he plans to focus on deporting violent criminals but has not backed away from pledges to deport even law-abiding illegal immigrants.

“When people get confident in this country that our border is secured, that our laws are being enforced, then I really believe the country — all people in the country — will be in a much better position to fix these bigger, thornier problems,” Ryan told Villalobos. “But if you’re worried some deportation force is coming and knocking on your door this year, don’t worry about that.”

Ryan later returned to the notion of a deportation force: “Everybody thinks that there’s some deportation force that’s being assembled. That’s not happening; that’s not true.”

CNN host Jake Tapper noted that Trump himself has actually used the term, including in a major August policy speech that called for a “deportation task force” aimed at criminal immigrants.

“And it’s not happening,” Ryan said with an awkward laugh.

“That’s why people think it,” Tapper replied.

“And I’m here to tell you, in Congress, that’s not happening,” Ryan said.

At other points in the hour-long program, Ryan discussed Republican plans for repealing and replacing President Obama’s health-care law with a cancer patient who credits the law with saving his life. Ryan pledged to find a “better way to fix this problem” without major rate hikes. He declined to give a date for when the GOP would unveil their replacement plan, but he said it would cover individuals with preexisting conditions and allow children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26 — provisions Trump has praised.

Ryan also defended the GOP push to defund Planned Parenthood as part of a forthcoming Obamacare repeal bill, arguing that women could get care at community health centers that are eligible for federal funding and don’t perform abortions: “We don’t want to effectively commit people’s tax dollars to something they believe is morally unconscionable.”

Tapper noted that federal law already prevents taxpayer funding of abortions. Ryan said the funding is “fungible” and can indirectly support abortions — a concept that Planned Parenthood and its supporters strongly dispute.

On Monday, ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued President Donald Trump for violating the Emoluments Clause, a constitutional provision that prohibits federal officials from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever” from a foreign state without congressional approval. The clause clearly bars Trump from receiving payments from foreign governments, including from state-owned corporations. Yet Trump’s business empire, from which he refuses to divest, is continually receiving emoluments from foreign states in the form of cash, loans, licensing deals, and building permits. (In 18th-century parlance, an “emolument” was any good or service of value.) So CREW has asked U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams to rule that Trump’s acceptance of these emoluments is unconstitutional and prohibit him from taking any more.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.

Make no mistake: This suit may well fail. If it does, it could help Trump, taking emoluments off the table as grounds for impeachment and allowing his administration to dismiss the issue as fatuous harassment. Democrats would lose a potent rallying cry, and the emoluments criticism would fade from the political arena. The suit is an audacious gamble; it could certainly backfire. But even if it does, it will have a silver lining—functioning as the opening volley in a sustained assault on Trump’s unlawful conflicts of interest.

CREW’s first hurdle is the sheer novelty of its claim. The Emoluments Clause has never before been tested in court—although the legal luminaries who joined CREW’s complaint appear convinced that judicial intervention is necessary. Eminent constitutional law professors Laurence Tribe and Zephyr Teachout, as well as Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California–Irvine School of Law, are participating in the suit; so is Deepak Gupta, a Supreme Court advocate of considerable renown.

This imposing lineup of lawyers is clearly designed to send Trump the message that his conflicts of interest aren’t a frivolous distraction to be blithely waved away. The basic point, that Trump’s foreign payments present a grave constitutional concern, is clearly correct. And yet the merits of the suit itself may never be heard in Abrams’ courtroom, let alone the Supreme Court of the United States. That’s because CREW arguably lacks “standing”—a concrete and imminent injury that gives it the right to sue Trump. CREW asserts that it has standing because it investigates ethics violations, and constantly investigating Trump’s conflicts of interest will create a “drain on the organization’s resources.”

Get Slate in your inbox.

This theory rests on a 1982 Supreme Court decision called Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman that blossomed into a generous interpretation of standing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, in which Abrams’ court is located. The judge may well decide, though, that this standing claim is simply a bridge too far, in which case she would be obliged to toss out the whole case. But Joshua Matz, an associate at Robbins, Russell who contributed to the Brookings white paper on emoluments that served as a kind of rough draft to the lawsuit, told me he found the theory “compelling”—and that the courts have a duty to act.

Matz hopes that the court finds Trump in violation of the Emoluments Clause and orders him to fully divest from his business; any other result, he said, would allow the president to maintain “financial interests that inevitably blur his loyalty with regard to foreign powers.” But that leads to CREW’s second big hurdle: The courts may decide that they have no business passing judgment on the president’s conflicts of interest, maintaining that they involve an inherently political question that courts are ill-suited to decide.

But in a conversation on Monday, Tribe told me he’s optimistic that the courts won’t punt on the case.

“This is a perfect example of something where the courts are quite ready to weigh in,” he said. “It’s clear that the old approach—treating every politically sensitive question as a potential ‘political question’—is gone. Once we get to the merits, the court will not say, ‘Ah, but we can’t decide that question; it’s only for Congress to decide.’ The Constitution states very clearly that foreign emoluments are absolutely forbidden unless Congress chooses to give its consent. And Congress has not given consent.”

I asked Tribe why he chose to litigate the issue, rather than pressure Congress to impeach Trump for accepting foreign payments.

“We want Trump to have the best interests of America at stake, and there’s no way of ensuring that under the current circumstances.”

“We are a country dedicated to the rule of law,” he said, “and those who spend their lives trying to interpret and understand and enforce the law naturally look at whether this is something we can get judicial help with.”

Moreover, judicial intervention may be the fastest way to remedy an extraordinarily serious problem.

“We want Trump to have the best interests of America at stake,” Tribe said, “and there’s no way of ensuring that under the current circumstances. He has divided loyalty. Right now, every time Trump makes a decision involving any of the dozens of countries where he has hotels or other enterprises, we can’t know what motivated it. Was it a desire to have better business relations with that country? A response to how much that country greased his palm? Or a desire to do what’s best for America?”

Tribe also sees the suit as a way to educate the public about Trump’s constitutional violations.

“Litigation can help bring important principles to light,” he said. “It helps me teach my students, and it performs an educational function vis-à-vis the public. Of course, I don’t take on causes that I feel confident I will lose purely for educational purposes. But win or lose, we’re going to help educate the public on something that’s very important.”

Even if the CREW suit fails because of standing or some other hurdle, it isn’t the only group seeking to tackle Trump’s conflicts of interest in court. The American Civil Liberties Union is searching for a plaintiff to sue under the Emoluments Clause—preferably a hotel that loses foreign business to Trump’s hotel, which would make for a strong standing argument. And lawyers around the country are hatching plans to use the courts to halt Trump’s lawbreaking well beyond Emoluments Clause breaches, challenging his planned crackdown on immigrants and disturbing rejection of transparency.

As Elie Mystal has written in Above the Law, these fights are critically important, even if they ultimately prove to be futile. While a majority of congressional Democrats debate appeasing or collaborating with Trump, these lawsuits demonstrate that, in Mystal’s words, “private citizens will use what they have to frustrate the Trump regime.”Universal Pictures

Sometime in the two years between the release dates of Fifty Shades of Grey and its boneheaded sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, I forgot what the actual experience of sitting through that first movie was like. I forgot the nonsensical story, the leaden pacing, the tedium of watching Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson bloodlessly perform their synthetic lust. In my memory, Fifty Shades became a dim montage of blindfolds and bull whips, acquiring all the eroticism the movie did not have. And so I will admit that I was eager for the next installment. But as soon as Fifty Shades Darker kicked off to the opening strains of a whispery Coldplay cover, it all came flooding back. Here we are again: watching two anatomical marvels writhe meaninglessly in the moonlight, like a burlesque performed by bots.

Laura Bennett Laura Bennett is Slate’s culture editor overseeing the Slate Book Review and television coverage.

Despite having a different director—James Foley, noted schlockmeister behind such psychosexual romps as Reckless and Fear, has replaced Sam Taylor-Johnson—Fifty Shades Darker is very faithful to its predecessor’s vision. That is to say, it is another terrible movie with just the slightest whiff of self-awareness about how terrible it is. Once again, for every inventively choreographed bedroom caper, there are three that are about as sexy as a Geico ad. And though the film now has a male director instead of a female one, its gender dynamics feel directly imported from Fifty Shades of Grey. It’s another equal-opportunity objectification fest with a camera that lingers just as avidly on each of Dornan’s abs as it does on Johnson’s nipples.

But Fifty Shades Darker is distinct in a few key ways. Now gazillionaire dom Christian and plebeian sub Anastasia are in a committed relationship; in the absence of the will-they-or-won’t-they dynamic, the movie introduces clunky new obstacles like stalker submissives from Christian’s past and a creepy boss for Anastasia, who’s now an assistant at a publishing house. The best parts of the original—the piecemeal unveiling of Christian’s extravagant life, the reveal of the Red Room, the logistics of the BDSM negotiation—have been swapped out for an earnest tale of deepening mutual love that feels more far-fetched than the marriage in Chef between Jon Favreau and Sofia Vergara.

Get Slate in your inbox.

The “how” and the “why” of Christian and Anastasia’s reunion is ruthlessly dispatched, in case you even remembered that at the end of the previous movie she’d dumped him for some boring reason. Within the first 20 minutes or so of Darker, they’ve run into each other at a photo exhibition, he’s bought a bunch of photos of her face at said exhibition, they’ve had dinner, they’ve had sex, she’s stopped being mad, and they’ve embarked upon a serious monogamous partnership. As they safari through the veldt of his billionairehood, lounging in his marble penthouse and attending masquerade balls and accepting house calls from hairdressers, Anastasia persists in her project of trying to get him to open up to her.

Jamie Dornan’s Christian continues to have all the charisma of a butt plug.

To be clear, nothing in this movie makes any kind of emotional sense; there is zero narrative foreplay. Every twist and turn serves as a mere occasion to showcase the bottomless depths of Anastasia’s arousal. One sequence begins with a helicopter crash and ends moments later with Anastasia cooing “I was so scared” into Christian’s ear. His dark past—sketched via cursory flashbacks to his childhood with a drug-addicted mother—is revealed only as a pretense to make Anastasia want to bone him more. Each time he offers up a new morsel from his backstory, she gratefully straddles him.

The main problem with Fifty Shades Darker is one that afflicts Fifty Shades of Grey, too. The spectacle of kink has diminishing returns, particularly where these two are concerned. Dornan’s Christian continues to have all the charisma of a butt plug. And Anastasia, especially in light of Johnson’s considerable natural charm, is a real bummer. This movie wants to make sure we understand that she’s an independent lady who knows what she wants—we are reminded many times that she doesn’t “do as she’s told”—but in fact she always does as she’s told. Even as she eye-rolls and sasses Christian, there is no demand with which she ultimately declines to comply, from skipping out on her work trip to committing to spend her life at his side. The main difference between Anastasia and the string of dead-eyed “subs” from Christian’s past is that sometimes Anastasia says no before she says yes.Photo illustration by Slate.

President Trump’s sudden cave-in to China on Thursday reveals that, despite his reputation as a master of the deal, he knows little about bargaining with major foreign powers.

Soon after he won the election, but before he took office, Trump said that he might scuttle America’s longstanding acceptance of the “One China” policy—the recognition of the People’s Republic of China, with its capital in Beijing, as the only state to be called China. (Taiwan, which calls itself the Republic of China, could still receive defensive weapons but not otherwise be treated as an independent state.)

That was Trump’s first mistake. Any expert in the region could have told him that the Beijing government views “One China” as an existential matter, not open to discussion. When told this after the fact, Trump said—publicly—that he would use his threat as a “bargaining chip” to get better terms on trade or other issues.

This was Trump’s second mistake. If his best-seller The Art of the Deal doesn’t include a chapter titled “If You Want to Use Something as a Bargaining Chip, Don’t Say It’s a Bargaining Chip,” it’s a pretty worthless book. If the Chinese had been worried before that Trump might carry out his threat, they no longer had cause for concern. He’d pretty much winked and nudged that he was bluffing. They could stand their ground with no risk.

Get Slate in your inbox.

And so, this week, when Trump was wrapping up his phone calls with foreign leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that he would not even speak with Trump until he explicitly reaffirmed the One China policy. In response, on Thursday, Trump reaffirmed it.

It’s good that, on this point, Trump reconciled with reality. But it’s bad that, after so avidly embracing an alternative reality and making it part of a tough stance toward China generally, he dropped it so swiftly, in exchange for nothing but a presidential phone call.

Our Asia-Pacific allies were already nervous about several of Trump’s remarks, which raised doubts about his commitment to their security. Their fears were so serious—and so justified—that Secretary of Defense James Mattis flew to the region and reassured them face to face. Now Trump’s 180 on China must make them leerier still of any promises he makes or beliefs he claims to hold. It’s likely that some of these allies will soon seek separate deals with China, another large power, or among themselves: some sort of arrangement that doesn’t depend on—or, as it will turn out, benefit—the United States.

Trump campaigned on the premise that, because he’d made great deals for his real estate empire, he could also make great deals for his country. Previous presidents made “terrible” deals, he scoffed, because they didn’t understand the game; he would make great deals because he practically invented the game. A deal is a deal is a deal—that was his assumption, regardless of whether the deal is made with New York City’s Department of Buildings, some vendor on a construction project, or the People’s Republic of China. What he didn’t understand was that the game of international relations is very different: In global power politics, no outside arbiter can settle disputes, and you can’t avoid a loss by declaring bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, on Friday, as was already scheduled, Trump welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the White House, then flew with him to Florida for a weekend of golf and talks. Abe played their joint press conference shrewdly: congratulating Trump for his election victory, complimenting Trump’s golf game (and deprecating his own), and touting the many jobs created by Japanese car factories in American territory. Abe has learned what many foreign leaders have learned—that the way to deal with Trump is to act like a grateful, admiring friend. Trump wears his buttons—his need for devotion and respect—so visibly on his sleeve that almost anyone can gain favor, at least for a while, by simply pushing them ever so gently. Vladimir Putin has done this; so has Theresa May (on Barack Obama’s advice); so, in a recent phone call, did Czech President Milos Zeman—lavishing praise, telling jokes, and talking about golf so amiably that Trump pronounced him “my type of guy” and invited him to the White House. Many more leaders can be expected to emulate these tactics.Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images

Donald Trump's presidency already appears to be spiraling into an anarchic blur of leaks, lies, and Russian intrigue (Gen. Flynn, we hardly knew thee). But amid all the chaos, the White House's economic team seems to be inching toward sanity on one very important issue: how to deal with China without starting a trade war.

Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent.

During his presidential campaign, Trump frequently promised he would label the People's Republic a currency manipulator as retaliation for its predatory trade practices. This didn't make much sense, since China stopped pushing down the value of the yuan in order to boost exports a long time ago. Recently, Beijing has been busy doing the exact opposite, burning through its foreign exchange reserves in order to prevent its currency from collapsing as the economy slows and wealthy investors spirit money out of the country. As with so many things, Trump's aggrieved, jingoistic view of the world was stuck in a time warp.

Tagging China as a currency manipulator, which Trump said he would do on the first day of his term, wouldn't have had many practical consequences. But the largely symbolic gesture would still have increased tensions between the world's two most important economic powers, who will need to cooperate on matters like containing North Korea's nuclear ambitions. It would have been, you know, suboptimal.

Trump backed off his Day 1 vow shortly before inauguration. And happily, it now seems we may not be heading down that route at all. According to the Wall Street Journal, the White House's National Trade Council is eyeing a plan that would address currency manipulation generally without aiming at China specifically by deeming the practice an unfair subsidy. That will allow individual companies that feel they've been hurt as a result of currency manipulation by China, or by any other country, to bring complaints before the Commerce Department and ask for countervailing tariffs. So, if steelmaker Nucor one day decided Beijing's currency practices were giving its competition in Shenzhen an unfair edge, it could go to Washington and ask the government to slap a tariff on imported rebar and sheet metal.*

This idea has been kicking around mainstream policy circles for a while. C. Fred Bergsten and Joseph Gagnon proposed it back during 2012, for instance, in a report published by the Petersen Institute for International Economics, an old pillar of D.C.'s free trade–loving establishment. There are at least a couple reasons to like the concept.

First, it doesn't just target China. Four years ago, Bergsten and Gagnon identified more than 20 different countries they believed were guilty of currency manipulation, from European exporters like Switzerland, petro-states, and a bevy of Asian nations including South Korea and Japan. There was no reason to let them off the hook while singling out Beijing.

Second, the move wouldn't penalize China, or anybody else, for crimes that exist purely in the mind of Donald Trump. In order to win countervailing duties, companies would need to show that currency manipulation was actually happening and that their business had been harmed by it. That means, given the realities of 2017, it won't cause any pointless conflict.



“On my reading,—and I’m a hawk—there’s not much manipulation right now, and certainly not in China,” Bergsten told me, adding that it was still a worth trying to deter the practice from coming back. “It’s a good thing to put this remedy in place. But it might not lead to many actionable cases, at least in the near future.”

There are also downsides to the idea. For starters, it might not be legal. According to Bergsten, U.S. law doesn't explicitly say whether the Commerce Department is allowed to treat currency manipulation as an illegal subsidy. The World Trade Organization's rules are also murky on that point, he says, meaning the administration's new approach would likely be challenged. “If the U.S. starts doing cases of this type, it will undoubtedly be contested in front of the WTO,” Bergsten told me. At that point, the administration will have to decide whether to back off its plan or defend it.

Finally, if China ever did start manipulating the value of its currency down again, letting companies complain about it to the Commerce Department might be an inadequate response. As the 2012 report put it:

Countervailing duties offer sector-specific or microeconomic response to the across-the-board macroeconomic problem of currency manipulation. All CVDs now in force in the United States cover only $7 billion of imports, a tiny share of total trade. Hence they are less than an ideal solution.

At the moment, though, the actual modesty of this proposal is kind of comforting. Team Trump is looking for a way to make good on the president's vow to get tough on currency manipulation, real or imagined, without causing needless havoc. It's a faint and welcome sign of sanity.iStock

Are you feeling uncertain about what the future will bring?

Yeah, me too.

Are you a person with female reproductive capabilities?

Yeah, me too.

Feelings of uncertainty around health care—and particularly women’s health care—are at an all-time high. For how much longer will we have an Affordable Care Act? Will it be repealed, replaced, repaired? Maybe you won’t have health insurance next year; maybe your doctor will no longer serve your area; maybe women’s health won’t exist as a discipline. (Kidding! Probably kidding. Actually, I can’t tell anymore.)

In the months since the election, women have faced this reality and taken action, which for many has meant utilizing some of the newer birth-control methods known as Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs). These devices include IUDs and contraceptive implants; together, they’re a collection of technologically advanced, long-lasting, and incredibly effective options for the prevention of pregnancy. In part, LARCs are so successful because they remove human error from contraceptive management: Set it and forget it, so to speak, for somewhere between three and 10 years, depending on the method. They allow women to stop having to remember a pill every day or use a condom with every act of intercourse (though, of course, many still should), and because of that, LARCs have efficacy that is close to that of permanent sterilization.

Because we have good data showing increased efficacy, many doctors (including me) have been strongly encouraging our patients to consider these methods, especially in light of the, ahem, current political situation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that more women have been asking for them since election night.

I think the real reason women aren’t accepting LARCs is trust.

Some patients are thrilled to get a LARC. But here’s a surprise: Many are completely uninterested in the idea. Some are outright hostile to it. Some of that resistance is just the ick factor, or the weirdness of adding parts to your perfectly functioning body. (Though I do think the contraceptive implant, in particular, is less painful than many piercings, and far more functional. This analogy has not yet convinced anyone, but I try.)

But I think the real reason women aren’t accepting LARCs is trust. Much of the LARC discussion is predicated on the idea that patients might not have access to a doctor anytime soon. This, we are saying, might be their last chance. The major advantage of the LARC is that, in theory, if they can’t get to a doctor they still have excellent contraception. But, in point of fact, if my patients don’t have access to a doctor or coverage for birth control, then who is going to remove the damn thing?

The thing about reproductive health care is that it is complicated, and intimate, and individual. The goals of that care change with every person, and for any given person, they usually also change markedly over time. So yes: An undesired pregnancy can be a tragedy. But—and this can be hard to realize, particularly in the context of birth control—the absence of a desired pregnancy is also tragic. And creating one of those tragedies in the medical effort to prevent the other is not a great solution.

Furthermore, this opposition to LARCs may be particularly resonant for the very populations targeted for LARC use—poor women, women of color—who have historically been subjected to acts of sterilization abuse, itself a practice with roots in eugenics and much admired by the Nazis.

Some providers are attempting to address these concerns. Other providers are working to empower patients to remove their IUDs by themselves. Yes, this may sound extreme, but to give some context, IUDs get removed unintentionally all the time; some women don’t even realize it happened, and it’s not usually a traumatic experience, except for the part where they are suddenly without birth control.

I guess, then, that managing your LARC on your own could theoretically be possible. But in my opinion, the patient–self-removal of LARCs is an iffy business. For one, this requires a level of comfort with the relevant anatomy that many women are just not going to be interested in achieving. For two, although there are no studies looking at this method, there could be some complications if the IUD gets only partially removed, or gets broken in the process, making the residual removal a much larger and riskier procedure.

However, this idea is mostly terrible because of the assumptions entailed: In the richest country in the world, we’re presuming a future for these patients where they do not have access to the health care they need. We are assuming this patient might not have the ability to contact a qualified medical provider—not for LARC removal, not for LARC–related side effects, not for annual health care maintenance, not for HIV testing or chlamydia treatment or appendicitis. We are assuming she will have nothing.

That assumption is abandonment; we are presuming she is off to the wilderness. And that possibility of abandonment can poison the offer of the LARC, and of most everything else a doctor can offer. Because, really, is a prolonged undesired contraception device really that different from old-timey sterilization abuse? Those practices, in these very same populations, echo loudly, and women can hear them.

These days, when I offer my 29-year-old postpartum patient a 5-year contraceptive option, she may hear that I have something that meets her needs and helps her time her pregnancies to her desires. Or she may perceive that our medical establishment is placing a device but not making access to removal a priority—that we are willing to spend money on preventing her ability to have children now, but we soon may not be as invested in her ability to be healthy or grow her family when she wants. My patient will probably hear that she will lose any liberty to plan her future childbearing unless she can get together enough cash to come in for a LARC removal. She will probably stop listening shortly thereafter. I can’t blame her.After the Supreme Court of Washington State ruled 9-0 that a Christian florist violated anti-discrimination law when she refused to provide flower arrangements for a gay wedding, the embattled owner of Arlene’s Flowers declared that she wasn’t giving up.

Barronelle Stutzman told KIRO-TV that she’ll take her case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“It was terrifying when you think that the government is coming in and telling you what to think and what to do and what to say,” she told the station by phone after Thursday’s ruling, which included a $1,000 fine.

As TheBlaze previously reported, Stutzman was first sued in 2013 after she cited her Christian faith in declining to make floral arrangements for longtime client Robert Ingersoll‘s same-sex wedding.

Stutzman, a great-grandmother, argued that she was exercising her First Amendment rights. But the state’s high court held that her floral arrangements do not constitute protected free speech, and that providing flowers to a same-sex wedding would not serve as an endorsement of same-sex marriage.

“As Stutzman acknowledged at deposition, providing flowers for a wedding between Muslims would not necessarily constitute an endorsement of Islam, nor would providing flowers for an atheist couple endorse atheism,” the opinion said.

Stutzman’s attorney, Kristen Waggoner, had a different take on the issue.

“It’s wrong for the state to force any citizen to support a particular view about marriage or anything else against their will,” she wrote in a statement following the ruling. “Freedom of speech and religion aren’t subject to the whim of a majority; they are constitutional guarantees.”

At a press conference following the ruling, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said that under state law, a business is not required to provide a particular service, but if it does so for couples of the opposite sex, it must provide that service equally to same-sex couples. Ferguson noted that Stutzman is not currently selling wedding flowers, but if she were to resume that side of her business, she would not be allowed to sell only to heterosexual couples.

Here’s more of Stutzman’s story:

The Associated Press contributed to this story.

(H/T: Hot Air)In a rare display of unity, various media organizations in Thailand have joined ranks in opposing a government bill that threatens to further undermine press freedom in the country.

The proposed “Protection of Media Rights and Freedom, Ethics and Professional Standards” bill is drafted by the National Reform Steering Assembly. But after analyzing the content of the bill, media groups and activists have warned that it could lead to total government control of the press in the country.

The bill requires journalists to get accreditation as licensed professional media workers. A National Professional Media Council will also be established to regulate the media and receive complaints against the media. The proposed council consists of 13 members including four permanent secretaries from the finance, culture and digital economy ministries plus a representative from the office of the prime minister.

Supporters of the bill said it will promote responsible journalism, but critics denounced it for in their view institutionalizing government censorship.

The Thai army grabbed power in 2014. It vowed to restore civilian rule after it drafted a constitution which guaranteed military influence in the bureaucracy. Despite the lifting of martial law, Thai media is closely monitored by the army.

Around 30 media groups signed a statement rejecting the bill:

This goes against the intent of Constitution (passed in the referendum last August) which promotes media self-regulation without state interference. The bill in its present form will directly impact the media duty to scrutinize state power and the public right to know.

Chakkrit Permpool, former chairman of the National Press Council of Thailand, is worried that the bill could entrench dictatorship in society:

This kind of thing exists only under dictatorship governments. This is against the new constitution backed by the referendum that ensures media freedom and people's freedom of expression.

The Bangkok Post published an editorial questioning the presence of government officials in a press panel:

Government presence on a press panel and licensing of journalists are never part of a free press. The media and the public it serves are capable of continuing to reform the press, which has never stopped. New media, changing public perception and an ever-evolving society ensure that press reform will continue, and government control can in no way make it better.

Thai journalists are urging the government to reconsider the bill. They also invited the public to support the campaign on social media by posting the photo of a chained dove (see photo at the top of the post) which symbolizes the muzzling of the press.

The Southeast Asian Press Alliance also issued a statement in solidarity to the protest organized by Thai journalists:National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”

On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial. The spokesman said Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration.

Flynn’s contacts with the ambassador attracted attention within the Obama administration because of the timing. U.S. intelligence agencies were then concluding that Russia had waged a cyber campaign designed in part to help elect Trump; his senior adviser on national security matters was discussing the potential consequences for Moscow, officials said.

[FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit]

The talks were part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition, officials said. In a recent interview, Kislyak confirmed that he had communicated with Flynn by text message, by phone and in person, but declined to say whether they had discussed sanctions.

The emerging details contradict public statements by incoming senior administration officials including Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. They acknowledged only a handful of text messages and calls exchanged between Flynn and Kislyak late last year and denied that either ever raised the subject of sanctions.

“They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence said in an interview with CBS News last month, noting that he had spoken with Flynn about the matter. Pence also made a more sweeping assertion, saying there had been no contact between members of Trump’s team and Russia during the campaign. To suggest otherwise, he said, “is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”

Neither of those assertions is consistent with the fuller account of Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak provided by officials who had access to reports from U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies that routinely monitor the communications of Russian diplomats. Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.

“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time,” said a former official.

A third official put it more bluntly, saying that either Flynn had misled Pence or that Pence misspoke. An administration official stressed that Pence made his comments based on his conversation with Flynn. The sanctions in question have so far remained in place.

The nature of Flynn’s pre-inauguration message to Kislyak triggered debate among officials in the Obama administration and intelligence agencies over whether Flynn had violated a law against unauthorized citizens interfering in U.S. disputes with foreign governments, according to officials familiar with that debate. Those officials were already alarmed by what they saw as a Russian assault on the U.S. election.

U.S. officials said that seeking to build such a case against Flynn would be daunting. The law against U.S. citizens interfering in foreign diplomacy, known as the Logan Act, stems from a 1799 statute that has never been prosecuted. As a result, there is no case history to help guide authorities on when to proceed or how to secure a conviction.

Officials also cited political sensitivities. Prominent Americans in and out of government are so frequently in communication with foreign officials that singling out one individual — particularly one poised for a top White House job — would invite charges of political persecution.

Former U.S. officials also said aggressive enforcement would probably discourage appropriate contact. Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that he was in Moscow meeting with officials in the weeks leading up to Obama’s 2008 election win.

“As a former diplomat and U.S. government official, one needs to be able to have contact with foreigners to do one’s job,” McFaul said. McFaul, a Russia scholar, said he was careful never to signal pending policy changes before Obama took office.

On Wednesday, Flynn said that he first met Kislyak in 2013 when Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and made a trip to Moscow. Kislyak helped coordinate that trip, Flynn said.

Flynn said that he spoke to Kislyak on a range of subjects in late December, including arranging a call between Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Trump after the inauguration and expressing his condolences after Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated. “I called to say I couldn’t believe the murder of their ambassador,” Flynn said. Asked whether there was any mention of sanctions in his communications with Kislyak, Flynn said, “No.”

Kislyak characterized his conversations with Flynn as benign during a brief interview at a conference this month. “It’s something all diplomats do,” he said.

Kislyak said that he had been in contact with Flynn since before the election, but declined to answer questions about the subjects they discussed. Kislyak is known for his assiduous cultivation of high-level officials in Washington and was seated in the front row of then-GOP candidate Trump’s first major foreign policy speech in April of last year. The ambassador would not discuss the origin of his relationship with Flynn.

In his CBS interview, Pence said that Flynn had “been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That’s exactly what the incoming national security adviser should do.”

Official concern about Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak was heightened when Putin declared on Dec. 30 that Moscow would not retaliate after the Obama administration announced a day earlier the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies and the forced closure of Russian-owned compounds in Maryland and New York.

Instead, Putin said he would focus on “the restoration of ­Russia-United States relations” after Obama left office, and put off considering any retaliatory measures until Moscow had a chance to evaluate Trump’s policies.

Trump responded with effusive praise for Putin. “Great move on the delay,” he said in a posting to his Twitter account. “I always knew he was very smart.”

Putin’s reaction cut against a long practice of reciprocation on diplomatic expulsions, and came after his foreign minister had vowed that there would be reprisals against the United States.

Putin’s muted response — which took White House officials by surprise — raised some officials’ suspicions that Moscow may have been promised a reprieve, and triggered a search by U.S. spy agencies for clues.

“Something happened in those 24 hours” between Obama’s announcement and Putin’s response, a former senior U.S. official said. Officials began poring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications and diplomatic cables, and saw evidence that Flynn and Kislyak had communicated by text and telephone around the time of the announcement.

Trump transition officials acknowledged those contacts weeks later after they were reported in The Washington Post but denied that sanctions were discussed. Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said Jan. 13 that Flynn had “reached out to” the Russian ambassador on Christmas Day to extend holiday greetings. On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

Other officials were categorical. “I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever,” a senior transition official told The Post at the time. When Pence faced questions on television that weekend, he said “those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.”

Current and former U.S. officials said that assertion was not true.

Like Trump, Flynn has shown an affinity for Russia that is at odds with the views of most of his military and intelligence peers. Flynn raised eyebrows in 2015 when he appeared in photographs seated next to Putin at a lavish party in Moscow for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network.

In an earlier interview with The Post, Flynn acknowledged that he had been paid through his speakers bureau to give a speech at the event and defended his attendance by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels, including CNN.

[Trump adviser Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and why Russia Today is just like CNN]

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn served multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — tours in which he held a series of high-level intelligence assignments working with U.S. Special Operations forces hunting al-Qaeda operatives and Islamist militants.

Former colleagues said that narrow focus led Flynn to see the threat posed by Islamist groups as overwhelming other security concerns, including Russia’s renewed aggression. Instead, Flynn came to see America’s long-standing adversary as a potential ally against terrorist groups, and himself as being in a unique position to forge closer ties after traveling to Moscow in 2013 while serving as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Flynn has frequently boasted that he was the first DIA director to be invited into the headquarters of Russia’s military intelligence directorate, known as the GRU, although at least one of his predecessors was granted similar access. “Flynn thought he developed some rapport with the GRU chief,” a former senior U.S. military official said.

U.S. intelligence agencies say they have tied the GRU to Russia’s theft of troves of email messages from Democratic Party computer networks and accuse Moscow of then delivering those materials to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which published them in phases during the campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival.

Flynn was pushed out of the DIA job in 2014 amid concerns about his management of the sprawling agency. He became a fierce critic of the Obama administration before joining the Trump campaign last year.

Trump and Putin: A relationship where mutual admiration is headed toward reality

Trump’s national security adviser shared secrets without permission, files showRick Wilking/Reuters

It's been widely noted, in the hours since the New York Times published its explosive story about alleged pre-election contact between Trump advisers/associates and Russian intelligence operatives, that the piece seemingly contradicts another major Times story published on Oct. 31. That October article, printed amid the furor over FBI Director James Comey's announcement of a new lead in the Hillary Clinton email investigation (which ultimately amounted to nothing), was titled "Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia." Isn't it a little odd that now, in a piece called "Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence," the Times says the FBI is "sifting through" a collection of "call logs and intercepted communications," which show that "members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election"?

Well, yes. But the two stories aren't quite as distinct as it might seem. Let's look at the specific language in the October piece, written by Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers, used to describe what the FBI was looking for and had found.

"Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump’s aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate."

"Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government."

"Mr. Trump himself has not become a target. And no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia’s election operations."

Now let's look at some key lines in Tuesday's story, which is credited to Michael S. Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti, and Matt Apuzzo. (I mention the writers' names because it's conceivable that different teams of investigative reporters have different sources who might have differing opinions about the meaning of a given collection of evidence.)

"Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election."

"The intelligence agencies ... sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation."

"The officials would not disclose many details, including what was discussed on the calls, the identity of the Russian intelligence officials who participated, and how many of Mr. Trump’s advisers were talking to the Russians. It is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with Mr. Trump himself."

"The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed."

The new story adds one critical piece of information: The NSA allegedly has evidence of a number of specific conversations between Trump associates and Russian intelligence officials. Besides that, the February and October stories actually match up pretty well. Neither says that Trump himself has had contact with Russian operatives, and neither says that there's evidence that Trump associates were aware of any Russian intelligence plans to influence the U.S. election. It certainly seems suspicious that Trump's advisers would be in contact with Russian spooks, but the new piece makes clear that the Times has no evidence as of yet that those contacts constituted illegal or otherwise inappropriate coordination. Again, in October, "law enforcement officials [said] that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government," and Tuesday's story says the same, emphasis on direct.Over the next few weeks, The Atlantic will be publishing a series of responses to Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me. (An excerpt is available online.) This is the second in a series. Readers are invited to send their own responses to hello@theatlantic.com, and we will post their strongest critiques of the book and the accompanied reviews. To further encourage civil and substantive responses via email, we are closing the comments section. You can follow the whole series on Twitter at #BTWAM, or to read other responses to the book from Atlantic readers and contributors. The most obvious point of the titanic curiosity that has greeted Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me may also be its most overlooked: Across the nation, in parlors and schoolrooms, in restaurants and train stations, on television and radio, in churches and barbershops, in newspapers and on blogs, on Twitter and Facebook and nearly every other social-media platform, we are talking, all at once, finally, about a black man’s book. Not his death, thank God, or his latest film, or his hot rap record. We are talking instead about his willful and unapologetic act of grand literacy. Perhaps I’m of a generation that still takes pride in extraordinary accomplishments by black folk. And recently no accomplishment has been bigger than this: A young man who uses words to expose the extravagant hoax of whiteness has also won a hearing among some of its most stubborn beneficiaries. It is remarkable to call a spade a spade, so to speak, when it comes to white identity; it is more remarkable to be caught doing that, and to get away with it, and not just that, but to prosper in ungluing the artifice of race with a blow torch—with a relentless stream of words hot to the page, and even more, burning millions of other pages marshaled in defense of a white identity that he has just unwritten.

Of course, he isn’t the first to do this. His most obvious predecessor—one he is conscious of, one he aimed for—is James Baldwin. Some have taken offense to the comparison, proffered, mind you, by no less a literary light than the greatest living black writer, arguably the greatest ever: Toni Morrison. (Sorry Ralph Ellison acolytes, but the bar is high, and the tab is a four-book minimum; with Ellison’s single gesture of fictional literary genius, Invisible Man, he may count as Biggie, if we compare writers to rappers—and why not, in homage to Coates’ literary pedigree—but Morrison is what Lauryn Hill might have been in her world had she had Jay Z’s career). Responses to Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me

Read More When Morrison brought Coates into Baldwin’s orbit, she wasn’t suggesting that they write sentences alike; they don’t. Baldwin exults in luxurious, labyrinthine punctuation. A Venn diagram of a Baldwin paragraph reveals a sublime congestion of commas that control the velocity of meaning, and a splatter of colons, semi-colons, and dashes that support more dependent clauses than a serial monologist. Coates’ lines are cleaner, simpler, gliding on the speed of graceful modifiers and sublime analogies; he also limns his meaning with pithy bursts of self-contained description. They are both beautiful styles. What they share in common, and what I believe Morrison meant in the comparison, is a forensic, analytical, cold-eyed stare down of white moral innocence. And the concomitant insistence that we awaken from the fantasies, and swear off the myths, of the imago caucasi, the collective white imagination that has made the world, or at least this country, in its image.KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- At a hospital morgue in Malaysia's capital, the tightly guarded corpse of a middle-aged man has become the focus of a dizzying case of international intrigue involving five countries, combative North Korean diplomats and an apparently duped female assassin.

Investigators are still trying to piece together details of what appeared to be the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korea's mercurial ruler and an exiled member of the country's elite. Malaysian police said Saturday that they had arrested a fourth suspect, a 46-year-old North Korean man.

Kim, who had been estranged from his younger half sibling for years, was attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday. A rotund man in his mid-40s, he told medical workers at the airport that he had been sprayed in the face with a chemical. He grew dizzy, suffered a seizure and was dead within hours, Malaysian officials said.

Without citing much in the way of evidence, observers including South Korea pointed to the obvious culprit in Monday's attack: Kim's half brother, Kim Jong Un, who has executed or purged a slew of high-level officials since taking power in 2011.

As the rumor mill swirled, Malaysia arrested four people over the course of the week - including an Indonesian woman who told investigators she was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.

Citing information received from Malaysian authorities, Indonesian police chief Tito Karnavian said Siti Aisyah, 25, was paid to be involved in "Just for Laughs" style pranks, a reference to a popular hidden camera show. He said she and another woman performed stunts that involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," Karnavian said. "She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents."

North Korean officials made no public comments for several days, but they privately demanded custody of the body and strongly objected to an autopsy. The Malaysians went ahead with the procedure anyway, saying they were simply following procedure.

By Friday night, North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia broke his silence. At an unusual news conference, held close to midnight outside the morgue, Ambassador Kang Chol said Malaysia may be "trying to conceal something" and "colluding with hostile forces."

"We will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem," Kang said, adding that the procedure was carried out "unilaterally and excluding our attendance."

Malaysia is one of just a handful of countries to have full diplomatic ties with North Korea, with each country having an embassy in the other's capital. Malaysia has also been a key place for quiet, semi-official "track 2" diplomatic talks between North Korea and the United States.

The results of the autopsy have not been released publicly, but a Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigation said the results were inconclusive and that there was a second autopsy Friday night. He asked that his name not be used because he is not authorized to speak to the media.

But senior Malaysian police official Abdul Samah Mat denied the second autopsy had taken place. "No such thing as a second post-mortem," he said, adding that the results of the first autopsy were not yet released.

Less than a week after Kim's death, the case had already reached well beyond Malaysia to North Korea, South Korea and Indonesia, along with Macau, where Kim lived with his family, and Vietnam, which was looking into whether another of the suspects was a citizen.

Even Washington has weighed in, as the killing strengthens bipartisan calls for the U.S. to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, a designation lifted nine years ago.

The intrigue over the case raises all sorts of questions about Kim's mysterious death, but a lack of closure and a lingering sense of the unknown are not unusual when it comes to North Korea. While South Korea has blamed North Korea for a slew of notable assassinations or attempted killings in past decades, the North often denies involvement or simply doesn't comment.

The suspects in Malaysian custody are: Aisyah, the Indonesian woman; another woman, who carried Vietnamese travel documents and was seen on closed circuit television footage in a shirt with "LOL" emblazoned across the front; a man investigators said is Aisyah's boyfriend; and the North Korean man, who was arrested Friday night.

Malaysia is seeking DNA samples from Kim Jong Nam's immediate family. He is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau.

"If there is no claim by next-of-kin and upon exhausting all avenues (to obtain DNA), we will finally then hand over the body to the (North Korean) embassy," Adul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official, said Friday.

He would not say how long that process might take.

Kim Jong Nam reportedly fell out of favor in Pyongyang in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He and his younger brother have the same father, the late Kim Jong Il.

Even as diplomatic ties between Malaysia and North Korea frayed, Malaysian officials appeared to be carefully following internal protocols for issues like control of the body, analysts said.

It's likely that Malaysia is hoping that following strict procedures would keep them from antagonizing North Korea - or anyone else in the international community.

"As a very small country, Malaysia does not take sides," said Geetha Govindasamy, a senior lecturer in East Asia studies at the University of Malaya who has studied North Korean ties to Southeast Asia.

But North Korea did not appear placated by Malaysia's strict adherence to procedure. At Friday night's news conference, the ambassador accused Malaysia of "colluding with the hostile forces ... who are desperate to harm us."

Associated Press writer Tim Sullivan in New Delhi contributed to this report.McMillon would be the first African American woman to land an Oscar nomination for editing. She didn't get this far overnight.

When Joi McMillon attended the Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere of “Moonlight,” someone asked her if she was one of the film’s stars. On another occasion, she was mistaken for a costume designer. “People would say it was a compliment to me because I dressed nice,” she recalled in a recent phone interview, trailing off with a sardonic laugh that sounded like the best defense against the absurd set of assumptions that have troubled her career for years.

In fact, McMillon is one of two editors on “Moonlight,” and poised to make history as the first African-American woman ever nominated for a best editing Oscar. “Thinking about it stresses me out a bit,” McMillon said. “Whether you want it or not, the responsibility holds.”

Although “Moonlight” marks McMillon’s first feature-length editing credit, she’s hardly a newcomer to the field. She attended Florida State University with much of the team behind the film, including director Barry Jenkins, producer Adele Romanski, cinematographer James Laxton, and co-editor Nat Sanders. While Sanders forged a path as a features editor over the past decade — cutting Jenkins’ understated debut “Medicine for Melancholy” in addition to festival breakouts like “Humpday” and “Short Term 12” — McMillon found herself stuck in the role of assistant editor on the reality television shows where they both got their start. Her early credits included episodes of “Beauty and the Geek” and “The Biggest Loser.”

Although the content didn’t exactly match her sensibilities, the experience wasn’t entirely worthless. “You definitely learn time management,” McMillon said, noting that at one point she was assisting 12 editors at a time. But whenever she interviewed to edit feature-length films, she was turned down. “It was so clear she was years past being ready for the bump to be an editor,” Sanders said. He would pass her name along for jobs he was unavailable to do, but “multiple times, they said they loved her but she seemed risky,” because she’d never edited a feature before. McMillon said she wasn’t surprised.“As an assistant, you can be waiting around for a good 10 years,” she said. “The feature world is dominated by a lot of men, which is makes it that much harder.”

Eventually, McMillon made her first steps into editing features by working as an an apprentice editor to Terilyn A. Shropshire on the 2007 Don Cheadle vehicle “Talk to Me.” While the gig was a step down for someone with McMillon’s experience, it put her in the environment she sought. Working with Shropshire, one of a few successful African-American women working as editors on bigger projects, gave McMillon a chance to assess the challenges of the field “It can be a very political place, especially when it comes to what you choose to say to producers,” she said. “Terilyn just had so much knowledge about how to be diplomatic.”

Shropshire has followed the success of “Moonlight” closely — the film has made close to $13 million in theaters and emerged as one of the biggest awards season players of the fall — and spoke enthusiastically of her former disciple’s success, shrugging off the time it took her to get to this point. “It has been my experience that talent and opportunity do not always run on the same timetable,” Shropshire said. “Joi has been out there doing what she’s supposed to be doing — working the craft, honing her skills, and proving herself both as a talented storyteller and collaborator to the filmmakers who give her the opportunity.”

At first, McMillon found herself stuck in a pattern. “As a person of color, if you work on a lot of projects that predominantly feature African-American casts, you can get pigeonholed,” she said. And so it went, with McMillon barreling through nine Tyler Perry projects as an assistant editor to Maysie Hoy. Then Sanders called. He had just been hired as an editor for Mark and Jay Duplass’ HBO series “Togetherness” and wanted to bring McMillon along. She was working as an assistant editor on the series when Sanders was recruited by Jenkins for “Moonlight.” He suggested that McMillon join him.

In film school, she worked with Jenkins as a production designer on his short films and he served as the cinematographer for her thesis film, so she learned early on that he had a very precise approach to the kind of small moments that make up the textured narrative of “Moonlight.” “Barry’s perspective on filmmaking definitely makes you take chances,” McMillon said.

McMillon and Sanders spent five months working on the film, which follows an African-American boy in Miami across three chapters as he grows into a troubled young man. It was a welcome contrast to the speed of the editors’ television projects, in which they had to constantly rush to new episodes. “When you’re in television, you’re like a single parent with five children,” McMillon said. “In features, it’s like you’re co-parenting one child.”

The spellbinding quality of “Moonlight” owes much to the layering of its narrative. The story of the main character — known in childhood as “little,” as a teenager as “Chiron” and finally as “Black” in adulthood — proceeds through each section by implying the psychological anguish of the character in passing glances and awkward asides. Sanders and McMillon divided the job between the two of them, with Sanders primarily focused on the first two segments and McMillon working on the third.

That ended up being the trickiest passage to nail down. At first, the section opened with Black (Trevante Rhodes) encountering his mother (Naomie Harris) in a rehab facility with little context related to his adult life. The transition had a rushed quality. “It was too quick to go right into this scene with a newly bulked-up Chiron,” Sanders said. “You’re not ready to be emotionally engaged with him.” It became McMillon’s job to convince Jenkins that the passage needed a more gradual opening, beginning with Chiron’s life as a drug dealer and working its way up to the compassionate encounter with his mother. At first, Jenkins rejected the idea, but with time he warmed up to it. “As we found a place for everything, it became organic,” she said.

The editors were committed to finding cinematic devices to complement Jenkins’ ambitious storytelling approach, a mentality that the group has jokingly called “The Bandry Rule” since film school. The label goes back to a film class when one of their professors meant to encourage students to “expand the boundaries of cinema” and flubbed the line, instead saying they should “expound the bandries of cinema.”

In addition to inspiring Jenkins’ Twitter handle, the term gave them a playful shorthand in the editing room. “Barry’s really focused on what life feels like,” Sanders said, referring to meaningful cutaways such a hand sifting through sand at the beach and Chiron’s mother moving in slo-mo through a courtyard as moments that Jenkins would say “needed to be more Bandry.”

The editors often accentuated Jenkins’ style by toying with the sound design and introducing abrupt cuts to black, but they were careful not to interrupt the elegant camera movement. “When you get such beautiful footage, you have to treat it like another performance,” Sanders said. McMillon was particularly attentive to the nuances of the performances in the third chapter, when Holland’s character Kevin and Chiron see each other for the first time in years at the cafe where Kevin works. “As an editor, you have to pay attention to the little gifts the actors give you,” she said. “Trevante gives this little jump when Andre speaks to him. I knew I had to preserve that.”

Even as she’s on the campaign trail for “Moonlight,” McMillon has moved forward with her career, having edited writer-director Janicza Bravo’s debut “Lemon,” which premieres at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. She’s also advising a pair of college-aged editors and expressed a desire to keep pushing for more diversity in the editing room. “The reason this hasn’t happened before is that a lot of times people don’t know what an editor does,” she said. “There’s a lack of exposure to this job for kids who don’t come from a well-to-do background.”

A24

In that regard, “Moonlight” provides the ideal platform for McMillon to assess the setbacks she’s faced. The movie explicitly deals with frustrations of black life in America and the ways those feelings can impact motivation. “It’s a bummer, but it’s the nature of the industry,” McMillon said. “I definitely want to get more involved.”

McMillon may have a clear understanding of the challenges she’s faced over the years, but she’s not alone. When asked why it took the editor so long to crack the field of features, Shropshire had a pointed response. “It’s a question better asked of filmmakers who choose their creative teams,” she said. “The talent is most definitely out there, and the discovery goes beyond the IMDb page. I am beyond proud of her.”“A president-elect is not an official of the United States,” Mr. Tribe said. “There is no reason why the Logan Act would not apply to the president-elect since it applies to all private citizens, and the people working on the transition are all working in a private-citizen capacity. They have not taken the oath, so they are covered by the act — to the extent that matters.”

What is the history of prosecuting people under the Logan Act?

The Logan Act appears to be a so-called dead letter, meaning a law that remains technically on the books but is essentially defunct or toothless.

A study by the Congressional Research Service in 2015 said nobody has ever been prosecuted under the statute and identified only one instance of an indictment under the law: in 1803, the United States attorney in Kentucky obtained from a grand jury an indictment of a Kentucky farmer who had written an article in support of creating a separate nation in the territory west of the fledgling United States that would be an ally to France. But the prosecutor dropped the case. A recent draft scholarly paper posted online by a Federal Appeals Court law clerk identified a second apparent such indictment, involving the reported arrest in 1852 of a man who wrote a letter to the president of Mexico.

Legal scholars have also raised questions about whether the act violates First Amendment free speech protections, although Mr. Tribe said he believed it would be constitutional if applied narrowly to core diplomatic negotiations with another government.

How has the Logan Act been used?

The Logan Act has functioned primarily as rhetorical ammunition for the party that holds the White House during partisan disputes over a foreign policy matter. When White House opponents, usually in Congress, encroach on diplomatic matters, invoking the Logan Act enables the pro-White House party to denounce the other side as not just wrongheaded but lawbreakers.

During the Reagan administration, for example, the Democratic speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, tried to help develop a peace deal in Nicaragua by interacting directly with its president, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, even as the Reagan administration took a harder line and supported overthrowing the Sandinista government. Similarly, during the Obama administration, 47 Republican senators signed a letter to the government of Iran warning the ayatollahs that President Obama’s successor might not follow through on promises Mr. Obama was making as part of negotiations over a deal to end Iran’s nuclear program. During such debates, some White House defenders portrayed the congressional opposition as having violated the Logan Act.

Does that mean Mr. Flynn is not in any realistic legal trouble?

Given its history, it seems highly unlikely that the Justice Department under Mr. Trump will try to prosecute Mr. Flynn for violating the Logan Act. However, that would not rule out other legal problems.

For example, if it turns out that Mr. Flynn made a false statement not just to Mr. Pence but also to F.B.I. agents about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, that could be a separate offense for which there is a history of prosecuting high-level officials. Most recently, late in the Obama administration, former Gen. James Cartwright pleaded guilty to making false statements to F.B.I. agents investigating a leak about cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Obama pardoned him before leaving office.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently denied that his company is a media company, which no doubt came as a surprise to many people who have gotten used to thinking of it that way. "No, we are a tech company, not a media company," he said during an event in Rome.

But is that description accurate? Not really.

Zuckerberg may not want to admit it, but Facebook is one of the largest and most powerful media companies in the world, and getting larger. He said the company he co-founded isn't a media company because "we do not produce any content." Instead, it just builds tools that let users interact with each other, which includes sharing news, he said.

But is creating content the best way to define whether a company is a media company? Not even close. To take just one recent example, The Huffington Post didn't create much of its own content in the early days, before it hired a reporting staff. Users created blog posts and HuffPo distributed and made money from them via advertising.

Despite that, the Huffington Post was clearly a media company. In the same way, Facebook ( fb ) takes advantage of content created by its users—users who in many cases are publishers and news outlets. It distributes that content and makes money from it through advertising.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter.

In the current media landscape, control over distribution has become almost as important as the actual creation of content, and that has given Facebook a huge amount of power.

Most of that power is expressed through the company's control over its news-feed algorithm, which ultimately determines what content gets shown to which users. With more than 1.5 billion users, a single algorithm tweak can make the difference between success and failure for a publisher.

it doesn't matter whether Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook is a media company or not. It is taking over functions of media companies - emily bell (@emilybell) August 30, 2016

As a number of observers have pointed out in the wake of Facebook's recent changes to its "trending topics" feature, the choices that are made via the algorithm are fundamentally editorial—what to show and what to hide, what to make more prominent and what to make less prominent. That's what news organizations used to do.

Not only that, but Facebook is paying publishers and celebrities an estimated $50 million this year to produce video for its platform, which also clearly makes it a media company.

The social network may argue that it doesn't tell its publishing partners what they should be creating for that money, but the fact that it is pushing video—and that its algorithm clearly favors certain kinds of video content over other kinds—helps determine what gets promoted.

Does Facebook need humans to decide what's trending? Watch:

Despite this, Facebook has consistently refused to admit that it has any journalistic responsibilities. Its argument continues to be that the algorithm is simply a reflection of its users' desires, as though algorithms aren't created by human beings.

There are a couple of reasons why Facebook is so adamant that it is a tech company and not a media company. One is the risk that it might be forced to pay more attention to issues like free speech and censorship and journalistic integrity than it really wants to, which would be a huge hassle.

Tech has stellar valuations. Tech disrupted media model. This is why no co wants to be called media. And media sometimes position as tech. - Jason Hirschhorn (@JasonHirschhorn) August 30, 2016

Another reason is that tech companies are valued much more highly by investors than media companies, which also helps explain why some media startups, including BuzzFeed, have also tried to argue that they are tech companies. But just saying it doesn't make it true.White House Press secretary Sean Spicer points as he answers questions from members of the media, seen reflected in an exit sign, during the daily briefing. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

President Trump’s ouster of national security adviser Michael Flynn, and the circumstances leading up to it, have quickly become a major crisis for the fledgling administration, forcing the White House on the defensive and precipitating the first significant breach in relations between Trump and an increasingly restive Republican Congress.

Even as the White House described Trump’s “immediate, decisive” action in demanding ­Flynn’s resignation late Monday as the end of an unfortunate episode, senior GOP lawmakers were buckling under growing pressure to investigate it.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that it was “highly likely” that the events leading to Flynn’s departure would be added to a broader probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Intercepts showed that Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions in a phone call with the Russian ambassador — a conversation topic that Flynn first denied and then later said he could not recall.

McConnell’s comments followed White House revelations that Trump was aware “for weeks” that Flynn had misled Vice President Pence and others about the content of his late-December talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

White House counsel Donald F. McGahn told Trump in a briefing late last month that Flynn, despite his claims to the contrary, had discussed U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration in late December, press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. That briefing, he said, came “immediately” after Sally Q. Yates, then the acting attorney general, informed McGahn on Jan. 26 about discrepancies between intercepts of Kislyak’s phone calls and public statements by Pence and others that there had been no discussion of sanctions.

(Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)

Trump brought in senior strategist Stephen K. Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to join the discussion with McGahn, according to two officials familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

McGahn then conferred with Yates again the following day, Jan. 27, to try to glean more information, these two officials said. Within the White House, the matter was viewed skeptically, and Trump, Bannon, Priebus and McGahn for several days remained among the few people briefed, they said.

Over the next two weeks, the officials said, Flynn was asked multiple times about what exactly he had said. He brushed aside the suggestion that he had spoken about sanctions with the ambassador — denials that kept him afloat within the White House even as he was being actively evaluated, they said.

It was not until a Washington Post report last Thursday, in which Flynn was quoted as saying that he had no “recollection” of discussing sanctions but couldn’t be sure that he hadn’t, that the downward slide culminating in Monday’s forced resignation began, several administration officials said.

“We’ve been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth,” Spicer said at the daily White House press briefing. He emphasized that an internal White House inquiry had concluded that nothing Flynn discussed with the Russian was illegal but that he had “broken trust” with Trump by not telling the truth about the talks.

When asked whether Trump told Flynn to talk to Kislyak about sanctions, Spicer responded: “No, absolutely not.”

Asked why Trump had waited nearly three weeks to act after what Spicer called a “heads-up” from the Justice Department, he said that once the question of legality was settled, “then it became a phase of determining whether or not [Flynn’s] action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined” Trump’s trust. He declined to specify the “other issues.”

In an interview conducted early Monday and published Tuesday by the Daily Caller, Flynn said that he did not specifically discuss sanctions with Kislyak but rather President Barack Obama’s simultaneous expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. He said he told the ambassador that “we’ll review everything” following Trump’s inauguration.

Current and former U.S. officials have said, however, that much of the conversation was about sanctions and that Flynn suggested that Moscow not respond in kind to the expulsions — advice that Russian President Vladi­mir Putin took in declining to take retaliatory action.

Although Trump has not publicly mentioned his view of the sanctions, Spicer said that the president “has made it very clear he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea,” even as he hopes to cooperate with Putin on terrorism.

Asked Tuesday on a flight to Brussels about Flynn’s ouster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it “has no impact” on his job. “It doesn’t change my message at all, and who is on the president’s staff is who I will work with,” he said.

Mattis was on his way to a meeting of NATO defense ministers, who were expected to discuss their significant concerns about Russian aggression. During his confirmation hearing, Mattis placed Russia first among threats to U.S. security.

Officials inside the National Security Council described low morale and concern about the future. The “worthless” message at a five-minute staff meeting Tuesday morning, one official said, was: “Keep working hard. Don’t leave.”

For those who knew and liked Flynn, another official said, “it’s sad. He’s a good man, and I hate to see this.”

Various accounts of the Flynn saga offered by White House officials in recent days have added to confusion about how the administration viewed Flynn’s actions, who knew what and when they knew it.

News accounts about a Flynn-Kislyak conversation in late December — the day before Obama announced new sanctions related to Russian election interference — first surfaced in a David Ignatius column in The Post on Jan. 12. Asked the next day whether they had talked about the sanctions in light of Trump’s campaign and post-election pledges to better relations with Russia, White House officials said the subject had not been discussed.

Three days later, Pence told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Flynn had assured him personally that there was no conversation about sanctions. Spicer offered similar assurances in a subsequent White House briefing.

On Jan. 24 or 25, based on discrepancies between comments by Pence and Spicer and what they knew from regular intercepts of Kislyak’s calls, FBI agents interviewed Flynn. Details of that interview, first reported Tuesday by the New York Times, are unknown but they could expose Flynn to possible charges if he denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. That interview was followed by the Justice notice to McGahn, who immediately informed Trump and others, officials said.

After Trump ordered McGahn to review the matter, Spicer said, he quickly concluded that the president’s “instinctive” conclusion that the discussions were not illegal was correct. But some in the White House who had long distrusted Flynn began to contemplate his departure. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Keith Kellogg, the National Security Council chief of staff, began attending intelligence briefings with Flynn.

“The president was sort of like: Until this matter is sorted out, I want buttressing,” said the senior official, one of several who discussed the sensitive matter on the condition of anonymity. “The idea was . . . if the president decides to pull the trigger, we need to make sure that we have some options.”

Flynn was eventually made aware of the White House investigation, which led to alarm among senior Trump aides when he initially told The Post, in a Feb. 8 interview, that there had been no discussion about sanctions. He revised his remarks to the paper the next day, saying through a spokesman that “while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.”

The two accounts were published by The Post on the evening of Feb. 9.

“His story remained the same until that night,” Spicer told reporters in his office Tuesday evening. “There was a story in The Post where there’s a White House official that says that he could not recall. . . . Whatever that quote was is what matters. . . . His story remained the same until that night.”

Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told reporters that the vice president first became aware of the “incomplete information” Flynn had provided him by reading the same newspaper account.

[Pence did not learn that Flynn misled him on Russia until last week]

Flynn was then questioned by McGahn, Pence and Priebus, who the official said was so frustrated that his tone became more that of a litigator than a colleague.

Asked Friday aboard Air Force One about the Post reporting that Flynn allegedly had not told the truth about the calls, Trump said he was not familiar with it.

“I don’t know about that. I haven’t seen it. What report is that? I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that,” Trump told reporters on the plane.

Spicer said Tuesday that Trump was responding only to a question about the Post report and was not speaking about the overall issue of Flynn’s contact with the Russian ambassador and his discussion of sanctions.

After discussing the situation throughout the weekend at Trump’s Florida resort, a final decision was made Monday night by Trump, along with Priebus and senior advisers Bannon and Jared Kushner, to tell Flynn to resign, officials said.

That is a notably different version of events than the one offered Monday night, when administration officials characterized Flynn’s departure as voluntary. One senior White House official said Monday that Trump had not fired Flynn but that he had made the decision to resign on his own because of “the cumulative effect” of damaging news coverage.

A hearing in the El Paso County went from ordinary to “unprecedented” last week when half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at a courthouse where an undocumented woman was seeking a protective order against the boyfriend she accused of abusing her.

Watchdog: US has no way to measure border wall effectiveness

Trump weighed National Guard troops for immigration roundups The woman, a citizen of Mexico who was living in El Paso, Texas, had been driven to the courthouse by a victim’s advocate from the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence, a shelter for victims of domestic abuse where she had been living.

She left under arrest.

“This is really unprecedented,” El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal told The Washington Post.

It was the first time in her 23 years at the courthouse, Bernal said, that she can remember ICE agents making their presence known during a protective order hearing. The agents had come to stake out the woman, identified by her initials I.E.G., because, Bernal speculates, they likely received a tip from the only other person who knew the time and place of the hearing – the woman’s alleged abuser.

The woman had a prior criminal record and had been previously deported, but, according to Bernal, had no current outstanding state warrants.

“It really was a stunning event,” Bernal said. “It has an incredible chilling effect for all undocumented victims of any crime in our community.”

It is county policy not to ask about citizen status, Bernal said, because officials want to make clear that all victims of crime in El Paso are entitled to the same protections within the criminal justice system.

The arrest of the domestic violence complainant comes at a time of considerable unrest and anxiety within the immigrant community nationwide as President Trump begins to make good on the strict immigration policies that defined his campaign. Since taking office just four weeks ago, Trump has threatened to cut off federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities and, he says, started the planning process for his Mexican border wall.

Already the policies have led to the deportation of an undocumented mother from Arizona who, rather than dodge her check-in with immigration officials, dutifully went and was detained. In Seattle, a 23-year-old man who had been living legally in the U.S. under the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was arrested and detained last week by ICE officials who claimed he was a gang member, something his lawyers deny.

And in Denver, an undocumented mother of four who had been living in the U.S. for 20 years sought refuge in the basement of a church this week rather than check-in with authorities, for fear she too would be deported.

In El Paso, Bernal said her office, which prosecutes criminal cases and represents alleged victims of domestic violence, like I.E.G., has felt the weight of this policy shift in recent weeks. Call volume has increased from concerned El Paso residents, she said, who have reported checkpoints in certain parts of town and the appearance of ICE agents at routine traffic stops.

What concerns her and other local officials most of all, though, is how last week’s courthouse incident could have a greater impact on the way crime is – or isn’t – reported within the immigrant community.

“An incident like what happened in the courthouse last week really puts fear in people,” Bernal said. “One of the things that really worries me is that it only takes one isolated incident like this.”

Whether the courthouse stakeout was indeed an isolated incident remains unclear. An ICE spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday in response to questions from El Paso Times reporter Marty Schladen, who first wrote about the case.

Bernal is trying to mitigate the situation and ease anxiety, she told The Post, by reaching out to Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, an El Paso native. The county attorney asked Beto Wednesday to set up a meeting with her office and the local ICE director to get “assurance from ICE that this is an isolated incident and that this isn’t going to happen again,” Bernal said.

After the courthouse incident last week, Bernal’s office launched an investigation, which unearthed a narrative of the day’s events that differs from the one outlined in court documents filed by ICE.

Based on eyewitness accounts from several attorneys in Bernal’s office, the judge who granted the undocumented woman’s protective order and the victim’s advocate assisting her, there were six ICE agents inside the courthouse that day – one inside the courtroom and others standing by the door and stairwells. They escorted her down the hallway, into the elevator and outside the building, where they detained her, Bernal said.

The narrative of the ICE affidavit, however, does not mention any contact inside the courthouse or the courtroom.

The affidavit claims that agents were “conducting surveillance” at the courthouse “in attempts of seeing” the woman. At 9:30 a.m., the affidavit says, agents saw the woman “exiting the El Paso County Courthouse and proceeded to walk along the side walk on San Antonio Avenue.” Agents identified themselves and questioned I.E.G., who admitted to being a Mexican citizen who was in the U.S. without legal status.

According to the affidavit, I.E.G. has a criminal and immigration history that dates back to 2010 and includes numerous deportations and arrests for assault, violating probation, domestic violence, false imprisonment and possession of stolen mail.

Even so, Bernal said “it’s hard to imagine how they would justify the rationale” for staking out a courtroom that deals in granting protective orders.

“If that person was that dangerous, state law enforcement would have been looking for her,” Bernal said. “It doesn’t make sense why the resources would be used to go after a victims of domestic abuse . . . it seems to be they are continuing to victimize our client.”Liberty Maniacs

Donald Trump, sporting a bald eagle combover of freedom. The Donald announced his candidacy for President in 2016, and American can't help but get FIRED up! We Shall Overcomb!



A classic tee that has a light feel. Made of 100% ring-spun cotton. This bad boy will last. It's Pre-shrunk, with shoulder-to-shoulder tape, double-needle sleeve and bottom hemmed for lasting toughness, but doesn't feel like your wearing a blanket. The cut is contemporary, and called a fashion tubular construction. So it will show off your chest and shoulders in just the right way. But this also means that if you like a more relaxed feel you should order a size up.



Ladies can wear these as well as they're unisex, but be mindful that they aren't women's cut, so they will drape differently than form fitting women's versions of this shirt which we also carry.

In the wake of Donald Trump’s election as president, Facebook has taken justifiable heat for its role in spreading misinformation and propaganda about the candidates. In particular, its news feed algorithm fueled a cottage industry of fake and intentionally misleading “news” that skewed heavily anti–Hillary Clinton and pro-Trump, according to a BuzzFeed analysis. These falsehoods attracted far more user engagement, on average, than true stories from the same outlets and drowned out earnest attempts by dedicated fact-checking sites such as Snopes to debunk them.

This should not surprise anyone who understands how Facebook works. People tend to read, like, and share stories that appeal to their emotions and play to their existing beliefs. Without robust countervailing forces favoring credibility and accuracy, Facebook’s news feed algorithm is bound to spread lies, especially those that serve to bolster people’s preconceived biases. And these falsehoods are bound to influence people’s thinking.

And yet, in the days following the election, as criticisms of the company mounted, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplayed and denied the issue—a defensiveness that says even more about the company than the fake news scandal itself. Zuckerberg’s response points to a problem deeper than any bogus story, one that won’t be fixed by cutting some shady websites out of its advertising network. The problem is Facebook’s refusal to own up to its increasingly dominant role in the news media. It’s one that is unlikely to go away, even if the fake news does.

In a public interview last Thursday, Zuckerberg claimed that fake news on Facebook “surely had no impact” on the election and that to suggest otherwise was “a pretty crazy idea.” He accused Facebook critics of condescension for assuming that voters could be influenced by falsehoods and dismissed the notion that one side could have shared more fake news than the other. (There is evidence that it did.) As criticism intensified, he followed up with a personal Facebook post on Saturday, which struck a more conciliatory tone but still rejected the notion that fake news had an impact. He noted that Facebook already allows users to flag hoaxes and fake news and added that “we will continue to work on this to improve further.” At the same time, he cautioned that Facebook had to “proceed very carefully,” because “identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated.”

Yes, the truth is complicated, and Facebook should proceed carefully. But there is a growing sense, both inside and outside the company, that it may be proceeding rather too carefully, given its increasingly dominant role in the distribution of news online. And Zuckerberg’s denials seem to be fanning the flames.

Over the weekend, some highly placed, anonymous Facebook employees told the New York Times that they’ve been questioning the company’s role in the campaign. Five more anonymous employees told BuzzFeed on Monday that they and dozens of others within Facebook have formed a secret “task force” to advocate for stronger action against fake news. Meanwhile, a top Clinton strategist told Politico that Democratic leaders are looking for ways to get Facebook to address the problem. And Gizmodo reported, citing an anonymous source, that Facebook considered a tougher move against fake news this summer but held off out of fear of upsetting conservatives. Facebook disputed that, telling me it did no such thing and providing an alternative explanation for its tweaks to the news feed over the summer. (This puts Facebook in the ironic position of arguing that Gizmodo’s post is itself a false news story of sorts.)

Finally, on Monday night, the company took a concrete step. Following the lead of Google, which made a similar move earlier in the day, Facebook announced that it will ban fake news sites from using its advertising network. It’s a fine start. It is not nearly enough.

The furor over fake news is warranted. Fabricated stories about the pope endorsing Trump or an FBI agent getting murdered for leaking Clinton’s emails may have composed a small fraction of all the political content shared on Facebook. (Zuckerberg declared, without sharing any evidence, that more than 99 percent of Facebook content is “authentic.”) But they and others like them were so widely shared—nearly 1 million times in the case of the bogus pope endorsement—that it’s easy to imagine they played a role in at least some voters’ thinking. By contrast, a major investigative scoop from the New York Times about Trump’s tax returns was shared fewer than 200,000 times. The presence of fake news side by side with real news, in identical format, contributes to a sense that anything you read in the news feed could just as well be true as entirely made up.

Yet in the long run, fake news on Facebook may prove to be a relatively short-lived concern compared with the deeper fault line that the tremors have exposed. It reveals a company increasingly torn between its self-conception as a neutral technology platform and its undeniable influence on the creation, distribution, and consumption of news and other media. And it’s left Zuckerberg, one of the world’s most powerful executives, struggling to keep control of his company and the story it tells about itself.

He’s right, by the way, to be wary of casting Facebook in the role of arbiter of journalistic credibility. A news feed that’s a messy free-for-all is probably preferable to one in which only Facebook-approved sources can be heard. So let’s grant that it would be impossible for Facebook to stamp out all falsehoods in its network and perhaps even dangerous for it to even try, were it to cast too expansive a net. Even so, the existence of Macedonian click-farms dedicated to churning out fake news stories for profit is a clear sign that Facebook could be doing more to address the small fraction of content that is obviously bogus. Even Zuckerberg admits this.

What was odd about Zuckerberg’s response to the fake news problem was how adamant he seemed that it had no impact. Facebook’s whole premise as a business is that what people read in their news feeds can influence their decisions—otherwise, there would be little point in advertising there. And Zuckerberg has been more than happy to trumpet the company’s estimate that it encouraged 2 million people who might have otherwise stayed home to vote. Yet he wants us to believe that fake news stories played no role at all.

If Gizmodo’s report is accurate, it would cast Zuckerberg’s pooh-poohing of the fake news problem in an ugly new light. It would suggest that the company knew fake news was helping one political party more than the other and that it declined to take action for that very reason. It would imply that Zuckerberg isn’t just in denial—he’s flat-out lying.

But there’s another explanation for his defiant stance that doesn’t rely on speculation (or single anonymous sources). It’s that Zuckerberg is so loath to take responsibility for the content that appears on Facebook—so reluctant to be weighed down by its baggage, even as he runs the conveyor belt—that he’d rather deny its effects than grapple with its causes.

That’s consistent with Zuckerberg’s approach to other deeper questions about Facebook’s role in the media, including the charge that it insulates users in ideological bubbles by reinforcing what they already believe. “All the research we have suggests that this isn’t really a problem,” Zuckerberg said on Thursday, citing a Facebook-funded 2015 study that has been criticized as misleading. The data showed that Facebook does in fact expose users primarily to political content that conforms to their partisan identifications. But the study concluded, a little defensively, that this problem was insignificant compared with the problem of users’ own choices as to which sort of content to engage with. As Jefferson Pooley pointed out in Slate, it’s impossible to reproduce Facebook’s findings, because the company won’t let independent researchers see its data.

Dubious as the study’s conclusions are, it seems to have convinced Zuckerberg beyond a doubt that Facebook doesn’t have a filter-bubble problem. That’s convenient for Facebook, since addressing such an issue would require rethinking the fundamental structure of its algorithm and user experience. Evidently Facebook’s users are not the only ones subject to confirmation bias and epistemic closure.

There is an even more subtle and insidious effect of Facebook’s algorithm that has gone almost unmentioned in this saga. It’s the incentive Facebook creates for the media—both the hoax-disseminating media and the truth-telling one—to write and frame stories in ways that are geared to generate likes, clicks, and shares among the social network’s users. The illusion that Facebook is a neutral platform should have been shattered long ago by the obvious ways it has warped online news coverage, from the manipulative headlines to the feeding frenzies over sensational stories and anecdotes that are too good to check. If you were trying to design a media diet that could help give rise to something like the Trump phenomenon, you could hardly do better than 24-hour cable news and the Facebook news feed. To its credit, Facebook has acknowledged the problems of clickbait and likebait and made real efforts to mitigate its own perverse incentives. But even as Zuckerberg has repeatedly addressed the issue of fake news, he has evinced no awareness of the other ways Facebook might have disrupted political coverage for the worse.

Drill down into Facebook’s reasons for insisting that it isn’t a media company, and you’ll hit layer upon layer of denial.

Finally, there’s Zuckerberg’s oft-criticized denial that Facebook is a media company. “It’s a technology company,” he says, as if that settles it. There are valid arguments on both sides, and no doubt the company has its feet in both sectors. It would be eminently reasonable for Facebook to admit that it is a media company in some key respects but not in others. But Zuckerberg denies even that. To him, there is no argument.

Drill down into Facebook’s reasons for insisting that it isn’t a media company, and you’ll hit layer upon layer of denial. It denies that it’s a media company because that allows it to further deny that Facebook shapes not only how the news is distributed, but how it is reported, framed, discussed, and perceived. That in turn allows it to deny that its humans or algorithms might exhibit any bias that could warp the news for better or worse or favor one set of interests over another. If Facebook is a neutral platform, as it insists, then it can deny any responsibility for how people use it, any responsibility for what they post or share, any responsibility to ensure the accuracy or fairness or journalistic virtue of whatever news might circulate on it.

The ultimate denial, and the underlying purpose of it all, is to deny the very possibility of any tension between Facebook’s own interests and the interests of society. Facebook, by Zuckerberg’s lights, is simply a powerful tool for making the world more open and connected. And if that means Trump is elected U.S. president, there must have been good reasons for his election that had nothing to do with Facebook. Or, in Zuckerberg’s words, “voters make decisions based on their lived experience”—as if Facebook weren’t a part of that, as if its $335 billion market value weren’t a function of the incredible degree to which it has managed to ingratiate itself into people’s daily lives, as if our online and offline lives weren’t now irrevocably intertwined.

Either the internal contradiction of Zuckerberg’s position is lost on him or, more likely, he recognizes it but refuses to acknowledge it. His discretion makes sense, from a business perspective if not a moral one, if he believes that confronting Facebook’s impact on politics would require changes that would hurt the company’s bottom line. But coming from a figure who preaches the gospel of openness, it’s baffling.

It now seems, however, that Zuckerberg has lost the faith of some of his own employees on this issue. Facebook has rarely been a leaky company in the past. But the leaks started with its bungling of the trending news controversy, and they’ve resurfaced around the fake news debate. Facebook’s move on Monday to cut off advertising to fake news sites feels like an acknowledgement from the top that outright denial is no longer tenable.

The question now is how far Facebook will go to placate its critics. The last time it faced an uproar over its influence on U.S. politics—the overblown controversy involving its trending news section—it grossly overreacted and made everything worse. That seems less likely this time, especially since the news feed is a far more precious product to the company.

What’s more likely is that Facebook will seek to isolate and defuse the fake news issue while preserving its claim to be a neutral technology platform. As John Herrman pointed out in the New York Times last week, Facebook may already be evolving in ways that render the current controversy largely irrelevant. For instance, it has been partnering with prestigious media outlets to produce video content, broadcast live videos, and publish glossy “instant articles” within the news feed itself. It’s using the power of its algorithm to prioritize those forms over others, including links to news stories from publishers around the web. It’s conceivable that Facebook will end up drowning out most fake news, along with a lot of legitimate content from second- and third-tier web publishers, without having to police it any more actively than it already does.Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego

This video proves it’s alive. Scientists have known since 2015 that the ruby seadragon existed based on DNA analysis of 100-year-old museum specimens but it’s never been seen, much less caught on video, until now.

The earlier specimens had been provided to Scripps Institution of Oceanography by Western Australia Museum. In April 2016, Scripps and WAM launched an expedition off the coast of Australia’s Recherche Archipelago to see if they could find the ruby seadragon in the wild. They sent a remote-operated vehicle down 150 feet for what seemed like a very slim chance of spotting one.

The chair and ranking members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday asked the the Office of Government Ethics to recommend possible disciplinary action to the White House after a senior adviser to the President, Kellyanne Conway, hawked Ivanka Trump's clothing line on television.

"As director of OGE, you have the authority to review potential ethics violations and notify the employee's agency, which in this case is the White House," Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) wrote to OGE Director Walter M. Shaub, Jr. on Thursday in a joint letter. "In this case, there is an additional challenge, which is that the President, as the ultimate disciplinary authority for White House employees, has an inherent conflict of interest since Conway's statements relate to his daughter's private business."

Chaffetz and Cummings wrote that Conway's statements "clearly violate the ethical principles for federal employees and are unacceptable."

The bipartisan letter is notable given that Chaffetz and Cummings have had a remarkably contentious relationship, most memorably over the Benghazi attack and subsequent investigations.

The letter asked Shaub to exercise the authority granted to him in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to "review Conway's statements and act promptly on the basis of your findings," and report on any disciplinary recommendations that OGE makes to the Trump administration regarding Conway.

Around the same time Chaffetz shared the letter online, a spokesperson for Donald Trump was quoted by the Associated Press saying the President "absolutely" stood by Conway.

Trump, the spokesperson said, "understands she was merely sticking up for a wonderful woman who she has great respect for and felt was treated unfairly."

White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday that Conway had been “counseled on that subject, and that's it.”

Several outlets and reporters then tweeted quotes from Chaffetz, who called Conway's comments “wholly unacceptable” and “clearly over the line.” A member of Chaffetz's staff confirmed to TPM the statements the congressman made to the press.
