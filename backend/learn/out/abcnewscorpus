This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.Just heard in the newsroom - "Emerald may be the color of the night?" What are you seeing Lesley?Troy Griffin walked across a bridge in Colorado, searching for a body.

He brought search dogs and a team of volunteers with him, but his main set of tools are his visions.

Griffin is a self-proclaimed psychic detective. Shunning the crystal ball, tarot cards and tea leaves of his fellow intuitives, he says he uses his psychic powers to solve crimes.

"I've worked on … about a 100 cases overall," Griffin said.

He says he's built a business out of bringing the paranormal into police work, charging up to $250 an hour for his investigative work.

He recently worked a missing person's case that gripped the nation. Kelsie Schelling, 21, was eight weeks pregnant and disappeared in February 2013 after making a late night drive from her home in Denver to see her boyfriend in Pueblo, Colorado. Her family never saw or heard from her again.

Four years after her unsolved disappearance, Schelling's mother Laura Saxton is still searching for her daughter and is grateful for Griffin's help.

"We just want her back, and well do whatever it takes to get her back," Saxton said. "Any time you can find anybody who sincerely wants to help it means a lot because people come and go very quickly."

Using Griffin's supposed psychic intuition and some anonymous tips, they searched a sparsely populated area in Pueblo, Colorado, where Griffin was trying to clue in on any sign of Schelling.

Griffin said his visions are "like watching TV, but just little clips,” and he’ll get overwhelming feelings of nervousness and anxiety.

"It's nothing to do with the victims, it's just how I know or how I use my directions," he said. "When I pick up the feeling I have to go and follow that ... So I have in my mind a vision of where I think her body may be that’s what I’m searching for."

As they combed through rocks and riverbeds at two different points of interest, Griffin appeared to pick up a bunch of different energies.

"I feel nauseous, sometimes I feel like I can't breathe," he said.

But hours of searching led to no real clues pointing to Schelling’s whereabouts.

"I don't feel Kelsie here at all," he said finally.

Back at his office located outside of Denver, the walls are covered with files, maps and addresses from what he says are his cases. Griffin said he had previously made contact with Schelling when he first met her mother.

"When I contacted Kelsie, it was more just apologies -– ‘I'm sorry mom, I didn't mean for it to happen. I didn't know,’” Griffin said. “[Her mother] Laura is never going to have closure unless she finds something.”

In the six years he’s been in business, out of 100 cases, Griffin claims he has an 18 to 20 percent success rate, but defended those numbers.

“When you look at murder cases and unsolved missing persons, they're very few percentage that actually get solved,” he said.

But of the roughly 100 cases Griffin claims he worked on, Griffin could not provide one example to ABC News to verify that he contributed to a police investigation. Even with the Kelsie Schelling case, when contacted, the Pueblo police department told ABC News they had “no official contact” with Griffin and were “unaware” of his investigation.

When asked how police departments typically receive his offer to help, Griffin said, “It really depends on what a detective or detectives believe in,” but that he was “lucky” if he got a “50/50” shot.

Rhonda Sheya said she is a former client turned friend of Griffin’s, and that she turned to him for help the day after her brother-in-law Danny Sheya mysteriously went missing in December 2014.

“He said, ‘I believe that he is within a few minutes of your home, a few miles, maybe five miles of your home. I see him surrounded by water and a few miles from your home,’” Sheya said. “I was like, ‘Water? There was no water on the route that we were searching.’”

Tragically, Danny Sheya’s vehicle had gone off the road on a dangerous stretch of road in Colorado and was found two days later by passerbys. Rhonda Sheya credits Griffin with helping them find closure.

"It does cross your mind that this a little bit out there," she said. "It's not exactly what mainstream people believe or think. It was desperation. You get desperate. At some point you're grasping at straws. You don't care. You just want your loved one back.”

Psychic-based crime solvers are not a new phenomenon. There was five seasons worth on the Court TV reality series called "Psychic Detectives." There have been other hits such as "The Mentalist" and "Medium." They were even spoofed on "South Park."

But psychic readings, especially those in the public eye, have not been exempt from scrutiny. One example was a 2004 reading famed psychic Sylvia Browne performed on "The Montel Williams Show" for the mother of then-missing girl Amanda Berry. Browne told Berry’s mother that her daughter was dead, but nine years later, in May 2013, she was found alive.

Prior to her death in November 2013, Browne released a statement saying in part, "I have been more right than wrong. If ever there was a time to be grateful and relieved for being mistaken, this is that time."

But still, Berry's mother died believing her daughter was dead when she wasn't. Critics called Browne a "grief vampire" taking advantage of a grieving parent. Griffin denied that's what he's doing in the Schelling case.

"I waited for her mom to tell me what she thought,” he said. “I don't say you're dead or you're alive. I say I have feeling. I'm never going to tell you if you're dead or alive. If I feel strongly, I'm still not going to tell you.”

But he did tell Schelling's mother how she was murdered, saying that he believed strangulation was involved. If it turns out he’s wrong, Griffin said it would be time for him to "consider a different career."

"I don't take advantage of people that are grieving. Most are referred to me from what I did. I don't charge them,” he said. "I'm not coming with false hope either way. I'm not here to tell you yea or nay. I'm here to help.”

Griffin said he’s not taking any money from Laura Saxton or any other grieving Schelling family members. He said he makes most of his money doing psychic readings, which he charges $140 an hour for people who come to him.

Famed skeptic Joe Nickell's office in Buffalo, New York, is a shrine to cases he claims to have debunked over the years, including psychic detectives.

“What people should realize is psychics cannot do what they claim to do,” Nickell said. “They have been reviewed by mainstream science, and they can't do it. If they can do it, let's see that they do it.”

Nickell said psychics use a series of mentalist tricks often referred to as “retrofitting.”

"[It] could be defined as ‘after-the-fact matching,’” he said. “In other words, the detectives have a missing person. They assume the person might be dead, but they're looking to find that person. In comes the psychic, often ingratiating himself or herself with the family, forcing the police, pretty much, to have to pay attention to the psychic.

"The psychic will say things like, 'I see water. I'm getting the number 7. I see some sort of tall structure,' and so on. They call these clues," he added.

But Griffin said he's isn't bothered by critics who don't believe in his work.

"What I say to skeptics is, if you have never been in the people's shoes that I walk with, don't judge or put opinion on it until you really know if it's real or not," he said. "The only way you're going to know is if there's ever a day that you need somebody like me. Then you'll know. Before then you'll probably never believe in me but the people that I help and walk away with closure moving forward. They're the ones who believed in me. That's why I continue to do what I do."

To this day, Kelsie Schelling remains missing, and her mother’s painful search for the daughter who never came home continues.

“I have to try and keep hope to keep going because I know if I give up then it just goes away and Kelsie's forgotten,” Saxton said. “I will just try and find my hope and my drive wherever I can find it and whoever is brought into my life to make that happen and right now [Griffin] has been brought in my life.”Luis Suarez is currently being investigated by FIFA for an apparent bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini – but what will really stick in the craw for the Azzurri is that Diego Godin’s late winner gave Uruguay a 1-0 win to go through to the knockout stages of the tournament at their expense.

"It's such a good question and it's something I really grappled with in the beginning -- the kind of Stockholm Syndrome question about this story," she told Entertainment Weekly. "That's where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor."

Watson said this doesn't necessarily ring true for Belle. In the film, Belle is imprisoned by the fearsome Beast after sacrificing herself for her father, and falls in love with him after spending time in his captivity. But Watson said she doesn't give up her spirit and free will.

"Belle actively argues and disagrees with [the Beast] constantly," she said. "She has none of the characteristics of someone with Stockholm Syndrome because she keeps her independence. She keeps that freedom of thought."

Belle does not allow herself to be mistreated, in Watson's view.

"He bangs on the door, she bangs back," she said. "There's this defiance that 'You think I'm going to come and eat dinner with you and I'm your prisoner. Absolutely not.'"

Watson also thinks their relationship defies stereotypical "love at first sight" romance plots.

"Beast and Belle begin their love story really irritating each other and really not liking each other very much," she said. "They build a friendship, slowly, slowly, slowly, and very slowly that builds to them falling in love. They are having no illusions about who the other one is. They have seen the worst of one another, and they also bring out the best."

"Beauty and the Beast" opens in theaters on March 17.

Here is what we know right now:



The first hostage situation is in Dammartin-en-Goele and involves the two brothers who are the main suspects in the Charlie Hebdo shooting, where 12 people were killed at or near a satirical newspaper office on Wednesday. Police have reportedly made contact with the two suspects, Said and Cherif Koachi, and they are thought to have one male hostage.



The second hostage situation started less than an hour ago, in a kosher supermarket in the town of Porte de Vincennes. There are far fewer details about this second hostage situation but teams of armed police have been seen moving in towards the building.

"Trump is good for the Jews" trumpeted the front page of the free daily Israel Hayom, a right-wing paper supported by Trump donor and Netanyahu patron Sheldon Adelson.

There were some murmurs that a U.S. president who campaigned steadfastly in support of Israel had, perhaps surprisingly, chosen to publicly bring up the question of settlements during Wednesday's press conference.

"Trump: I'd like you to 'hold back' on settlements," read the cover of Thursday’s right-of-center Jerusalem Post, while the left-of-center Haaretz, Israel's oldest daily newspaper, chose: "Trump declines to endorse two-state solution, calls on PM to 'hold back on settlements'."

After the press conference, Netanyahu told Israeli reporters that "if there's a request from the [U.S.] president to examine this issue of construction in the settlements then I think it is in our national interest to reach an understanding."

But with Wednesday’s meeting, Netanyahu's right-wing coalition has chalked up his first visit with Trump as an unqualified success.

The prime minister's arch rival and leader of the far-right, pro-settlement Jewish Home party, Naftali Bennett, heaped praise on Netanyahu.

“This is the end of an era,” he said. "The Palestinian flag has come down and has been replaced by the Israeli flag. The prime minister displayed leadership and daring and strengthened Israel’s security.”

Last week, Bennett threatened that the "earth will shake" if Netanyahu mentioned the two-state solution or uttered the word Palestine. And to Bennett's great satisfaction, Netanyahu did not commit to a two-state solution in his meeting with Trump.

That satisfaction comes on the heels of the previous three weeks of Trump's presidency, where Netanyahu dramatically accelerated settlement expansion in a nod to his right-wing coalition. He announced the approval of more than 6,000 housing units in the occupied Palestinian territories, in addition to the first new settlement since the 1990s.

While settlements have long put the U.S. and Israel at odds, the Trump White House has largely kept quiet, issuing only a mild warning last week. Foreshadowing his press conference comments, last weekend Trump told Israel Hayom that he was "not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace."

For Palestinians and parts of the Israeli center and left, however, Wednesday’s meeting was largely viewed as a dangerous policy shift, albeit for different reasons.

Opposition leader Isaac Herzog, leader of the center-left Zionist Union party, said “it was sad and embarrassing to see Netanyahu avoid the concept of separating from the Palestinians via the two-state solution.” He decried a policy that he thought would ultimately weaken Israel’s ability to retain its Jewish character.

Fellow Zionist Union member Erel Margalit echoed that sentiment, saying Wednesday night that “the extreme right won tonight, and the state of Israel lost."

Left-wing party Meretz chairwoman Zehava Gal-On issued a starker warning, saying that turning away from the two-state solution would “guarantee that we [Israel] will become an apartheid state" with two laws for two peoples.

The leader of Israel’s Arab-dominated Joint List and a Palestinian citizen of Israel, Ahmad Tibi, said Netanyahu’s meeting had left the path forward in some ways more clear.

“If Netanyahu and Trump decide they want a one-state solution, there will have to be equality and a right to vote for all.” He told CNN that if that's the case, he will run for prime minister. “All Palestinians will vote for me. Some Israeli Jews will vote for me and Netanyahu will be the loser," he said.

For more than two decades, U.S. policy has unequivocally pushed the two-state solution.

While Prime Minister Netanyahu opposed the Oslo peace process which enshrined the two-state paradigm, in a 2009 speech Bar Ilan University he declared support for a version of two independent states for two peoples, with Israel retaining a security presence in the West Bank.

But many on the Israeli right have criticized his support of two states, and the election of Trump has left Netanyahu with more room to maneuver with those on his right flank.

Meanwhile, for the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank, Thursday’s meeting marked a major turning point for the worse.

The secretary-general of the PLO and veteran Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said the alternative to two states is "a single democratic secular state for Jews, Muslims and Christians" where everyone has full rights.

But he suggested this was far from the Israeli leader’s conception of what one state would look like.

"What Netanyahu is thinking about, the one state-two systems, the military government imposed on Palestinians, is apartheid.”

He added, "I don't think they can sustain it, not in the 21st century."

In a statement, Palestinian President Abbas echoed Erekat, saying the Palestinian Authority "affirmed its continuing commitment to the two-state option, international law and legitimacy, which should ensure the end of the Israeli occupation, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, living in peace and security next to the State of Israel on the June 1967 borders."

Abbas added that he was ready “to deal positively with the Donald Trump administration to make peace.”

But President Trump's refusal to endorse the two-state solution sets him far apart from other international actors here in Jerusalem, including the European Union and the United Nations.

"There is no alternative solution for the situation between the Palestinians and Israelis," U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, "other than the solution of establishing two states, and we should do all that can be done to maintain this."Hello everyone!

Some residents mistook the loud sound from the F-15 jets for an explosion, but the Broward Sheriff’s office confirmed that the noise was from a military exercise.

“The intercept required the Air Force F-15s from Homestead Air National Guard Base to travel at supersonic speeds, a sound noticed by area residents, to get to the general aviation aircraft where they were able to establish communications,” NORAD said in a statement of the incident, around 7 p.m.

"The intent of military intercepts is to have the identified aircraft re-establish communications with local FAA air traffic controllers and instruct the pilot to follow air traffic controllers' instructions to land safely for follow-on action."

The Broward Sheriff’s office said 911 centers were flooded with phone calls about the incident.

Kristen Patton, 41, suffered her first heart attack with no warning on Christmas Eve 2015. She had just brought home her fourth child after giving birth two days prior and the family enjoyed a normal Christmas Eve. She first noticed something was wrong when she was feeding her infant daughter.

KVUE

"I had this horrible pain in my jaw ... it felt like it was drilling into my jawbone," Patton, of Austin, Texas, said. She instantly knew something was wrong and put her child back in the bassinet before calling for her husband.

"He came into the room to find me unresponsive and called 911," Patton said. By the time paramedics arrived she no longer had a heartbeat and they had to use a defibrillator to get her heart started again.

Once she was at the hospital, the doctors were able to stabilize her heartbeat but they remained mystified to why her heartbeat had been dangerously irregular.

Days later, after multiple tests and no clear answer, they planned to let her leave the hospital with an defibrillator vest that could shock her heart if she had another heart attack. But before they could prep her for that device, Patton had a second heart attack.

"It was the same exact pain and progression," Patton recalled. "But I felt like I was drowning and I could not get a breath."

During the second heart attack doctors realized that Patton had a rare heart condition called spontaneous coronary artery dissection. The layered walls in her artery had partially torn, cutting off desperately needed oxygen to portions of the heart muscle, effectively killing the heart tissue.

Dr. Mary Beth Cishek, a cardiologist at Seton Heart Institute in Austin Texas, treated Patton and said the heart was so damaged doctors knew she would need a transplant in the future.

"It was so extensive and damage to her heart was so great ... it was no longer able to support her body," Cishek said.

To save her life doctors performed a triple bypass and attached Patton to a machine that can oxygenate blood called an ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.)

After the surgery, Patton remained unconscious at the hospital for weeks on life support. She could not be put on the transplant list because her kidneys started to fail and her heart could no longer effectively pump her blood. The ECMO machine and later a similar more portable device called an LVAD (left ventricular assist device) used to pump blood were the only way she could stay alive.

After her diagnosis, Patton's doctors realized that her pregnancy, with the accompanying rise and fall in hormones, was the likely cause of the rare and dangerous heart condition.

"It's thought that the shifting hormones in a way may kind of loosen the cell to cell connections," Cishek explained.

In late January, weeks after arriving in the hospital, Patton finally woke up, but was unable to speak due to a tracheotomy.

"It was a really horrible feeling to not be able to communicate effectively with the people around me," she said. "I also just felt pretty horrible ... I had lost all strength in my arms and legs."

Slowly she was able to recover to the point that she could get into a rehab facility as she gained her strength. The LVAD meant she had to be connected to a battery 24 hours every day to keep her blood pumping through her body.

Over the course of 2016 Patton continued to get stronger and was even able to return home where she went on a hike with her family and started to get back to her normal life. In November, her doctors were able to put her on the wait list for a heart transplant, giving her hope that a new heart could mean no longer relying on the LVAD to stay alive.

"You walk around with your cellphone in your hand waiting for your call," Patton said, explaining that every call from an unknown number was exciting. "You think, 'Is this a telemarketer or a heart?'"

Eventually, on her 41st birthday, Patton got the call that a heart was available.

"I got the call on my birthday, it was really beautiful," Patton recalled, explaining she was with her husband at the time. "We both just hugged each other and cried."

Patton successfully underwent the transplant surgery in November, approximately 11 months after her first heart attack. When she woke up, she said she could feel her heart beat for the first time in nearly a year after being put on the ECMO machine.

"It [felt] like horses galloping through my chest because the heart beat was strong," she said. Now nearly three months after her transplant, she continues to get better and more active with her children.

"I do feel so good now it is hard to fathom that all of this could possibly happen, sometimes it feels like another person's story," Patton said.

She is hoping that sharing her story she can raise awareness about the need for people to be proactive about their heart health. While she knows her condition is rare, she also lost her mother to a heart attack last February. The cause was atherosclerosis -- a build-up of plaque in the arteries that is a common cause of heart attacks.

"Heart attacks are devastating and my hope is to raise awareness so that people go get their heart screened," Patton said.I’m

three games today as Argentina meet Iran atOne Texas couple is finally expecting not just one, but two babies, after struggling with infertility for two years.

Lauren Walker shared her story, with a moving photo featuring two onesies and 452 needles used for her In-Vitro Fertilization treatments in a photo that has since gone viral on Facebook.

"We prayed for 953 days...452 Needles, 1000's of tears, 1 corrective surgery, 4 clomid/letrozole attempts, 2 IVF rounds, 3 failed transfers and & 1 Amazing GOD," the yoga instructor wrote as a caption before explaining her inspirational journey.

Walker, 28, had been trying to have a child with her high school sweetheart, Garyt, since 2014.

"When we started, we knew off the bat that I was having issues," Walker told ABC News, "which I guess is a blessing."

So Walker decided to undergo IVF treatments at Houston Fertility Institute "and we expected it to work." Still, she miscarried two embryos on Sept. 10, 2014. After another round of treatment, Walker miscarried two more embryos three months later.

"It's every mother's job to be able to protect their children and keep them safe," Walker said through tears. "And every time they kept putting them inside me I couldn't do it."

The couple had one embryo left and decided to "give it one more shot," Walker said. But two days before Christmas in 2014, they discovered they still weren't pregnant.

Walker said she made her husband take the call from her fertility nurse because she was too afraid to hear any more bad news.

"He went into the bedroom to take the call. He came out and just looked at me and he started to tear up [and said,] 'I'm so sorry, sweetie,'" Walker recalled. "We just held each other and I let out this blood curdling scream. I was completely broken."

It didn't help that, by then, they had spent approximately $30,000 on treatments. Thankfully, their marriage was still in tact.

"We have heard stories of how going through infertility can really cause wear and tear in a marriage," Walker said. "[We decided] we come first. We need to make sure we are always taking care of each other first and foremost."

The couple credits the strength of their marriage and their faith in God for giving them the courage to try to have a baby again.

They moved to The Woodlands, Texas, from Houston, in May 2016. After taking out a $14,000 loan, they began treatments again last October.

This time, they decided not to tell family and friends they were trying again to have a baby.

Instead, they surprised their family with the news that Walker was indeed pregnant -- with twins -- just a week before Christmas by handing them the pregnancy test wrapped in a bow.

Walker said that despite her long journey, she wouldn't want it any other way.

"Life happens the way that it's supposed to happen," she said. "Had this all happened the way I wanted to back in 2014, we would have different children and we would have a different life, and I know that these babies right now are meant to be here."

"The reason why we were waiting so long is that we were waiting for them," she gushed.

Walker is due in August and she said she's looking forward to introducing her twins, that she's named Duke and Diana Walker, to her 6-year-old goldendoodle, Fenway -- and of course they rest of their family.

"They're the first grandchildren," Walker said. "Everyone's just so excited."Hurricane Matthew Upgraded to Category 4, as Millions Warned That 'This Storm Will Kill You'





Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents in evacuation zones that "this storm will kill you. "





The storm could be the strongest to hit the U. S. in more than a decade, according to meteorologists.



Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban took his longtime feud with President Trump to the basketball court Friday night, donning a No. 46 jersey during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome.

With Trump being the 45th president of the U.S., Cuban's attire seemed to be a direct jab to Trump's tweet last Sunday, which read, "I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.

I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017

When asked about the jersey by ESPN before the game, Cuban made no mention of Trump, instead saying tongue-in-cheek, "I couldn't get 23. This is two times 23." But according to ESPN, no one on the West celebrity squad wore No. 23.

But Cuban, who supported Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, later said the number choice was "to tweak the s--- out of everybody," according to ESPN.

He added, "It was just to f--- with everybody, because that is what I do," he said. "You've got to have fun with it. You can't take it too seriously. So we'll see."

Earlier on Friday, Cuban wrote a series of tweets slamming the president. "Trump's biggest issues are: No self-awareness, no situational awareness, can't admit mistakes, no leadership skills, can't stay focused," read one of Cuban's tweets."Is this the last act of the great Tony Stark or are you going to do something about it?" #MarvelMovieMarathonA powerful Pacific storm blew into Southern and Central California on Friday with wind-driven heavy rains that downed power lines and electrocuted a man, killed a motorist in a submerged car and disrupted hundreds of flights at airports.

With the storm feeding on an atmospheric river of moisture stretching far out into the Pacific, precautionary evacuations of homes in some neighborhoods were requested due to the potential for mudslides and debris flows.

More than 300 arriving and departing flights were delayed or canceled at Los Angeles International Airport.

In the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, a falling tree downed power lines and hit a car. A 55-year-old man was electrocuted and pronounced dead at a hospital, police and fire officials said.

Later in the same neighborhood, a sinkhole swallowed two cars, the second on live TV as viewers watched it teeter on the edge before plunging in. Firefighters rescued one person from the first car, and the driver got out of the second before it fell. No one was injured.

Winds gusting to 70 mph or more lashed parts of the region. Heavy rains turned creeks and rivers into brown torrents and released slews of mud from hillsides burned barren by wildfires. Several stretches of freeways and highways were closed by flooding.

"It's crazy," said Robin Johnson, an academic adviser at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "It's just pouring down rain. The wind is just going nuts."

"At one point the wind was so strong I'm surprised it didn't blow my windows out," retiree Phoenix Hocking said in a Facebook message from Carpinteria. "I now have a pond in my patio. And my dog is starting to grow flippers so he can go out and do his business."

In the desert town of Victorville, several cars were washed down a flooded street. A helicopter rescued one person from the roof of a car but another motorist was found dead in a submerged vehicle, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said.

Elsewhere in the county, a 20-mile stretch of State Route 138 in the West Cajon Valley was closed at the scene of a summer wildfire.

Mud sloshed over concrete rail barriers and about two dozen vehicles, including big-rigs and a school bus, were either mired in mud or became unable to turn around on the closed road and some were abandoned, Sherwin said.

Two people in a car were rescued and four students on the bus were removed and taken to a school office, he said.

Another road in the area was covered with 2 feet of mud.

In LA's Sun Valley, 10 cars were trapped in swift-moving water on a roadway and 15 people had to be rescued, the Fire Department reported.

Using ropes and inflatable boats, firefighters rescued seven people and two dogs from the Sepulveda basin, a recreation and flood-control area along the Los Angeles River. One person was taken to a hospital with a non-life threatening injury.

The storm took aim at Southern California but also spread precipitation north into the San Joaquin Valley and up to San Francisco. It was not expected to bring significant rain in the far north where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend.

The National Weather Service said it could end up being the strongest storm to hit Southern California since January 1995.

Rain and wind wiped out play in golf's Genesis Open at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where a eucalyptus tree cracked.

Hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines had toppled in the Los Angeles area and at one point more than 60,000 city power customers were without electricity.

A 75-foot tree fell onto an apartment building near the University of California, Los Angeles, narrowly missing someone who was in bed, fire officials said. Four of the six apartments have been declared unsafe to enter, prompting the evacuation of 16 college students.

"I was just sitting in bed trying to enjoy a Friday morning of no class," one resident told KCAL-TV. "I had a giant, like, thunder popping sound and then next thing I knew a branch was coming through the ceiling."

Her leg was scratched by debris and "I was covered in sawdust," she said.

Her thought now was, "Where am I going to live?"

Another tree smashed a carport and vehicles in the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta.

By evening, Ventura County and northern Los Angeles County had seen 24-hour rain totals of up to 7 ? inches, with the San Marcos mountain pass in Santa Barbara County receiving nearly 8 ? inches.

Farther south, downtown Los Angeles had received about 1 ? inches of rain while some areas saw up to 4 inches.

The storm system was moving "very slowly" eastward and Los Angeles County was expected to see more rain through Saturday, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.

The city of Duarte, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles, ordered evacuation of 180 homes below a burn scar. Up the coast, evacuations were urged for parts of Camarillo Springs in Ventura County and around an 11?-square-mile burn scar west of Santa Barbara.

In Northern California, officials monitoring the stricken Oroville Dam on the Feather River said they were confident the reservoir would handle any runoff from expected storms because ongoing releases have been lowering the lake's level since its spillways were damaged last week.

AP writers Mike Balsamo, Robert Jablon and Doug Ferguson contributed to this report.World News Tonight Anchor David Muir discusses the presidential election, a divided America, his historic interview with President Donald Trump, and why all voices should be heard with Jimmy Kimmel on Feb. 15, 2015.

“I think if you underestimate the audience, you do so at your own peril. I think Americans, particularly in this moment, are a lot smarter than people give them credit for. They're a lot more engaged than they were before the election,” Muir told Kimmel, who asked about the impact of fake news accusations in the news business.

“Whatever end of the spectrum you're on, people are definitely more engaged than they have been in many, many years ... That is a tremendous byproduct of what was a terribly bruising campaign.”Just beyond the Trump swelter of the hour, lawmakers have been busy concocting plans to dismantle key achievements of the Obama years. Among those accomplishments currently targeted is a concerted effort to destroy, defang, scrap (feel free to select the word) the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The CFPB was created to protect consumers from the kinds of predatory practices that played a big part in the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008. The idea was simple: Create a federal agency to be, to quote Sen. Elizabeth Warren, “the cop on the beat” in the financial sector. The CFPB was to have the ability to take decisive action to shut down questionable practices. The CFPB was designed to be the regulatory safeguard against future financial wipeouts.

It’s Populist!

Given the populist nature of Mr. Trump’s ascent to the White House, it remains for me a real head-scratcher as to precisely why the CFPB is on the chopping block.

The agency is tasked, after all, with policing financial products (and practices) that specifically take advantage of consumers. It has jurisdiction over a host of consumer “favorites” like credit reporting agencies, payday lenders, debt collectors, debt settlement companies and student loan servicers, as well as banks, credit unions, credit card companies and many other financial services organizations operating in the United States. With the power to ban financial products deemed “deceptive, unfair or abusive,” the CFPB also possesses the authority to impose significant penalties on financial predators.

What kind of penalties are we talking about? More than $5 billion so far, including a record $100 million against Wells Fargo in 2016. The CFPB has helped nearly 30 million consumers recover several billions of dollars in remedies from financial companies. All this, and in 2016 the CFPB, experiencing a huge amount of growth both in programs and staff, stayed $67 million under its budget cap.

So, if the CFPB hasn’t been too expensive for the federal government to run, what’s the problem? Follow the money.

Conservatives argue that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (aka Dodd-Frank, the law that authorized the creation of the CFPB) has cost businesses more than $24 billion in compliance-related expenses and 61 million hours in paperwork. It’s also a federal agency, and it has a fairly big budget. This is what the Republicans are focused on.

Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chair of the House Committee on Financial Services, cited what he calls “the avalanche of regulations that smother the U.S. economic system” in his latest rally to kill the bureau. This so-called “avalanche” was in response to an economic event that nearly destroyed the world economy.

Hensarling seems to be motivated primarily by conservative ideology, a central tenet of which being that too much centralized power is a bad thing. “The CFPB is arguably the most powerful, least accountable agency in U.S. history,” Hensarling wrote in a Feb. 8 Wall Street Journal opinion piece.

“CFPB zealots have the power to determine the ‘fairness’ of virtually every financial transaction in America. The agency defines its own powers and can launch investigations without cause, imposing virtually any fine or remedy, devoid of due process,” he wrote.

In an Oct. 11, 2016, decision, a federal appeals court ruled that the president should have the authority to fire the director of the CFPB other than for cause. The agency is currently appealing the court’s decision. Richard Cordray, the CFPB director, will leave the post when his five-year term expires in 2018.

“Other than the President,” Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the 2-1 majority, “the Director of the CFPB is the single most powerful official in the entire United States Government, at least when measured in terms of unilateral power.” Anticipating the popular response, Kavanaugh added, “That is not an overstatement.”

On Thursday, a court granted the CFPB's request for a review by a full panel of judges on whether its structure is constitutional. Oral arguments are scheduled for May 24.

The reason I say the attacks are mainly ideological is complicated, but in essence it seems like pressure from financial sector lobbyists plays a big part in the pushback against the CFPB and that the focus on centralized power is really just putting sheep’s clothing on an influence-buying wolf.

I don’t know how else to view the willful misunderstanding of what the CFPB actually does, which is simple: It demands accountability from financial institutions. The idea that, as Hensarling said, the CFPB “requires lenders essentially to read their clients’ minds, know and weigh their clients’ comprehension levels, and forecast future risk” is absurd.

Consider, if you will, the various ways consumers got screwed by the Wild West years in the finance world that led to the Great Recession. There is no mind reading required, but plenty of policing is needed.

It doesn’t matter if it’s the latest "SNL" sketch or Trump’s policy man Stephen Miller proclaiming that the new administration accomplished more in three weeks than most presidents achieve in four or even eight years — a claim that was quickly quashed — though I suppose he was right if you consider chaos an accomplishment. What matters is that we’re getting distracted from assaults on real progress made since 2008.

Killing the CFPB is an ill-advised and dangerous move, and one that will backfire on Republicans in the long run. As we consumers filter through the latest, greatest Trump outrage (or triumph), and as we focus on the news cycle, huge things are happening behind the scenes. This one might be a doozy, making America unacceptably vulnerable again.

ABC's JONATHAN KARL, ARLETTE SAENZ, JOSH HASKELL, MATTHEW CLAIBORNE and BENJAMIN GITTLESON : Debbie Wasserman Schultz didn’t overtly reference the email scandal nor did she issue any sort of apology at today's Florida delegation breakfast in Philadelphia. Throughout her entire remarks, protesters were shouting and standing in front of her with signs in hand.





"Everybody settle down please,” Wasserman Schultz said as she started to speak. "So I can see there is a little bit of interest in my being here, and I appreciate that interest,” she went on. "And a little bit of interest from the press. ” But she attributed that interest to Florida being “the most significant battleground state. ”





She said she was “proud” of her tenure as DNC chair and referenced her conversations with President Obama and Hillary Clinton on Sunday.





"I’m so proud to have been able to serve as the chair of the Democratic National Committee, and yesterday I had the great honor of speaking to both President Obama and Hillary Clinton. I thank President Obama for the honor of serving as the Chair of the Democratic National Committee and being able to watch his back and bring him across the finish line in 2012. ”

She said she would continue to work to elect Clinton as a surrogate. And she finally referenced the protesters, saying they didn’t represent Florida. "We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive,” she said. "We know that that’s not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is united."

We're taught in elementary school that there are seven continents on Earth -- Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America.

But geography textbooks across the world might have to add one more to that list -- Zealandia.

Zealandia is a continent that is 94 percent submerged underwater, which is why it took so long for geologists to identify it. The 6 percent that is above water comprises what many know as New Zealand and New Caledonia, according to a study in GSA Today, the journal of the Geological Society of America.

Zealandia spans almost 2 million square miles, a bit larger than India. And while the idea of a mostly submerged continent in the Pacific has been known in the science community for a while, it was only in the last two decades that researchers accumulated enough data and observations to classify it as the world's eighth continent.

In 1995, Bruce Luyendyk, a geologist teaching at the University of California Santa Barbara, coined the term “Zealandia” to describe New Zealand, New Caledonia and sections underwater that broke off from an ancient supercontinent, Gondwana.

“I wanted to just lump all of these masses together,” Luyendyk told ABC News today. “It was really just a convenient way to refer to this area.”Retired admiral and former Navy SEAL Robert Harward was offered the job of national security adviser to President Donald Trump, but has turned down the position for personal reasons, a senior administration official tells ABC News.

Harward, 60, had been the leading candidate to replace Gen. Michael Flynn, who was fired Monday, sources said. Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador ahead of the inauguration.

Harward most recently served as the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command under Gen. James Mattis, now the Secretary of Defense, a relationship which was seen as a strong selling point, administration officials said.

Harward, an ABC News contributor, and Trump had spoken recently about a position in the administration, according to the officials.

But after weighing the opportunity of national security adviser, Harward cited his family in declining the job, the senior administration official said.

"I was humbled and honored," Harward told ABC News, but said of the job, "It takes 24 hours a day of focus... It's a tough sacrifice" and after 40 years of military service, he was not ready to come back from retirement.

Harward denied turning down the offer because of chaos in the West Wing.

Other names have been under consideration as possible replacement for Flynn, according to administration officials: retired Gen. David Petraeus, former Ambassador Bob Kimmitt, and retired Gen. Keith Kellogg -- who is currently serving as the acting NSA -- have all been in the mix.

"I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position," President Trump said Thursday at a White House press conference.

Thursday evening, reaction to Harward's decision was already coming in.

"Robert Harward’s decision to not take over General Flynn’s old job is the latest evidence that the Trump WH is falling into utter disarray," House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted.

ABC News’ Elizabeth McLaughlin contributed to this report.The leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the Department of Justice and FBI Wednesday to brief their committee on the situation regarding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

In a letter addressed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director James Comey, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa and Diane Feinstein, D-California, the chairman and ranking member of the committee, cite media reports indicating the involvement of the Justice Department and the FBI in the circumstances leading up to Flynn's resignation.

“Accordingly, we request that individuals with specific knowledge of these issues from both the FBI and Justice Department brief Committee Members and staff,” reads the letter. “We similarly request copies of the transcripts of Mr. Flynn’s intercepted calls and the FBI report summarizing the intercepted calls referenced in the media.”

The committee, which is also seeking details on the Justice Department’s response and potential leaks of classified information, requested that the briefing be held the week of Feb. 27.

Flynn resigned Monday for what the White House called an “evolving and eroding level of trust” over the disclosure of his interactions with the Russian ambassador prior to President Trump’s inauguration.

Trump said that Flynn was treated "very, very unfairly" by the media and called him a "wonderful man."

No clear evidence of wrongdoing has been found on Flynn's part. Flynn said the calls he made to the ambassador were similar to others he made during the transition and that he "inadvertently" briefed the vice president with "incomplete" information.

Flynn initially denied discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador and Vice President Mike Pence repeated that claim during an interview in January.President Trump told reporters today his administration is working "like a fine-tuned machine," in the wake of this week’s resignation of his national security adviser and the withdrawal of his nominee for labor secretary.

"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine," Trump said. "Despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved, and they are outstanding people."

Ten of his 22 Cabinet-level nominees have yet to be approved, the most in U.S. history four weeks into a new presidency. "I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats," he said.

"I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite."

His national security adviser, Mike Flynn, resigned from his post earlier this week amid questions about his communications with the Russian government during the transition period. And fast-food executive Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for labor secretary after questions about his employing an undocumented immigrant and his wife's now retracted allegations of abuse.

"We have made incredible progress," Trump said. “I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.”

One of Trump's major moves so far — an executive order temporarily barring travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries — is no longer in effect after being blocked by the federal courts.When Do Polls Open and Close?

The appeal of Paris is as universal as it is timeless.

But special circumstances make this an especially attractive year to visit: a drop in tourism numbers, a weaker euro, and hotter airfare competition have suddenly converged to make the City of Lights a bargain travel option. That’s why it’s on Travelzoo’s WOW Deal Destinations list for 2017.

Planning your own Paris visit? These tips will get you going.

Skip the Cab, Buy the Card

My friend Lara Barlow, country manager for Travelzoo Canada, just got back from a five-day jaunt to Paris. She says the “Visite Paris” card, which she bought upon arrival at Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport, is a no brainer.

“If you get the five-zone ticket for 63 euros, it covers your train into the city (and back) from terminal 1, the metro within Paris, and the train to Versailles and Fontainebleau,” she says. “Given that a taxi to the city is at minimum 37 euros each way, and the train to Versailles is 7 euros round-trip (Fontainebleau even more), this was an easy way for us to get around Paris, as well as saving us money overall.”

Skip the Champs-Elysees, Shop Chic

Strolling down the most famous avenue in Paris is nothing short of an iconic tourist experience. Barlow enjoyed walking down the Champs Elysees toward the Arc de Triomphe after dark, because “the nightlife is bustling and the atmosphere is fun.”

But my colleague Stephan Renard, head of publishing in Travelzoo’s Paris office, is not so sure. In unabashed French style, he says, “A real Parisian symbol for many, I find Champs-Elysees rather unpleasant, especially in the evenings and on weekends. The shops are boring and devoid of personality, and the restaurants are nowhere near as good as you would expect from Paris. If you must tick it off your list go early to avoid crowds and leave time to explore so much more of what the city has to offer.” Instead, Renard sends shoppers to Rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré, which is home to almost every major international fashion brand, and Place Vendome, a historic square that’s teeming with ritzy hotels and famous designers. “These are the places to visit for the real ‘chic a la Française,’” he says.

A post shared by Olivier Leclercq street photo (@ol_streetphoto) on Feb 7, 2017 at 9:55am PST

Barlow adds, “If you’re less focused on global brands, stroll around Montmartre, where you’ll find some unique smaller shops.”

For hungry shoppers, Renard suggests La Grande Epicerie inside the exquisite Le Bon Marché department store. Located in the seventh arrondissement, or district, the 30,000 square-foot shop features more than 30,000 gourmet products – an international array of artisan meats, cheeses, fruits, seafood, pastries, breads, even high-end wines, as well as various venues in which to taste them. “The shop inspired one of France’s most famous writers, Emile Zola, for his novel Au Bonheur des Dames (or The Ladies’ Delight),” says Renard. “It’s on the pricey side, but certainly worth a look.”

Skip Lunch, Try the Cheese

If cheese is your weakness, the bevy of shops dedicated to the dairy treat won’t disappoint. My colleague Jonathan Rougeot, a senior producer in Travelzoo’s NYC headquarters, visited Paris earlier this month and did a comprehensive tasting in the cheese cellar at Pere et Fille Maitre Fromager.

“They took a small group of us down to the basement and walked us through the art of making cheese,” he says. “The thing I found fascinating was how different cheese can taste depending on how you eat it. They had us put the cheese in our mouths, chew it up, and then pour wine through it. Then they had us eat the cheese alone and learn how to still smell it after we swallowed it, which was fun and strange!”

Skip the Restaurant, Hone Your Skills

You don’t go to Paris if you’re on a diet. This is an international culinary epicenter, and great restaurants abound. Barlow loved her meal at Leperouse, located along the Seine, across from the Louvre. What started as one of King Louis XIV’s mansions in the 1760s later became an under-the-radar rendezvous for businessmen and their escorts, who were often paid in diamonds.

“The ladies, wanting to test whether the gifts were real, would scratch the mirrors in the dining rooms – those mirrors with the scratches still hang on the walls!” she says. “The ambiance is intimate and luxurious, and the food is fine dining.”

Renard’s favorite dining spot right now is Restaurant Kei, where “the décor is immaculately white and the food is both beautiful and surprising,” he says, and where the French-Japanese fusion food is getting a lot of buzz. Rougeot really enjoyed La Basalic in Montmartre, as much for the food as the look.

“What drew us was the Tudor-style building in the middle of a fork in the street that was covered in ivy and white lights,” he says. “It looked like something out of the Lord of the Rings or something.”

Paris, of course, is the place to hone your own kitchen skills, thanks to a bevy of cooking schools. Cook’n With Class Paris features an ongoing schedule of quick pastry and dessert classes, market visits and wine-and-cheese tastings; they offer kids’ classes, too. Le Foodist runs a slew of gastronomic tours and classes, including cooking classes that culminate in a four-course dinner with wine. The world cuisine and enology class at L’Atelier des Sens get high marks, too, as well as the big-name schools from Le Cordon Bleu and celeb chef Alain Ducasse.

Skip the Roundabout, Climb the Arc

The Arc de Triomphe is one of this city’s primary landmarks. You’ll also find the Tomb of the Unknown Solider here, which is rekindled nightly in memory of the dead from World War I. But you can climb the Arc, too, and the view it offers is unique: “Out to La Défense, the business district of Paris, through the Champs Elysées and Place de la Concorde, all the way to Bastille,” says Renard. The symmetry of the marvelously hectic 12-pronged roundabout that sprouts away from the Arc is fascinating.

Skip the Eiffel Tower, Catch a Different View

Want more awesome views? Tough to beat the selfie ops at the Eiffel Tower, of course, but unique vantage spots abound in Paris. Whether you climb the 200-plus steps or ride the funicular, the views from the base of the Sacre Coeur Basilica in Montmartre are breathtaking.

The fact it’s off the beaten path adds to the charm and romance of Parc de Belleville, and the views of Paris from this green haven in the heart of a residential neighborhood are lovely. Take a picnic and enjoy the panorama from Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. Check out the sights from atop the Saint-Jacques Tower and the Montparnasse Tower. For a bite with a view, nosh and sip at Restaurant Le Zyriab at the Institut du Monde Arabe, the 43 Up The Roof Bar at the Holiday Inn in Saint-Germain-des-Pres and the Le Perchoir bar. When you visit the National Museum of Modern Art, take the elevator to the very top for picture-perfect peeks at Notre Dame Cathedral.

If you’re at Notre Dame, Rougeot recommends “hiking the 400-some-odd steps up to the top. You can get a close-up view of the famous gargoyles along with a 360-degree view of the city. It's a bit of a hike up, though, and I wouldn't recommend it for those who are claustrophobic, because the stairs get tight toward the top.”

Skip the Louvre, Go Small

Barlow loved her visit to the iconic Louvre museum. “Even if you don’t spend time with the exhibits, go into the central courtyard,” she suggests. “As the former palace it is absolutely breathtaking and, from there, it is an easy walk to the Latin Quarter and on to Notre Dame and the ‘La Marais’ area."

Many smaller museums can be unique alternatives to the Louvre. The Sewers of Paris museum is a 1,500-foot underground path dotted with machine models that showcase the history of Paris’ sewer system -- complete with stomach-turning odors. The Musée Carnavalet, inside a 16th-century building, features 140 rooms that chronologically highlight the city’s history. At the Musée de la Magie, check out magic tricks and devices that span three centuries, or catch a magic show. At the Musée du Vin Paris near the Eiffel Tower, admission to exhibits and artifacts that trace the history French winemaking comes with a glass of wine. And at the Musée de Montmartre, the former residence of various artistic greats, stroll the gardens that once inspired August Renoir.

Skip the Ticket (If you qualify)

Certain groups can enjoy free admission to most Paris museums, including disabled visitors (plus one accompanying person), journalists and guests under age 18. Everyone gets free admission on the first Sunday of every month, though this is when you’ll get the longest wait lines, too. Visit the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau website for more info.

Skip the Walking Tour, Tour by Boat

“Start with a river cruise on the Bateaux Mouches, the city’s sightseeing vessels,” suggests Renard. “The Seine is the city’s main artery, from where you will be able to see many of Paris’s top monuments in one trip: Notre-Dame de Paris, the Musée D’Orsay, the Assemblée nationale (the home of the French parliament) and the Eiffel Tower. From the water, you will also be able to have a peek at the interiors of the hôtels particuliers – the luxurious townhouses -- of the island, Île Saint-Louis.”

Skip the Boat, Tour by Citroen

To tour Paris on land, check out 4 Rues Sous 1 Parapluie, a company that drives you around in a Citroen 2CV, the stereotypical French car. But they don’t stop there. The cars are “driven by a stereotypical Frenchman dressed in a stripy sailor top and a beret,” says Renard. “The only things missing are a baguette and a bottle of wine!” Tours are themed to take you shopping, or show you Paris by night, or visit romantic avenues (which ends with dinner for two).

Skip the Champ de Mars, Go Urban

The rolling green expanse of Champs de Mars is one of Paris’ favorite picnic spots and evening hangouts, especially in summer. But don’t miss out on some this city’s many other distinctive parks, many of which are wonderfully repurposed spaces. Parc André Citroen sits on what was once a Citroen manufacturing plant and features various glass structures; the helium balloon tethered on-site will whisk you 500 feet into the air, weather permitting.

The Promenade Plantée sits along an abandoned railway viaduct and is a walker’s dream; the nearly three miles of paths and tunnels take you past myriad trees and plants. Nature lovers congregate at La Recyclerie, an old rail station where you can now stroll past trees and vegetable patches, or take a gardening class. Also, ask about the slew of community gardens peppered throughout the city.

The false post from a website called Departed Media features this headline: "Bill Gates: 'I think Donald Trump will go down to history as one of the greatest presidents, just like Reagan.'"

On a page littered with advertisements, an image of a fake tweet they claim is from Microsoft founder Bill Gates says, "After 17 minutes [sic] phone call with President Trump, I think he will go down to history as one of the greatest presidents just like Reagan."

A detailed search of Twitter by ABC News shows that Bill Gates has never tweeted about Donald Trump -- or Ronald Reagan. A Twitter search for the text of the tweet itself also showed no results.

Two email addresses associated with Departed Media did not reply to ABC News' request for comment.

The only tweet from Gates on Jan. 22, the date indicated in the fake news story, is a congratulatory message to Jeff Raikes, the chair of the Stanford University Board of Trustees.

The tweet in the article appears to be a Photoshopped image of that Stanford tweet: the timestamp is changed from 7:23 p.m. to 4:23 p.m., though the date remains the same. The number of retweets and likes noted on the genuine tweet are virtually the same as the Photoshopped image.

Congratulations @jeffraikes. Stanford is lucky to have you. — Bill Gates (@BillGates) January 23, 2017

The spelling mistake and awkward wording in the tweet is a hallmark of fake news stories written outside the United States.

A Facebook module on the page indicates that the post has gotten 100,000 likes on the social media network. The story appears to have originated with Departed Media roughly two weeks ago and has been posted again on dozens of pages since then.

"Yes Mr Gates, we support President Trump, he is a right president for USA," reads one comment, while other commenters point out the post is indeed fake news.

Bill Gates did meet with then-President-elect Trump on Dec. 13, telling reporters that he had a wide-ranging conversation on innovation. Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters the next day that it was a "great meeting."

Later that day on CNBC, Gates said Trump's message has centered on "where he sees things not as good as he'd like" but later said Trump had an opportunity to rally the country around major causes like President John F. Kennedy's effort to develop the space program during the 1960s.

And while Gates did not endorse either candidate during the 2016 election, he did make a few brief comments about the campaign.

In a June interview with STAT News, Gates said, "we're going to work with whoever's elected," though he noted that "Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have more experience on global health," a cause that the Gates Foundation is committed to.

Also in June, asked by a Recode reporter about Trump not signing a philanthropy pledge, Gates quipped, "He hasn't been known for his philanthropy. He's been known for other things."

But Jackman insisted he's OK.

"It is fine, it is all done, all fixed, all out. Thank you for asking," he said at the Friday night debut of the film at the Berlin Film Festival.

Jackman revealed Monday that he had another basal cell carcinoma on his nose, and tweeted out a picture of his bandaged nose, and urged people to wear sunscreen.

But his focus on Friday was the "Logan" premiere. It's the third installment of the "Wolverine" spinoff series, and it may be the most ambitious. It's competing at the Berlin Film Festival, which was a goal for Jackman when he signed on to do it.

"I didn't want it to be seen as a comic book movie, I wanted it to be seen as a film on its own," he said.

The movie is set in a dystopian future and sees Wolverine caring for an aged Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart).

Stewart said he didn't need any convincing to get on board.

"I had no doubts whatsoever. When I began to understand some of the content of this film, I was all for it. The film is unusual, very different and I think remarkable," he said.

Jackman has said that this movie is the end of the road for him and Wolverine. So what does he remember of his last day playing the mutant?

"The last day was an action day and I was sore and hurt and it was great," he laughed.Whoopi Goldberg is no stranger to criticizing Donald Trump's policies, but when it comes to the president's children, she draws a line.

"The View" co-host discussed Wednesday reports about Tiffany Trump getting snubbed during New York Fashion Week earlier this week. While sitting front row at the Philipp Plein show, fashion writers tweeted that no one wanted to sit with Trump.

Former Wall Street Journal style columnist Christina Binkley tweeted Monday, "Nobody wants to sit next to Tiffany Trump at Philipp Plein, so they moved and the seats by her are empty."

"You know what Tiffany? I'm supposed to go to a couple more shows. ... I'm coming to sit with you," Goldberg said Wednesday. "Because nobody is talking politics at the [shows], you're looking at fashion! She doesn't want to talk about her dad. She's looking at the fashion!"

Calling the incident "mean," Goldberg, 61, continued: "Girl, I will sit next to you because I've been there where people say, 'Ooh, we're not going to sit next to you. I'll find your a-- and sit next to you."

She then shared a photo, which she captioned, "Empty seats next to Tiffany Trump."

But by Thursday, Binkley took to Twitter to clarify what occurred, downplaying her original reporting.

"The two seats remained empty for about 2 minutes before others sat there," she wrote. "Then Philipp Plein's sister made them move so she could sit there."

"It’s easy to assume from a photograph that she sat there, humiliated, with empty seats by her, which wasn’t the case," Binkley told People magazine.

"She was surrounded by photographers," Binkley said, referring to Trump, "and the two women who moved were leaning away -- they clearly didn’t want to be in those photographs.

"But I don’t think Tiffany really noticed that, because she was active with her friends and the photographers."

"The View" co-host Whoopi Goldberg responded to the Monday incident two days later on her daytime talk show, offering to sit with Trump.

ABC News reached out to Binkley, but did not receive a response.A Tennessee man is being treated for multiple gunshot wounds after sheriff's deputies in the Florida Panhandle say he pointed a gun at them during a confrontation outside a motel Thursday night.

The deputies were looking for Randy Carl Patton, 30, of Antioch, Tennessee, after being notified by police in Nashville that he was apparently suicidal, according to an Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office news release. Police in Tennessee told Florida authorities that Patton had texted his wife a photo of himself with a gun and made statement about committing suicide.

Deputies spotted his car at the Days Inn in Destin, which is west of Panama City Beach, Florida, around 7 p.m. Thursday, according to the release. Deputies were going to the office to check on Patton's status when he came out of a room and confronted them.

Investigators said Patton initially complied with deputies' commands but then raised a gun toward them. The deputies fired their weapons. Patton was struck multiple times and a 60-year-old woman who happened to walk out of a room was also struck in the leg.

The incident was captured on body cameras worn by the deputies.

The woman is being treated at a hospital in Fort Walton Beach. Patton was also taken to a hospital where he told medical staff that he was trying to get the deputies to kill him, according to the news release.

Patton now faces charges of resisting an officer with violence and assault on a law enforcement officer. He is still in the hospital. His condition wasn't released.

The deputies were not injured. Investigators said they've been suspended with pay pending an investigation by the agency's Office of Professional Standards."That's the first thing I'm gonna do as president.

SMALL PROTEST IN FRONT OF DNC HEADQUARTERS OVER DEBATES ABC's MARYALICE PARKS: It may be Republican debate night, but this afternoon about 100 Democrats gathered outside of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC, to protest their party's handling of debates this election cycle. The group included Gov. Martin O'Malley's campaign manager and some senior campaign staff. O'Malley has been calling for more debates and an end to the so-called "exclusivity clause." His campaign was ready today with posters and signs. O'Malley's campaign manager Dave Hamrick told ABC News he thinks the DNC will cave, saying all of this pressure and disagreement is not "sustainable."

6 p. m. debate featuring Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum and George Pataki is underway.

CANDIDATES PLAY FOR SIDEBAR STATUS



ABC’s RICK KLEIN: The most common refrain among campaign operatives in advance of the debate: Does it really have to be about Trump?

The truth is that it does, and they know that it does. To the extent that these are predictable affairs, it’s reasonable to expect a feistier debate, not so much about Trump as it is about who will stand up to Trump.

But another intriguing storyline with be the candidate who plays for the sidebar. Several aides to rival campaigns have cited Ben Carson’s surprise breakout in the last debate as a template – and evidence that you can “win” even a debate in this environment without just mixing it up with Trump.

One aide to a campaign with this longer-game strategy laughed when I asked about campaign strategy, pointing out that these are dynamic and hard-to-game-plan events: “Everyone watches too many ‘West Wing’ reruns!”

ABC’s JESSICA HOPPER and JOSH HASKELL: Sen. Rand Paul arrived at a shooting range in Simi Valley this morning. Wearing blue jeans and Ray Ban sunglasses, Paul shot two rifles and a pistol. Paul elected to shoot a rifle first because he said his neck was bothering him. He also asked for ear muffs towards the end. After examining his target, some of which were labeled "IRS Tax Code," Paul talked to reporters. He laughed when asked if shooting was helping him relax ahead of the debate. He said he has only shot around 10 times in his life but enjoys it.

Favorite He used the word ‘combat’ several times to describe tonight's GOP debate and discussed his plan to take down GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, saying that ultimately people would get past Trump's celebrity and that it is important to expose Trump for who he is.

“He's recently come to join the Republican Party and he's trying to come to join as a conservative but I think there's a great deal of evidence pointing in the opposite direction that he's really not a conservative and so I think we will have that debate,” said Paul, who has repeatedly called Trump a fake conservative. Paul went on to argue, "Ultimately the issues will be a problem for Trump when people get beyond the celebrity. I do think that his attack on Fiorina probably started to wake people up. I think Governor Perry leaving the race started to wake people up that my goodness, a governor of a large Republican state is leaving, but we're keeping a reality TV Star who really shows no evidence of really being serious about anything." The Kentucky Senator was asked about Gov. Chris Christie, who he fought with during the first Republican debate. "We're all in and I'm ready for combat,” Paul answered.

HOW HILLARY CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN IS SPENDING DEBATE NIGHT ABC’s LIZ KREUTZ reports: Meanwhile, what’s Hillary Clinton's campaign up to tonight?

Hosting house parties!

The Clinton campaign has organized over 100 “Women for Hillary” GOP debate-night watch parties in roughly 20 cities across the country for women supporters a and volunteers to watch the debate. According to the campaign, “while the Republican candidates bend over backwards to offer extreme, out-of-touch and out-of-date positions, women supporters will discuss Hillary’s record as a champion of women and girls.” In addition, the campaign has launched a Pinterest page — “Organizing 101: House Parties for Hillary” — with instructions on how you (aka “everyday Americans”) can host one, too. Here are some of the cities hosting a "Hillary for America" GOP Debate Watch Party tonight: Boca Raton, FL Austin, TX Charleston, SC Minneapolis, MN Washington, D.C.

SCOTT WALKER’S DEBATE DAY DISCOUNT

ABC’s MEREDITH MCGRAW: Is Scott Walker’s campaign holding a going out of business sale?





That’s what Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Holly Shulman asked on Twitter today after the Walker campaign advertised 40 percent off all merchandise in its online store for one day only.

Among the items for sale: Red, white and blue bumper stickers (two for $10), limited edition signed rally placards ($75), and “Walker for President” embroidered fleece pullovers that retail for $65.00. As the website notes, “All proceeds are invested in our campaign to elect Scott Walker for President in 2016.” Walker had been riding high in the polls both nationally and in Iowa, but as Donald Trump took more of the spotlight this summer, Walker’s support has crumpled. Recent national polls put him in the low single digits. Tonight, Walker takes the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in an effort to win back some of that early support. But Walker, who is viewed as the Midwestern foil to Trump’s gilded, showy style, isn’t closing shop yet. Despite canceling campaign events in Michigan and California next week, he will continue to campaign throughout Iowa and South Carolina. And Walker’s campaign isn’t the only trying to move some merchandise in honor of tonight’s debate. Ted Cruz is offering his supporters 20 percent off items in his campaign store like camo print hats.

HOW JEB BUSH IS PREPPING FOR TONIGHT’S DEBATEDonald Trump took aim Friday at one of his favorite targets, the media, calling a number of news organizations the "enemy of the American People!"

"The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" he wrote.

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

The message was actually the second version of the tweet. The first, which was deleted, was posted at 4:32 p.m. and only included three media organizations, capped off by the word "SICK!"

That full tweet read: "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @CNN, @NBCNews and many more) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people. SICK!"

The next version was posted 16 minutes later and added ABC News and CBS to the list.

Trump's attacks on the press are not new. His complaints about the media were a common thread of his campaign rallies, and he regularly pointed to the press pen at his events, lambasting reporters as "the most dishonest people."

The tweets come one day after he held a press conference in the White House where he criticized the media repeatedly.

"Many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth. And will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward, we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay, too," Trump said at the press conference on Thursday.

"The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people," he said.

"One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!" says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA calls it differently! Dishonest — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

Trump is not alone in his White House in expressing a distaste for the media. Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, has called the media "the opposition party."

The Society of Professional Journalists condemned Trump's Friday tweet.An Indiana semi-truck driver involved in a crash that killed five people in northern Illinois has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Francisco Espinal-Quiroz pleaded guilty in November to five counts of reckless homicide and falsifying entries in his logbook, which tracked how many hours he was behind the wheel. He was sentenced Thursday during hearing attended by relatives of the victims.

Espinal-Quiroz told the families: "I'm so sorry."

Espinal-Quiroz, 53, was driving along Interstate 55 near Channahon when his vehicle slammed into vehicles stopped at a construction zone on July 21, 2014. The crash killed five people in three vehicles.

In one SUV, including Kimberly Britton, 43, and Piper Britton, 11, both of Urbana, died at the scene. Timothy Osburn, 64, of Channahon, died in a Chicago hospital more than two weeks later.

Two other women, Ulrike Blopleh, 48, of Channahon, and Vicky Palacios, 54, of Coal City, also were killed when Espinal-Quiroz's truck struck their vehicles. Three of Blopleh's children were injured in the crash.

During the hearing, relatives of the victims told Will County Circuit Judge David Carlson how they'd suffered after losing their loved ones. Some called for stricter laws regulating the trucking industry.

Espinal-Quiroz is blind in his right eye but had a waiver to drive a truck through Indiana.

Under state sentencing laws and credit for time served, Espinal-Quiroz's remaining time in prison will be closer to 2 1/2 years.

Espinal-Quiroz's offenses could have been eligible for probation or up to 28 years in prison, but prosecutors agreed to seek no more than a 15-year sentence as part of his plea.Republican Sen. John McCain delivered a withering critique of President Donald Trump in a speech Friday that highlighted fractures within the GOP as the new administration struggles to overcome a chaotic start.

Speaking in Germany at the Munich Security Conference, McCain didn't mention the president's name, according to the prepared text, while he lamented a shift in the United States and Europe away from the "universal values" that forged the Western alliance seven decades ago. McCain is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.

Trump has repeatedly questioned the value of NATO, calling the military pact obsolete, and sought instead to stoke a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Trump's defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has accused Putin of wanting to break NATO.

McCain, who has openly quarreled with the president, said "more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent."

The senator lamented the "hardening resentment we see toward immigrants, and refugees, and minority groups, especially Muslims." During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to stop Muslims from entering the U.S. and shortly after taking office issued an executive order banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations.

McCain also said the alliance's founders would be "alarmed by the growing inability, and even unwillingness, to separate truth from lies." While bashing the news media for being dishonest, Trump has ignored facts and sought to blame others for his miscues. Trump tweeted Friday that the news media are "the enemy of the American people."

The senator said he's aware there is "profound concern across Europe and the world that America is laying down the mantle of global leadership." But he said that's not the message they would hear from him or other American leaders "who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend." Mattis had already addressed the conference. Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly were are scheduled to give speeches.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports ( http://bit.ly/2m2advm ) that Michael Bowman faces a possible death sentence following the Troup County jury's verdict Thursday in the May 31, 2014, killing of Griffin police officer Kevin Jordan.

Jurors are scheduled to hear testimony Friday for Bowman's sentencing. He faces a possible sentence of death, life without parole, or life with the possibility of parole.

The jury deliberated for more than three hours before finding Bowman guilty but mentally ill.

Bowman testified that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after three deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He said he didn't remember shooting Jordan five times in a Waffle House parking lot after a disturbance inside the restaurant.

"I just remember him (Jordan) telling us to leave, but I don't remember nothing else," Bowman testified.

Griffin is in west Georgia's Spalding County, but Bowman's trial was moved about 50 miles away to Troup County because of concerns that publicity surrounding the case had jeopardized his right to a fair trial.

Bowman is white. Jordan, who was black, was a 43-year-old father of seven.

Bowman, his girlfriend Chantell Mixon, and his brother Tyler Taylor spent several hours at a bar before going to the Waffle House, but Bowman said he didn't drink that night.

The three were asked to leave the restaurant when Mixon created a disturbance, demanding to be served. Bowman shot Jordan in the back after the officer walked Mixon out of the Waffle House.

It was in October 2015, not 2014.

A corrected version of the story is below:

Lawsuit: Tiffany pushed out employee with cancer mutation

A former employee of Tiffany & Co. says the jewelry maker pushed her out of the New York-based company after she had her breasts and ovaries removed to avoid getting cancer

By MICHELLE R. SMITH

Associated Press

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A former employee of Tiffany & Co. says the jewelry maker pushed her out after she had her breasts and ovaries removed to avoid getting cancer.

Lisa O'Rourke alleges in a federal lawsuit that the New York-based company discriminated against her because she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for developing cancer, and she was compelled to have surgeries that her lawyer says were life-saving.

Tiffany is fighting the lawsuit, filed in November in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, and said it believes the allegations are "completely without merit."

O'Rourke said she decided to sue, and speak about her experience, because she wants to spread the word to Tiffany's many female customers, especially high-profile women affected by breast cancer. She specifically cited Angelina Jolie, who has been photographed in Tiffany, and Lady Gaga, who's starring in a new Tiffany ad and has spoken about a close friend stricken with breast cancer.

"I wish they knew some of the real story. Would they really want to support a company who treats an employee like that? In a time of need, they just toss 'em out," she said.

Tiffany spokesman Nathan Strauss wrote in an email that "we support equal opportunities in employment, place great importance on the health and well-being of our employees, and strive to eliminate discrimination in any form."

O'Rourke, 45, was director of strategic sourcing for Tiffany at its manufacturing facility in Cumberland, Rhode Island.

Her maternal grandmother and aunt both died of cancer, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and tested positive for a gene mutation that puts women at high risk for developing breast and ovarian cancers, O'Rourke said. In 2013, O'Rourke learned she was carrying the same gene mutation.

Jolie had her breasts removed in 2013 after discovering she carries a different gene mutation associated with higher breast cancer risk. In 2015, Jolie also had her ovaries removed.

O'Rourke made a similar choice. She took a leave to have her ovaries and breasts removed in January and February 2014, and said she told Tiffany there would be more surgeries down the line.

She returned to work that May, she said. When time came for a third surgery in July, she said she was initially asked to reschedule and told she did not have enough accrued time to take more leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, but was eventually told her job would be held. She returned to work the next month after an unpaid leave.

In October 2015, she alerted the company she would need another leave for the fourth surgery. A month later, she was told her job was being eliminated. She said she was offered a different job with less compensation and responsibility, but she declined it.

Her lawyer said it's a case of discrimination due to her genetic condition.

"They needed to make reasonable accommodations," Kathleen Hagerty said.

The lawsuit asks for unspecified punitive damages, back pay and attorney's fees.

O'Rourke said she's not in it for the money, but is motivated in part by her two daughters, who have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene mutation.

"If they do inherit this gene, they will someday decide how they want to proceed, and I would be heartbroken if they had to endure the same type of discrimination that I did," she said. "At a time when one should focus on getting better, I had the added worry of losing my job and not being able to financially support my family."Hillary Clinton was asked if she would release the transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street.





"That's a good question, it's a very fair question. And let me answer it this way. . . ," Clinton started out.





"I have released 33 years of tax returns and you can go to my website and see the last eight years of my tax returns," Clinton said.







She went on to argue that it's a "new request" to release transcripts of speeches, and that she'll release her transcripts once every candidate agrees to release their tax returns.



Hi everyone, welcome to the 2014 Emmy Awards liveblog and in case you are just joining the red carpet coverage you missed a lot -- Hayden Panetierre is having a girl, Amanda Peet is pregnant again, wow. I'm Michael Rothman and I'm here with Lesley Messer, should be a wild ride!!A South Florida college student says he was startled when he saw a large snake crawl under his roommate's car.

Nova Southeastern University students Ross Price and his roommate James Hand called an exterminator Feb. 1, but were told it was too late to send someone. So they called the Davie Police Department.

The SunSentinel ( http://bit.ly/2lpDbs9 ) reports Officer Tony Bernardo — the go-to guy for dealing with wildlife — and two other officers responded. The snake put up a fight and moved deep into the Toyota Camry's engine compartment. Eventually, they pulled out an 11-foot reticulated python.

Police spokesman Mark Leone says it was likely a pet because it was in a residential area. The snake was turned over to a company licensed by the state to care for exotic animals.

Information from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/Trump will be sworn-in today as the 45th president of the United States.

Good morning! Donald J. Trump will be sworn-in today as the 45th president of the United States.

First, Trump, Pence and their families are scheduled to attend services at St. John’s Episcopal Church. Trump will then head to the White House for a tea and coffee ceremony with the Obamas.

The

president will then escort the president-elect to his swearing-in ceremony at the US Capitol by

motorcade.

The swearing-in ceremony will take place shortly after they arrive, and Trump will take the oath of office promptly at noon, which marks the official transfer of power.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair launched a new campaign Friday to persuade Britons to change their minds about leaving the European Union.

Blair urged voters to speak out against the government's drive to exit the EU at any cost, saying it could damage future generations. He argued last year's vote to leave was "based on imperfect knowledge," and that Britons voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit.

"As these terms become clear, it is their right to change their mind," he said. "Our mission is to persuade them to do so."

Blair argued that leaving the 28-nation bloc was not inevitable and that the people favoring Brexit took advantage of a mood of revolt stemming in part from changes in the global economy.

"The Brexiteers were the beneficiaries of this wave; now they want to freeze it to a day in June 2016," he said. "They will say the will of the people can't alter. It can."

He plans to start an institute and build an alliance across party lines to create a movement with weight and reach to fight the notion of Brexit at any cost.

The former Labour leader said Prime Minister Theresa May's government has become obsessed by Brexit to the exclusion of any other issue. Pressing issues on challenges in the modern economy, the National Health Service, communities left behind by globalization and immigration controls are being ignored, he said.

"This is not the time for retreat, indifference or despair," he said. "But the time to rise up in defense for what we believe."

It is not immediately clear how much support Blair may have in creating a new wave of sentiment against May's plans. The once-popular Labor leader suffered a fall from grace in supporting the United States in its intervention in Iraq that led to the ouster of Saddam Hussein.Transcript for Go inside this year's Governors Ball

Four years ago, President Barack Obama won reelection over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by a margin of 332-206 electoral votes.



Television networks began to call the election for Obama shortly after 11 pm, when a combined 74 electoral votes came in for the president upon the closure of polls in California, Oregon and Washington, and 18 votes from Ohio -- which had been too-close-to-call since closing earlier in the night -- put the Democrat over the top.



Despite the apparent results, Romney waited almost three more hours to call Obama to concede, leaving the candidates to give their concession and victory speeches early Wednesday morning. Romney, expecting victory, reportedly did not draft a concession speech in advance, eschewing the norm of preparing two speeches.



Both candidates urged the political parties to work together in the aftermath of the election.



“The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing,” said Romney. “Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.”



Added Obama, “I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America.”President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped U.S. Century Bank chairman Alexander Acosta as his nominee for labor secretary.

The news came one day after fast food executive Andrew Puzder withdrew himself from consideration on Wednesday.

Aside from his work at Century Bank, Acosta has experience serving on the National Labor Relations Board and has an extensive background in law, including teaching employment law.

But he has courted controversy as well, overseeing a plea deal with financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while he served as a U.S. attorney in Florida that was kept secret from Epstein's alleged victims. Trump, as well as former President Bill Clinton, spoke highly of Epstein before allegations surfaced in 2005.

“I've known Jeff for fifteen years," Trump said in a 2002 New York Magazine story. "Terrific guy.”

Here is everything you need to know about Acosta, Trump’s choice to lead the labor department:

Name: R. Alexander Acosta

Hometown: Miami, Florida

Education: Acosta has his bachelor’s degree and his law degree from Harvard.

What he does: Acosta currently serves as chairman of the board of U.S. Century Bank, the largest domestically owned Hispanic community bank in Florida, a post he took up in 2013. He is also the dean of the Florida International University (FIU) law school, a post he’s held since 2009.

What he used to do: Acosta formerly was a member of the National Labor Relations Board.

In 2003, President George W. Bush selected Acosta to serve as assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s civil rights division. Acosta made history as the first Hispanic man to hold the rank of assistant attorney general. The Miami native went on to serve as the U.S. attorney for Florida’s southern district.

Acosta started off his law career as a clerk for Justice Samuel Alito, when Alito was an appeals judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He then went on to practice law in Washington D.C. at the Kirkland & Ellis, specializing in employment and labor issues.

He also taught classes at George Mason University on employment law, disability-based discrimination law and civil rights law.

What you might not know about him: If confirmed, Acosta would be the first Hispanic member to serve in Trump's Cabinet.

About his Senate testimony for American Muslim civil rights

As dean of FIU Law, Acosta testified in front of a Senate judiciary subcommittee on March 29, 2011, arguing for the protection of the American Muslims’ civil rights in a post-9/11 America.

Acosta read to the Senate subcommittee members two accounts of American Muslims - the first of his FIU law student that enlisted in the U.S. military after the 9/11 attacks.

The second account was of a young girl who after 9/11 was suspended from school because she would not remove her hijab.

“[School officials] could have taken this opportunity to say that fear is wrong, that respect and tolerance for another’s faith is right, and that these are founding principles of our nation,” Acosta said at the time. “Instead, the school officials fed the fear, signaling to Nashala’s fellow sixth-graders that the headscarf, and by extension that her faith, should be suppressed.”

Acosta went on to praise the actions of the Justice Department in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and President George W. Bush’s visit to the Islamic Center of Washington D.C. on Sept. 17, 2001.

“These efforts following 9/11 were important. They set a tone. They reminded those who might be tempted to take out their anger on an entire community that such actions were wrong,” Acosta said.

His controversial deal with Jeffrey Epstein

While serving as the U.S. Attorney for Florida’s southern district, Acosta’s office cut a deal with Epstein, a wealthy financier who was being investigated by the FBI for allegations that he had engaged in sexual misconduct with up to dozens of underage girls.

The 2008 agreement -- called a secretive “sweetheart deal” by the lawyers for two of the alleged underage victims -- effectively immunized Epstein from federal prosecution in exchange for his guilty plea in state court and a light jail sentence.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of solicitation of a prostitute and one count of solicitation of a prostitute who is a minor. He spent 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach county jail and was released in 2009. Epstein is registered as a level three sex offender.

The Epstein deal, which Acosta oversaw and approved, remains the subject of an ongoing victims-rights lawsuit in federal court filed in 2008 against the federal government. Acosta is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.

The judge overseeing the case ruled that Acosta’s office had the legal obligation to inform the victims of the agreement with Epstein, but there has been no resolution on the question of whether the deal should be invalidated, as the victims seek.

In a 2011 letter, Acosta defended the deal and accused Epstein’s defense lawyers of a “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors.”

Acosta argued that while critics think the prosecution should have been tougher, and "evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view," if more evidence was available to them at the time perhaps "the outcome may have been different.”

“Our judgment in this case, based on the evidence known at the time, was that it was better to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex offender and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial with a reduced likelihood of success,” Acosta wrote.Welcome to the GMA 40 live blog to follow ABC News' own Dan Childs as he attempts to go an eye-popping 40 hours without sleep.





As Dan starts his sleepless saga, here's a few fun facts about sleep.An 18-year-old man who authorities say shot a friend and then posed for a selfie with the dying teen has been convicted of a less serious charge.

Maxwell Morton was convicted Thursday of third-degree murder in the shooting of 16-year-old Ryan Mangan in February 2015.

The Westmoreland County jury deliberated six hours before rejecting prosecutors' arguments that Morton intentionally killed Mangan.

Morton testified Thursday that the teens were playing with a handgun and he thought it was not loaded when he pointed at Mangan and pulled the trigger.

He said he took the selfie to document what happened and said he planned to kill himself.

Morton testified that people think that he's a monster, but that he's actually a "chill kind of guy."

At times, he broke down in tears while describing his friendship with Mangan and the details of his death.

Morton displayed little emotion as the verdict was announced, but defense attorney Pat Thomassey said his client was pleased.

"He's out from under a possible life sentence. The poor kid did a lot of stupid things that we had to overcome at trial," Thomassey said.

Morton faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced in May.

Mangan's parents declined to comment as they left the courtroom.

Earlier this week, jurors were shown the selfie during testimony from a Springville, Wisconsin, teenager who said Morton bragged about the killing as they played an online video game that evening, saying he "got his first body."

The teen said he thought it was a prank until Morton texted a link of a news item about the death and sent the selfie via Snapchat. The message was followed with a text that said, "Told you," he testified.

The teenager said he immediately took a screen shot of the selfie and told his mother, who called police in Pennsylvania and testified she told authorities, "you probably won't believe this, but we have a Snapchat of the murder."

A forensic pathologist testified Wednesday that Mangan didn't die immediately and "would have survived with appropriate medical care."Davis/White may not be completely sure what the future holds but we have heard on more than one occasion that @Meryl_Davis wants a puppy!Where to begin?

Asked about the seventh season of the hit FX series, Murphy told Cohen, "I don't have a title, but the season that we begin shooting in June is going to be about the election that we just went through. I think that will be interesting for a lot of people."

As to whether that means someone will be cast to play President Trump, Murphy simply said, "Maybe."

FX has renewed the show, which focuses on a different story line each season, through a ninth season, according to Variety.Spain's Princess Cristina was found not guilty in a tax fraud case Friday, while her husband was convicted and sentenced to more than six years in prison.

A panel of judges ruled that Cristina, the sister of King Felipe VI, will be required to pay nearly 265,000 euros (more than $280,000) in fines because the court considers that she indirectly benefited from the fraud.

Her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, was found guilty of evading taxes, fraud and various other charges. He was sentenced to six years and three months in prison in a decision that can be appealed to the Supreme Court.

The trial centered on accusations that Urdangarin used his former title, Duke of Palma, to embezzle about 6 million euros ($6.6 million) in public funds for the nonprofit Noos Institute.

The institute organized conferences and sports-related events and was run with a partner, Diego Torres, who was sentenced to eight years and a half in jail in Friday's ruling by a provincial court in Palma de Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands.

Among the companies they used was Aizoon, a real estate consulting company jointly owned by Cristina and Urdangarin.

A lawyer with Cristina's defense team, Miquel Roca, said that the princess was "satisfied for the acknowledgement of her innocence" but that she was still convinced that her husband wasn*t guilty.

"If we believed in the judicial system when the princess was made to sit in the dock, I think citizens can trust in it when she's absolved," Roca told reporters in Barcelona.

A spokesman for the Royal House told Spanish media that the royal family respected the court's decision.

There were no immediate comment from Felipe and Queen Letizia, who received news of the ruling during a visit to a museum in Madrid with the Hungarian president.Dev Patel calls his role in the Oscar-nominated film “Lion,” “the most nourishing thing I’ve been able to dive into.”

"For a British-Indian guy, roles like this are few and far in between, if not never. This really, when I read it, was such a profound script," Patel said on ABC News’ “Popcorn with Peter Travers.” "I was just a puddle of tears. I just hoped one day those words could, you know, move past my lips."

Patel plays Saroo Brierley, who was separated from his brother in India at the age of 7 while scavenging for food on a train. The film follows Brierley’s true-life journey of tracking down his birth mother.

Patel said he had to jump through hoops for the role, for which he is nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor.

Here are five things to know about the Oscar-nominated actor.

1. His mom is the reason he got into acting

Patel said his mom would take the train to and from work, and on one day during her commute, she saw an advertisement for a casting call.

"She tore it out and didn’t tell me until the day before. And she’s like, 'Alright, by the way, we’re bunking school tomorrow. I want to take you to this thing,'" Patel recalled.

2. His first big break was the UK television series, 'Skins'

The audition to which his mother ended up taking him was for the British teen TV drama, “Skins.”

"We turned up and there [were] all these drama students doing their vocal warm ups. And I’m in my uniform with my mom," he recalled. "I was like, 'Ugh.' And that’s how I got into it."

Patel was cast as Anwar Kharral, a Muslim teen, and the role was written specifically for him.

3. He struggled to find work after 'Slumdog Millionaire'

Though he rose to international stardom for his role as Jamal Malik in the 2008 Oscar-winning film, “Slumdog Millionaire,” Patel said he struggled to find work afterwards.

"There’s been times after 'Slumdog [Millionaire],' where I looked out and there wasn’t a sea of roles," Patel said.

"There wasn’t anything, and I wasn’t working," he said. "I just stepped off this red carpet, surrounded by all these amazing actors and Oscar winners and there was nothing."

4. He admits that he has faced typecasting as an actor

Patel said that he feels typecasting -- whether by looks or race -- is a reality that he and other actors constantly face.

"You see it changing," he said, "but sometimes you just want to work. You want to keep the lights on and pay the rent."

5. He underwent intense preparation for his role in 'Lion'

In order to play Saroo Brierley, Patel trained physically, grew out his hair and went through dialogue coaching to perfect an Australian accent.

"I called up my manager and I was like, 'For the next eight months, I don’t want any distractions. I don’t want you to send me any other work or anything. I want to commit every fiber of my being to get this journey right. This script demands it. And Saroo and the family, they deserve it,'" Patel said.Donald Trump Jr., son of the Republican presidential nominee, took to Twitter on Monday to publish a graphic that likened Syrian refugees to Skittles.

We’re been spoiled by the action so far, but this is where the tournament starts to get tense; the second round of fixtures began yesterday with Brazil held to a goalless draw by Mexico, and dreams of glory start to fade – and funnily enough, it could be the end for the holders Spain before the day is out!Roman Polanski's attorney has asked a Los Angeles judge to unseal testimony given by a former prosecutor who handled the fugitive director's sexual assault case. It is Polanski's latest bid to end the nearly 40-year-old case.

Polanski's attorney Harland Braun wrote the judge a letter made public Thursday that he is seeking to unseal the letter because it is crucial to attempts to resolve Polanski's case.

The Academy Award-winning director pleaded guilty in 1977 to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl but fled to France in 1978 when the now-deceased judge in the case suggested in private remarks that he would renege on a plea bargain and sentencing agreement.

Los Angeles prosecutors have repeatedly sought Polanski's extradition but have been rebuffed by courts in Switzerland and Poland, two of the countries where the Oscar winner has been able to safely travel.

The director has alleged that he was mistreated by a judge and prosecutors, but subsequent judges have ruled the Oscar winner must return to Los Angeles for the case to be resolved.

Braun's letter seeks the unsealing of testimony from retired Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson, who handled Polanski's case. Gunson gave the testimony over three days in 2010 in case he was unable to testify at any future proceedings in the case.

Braun contends Gunson's testimony might help Polanski's argument that he has already served his time in the 1977 case by spending more than 300 days in jail and house arrest in Switzerland during a failed extradition effort in 2010.

Los Angeles Superior Court Scott Gordon, the presiding judge over criminal matters in Los Angeles County, set a hearing for Feb. 24. Polanski will not attend, Braun said.

Switzerland refused to extradite Polanski because it was not allowed to review Gunson's testimony. Polanski's lawyers sought to unseal the testimony, but prosecutors objected to unsealing the transcripts, and a judge agreed.

In a 1977 deal with prosecutors, Polanski pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape for having sex with the underage girl during a photo shoot in Los Angeles.

He was ordered to undergo a psychiatric study at the state prison in Chino, where he served 42 days.

Gunson and Polanski's attorney have said they understood from a private conversation with the judge handling the case that the time in the prison would serve as Polanski's punishment.

However, lawyers for the Polish-born director said the judge later reneged on the agreement and suggested Polanski would go back to prison. Polanski then fled to France, and his travel has been restricted to Poland, Switzerland and France ever since.

Polanski sought a dismissal of the case in 2008, but his motion was denied in a ruling that was upheld by an appellate court. A judge in 2014 rejected Polanski's request of a new hearing.

His victim, Samantha Geimer, has said she forgives Polanski and has repeatedly called for the case against him to be dismissed.

The Associated Press does not typically name sex abuse victims, but Geimer has publicly identified herself in court filings, interviews and a memoir.

Polanski won an Academy Award for best director for his 2002 film "The Pianist" and was nominated for 1974's "Chinatown" and 1979's "Tess."

Anthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAPCounty commissioners in immigrant-rich Miami-Dade voted Friday to uphold their Cuban-born mayor's order to cooperate with federal immigration officials, drawing shouts of "shame on you" from those hoping to make their community a sanctuary city.

Though it's the only U.S. county where more than half the population is foreign-born, Miami-Dade has bucked a trend among some cities that have sought to defy federal immigration crackdowns out of sympathy with their large migrant populations.

The commissioners, voting 9-3, backed the order of Mayor Carlos Gimenez that was delivered after the administration of President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the so-called sanctuary cities.

"This is a country that opened arms to everyone, allowed opportunities to everyone. But this is also a country of law," county commissioner Rebeca Sosa, also of Cuban descent, said before the vote taken in a special public session. "I am so sad to see that people are afraid of something that has nothing to do with immigration. This was just a financial decision."

In emotional public testimony, dozens spoke against the order, including school-age children of deportees, young people brought to the U.S. without legal permission as children, construction workers, lawyers and rights activists.

At one point, four school-age girls and a boy stepped up to the podium holding hands with Nora Sandigo, who has a foundation that helps and houses children whose parents have been deported.

"These kids are orphans because they took their parents away from them. I can't stand this much pain," Sandigo said.

Many of the people gathered at the meeting stood and shouted obscenities at the commissioners when they voted to uphold the mayor.

Hatian-born Jean Monestime was among the three commissioners to vote against the motion.

"Today cannot be about money. It must be about justice," Monestime said. "It must be about dignity it must be about the spirit of our community."

The debate has highlighted a divide between Cuban-Americans and immigrants from other countries, stemming largely from a former immigration policy that gave preferential treatment to Cubans fleeing the island's communist government. For more than 50 years, Cubans arrived to open arms in the U.S. and were able to become citizens much more easily than people from other countries.

"Cuban families, in a general way, haven't been as aware of what it means to be undocumented in this country," said Michael Bustamante, a Florida International University expert on contemporary Cuban history. "They have had a different process to achieve legal status. Not to say that they haven't faced other difficulties."

Miami-Dade counts 51.7 percent of its people as born abroad. But the share of immigrants living here without permission is lower than places like Houston or Atlanta, precisely because Cuban immigrants could quickly get employment authorization cards, a Social Security number and become legal residents.

But that's changed. In January, then President Barack Obama announced that Cubans without residency or visas would be treated as any other immigrant with similar status.

In 2013, Miami-Dade commissioners passed a resolution that local law enforcement officers would comply with federal immigration officials only in cases of serious charges or convictions and only when the federal government agreed to reimburse the county for holding an offender in jail for more than two days. Longer detention while awaiting deportation was costing local taxpayers, Miami-Dade officials said.

The move put the county on a list of sanctuaries in a 2016 Justice Department report. Gimenez contested the designation, and then on Jan. 26, a day after Trump announced he would strip federal funding from sanctuary cities, Gimenez sent a memo instructing the corrections director to honor all immigration detainer requests.

Gimenez defended his decision Friday and said the county's police were not actively chasing people or asking for their immigration status — they were only agreeing to hold people flagged by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said that most of the 34 people who have been requested by immigration authorities had previously committed crimes.

"Look. I am an immigrant myself," Gimenez said. "I can assure our residents that I will not comply with any executive order that will unfairly put our law-abiding immigrants at risk."

But Maria Bilbao, a 51-year-old Argentine who has lived in the U.S. for 16 years and is now obtaining residency, said the commissioners' support of Gimenez's decision is an anti-immigrant stance.

"They are broadening ways in which immigration officials can deport families," she said. "How can they keep a clear conscience"

Follow Adriana Gomez Licon on Twitter at http://twitter.com/agomezlicon .Karen Pence wants people to know that art therapy isn't exactly arts and crafts.

The wife of Vice President Mike Pence has been a passionate advocate of art therapy for many years, including during her service as first lady of Indiana. Now, she hopes to use her new and loftier public profile to raise awareness of the mental health profession and help change the public's perceptions about what art therapists actually do.

"They can do things that help the patient have a little more control," Mrs. Pence told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview.

Art therapists use art, the creative process and the artwork patients create to help them explore feelings, resolve emotional conflicts, manage behavior and addictions, reduce anxiety and boost self-esteem, among other benefits, according to the American Art Therapy Association. A main goal is to improve or restore a patient's functioning and sense of personal well-being.

Mrs. Pence, an artist whose specialty is painting watercolors of homes and historical buildings, plans to observe European art therapy programs when she accompanies her husband to Germany and Belgium on Friday, his first overseas trip since taking office on Jan. 20. She is scheduled to speak with art therapists in Munich and visit an art therapy program in Brussels.

As Indiana's first lady from January 2013 until last month, Mrs. Pence visited art therapy programs across the state, as well as in Israel, Canada, Japan and Germany.

The field is growing, but is not well understood, she said. The American Art Therapy Association says it represents more than 5,000 professional art therapists and others related to the profession.

"One thing I can bring to this as second lady is making people aware of what art therapy is and how it works," Mrs. Pence said. "It's not arts and crafts."

Donna Betts, the art therapy association's president, said the organization values "any interest in increasing public awareness about the art therapy."

Mrs. Pence, a former elementary school teacher, said she was first exposed to art therapy during a visit to a Washington hospital more than a decade ago. Her husband represented Indiana in Congress, and the Pences lived in Washington during his six terms in the House before he was elected his governor.

She has a master's degree in art education, but learned that art therapy "wasn't even something that I would be qualified to do."

Mrs. Pence said art therapy usually is not paid for by insurers, but she doesn't think it's her place to use her new platform to try to encourage them to provide coverage.

"I don't really see my role as policy maker or policy changer," she said. "I just want to make people aware of what art therapy is."

She has served on the board of Tracy's Kids, an art therapy program for youth cancer patients, since 2011. The organization recently honored her with its Courage Award.

As for the return to Washington, Mrs. Pence said it's been a "pretty smooth transition since we lived in Washington for 12 years."

"We have friends, we have places we like to frequent and we know the neighborhood" around the vice president's official residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory in Northwest Washington. "We're familiar with Washington. It kind of just feels like we're coming back."

John McCain shared a playful moment at the beginning of a Senate hearing on Wednesday when McCain teased Kutcher about his appearance.

McCain joked, "Ashton you're better looking in the movies," which led Kutcher to blow McCain an air kiss before he continued his remarks.

The lighthearted moment kicked off a hearing on the serious issue of modern day slavery and sex trafficking. Kutcher was asked to testify because of his position as the chairman and co-founder of Thorn, a company that builds software to fight human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children.

"This is about the time when I start talking about politics that the internet trolls tell me to go back to my day job," Kutcher quipped as he introduced his work with Thorn.

But he also said the issue of protecting children touches him personally as a father.

"My other day job is that of a father of two, a 2-month-old and a 2-year-old," he said. "And as part of that job that I take very seriously, I believe that it is my effort to pursue their right to pursue happiness and to ensure society and government defends it as well."

Kutcher has worked with McCain on this issue before. The McCain Institute partnered with Thorn to create a tool called Spotlight that helps law enforcement identify and stop online human trafficking networks.

“Spotlight was only enabled by the McCain Institute and the full support of Sen. McCain and a man that I find not only to be a war hero but a hero to this issue, John McCain,” Kutcher said during his testimony.David Benioff says if anti #GoT bible thumpers would stop thumping, they would realize just as much incest in the bible as #GoTTranscript for George and Amal Clooney Expecting Boy and Girl, Relative Says

The series of getaways is drawing the attention of government watchdogs and members of Congress over associated security and travel costs.

Visits to his southern golf resort –- which Trump dubs the "Winter White House" –- will continue frequently over the next four years, aides say.

"The taxpayer is on the hook every time the president flies to Mar-a-Lago. Every time the president uses Air Force One, we pay for it," said Tom Fitton, president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which has been filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain government records and reveal the full cost of presidential trips. The group has monitored President Obama and now President Trump.

While the travel is not unprecedented or inherently improper, the Trump presidency does pose a highly unusual –- and undeniably costly -– logistical and security dynamic given Trump's multiple homes in expensive locations and four active adult children who each require security protection.

The Trump administration won’t provide dollar figures for the initial trips to Florida, but one presidential trip to the Palm Beach area in 2013 cost taxpayers around $3 million dollars, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimate from 2016.

"If President Trump is going to go back and forth to Florida every weekend, those costs could really skyrocket," Fitton said. "The presidency is too big, it costs too much money and if anyone is able to cut down the cost, maybe President Trump can."

Fitton suggested Trump spend weekends at one of his properties closer to Washington, or even Camp David, the presidential retreat.

The costs of presidential travel have been in the spotlight for decades. President George W. Bush took 77 trips to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, over 8 years, according to CBS’ Mark Knoller. Richard Nixon frequently spent short weekend trips at his "Winter White House" at Key Biscayne in Florida. Ronald Reagan made occasional trips to his home on the West Coast.

In the past, Trump has been sharply critical of the costs of presidential travel. He lambasted President Obama on Twitter for millions of dollars of "unbelievable!" travel expenses –- and suggested he spent more time golfing and campaigning than working for the American people.

In 2015, Trump went so far as to publicly pledge that he would "rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done," The Hill reported. But so far, Trump has shown no indication he’s looking to cut down on his own presidential travel costs.

The White House did not respond to ABC News requests for comment about the travel, and the administration will not provide details about the cost of travel and security.

With every presidential visit, there are also added costs imposed on local governments playing host. The Palm Beach Sheriff’s office estimates they pay $60,000 in overtime pay each day when President Trump is in the area. During the Thanksgiving holiday, the county had to absorb $248,000 of overtime wages because Trump was in town.

"We’re hoping to get that reimbursed with the federal government right now, and going forward, if the president continues to come in," said Rep. Lois Frankel, a Democrat representing the district that includes Mar-a-Lago.

Frankel, who represents Palm Beach, said Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago also have a local airport and some businesses "feeling the pain." Latana Airport, the country airport, has been shut down for each of Trump's visits this month.

"Whoever the president is, regardless of your political party you want a president to feel welcome and be safe," Frankel said. "This has been his winter place for a very long time and he’s used to coming down and it is a beautiful venue ... but maybe he should vary his trips. I’m being diplomatic."

Palm Beach and New York City have asked Congress to help recoup the costs of protecting Trump between Election Day and his swearing in. New York City requested $35 million and Congress eventually allocated $7 million.

Trump also maintains a residence in New York City, where his wife and youngest son Barron reside, and another in Bedminster, New Jersey, among several others. All locations have required added security measures since he’s become president.

The New York City Police Department says it spends $500,000 a day just to protect the president’s midtown residence at Trump Tower.

As for the four Trump adult children, Secret Service has assigned protective details to each as they navigate busy careers, frequent global travel and active lifestyles –- adding to the cost of protecting the First Family.

"Regardless of location, whether it’s the White House or a private residence in New York, Chicago, Texas, or Florida, the Secret Service is confident our security plan consistently demonstrates the ability to evaluate and revolutionize our methods of security, ensuring the safest environment for those we are responsible for protecting," an agency spokesman told ABC News.

ABC News' Jack Date and Aaron Katersky contributed to this report.Airlines canceled flights, mass transit systems planned to shut down from New York City to Boston, and roads were ordered closed to all traffic in all or parts of five states as a massive blizzard was expected to engulf the Northeast.

Follow the progress of the storm here.The Islamic State group attacked a battalion of state-sponsored militia southeast of Tikrit on Friday, killing at least eight militia members, an intelligence official said.

IS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted by its Aamaq news agency. The statement said IS fighters had struck the 9th Battalion of the Popular Mobilization Forces, "killing its commander and 13 soldiers."

The statement also said that IS fighters blew up the battalion's headquarters and other nearby positions and destroyed two Humvees that had arrived to assist the battalion.

The intelligence official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief reporters.

The Popular Mobilization Forces are state-sponsored militias, largely comprised of Shiite Muslims, battling IS across the country.

Also on Friday, a police officer and medical sources said the death toll from a car bomb attack in a southern Baghdad neighborhood has reached 59 with 66 others injured.

Authorities initially said the Thursday night attack at an auto dealership in the al-Bayaa neighborhood killed at least 55 and wounded more than 60. The Islamic State group claimed credit for the bombing.

The police officer and medical personnel spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.

IS, in a statement early Friday, said its fighters detonated bombs in a parked car among a gathering of Shiites in the Fifth Police district Thursday. It did not give further details.

The extremist group has carried out near-daily attacks in Baghdad despite suffering military setbacks elsewhere in the country, including in the northern city of Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraqi forces have been waging a major operation since October.

The spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiites Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, expressed his condolences for the victims' families and called on those "responsible for decision-making to recognize their responsibility to preserve security."

His comments were delivered at Friday prayers by his representative, Ahmed al-Safi, in the holy city of Karbala.

The U.S. State Department condemned the bombing, saying such attacks show the extremist group's "utter contempt for human life and its efforts to sow discord and division among the Iraqi people."

U.N. Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General Farhan Haq too condemned the attack in a statement issued Friday, which also conveyed "solidarity to the people of Iraq in resisting attempts to spread fear, intimidation and hatred."

Another four attacks in and around Baghdad on Thursday killed eight people and wounded around 30, authorities said.

The bomb attacks claimed by IS are seen as an attempt to distract attention as the militants cede territory along front lines in northern and western Iraq.

Elsewhere, Jaafar Husseine, spokesman for the Hezbollah Brigades, an Iraqi Shiite paramilitary group supported by Iran, said his brigade was fighting IS in the village of Ein Hasan west of Tal Afar in Nineveh province, 63 kilometers (39 miles) from Mosul. He said the unit had air support from the Iraqi army to thwart IS's attempt to open a passageway into neighboring Syria.

Separately, followers of influential cleric Muqtada al-Sadr began gathering in Baghdad's downtown Tahrir square for a silent demonstration called for by al-Sadr. The demonstration comes after last weekend's clashes with police that left five dead.

Al-Sadr is demanding an overhaul of the commission overseeing local elections scheduled this year. He has accused the commission of being riddled with corruption and has called for its overhaul

Security authorities Friday blocked roads leading to the square but there was no heavy security presence in the area.Ted Cruz explained the ‘New York values’ attack he made against presidential rival Donald Trump.

“The phrase New York values actually didn't come from me: it came from Donald Trump. It was an interview he gave a number of years ago to “Meet the Press” where he was explaining his support for partial birth abortion,” Cruz said. “I was repeating Donald's own phrasing.”

Cruz went on to argue that New York values pertain to the “left-wing democratic” values, reports ABC's VERONICA STRACQUALURSI.

“Let me be clear, as I have said many times, the people of New York, the folks here, y’all have suffered under the left-wing democratic policies year after year after year that are forced on you by politicians who aren't listening to you.”

Cruz went on to say: “There was a moment that illustrated the left-wing Democratic values perhaps better than any other, and it was when the brave men and women of the NYPD stood up and turned their back on Bill De Blasio."It's a tale as old as time: a dad's love for his daughter.

Commercial photographer Josh Rossi wanted to give his daughter special photos she'd cherish forever, so he arranged for the two of them to have an absolutely magical "Beauty and the Beast" photo shoot complete with real castles and authentic costumes.

@joshrossiphoto/Instagram

"This is priceless," Rossi, who is currently living with his family in Puerto Rico, told ABC News. "I love being able to use my talent for something in the family that will live on forever. It's a representation of the relationship we have together. And instead of having a poster of Justin Bieber over her bed in a few years, she can have this awesome photo of herself."

@joshrossiphoto/Instagram

To give his little girl, Nellee, the true princess treatment, Rossi traveled to Europe to photograph actual castles and landscapes he could use as the scenery for their pictures.

@joshrossiphoto/Instagram

"I wanted it to be really authentic so I went to shoot all the castles that Disney movies were inspired by," he explained. "I had some SkyMiles and I was like, 'I could totally do this for fun and it would be an awesome gift.' I have family in Italy so I stayed with them and drove around Europe to get the shots."

He and his wife even custom ordered her Belle costumes from designer Ella Dynae.

The "Beauty" and "Beast" loved twirling around the dance floor together, although Rossi admitted it made him emotional thinking about his daughter's future.

"It was all these weird, mixed emotions, like she was getting married, but she was still young. But, I imagined her older," the proud papa recalled. "It was the cutest thing."

As for how Rossi will ever top this sentimental photo shoot for her actual wedding, "I've got 20 years to figure it out," he laughed.

"I specifically wanted to keep him very private from the beginning because we wanted him to ourselves," Murgatroyd told "Good Morning America" weekend anchor Paula Faris. "I think he's just so special that we wanted those moments, those first moments, to be for ourselves.

"And you know, there's going to come a time where he's going to be with us walking hand-in-hand down the street and everyone's going to be able to see him," she said. "And there's so many moments and opportunities that are gonna come up very soon where you just, you can't hide him any longer."

"This is our child," Chmerkovskiy said of Shai, whose name means "gift" in Hebrew. "Every time somebody comes over, you kind of share him with somebody else."

'Not Worry About the Little Things'

Murgatroyd has been public about one thing -- recognizing the challenges of parenting. She made headlines for posting a photo of herself eight days after giving birth and speaking honestly about being "disappointed."

"I left the hospital literally looking five months pregnant and at first I was like, 'Oh, wow,' like, I was a little disappointed," Murgatroyd told "GMA." "And I just realized that I just did the most beautiful thing that a woman can produce and do in life and I need to just suck it up, move on, and you know not worry about the little things."

Not worrying about the little things for Murgatroyd includes not yet worrying about whether she will return to "DWTS" for season 24.

"It's not about me anymore," she said. "It's got nothing to do with me and how I look and if I've got mascara on to go outside."

She continued, "It is all about Shai and it's amazing. I'm okay with it."

Murgatroyd admitted she was surprised by how long it has taken her to resume her fitness routine post-pregnancy.

"I could hardly move, like, I'm a professional dancer and it was difficult to get back because I haven't done it since I won with Nyle," she said, referring to her Season 22 "DWTS" victory with partner Nyle DiMarco. "I didn't think it was going to take this long, honestly. I was, like, 'Oh, I'll be back running in three days.'"

Murgatroyd has started a lifestyle blog, "All Things Fam & Glam," to reach out to other moms who may be going through a similar experience.

"I wanted other women to know that it's okay and that this is all normal and you don't have to feel bad about your post-baby body," she said. "I mean, it was such a beautiful thing and you just have to be patient and you have to love yourself and love yourself through this whole process, because it's a lot."

'Life-altering' Change

Chmerkovskiy is also still undecided about a return to the dancing competition. The past champion revealed he changed Shai's very first diaper, but hasn't changed one since.

"I've come to realize fathers are like a giant plus-one in this entire thing until there's a communication," he said.

"It's very, as they say, life-altering," said Chmerkovskiy, who added he cried "men tears" at his son's birth. "But now I understand why because you just start realizing things that you never even thought of before."

Chmerkovskiy also played a large role in the decoration of Shai's nursery, choosing an elephant theme for a special reason.

"A while ago somebody said elephant with [its] trunk up means good luck for the household," he explained. "I don't know why, but at that time I still competed and I traveled all over the world, and I would just start collecting elephants and bring them home."

Murgatroyd described the change she has seen in Chmerkovskiy since becoming a dad.

"I think he's just more serene, more calm. He's a dad now," she said. "I mean, we have these massive responsibilities now hanging over our heads and I think it's just, it really sinks in when you see your child for the first time."

Chmerkovskiy said he presents more confidence than what he feels inside as a first-time parent.

"It's very scary," he said, calling Murgatroyd "amazing" at being a mom. "I find myself sort of portraying like, 'I got this,' and then on the inside I'm like, 'I don't got this. I don't got this.'"

Surprisingly, the new parents said they don’t mind if their son doesn’t grow up to be a dancer, but Murgatroyd added, "I think he's going to have a natural rhythm."

Wedding Planning

As they raise Shai, Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd are also preparing for another huge milestone in their lives together -- their wedding.

The couple said they are in the middle of planning a three-day, 300-guest wedding extravaganza.

"I said to him the other day, it was a little stressful," Murgatroyd said. "I had a moment of, 'Should we put [the wedding] on hold for a little bit?'"

But she said Chmerkovskiy wants to get married now, telling her, "No way, baby, we're getting married."

When the wedding happens, Shai will play a central role, they both said.

"We can just roll him out," Chmerkovskiy joked of his son.

Murgatroyd added, "I think one of the moms will probably carry him down and he'll be all suited up and looking good."Whitney's wearing flannel to meet Chris's family, and she's really excited to be in Arlington. (She brought wine and flowers and jumped into his arms.) "Today has to go well for there to be a proposal," she said, adding that she wants to tell them that she's in love with Chris. "I am the happiest girl in the world... but gosh darn it, I'm freaking nervous. This is a big deal."O'Toole is now explaining the questionnaire to jurors. "There are no right or wrong answers. All we ask is that you answer truthfully and to the best of your ability." He adds that the court staff has been instructed not to assist anyone with their answers.In daily visits to Senate offices, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has tried to make clear to Democrats that he's an independent thinker.

Gorsuch told senators that he found President Donald Trump's attacks on the judiciary "disheartening" and "demoralizing" after Trump had lashed out at a federal judge who issued a stay on his refugee and immigration ban. On Tuesday, Gorsuch told Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin that he hopes to be "half the nominee" as Merrick Garland, the judge nominated by President Barack Obama last year, only to be blocked by Senate Republicans.

Durbin, D-Ill., also said Gorsuch indicated support for criminal justice reform — a Durbin priority — and disavowed a 2005 National Review article he'd written criticizing Democrats and liberals.

"He said it was probably one of the biggest mistakes he ever made," Durbin recalled Thursday. "It's a terrible article. He wishes it would just disappear."

Though Democrats who have met with him have almost uniformly said that the perfectly pedigreed federal appeals court judge is impressive, Gorsuch's overtures may not be enough to win him an easy confirmation. Liberals are pressuring Democrats to strongly oppose Trump's pick. Several Democratic senators say they are uncomfortable with some of Gorsuch's judicial decisions.

A year after Justice Antonin Scalia's death created the vacancy, Democrats are still furious that Republicans refused to consider Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said voters should have a say in the choice via the presidential election.

Republicans would like to see Gorsuch take the ninth spot on the court by the time they leave for a two-week recess April 10 and in time for the court's arguments that start a week later.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Thursday that the committee will hold at least three days of hearings starting March 20. That would give the Senate two weeks for committee approval and confirmation votes on the floor.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this month that he has "serious, serious concerns" about Gorsuch, and Republicans will likely need the support of 60 of the Senate's 100 members to move to a confirmation vote on Gorsuch. Republicans have a 52-48 majority, so at least eight Democrats will need to vote with Republicans.

Much of the focus has been on 10 Democrats up for re-election next year in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. While at least two — Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin — have said they will oppose Gorsuch, many of the others have said little as conservative groups are already spending money to pressure them.

Montana Sen. Jon Tester spoke to reporters for less than a minute after his meeting with Gorsuch earlier this month, saying he is "open" to voting for the judge. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill won't comment at all on the nomination after she was criticized online for a tweet saying Gorsuch should get a hearing and a vote.

North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp issued a statement saying she discussed several local issues with the judge and "it is our job as U.S. senators to perform this function and not play politics."

Other Democrats have been more open with concerns. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy says he's wary of Gorsuch's sharp criticism of the Chevron doctrine, which holds that judges should defer to federal departments and agencies to fill in the blanks of certain laws, including on immigration and the environment.

The framers, Gorsuch wrote last year, intended for lawmakers to make the laws, executives to execute them and judges to decipher their meaning.

Murphy says Gorsuch's comments on Trump's tweets are irrelevant to his confirmation.

"It would be a story if he wasn't disheartened by the president of the United States openly attacking federal judges," Murphy says.

Delaware Sen. Chris Coons said after his meeting that Gorsuch is an "engaging and well-educated person" but that he has concerns about some cases in which Gorsuch has written a dissent or concurrence on an issue that wasn't before the court, along with several of his decisions.

Democrats will likely seek to tie Gorsuch to chaos in Trump's White House and controversy over his immigrant ban, noting that some of his executive actions could end up before the court. When the judge was nominated, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said the actions of the Trump administration "raise the stakes to an even higher level."

Asked whether he could see himself supporting Gorsuch, Durbin said, "Of course I'm not ruling that out," but he says he awaits the hearings.

Senate Republicans have universally praised Gorsuch as they face questions about many of Trump's other decisions.

"He gives us an opportunity to talk about an issue that matters a lot to people across the country, and where we're very much in sync with what they want to see on the court," said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.

AP Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report.President Trump’s controversial immigration order has played out on the national stage with protests, court rulings and now a promise by the president to replace the travel ban. But for Nick Lee, it's personal -- a painful reminder of his family's history.

Lee's grandfather was separated for 16 years from his wife and never got to see his first child before she died -- all because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first major U.S. law restricting who could come into the country.

The 1882 law -- followed by other exclusion acts that stayed in force for six decades -- was born amid a wave of fear that Chinese workers who had come during the Gold Rush and helped build the United States’ railroads were competing with other Americans for jobs and lowering wages.

"They used to say that the Chinese are outsiders, and they couldn’t mix with our society, just like what they’re saying about Muslims now,” said Lee, who works for OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization.

Library of Congress

Lee said he fears that Trump's executive actions will separate families in the same way as his.

"It's horrifying," he said. "There's no other word for it."

Trump's travel ban

The president said Thursday that he will issue a new executive action soon following a federal court's putting a hold on the order signed Jan. 25. That order bans entry into the U.S. of people from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, suspends refugee admissions from any country for 120 days and indefinitely bans the entry of Syrian refugees.

The president said executive action is necesssary to bolster national security and that the seven countries -- Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and terrorism.htm" id="ramplink_Yemen_" target="_blank">Yemen -- were identified by the Obama administration as a concern because of their history of links to terrorism. Critics said the order is a de facto Muslim ban.

Within hours after it was signed, scores of people coming to the U.S. were detained at airports around the country. Families were separated as members trying to join loved ones in the U.S. were stopped. And 60,000 visas were cancelled in one week before a federal judge stayed the order on Feb. 4.

'I wanted to live, so I had to come to America’

The president's immigration order also brought up painful reminders for Erika Lee.

Her grandfather came to the U.S. in 1918 as an orphan under a fake identity, what was called "a paper son," with documents falsely stating he was related to American citizens.

“He had to give up his name and become someone else.” said Erika Lee, a history professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of books on immigration including, "At America’s Gates: Chinese Immigration During the Exclusion Era, 1882-1943," and who is not related to Nick Lee.

Washington State Historical Society

She said her grandfather felt he had no choice.

“I remember my grandfather saying ‘I wanted to live, so I had to come to America,’" she said. In China, "if you wanted to live during that time you went abroad.”

Political and economic instability in China from around the 1850s on led thousands to immigrate to the U.S.in search of opportunity and a better life, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.

Erika Lee said the president's travel ban reminds her of old U.S. laws restricted Chinese immigration -- presented as for the "public good" and "national security" when really such laws are "a cloak for discrimination,” she said.

“It pains me and frustrates me to no end to realize we are repeating the mistakes of the past,” Erika Lee said of the president's executive order, “repeating laws that our presidents and government have regretted and regarded as a historic mistake.”

American Citizens Put in Camps

Chinese Americans weren’t the only groups targeted by past immigration laws. The Johnson-Reed Act signed in 1924 set immigration quotas based on national origin and completely barred all Asians.

Then in 1942, after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor the previous December, President Roosevelt signed an executive order that led to 120,000 Japanese-Americans, many of them American citizens, being forced into internment camps for the duration of World War II. President Reagan formally apologized for the policy in 1988.

Satsuki Ina was born behind barbed wire 73 years ago in the Tule Lake internment camp in California.

Ina, a psychotherapist who has produced documentaries on the internment camps, said her parents were born in America but because they were educated in Japan, they were deemed high-risk. They were forced to renounce their American citizenship and separated into different camps, she said. Her father was sent to a camp in North Dakota.

After her parents was released, she said: "They didn’t talk about it at all.”

Nick Lee

Then while she was in college amid the U.S. Civil Rights movement, she said realized what her parents went through.

“I went home to find out why they were anxious about these protests," Ina said. "That’s when they told me about their renunciation of their citizenship.”

"I was shocked, but proud. When I asked why they never told us, they said they were afraid I’d be ashamed of them,” she said. “My parents were innocent, just like the other 120,000 Japanese Americans. It was an act of racism that put them in the camps. They felt vulnerable for the rest of their lives, scared their freedom would be stripped away once more."

Satsuki Ina

Now with the president's immigration order, Ina said: “We see the same sentiment and language about risks to national security, about blanket actions taken based on fear.”

A Father's Sacrifice, a Son's Success

Nick Lee, the Asian-American advocate whose grandfather, William, was long separated from his wife, came into the U.S. illegally through Canada around 1930.

He was 24 and penniless but wound up working in the laundry business in New York.

Finally, after he served in the U.S. Army in World War II, William Lee's wife was able to join him in his new country.

They had two sons in the U.S. One, Nick's father, Bill Lann Lee, rose to become assistant U.S. Attorney General for Civil Rights under President Bill Clinton.

To Nick Lee, that progression is America's strength.

“In one generation, you have my grandfather who came as an undocumented immigrant to my father, one of the highest-ranking Asian-Americans in government at his time."

Nick Lee

Ina, like Nick Lee, said she will fight against any new immigration laws that she sees as discriminatory. Americans can't take civil liberties for granted, Ina said.

“The Constitution is a piece of paper,” Ina said. “It’s the people that bring it to life.”While President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basked in their bromance Wednesday, their wives also appear to have a seemingly similar affinity for each other.

Following the joint Trump-Netanyahu press conference in the East Room of the White House, Melania Trump hosted Sara Netanyahu on a visit to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.

The wives were accompanied by museum director Lonnie Bunch and Smithsonian Secretary David Skorton.

"Mrs Sara Netanyahu met at the White House with @FLOTUS Melania Trump, who surprised her with a visit to @NMAAHC," read a tweet from Netanyahu's office, along with a trio of photos of the leaders' wives at the museum and the White House.

The first lady reportedly said in a statement afterwards of the visit, "As we remember, with deep humility and reverence, the historic plight of slavery which the Jewish and African-American people have known all too well, we rededicate ourselves to those powerful words that both our nations hold dear: "NEVER AGAIN!"

Mrs. Trump also tweeted, "It was an honor to visit the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History @NMAAHC."

During their husbands' press conference, President Trump gave Mrs. Netanyahu accolades, saying, "I also want to thank Sara, can you please stand up? You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania, I appreciate it very much."A Virginia man who talked about his desire to carry out beheadings for the Islamic State was sentenced Friday to more than eight years in prison after getting caught in an FBI sting last year trying to help the group.

Haris Qamar, 26, is one of more than half a dozen men from the northern Virginia area charged in the last few years with helping the Islamic State or attempting to do so. Like so many of those cases, Qamar left the judge flummoxed as to why he was drawn to the violent ideology of the Islamic State, which has conducted beheadings and burned its captives alive.

Asked to explain himself at a sentencing hearing, Qamar said he felt compelled to respond to videos and news accounts he saw online showing innocent Muslims, including women and children, being slaughtered in Syria and the Middle East.

The judge, Leonie Brinkema, asked why he showed no sympathy for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in 2015, after which Qamar tweeted out a prayer for similar attacks.

"It was kind of like payback, an eye-for-an-eye thing," said Qamar, who has renounced his support of the Islamic State and apologized for his actions.

Even prosecutor Gordon Kromberg acknowledged that Qamar, a Brooklyn native, is a likable personality. But he said Qamar is also a guy who talked excitedly about his desire to drink "Slurpees out of their blood."

"I met him. He is a nice guy," Kromberg said. "But there's another side of him that's really scary."

Kromberg also said that Qamar's support of the Islamic State was no brief flirtation. In 2014, before he was ever on the FBI's radar, he bought a plane ticket to Turkey with the intention of joining the Islamic State. He never took the trip because his parents prevented him.

Then, in 2015 and 2016, he used variations of the handle "New Era JihadI" on social media to promote Islamic State propaganda. His accounts were shut down roughly 100 times, but he would just open new ones.

It was his social media use that brought him to the attention of the FBI. An informant convinced Qamar to buy Google gift cards in small amounts and transfer the codes to a person Qamar believed was a representative of the Islamic State. In June, Qamar took photographs of landmarks in the D.C. area for what he thought would be an Islamic State video showing the landmarks as potential targets.

His sentence fell between the term of five to six years sought by Qamar's attorney, and the 20-year maximum recommended under the federal sentencing guidelines.German Chancellor Angela Merkel says her country will stick to its long-term commitment to raise defense spending to levels agreed with NATO partners — but no hurry about it.

Merkel said that "Germany is conscious of its responsibility" to spend more on arms but added other issues are also important for global security.

She said Germany would stick to the long-term goal of raising defense spending to 2 percent of economic output by 2024.

Merkel spoke Friday when she and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's calls for NATO allies to carry more of the financial burden. NATO members agreed at a 2014 summit in Wales that countries not currently meeting the 2 percent goal would do so over a decade.

Merkel said Germany had increased defense spending by 8 percent in this year's budget over last year. "We must do more here, no question, but the matters of development aid and crisis prevention are also important," she said.

She said that that NATO was also important for the United States and served to strengthen U.S. influence in world affairs.

Trump set off alarm bells last month by calling NATO "obsolete," though he has subsequently told European leaders he agrees on the "fundamental importance" of the military alliance. He has emphasized the need for all members to pay a fair share for defense, an issue that NATO leaders themselves have pushed for years.North Korea said it will reject the results of an autopsy on its leader's estranged half brother, the victim of an apparent assassination this week at an airport in Malaysia. Pyongyang's ambassador said Malaysian officials may be "trying to conceal something" and "colluding with hostile forces."

Indonesia's police chief, meanwhile, said an Indonesian woman arrested for suspected involvement in the death of Kim Jong Nam was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank.

Speaking to reporters gathered outside the morgue in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, North Korean Ambassador Kang Chol said Malaysia conducted the autopsy on Kim Jong Nam "unilaterally and excluding our attendance."

Kim Jong Nam, who was 45 or 46 and had lived in exile for years, suddenly fell ill at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday as he waited for a flight home to Macau. Dizzy and in pain, he told medical workers at the airport he had been sprayed with a chemical. He died while being taken to a hospital.

"We will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem," Kang said, adding that the move disregarded "elementary international laws and consular laws."

Kang said the fact that Malaysia has yet to hand over the body "strongly suggests that the Malaysian side is trying to conceal something which needs more time and deceive us, and that they are colluding with the hostile forces towards us who are desperate to harm us."

South Korea has accused its enemies in North Korea of dispatching a hit squad to kill Kim Jong Nam at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, saying two female assassins poisoned him and then fled in a taxi.

North Korean diplomats in Malaysia objected to an autopsy and had requested custody of Kim Jong Nam's body, arguing that he had a North Korean passport. Malaysian authorities went ahead with the procedure anyway, saying they did not receive a formal complaint.

The autopsy could provide some clarity in a case marked by speculation, tales of intrigue and explosive, unconfirmed reports from dueling nations. Authorities were still awaiting the autopsy results.

Malaysia said Friday it wants DNA samples from Kim Jong Nam's family as part of the post-mortem procedure and that officials were not yet willing to hand the body over to the North Koreans. Although Kim Jong Nam is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau, police in Malaysia say none has come forward to claim the body or provide DNA samples.

"If there is no claim by next-of-kin and upon exhausting all avenues (to obtain DNA), we will finally then hand over the body to the (North Korean) embassy," said Abdul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official. He would not say how long that process might take.

Malaysian police have arrested three people in the investigation but have released few details.

Indonesian police chief Tito Karnavian, citing information received from Malaysian authorities, told reporters in Indonesia's Aceh province that Siti Aisyah, 25, was paid to be involved in "Just For Laughs" style pranks, a reference to a popular hidden camera show. He said she and another woman performed stunts which involved convincing men to close their eyes and then spraying them with water.

"Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong Nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer," Karnavian said. "She was not aware that it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents."

Karnavian's comments come after a male relative of Aisyah said in an Indonesian television interview that she had been hired to perform in a short comedy movie and traveled to China as part of this work. Indonesian Immigration has said Aisyah traveled to Malaysia and other countries it did not specify.

Investigators were still trying to piece together details of the case, and South Korea has not said how it concluded that North Korea was behind the killing.

Malaysian police were questioning three suspects — Aisyah, another woman who carried a Vietnamese passport, and a man they said is Aisyah's boyfriend.

Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger half brother, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He reportedly fell out of favor with their father, the late Kim Jong Il, in 2001, when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

Yoji Gomi, a Japanese journalist who wrote a book about Kim Jong Nam, said he criticized the family regime and believed a leader should be chosen "through a democratic process."

Gomi said he met Kim Jong Nam by chance at Beijing's international airport in 2004, leading to exchanges of 150 emails and two interviews in 2011 — one in Beijing and another in Macau — totaling seven hours.

Kim Jong Nam appeared nervous during the interview in Macau, Gomi said.

"He must have been aware of the danger, but I believe he still wanted to convey his views to Pyongyang via the media," Gomi said. "He was sweating all over his body, and seemed very uncomfortable when he responded to my questions. He was probably worried about the impact of his comments and expressions. The thought now gives me a pain in my heart."

We need more good.A 68-year-old Canadian man got a pleasant surprise when authorities returned more than $100,000 CAD ($76,560 USD approx.) in cash to him after it was discovered inside of an old television set, reports ABC News partner CTV News.

A GEEP recycling plant worker found the money last month as the TV was dismantled for processing, according to CTV News. The electronics recycling firm -- located in Barrie, Ontario, about 60 miles north of Toronto -- said it contacted the police immediately.

Authorities say the money was the man’s lost inheritance.

“There was like, four stacks of $50 bills, and I knew it was a large amount of money,” Rick Deschamps, general manager for GEEP told CTV News' Barrie affiliate.

The money was hidden inside of a cash box along with documents -- which authorities used to find the owner.

When located, the man told police that he had forgotten about the cash box when he gave the TV to a friend, according to the CTV News report.

The money, which he says he stashed away some 30 years ago, was intended to be passed down to his family members as an inheritance.

The recycling plant said it praises the employee for her honesty.

“She’s representative of all our employees and it’s what we stand for and this kind of behavior is really what we would expect from everyone here,” Lew Coffin, GEEP vice president of operations, told CTV News.The U.S. Senate this afternoon confirmed President Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, even as he faces a new court order.

An Oklahoma district court judge Thursday ordered Pruitt, the state’s former attorney general, to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office.

The nonprofit watchdog Center for Media and Democracy had requested the public records two years ago, and the judge ruled there had been an “unreasonable” delay in responding to the request, demanding that Pruitt comply by the end of the day Monday.

The Senate confirmed his nomination this afternoon, 52-46, even after Democratic senators expressed outrage overnight that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled, despite the judge’s ruling.

One Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who had said she would vote no before Thursday’s news of the court ruling, held to her vow to vote against Pruitt today. Another, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., skipped the vote, as did Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.

But two Democrats -- Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia – voted for the controversial nominee, giving him the votes he needed.

Democrats had pushed Pruitt during his confirmation hearing last month about whether he used a private email account for state business and had turned over all of those messages. They say the records could prove improper connections. For years Pruitt has been accused of siding with oil and energy companies in exchange for campaign donations, which he denied at his hearing.

Asked by one senator whether he solicited money from a number of energy companies while attorney general, Pruitt, 48, said he “attended fundraising events as an attorney general along with other attorneys general” and denied asking several energy companies for money.

He also said he worked to represent the "voices of all Oklahomans,” including the energy industry that has a major role in his state.

Pruitt has faced fierce opposition from the country’s leading environmental organizations since his nomination was announced in December.

He has spent much of his career suing the EPA -- 14 times in total -- over clean water regulations, limits on carbon pollution from power plants, and new standards for mercury and other air toxins. Pruitt had described himself on the attorney general website as a leading advocate against the “activist” agenda of the EPA.

Michael Brune, executive director of the environmental Sierra Club, said his organization, 2.7 million members strong, was prepared to fight the incoming administration in court and push environmentally minded reforms in the marketplace under a secretary Pruitt.

“He is unfit to serve in this position,” Brune told ABC News last month. “He is dangerous to the EPA.

“We will hold Scott Pruitt accountable to the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which are both bipartisan legislation."

Brune accused Pruitt of lacking the “basic knowledge” to head the agency tasked with keeping the country’s environment safe and clean.

Republicans, though, have stood by Pruitt. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., congratulated him on the nomination and immediately offered his support.

“The EPA is the poster child for agencies in need of immediate reform and Scott has the resume and energy to turn this bureaucracy around,” he wrote in a statement. “I’m confident he will work to find reasonable solutions rather than simply working to grow the reach and power of the federal bureaucracy.”

But nearly 450 former EPA officials wrote to Congress last week urging Senators to vote against Pruitt today.

In the letter, the former government officials wrote, in part, “every EPA Administrator has a fundamental obligation to act in the public’s interest based on current law and the best available science. Mr. Pruitt’s record raises serious questions about whose interests he has served to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of U.S. environmental law.”

Even current employees at the EPA have been protesting his nomination, with the union president of the American Federation of Government Employees National Council of EPA Locals No. 238 telling ABC News he is bracing for large-scale budget rollbacks.

For Pruitt's part, he praised the work of agency staff in his prepared opening remarks at the confirmation hearing.

“It will be my absolute privilege to work with the thousands of dedicated public servants at EPA who have devoted their careers to helping realize this shared goal,” he said.

“I’ve always said that if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life, and I know those who work at EPA do so because of their tireless dedication to what they do.”The recent revelation that condemned prisoners in Arizona can now provide the lethal drugs to be used in their executions has received attention around the world and raised questions about the state's rules for the death penalty.

The novel policy has drawn sneers from defense attorneys who were puzzled as to why the state would think that they would assist in killing their clients. It has inspired wisecracks about Arizona's penchant for taking on envelope-pushing criminal justice policies and left some readers on social media asking whether the bring-your-own-drugs policy was actually the product of a news parody website.

Criminal defense lawyers and death penalty experts say they have never heard of a state suggesting that condemned inmates can line up drugs to be used in their executions.

However unlikely it is that any of Arizona's 119 death-row inmates will take up the offer, the change is a reflection of the difficulties that Arizona, like other states, faces in finding execution drugs now that European pharmaceutical companies have blocked the use of their products for lethal injections.

Executions in Arizona have been on hold since the 2014 death of convicted killer Joseph Rudolph Wood, who was given 15 doses of the sedative midazolam and a painkiller and who took nearly two hours to die. The state will not be able to carry out executions until the resolution of a lawsuit that alleges Arizona has abused its discretion in the methods and amounts of drugs used in past executions.

WHY LET PRISONERS SEEK EXECUTION DRUGS?

The state hasn't publicly explained its aim in taking on the new policy, which surfaced last month in the lawsuit.

The Arizona Department of Corrections, which carries out executions, didn't respond to requests for comment. The Arizona Attorney General's Office, which is defending the state in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Under the policy, the state's top prison official would be required, in one execution drug protocol, to use the barbiturate pentobarbital that's obtained by lawyers for inmates or someone acting on their behalf. The corrections director also would have the choice of picking one of two drug protocols involving the sodium pentothal if the barbiturate is obtained on behalf of a prisoner.

Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who has expertise in the death penalty, views the change as a pushback against the conditions that have made the drugs unavailable. "I think the idea is to say in the protocol, 'You guys want pentobarbital? Then get it. If you can get us the drugs, we'll use them,' " Berman said.

———

WILL THE POLICY WITHSTAND SCRUTINY?

No, said Dale Baich, an assistant federal public defender who represents the inmates in the lawsuit.

He explained that the policy is unfeasible because the Controlled Substances Act prohibits attorneys and inmates from getting the drugs. "As a lawyer, I just can't go to local Walgreens and pick up a couple of vials of pentobarbital," Baich said.

It's the responsibility of the state, not condemned prisoners, to carry out executions, Baich added.

The policy would seem to appeal to inmates who have abandoned their appeals and want to speed up their executions.

But Baich said the Controlled Substances Act would still prevent those prisoners from getting lethal-injection drugs.

Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which has been critical of the way executions are carried out in the United States, said the policy also raises ethical concerns.

Death-penalty lawyers are supposed to zealously represent their clients and have a duty not to take actions that harm them, Dunham said. "No one has done it before, and the fact that it is impossible, impractical, illegal and unethical may have something to do with that," he said.

———

WILL INMATES REALLY SEEK THEIR OWN EXECUTION DRUGS?

Timothy Agan, a longtime criminal defense lawyer in Phoenix who has handled several death penalty cases, said he can't imagine condemned prisoners lining up to seek their own execution drugs and couldn't foresee a situation in which the policy would be used.

He described his initial reaction to the policy by playing off a joke that comedian Jon Stewart made in summing up Arizona's reputation for antiestablishment, we'll-do-things-our-way approach to governing.

"I saw that and shook my head and thought, 'This is truly the meth lab of democracy,' " Agan said. "A truly crazy idea."

ABC's ARLETTE SAENZ : In a stunning blow to Democrats, ABC News can project Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. , will win the Arkansas Senate race Tuesday night, based on preliminary exit poll results. Cotton is projected to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, the first Senate Democrat to lose their seat this election cycle. This is the second seat Republicans have picked-up Tuesday night.





Pryor’s loss is a major upset to Democrats who were hoping to hold onto the seat and keep Republicans from taking control of the Senate. Pryor comes from a popular political family in the state. His father, David Pryor, represented Arkansas in the U. S. Senate and served as the state’s governor. The family maintains close ties with the Clintons, a connection that prompted former President Bill Clinton to campaign on Pryor’s behalf on multiple occasions.





But Cotton, a one term congressman and former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was able to break through Pryor’s deep political connections in the state. Throughout the campaign, Cotton, 37, repeatedly tied Pryor to President Obama, whose favorability has reached an all-time low, and stressed issues related to national security, including how the administration’s is dealing with ISIS, on the campaign trail.





Mike Pence affirmed the United States' support for NATO and urged Russia to deescalate violence in eastern Ukraine while speaking Saturday at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, which marked his first overseas trip as vice president.

"Today, on behalf of President Trump, I bring you this assurance: The United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in its commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance," Pence told attendees at the annual international security policy gathering, at which Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also attended.

He added, "This is President Trump's promise: We will stand with Europe, today and every day, because we are bound together by the same noble ideals -- freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law."

As for Russia, Pence took a defiant position, saying, "In the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force rest assured, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, will continue its leadership role as a framework nation in the Enhanced Forward Presence Initiative and support other critical joint actions to support our alliance."

In specifically addressing Ukraine, Pence said "we must hold Russia accountable and demand that they honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning by de-escalating the violence in eastern Ukraine."

He reiterated, "Know this: The United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found."

Pence also spoke about quashing Iran's attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon while slamming the lifting of sanctions against the country, saying Iran "continues to destabilize the Middle East, and thanks to the end of nuclear-related sanctions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran now has additional resources to devotwe to these efforts."

He continued, "Let me be clear: Under President Trump, the United States will remain fully committed to ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon capable of threatening our countries or our allies in the region, especially Israel."

Pence also described ISIS as "perhaps the greatest evil of them all. It shows a savagery unseen in the Middle East since the Middle Ages ... the United States will fight tirelessly to crush these enemies -- especially ISIS and its so-called caliphate -- and consign them to the ash heap of history, where they belong."Windows 10: The Next Chapter Join us right here on January 21 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time to learn about the next chapter for #Windows10.

Adam Pretty/Bongarts/Getty ImagesThe last presidential election ended three months ago and the next one is not for almost four years, but President Donald Trump is set to travel to Orlando today for what the White House has termed “a campaign event.”

The event, which is listed on Trump’s campaign website, will take place at a hangar at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport, the site of a previous Trump campaign rally in September.

Asked about the event Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer called it “a campaign event” and said it is “being run by the campaign.”

President Trump, who has touted his election victory almost habitually since taking office, predicted “massive” crowds at what will be his first campaign rally since becoming president.

“In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 'clock on Saturday. And I heard, just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there,” the president said Thursday at a press conference.

A White House official says the president will travel from West Palm Beach to Orlando aboard Air Force One to his Saturday rally, but will not use the jet as a backdrop, as he did so often with ‘Trump Force One’ during the campaign.

On the day of his inauguration, Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission indicating a possible re-election bid in 2020.

Trump wrote that his filing, “does not constitute a formal announcement.” But as a result, he is able to collect donations.

President Barack Obama didn't file his re-election paperwork until April 2011, 19 months before the 2012 presidential election; President George W. Bush didn't file until May 2003, 18 months before the 2004 election.

"Many times in the past, what sitting presidents have done in the first two years is really suspend any fundraising activities for their campaign committees," former FEC chair Michael Toner told ABC News in January, adding that the Trump campaign's move could help keep the dollars flowing. "It gives them flexibility to raise money for a potential re-election effort."ANALYSIS: Trump Takes Role as Angry Savior for Nation’s ‘Disaster’

ABC's RICK KLEIN: He’s been an entrepreneur and an entertainer, a provocateur and, most recently, a politician.

Now comes Donald J. Trump, angry savior. In wrapping up a convention that was unmistakably his, delivering an extra-long speech very much in his own staccato, Trump combined elements of all of his former careers to try the role of a lifetime -- ready to fix a country he believes to be deeply broken, and that he believes he is uniquely suited to mend.

“Nobody knows the system better than me -- which is why I alone can fix it,” Trump said in his acceptance speech.

Trump, with the help of his daughter on Thursday, may or may not have saved his own convention, after the campaign’s self-imposed distractions and a hostile takeover attempt by a scorned rival. That media-ready candy replaced the meager policy vegetables offered up by speakers earlier in the week -– sideshows that were novel yet somehow predictable at Trump convention.

But whether Trump succeeds more broadly in the election will depend on grim calculations: that voters see the country as broken and beaten, and that they will reject Trump’s rival as corrupt, criminal, or worse.

Those twin themes are apparent in the way Trump has rewritten a Hillary Clinton campaign slogan -– “I’m with her” -– for his own purposes.

“My pledge reads: ‘I’m with you – the American people,’” Trump said.

Trump’s speech was a gloomy exclamation point on a run-on sentence of a convention. After the first three days meandered through major themes, Trump on Thursday marched through a parade of horribles: poverty, crime, terrorism, illegal immigration, trade, unemployment, war and Hillary Clinton.

“This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness,” he said.

Trump’s answer includes, prominently, a promise of “law and order.” At one point, when the crowd starting chanting, “Lock her up,” Trump responded with what counts as restraint for him: “Let's defeat her in November."

Trump used his family to offer the uplift that his speech, and much of his convention, lacked.

offered powerful personal testimony to her father, humanizing him while connecting biography to policy –- just not the policies that Trump is best known for endorsing.

“He will fight for equal pay for equal work and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,” she said. “Politicians ask to be judged by their promises, not their results. I ask you to judge my father by his results.”

Like her father, Ivanka Trump underscored qualifications she views as making him unique.

“In ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission, and given it to an extraordinary man,” she said.

Her dad wouldn’t disagree. Eight years ago, the next president was ushered into office on the strength of “yes we can.” After a year of campaigning and winning, Trump is replacing that with the first person singular.

“People who work hard but no longer have a voice –- I am your voice,” he said.

Trump is making a calculation, but it’s not a blind one. Trump’s voice has gotten louder because of what he senses in the country he’s traveled.

Inside the broad of statements Trump made -- “Safety will be restored,” “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,” “I am the law and order candidate” -- is a deep sense of anxiety that Trump is recognizing and amplifying during his remarkable campaign for the White House.

“America is back,” Trump thundered, well more than an hour into his speech. “History is watching us now. We don’t have much time, but history is watching.”

The balloons fell, the Trumps were joined by the Pences, and the campaign music blared the Rolling Stones: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” http://abcn.ws/2azBaSAWatch their intvu with @arobach today on @gma MT @USOlympic : You never know who will stop by the #TeamUSAAuthorities in northwest Georgia say a collision involving a day care bus sent eight children and three adults to hospitals.

Also, why is going south code for negative happenings?During movie awards season, a lot of attention is given to the Oscar-nominated actors and directors.

But what about the nominees whose job responsibilities aren't quite so clear to the average movie-goer?

For a new series called "Behind the Lens," ABC News got to know the people who were recognized for work behind the camera.

"La La Land" editor Tom Cross and "Hacksaw Ridge" editor John Gilbert opened up about the process of movie-editing, and what it was like to collaborate with Oscar-nominated directors Damien Chazelle and Mel Gibson respectively.

Tom Cross first met Damien Chazelle a few years ago, when he was asked to edit a short version of his first major film, "Whiplash," to attract financing.

The two hit it off, and ultimately "Whiplash" became a hit, earning a best picture nomination, a best adapted screenplay nod for Chazelle and an Academy Award for film editing for Cross.

So, when Chazelle was looking for someone to edit "La La Land," Cross was an obvious choice.

"The thing that struck me was it was so dreamy and very hopeful and very earnest, whereas 'Whiplash' was more about the suspense and tension. 'Whiplash' was trying to use film editing to achieve a certain brutality, and in 'La La Land,' it was apparent he was going or something very, very different. I was very excited by it," Cross told ABC News. "This was much more ambitious."

Chazelle told Cross that he wanted the movie to feel "naturalistic," while at the same time creating "dreamy moments that would serve as an expression of what's in the hearts of the characters." To do so, Cross worked closely with the cinematographer, who chose the equipment used to shoot the film, to make sure that the overall feel of the movie was what Chazelle wanted. He also used old-time techniques to give the modern-day movie a more classic feel.

"[Chazelle] really wanted to tell the story with, as he called it, 'the language of dreams.' So he wanted to use techniques from classic Hollywood cinema -- a lot of montages, a lot of irises, a lot of fade in, fade out -- and tell the story with mostly just pictures," he explained. "The biggest thing was, he didn't want the movie to have just one rhythm. He wanted it to have the different rhythms of romance."

What that means, Cross explained, is that the movie was edited to mimic the feeling of falling in love. So, he noted, at the beginning, in the courtship phase, there are long, romantic cuts that show the characters' full bodies, which were inspired by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Later on, when they're in love, cuts move very quickly, which is meant to give the audience the feeling of being swept off their feet. And when things start to go sour, there's a very anti-musical feel, Cross said.

"The editing style of that scene is the opposite of what had come before, so it felt very stripped down and austere," he said. "Damien said, 'You can use a medium [shot] of either [Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone] or a close up of either one, but once you get closer, you have to stay close.' He gave me very strict parameters because it would force a certain repetitive nature which in turn would make you feel uncomfortable. He really wanted the audience to recognize how uncomfortable the two characters are."

That type of specificity took time. According to Cross, unlike the edit of "Whiplash," which he only had a few months to complete, putting together "La La Land" took the better part of a year. A lot of those changes involved composer Justin Hurwitz, as Chazelle wanted certain moments of the score to match up with edits.

"It’s natural for the needs of the movie to evolve in the editing room, and even the most planned-out sequences end up changing. But Damien wanted to go for the same level of precision," he said. "I had to adjust the picture and it was all about perfecting where certain dissolves would hit the music and we kept working on that even through the final sound mix. When we were on the mixing stage, we would vet every single big downbeat of the music to see if it hits right on the picture and if it didn't, we would make the change."

Given all the work that went into making "La La Land," Cross is thrilled that it received a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations.

"In order for Damien to pull off this ambitious vision, he knew he it was going to require all departments firing on all cylinders, so I'm really happy that the departments I worked most closely with -- sound mixing and sound editing -- were recognized, but I also feel it's very validating that the other departments are recognized as well," he said. "This was truly a team effort."

"Hacksaw Ridge" editor John Gilbert feels similarly about the six nominations his film received. However, the editing process was very different from the Cross described.

ABC’s MICHAEL FALCONE: As the United States and Russia butt heads over Ukraine, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and unsuccessful presidential candidate turned Fox News host, offered a scathing critique of the Obama administration’s national security strategy on Friday.



Speaking on the second day of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Huckabee declared that in the second term of the Obama presidency there is “not one country anywhere with whom we have a better relationship than we did before.”



“No one trusts us, no one listens to us, no one respects us and no one fears us,” he complained.



And when it comes to the Russian leader whose provocative actions in Ukraine have flummoxed the White House foreign policy team, Huckabee quipped, “The only time Vladimir Putin shivers is when he has his shirt off in a cold Russian winter.”



Huckabee added that Israel, a country he called America’s “one true ally,” has been “incredibly mistreated” by the Obama administration.



“It is the duty and responsibility of the American government to make us safer and more secure not less,” he said.



Huckabee, who said in December that he was not closing the door on a 2016 presidential run, fit in a mild jab at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who under intense questioning from members of Congress about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya once told lawmakers: “What difference at this point does it make?”



“With all due respect to Hillary Clinton,” Huckabee said in his speech to the conservative gathering, “it does make a difference.”



The former pastor, who competed for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, threaded his speech with biblical references -- even though, he noted, talking about God in America is not always “politically correct.”



“A nation that can remember him will be a nation that will be remembered by him,” he said.Good morning! After a series of setbacks on Thursday, NASA is ready to try again.

Authorities say that 47-year-old Rodney Cydrus threatened to hurt a number of government officials and that some of the mail last month contained white powder that turned out to be harmless.

Prosecutors say the former Chillicothe (chihl-ih-KAHTH'-ee) man was indicted this week in federal court on multiple counts of mailing threatening communications. Court records list no attorney for him in the case.

He has been imprisoned at the Lebanon Correctional Institution for convictions that include arson, aggravated robbery and theft.South Korea was taken by surprise Friday with the arrest of the scion of the country's richest family and de-facto leader at Samsung over his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scandal that engulfed the president and riveted the nation.

Prosecutors believe Lee Jae-yong, 48, a vice chairman at Samsung Electronics and the only son of the ailing Samsung chairman, gave bribes worth $36 million to President Park Geun-hye and her close friend to help win government support for a smooth company leadership transition, including a contentious merger of two Samsung companies.

A look at how his arrest affects the electronics giant:

LITTLE IMPACT ON PHONE, TV BUSINESSES

Some conservative commentators are worried that Lee's arrest could hurt Samsung's businesses and therefore the economy, which relies on such companies for exports and jobs.

But others dismiss such concern as exaggerated. "What would affect its businesses are the Galaxy phone's success, the performance of the semiconductor sector and how fast Chinese rivals are catching up, not whether Lee Jae-yong is arrested or not," said Park Sang-in, a professor at Seoul National University.

Chiefs of companies such as Hyundai Motor Group and SK Group have been jailed before but still ran their companies from behind bars.

Samsung Electronics, which is the world's largest maker of mobile phones, TVs and computer memory chips, has three separate chief executive officers each overseeing its electronic component, mobile phone and television divisions.

But long-term business decisions, such as appointing executives and deciding on mergers and acquisitions, may be put on hold. Samsung normally announces personnel reshuffling and promotions each December, but postponed those announcements in 2016 as it was dragged deeper into the political scandal.

Lee is not the first in his family to face criminal charges. His father was convicted in 2008 and 2009 for embezzlement and tax evasion related to business dealings designed to pass down wealth to his son. Lee Kun-hee, the ailing chairman, stepped away from his role at the company when prosecutors indicted him in 2008. The younger Lee will likely follow a similar course and stay away from leadership role once investigators formally bring charges against him.

———

FAMILY SUCCESSION HITS SNAG

As he stepped up his role in the absence of his ailing father, Lee was seen as the new face of Samsung, fluent in foreign languages and educated oversees. Since Lee assumed a bigger role, Samsung promised to inject the company's top-down hierarchy with a nimble, startup-like attitude. Corruption allegations similar to those that took down his father may mean the damage to Lee's reputation is irreversible.

Prosecutors were able to secure Lee's arrest in their second attempt, thanks to new evidence showing President Park's broader involvement in Samsung's family succession plan. Initially, prosecutors focused on their argument that Samsung offered bribes and in return, the government backed a controversial merger of two Samsung companies in 2015, which was a key step in the leadership transition.

But after the initial request was dismissed, additional evidence from a notebook that belonged to a top presidential adviser showed that the government gave favors to Samsung in other areas related to the Lee family's father-to-son succession, said Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesman for the special prosecution team.

Thanks to the family's decadeslong succession plan, the 48-year-old heir to Samsung was able to amass enormous wealth even before starting his own business.

Lee's net worth is estimated at $6 billion. Here's how: In 1995, the elder Lee gave his only son, then in his 20s, 6 billion won ($52 million), which became the seed money to purchase unlisted stock in several Samsung companies. And during the next two decades those unlisted Samsung companies saw increased revenues based on lucrative deals done with other Samsung firms. The shares could then be sold when the companies went public. Some Samsung securities were sold at illegally cheap prices to Lee before he sold them off with huge returns, which later led to the conviction of his father.

———

OPPORTUNITY FOR REFORM?

With the Samsung scion's arrest, others saw an opportunity to change a business community long criticized for poor corporate governance and a lack of transparency.

Even though Lee has less than a 1 percent stake in Samsung Electronics and his father owns a 3.5 percent stake, the family's influence on the consumer electronics giant and other Samsung companies exceed other shareholders thanks in part to the way they control the business empire through a complicated web of cross-shareholding.

The merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries in 2015 was one example showing how the Lee family could exert an outsized influence on Samsung Group.

Opponents of the merger, mostly minority shareholders, said the deal unfairly benefits the founding family while hurting other shareholders by devaluing the price of one company.

Samsung narrowly won the shareholder approval thanks to the support from the National Pension Fund, its key investor. Lee became the majority shareholder of the merged entity and he gained control over Samsung Electronics stock owned by Samsung C&T before the merger. If Lee had bought more Samsung Electronics stock, it would have cost him billions of dollars. But by merging two companies, he did not have to spend a penny.

"The arrest of Lee Jae-yong should provide a momentum for fundamental changes to end the collusion between the government and businesses, and reform the chaebol," said Park, referring to the family-controlled business conglomerates that dominate the economy.

The Ceuta regional government gave the figures, with officials saying it was believed to be the biggest border invasion in recent years. Ceuta is separated from the rest of Spain by the Strait of Gibraltar.

Some 700 migrants attempted to smash through several gates simultaneously at about 6 a.m., a Ceuta government official told The Associated Press. He refused to be identified, in accordance with government rules.

He said 498 migrants made it into Spanish territory, with two hospitalized due to injuries they sustained in the assault. He said 11 Spanish police were also hurt.

A Civil Guard spokesman said police clashed with the migrants at the Tarajal area of the fence. He declined to disclose his identity in line with internal policy. At least 10 members of Morocco's armed forces were also injured, he said.

More than 30 migrants were treated at a migrant center for bone fractures and other injuries. Some were also cut trying to scale the fence, which is topped with barbed wire, said Clemen Nunez, director of Ceuta's Red Cross emergency response team.

According to the Civil Guard, a surveillance camera showed hundreds of people approaching the fence, using tools and clubs to break one of the gates.

In video filmed by Faro TV Ceuta, some of the migrants can be seen with blood on their faces and bruises but mostly celebrating the arrival in Spanish territory. Some wrapped themselves with Spanish and European flags and screamed "Freedom, freedom!"

Hundreds of sub-Saharan African migrants are living illegally in Morocco and regularly attempt to enter Ceuta and Melilla, Spain's other North African enclave, in hopes of getting into Europe. Most are fleeing poverty, violence or both.

On Friday, 55 of them were rejected, according to the Civil Guard, because those who are intercepted on the spot can be returned to Morocco. But those that make it over the fences are usually taken to migrant centers and eventually repatriated or let go, many choosing to seek asylum or work informally in Spain or other European countries.

Before the latest arrival, the migrant center Ceuta was already struggling to cope with more than 600 people and making use of military tents in nearby parking lots.

AP reporter Barry Hatton contributed from Lisbon, Portugal.Officials at a Washington D.C. public health lab confirmed to ABC News that they are retesting hundreds of samples from people in the area for Zika virus over concerns about the accuracy of the original test results.

Already, samples taken from two pregnant women, who originally tested negative for the virus, have now tested positive for likely Zika infection.

The District of Columbia Department of Forensic Sciences Public Health Laboratory has tested hundreds of people, mainly pregnant women, for the Zika virus since last year.

Yesterday, officials from the lab announced that after identifying "technical issues" with the Zika tests in December and a subsequent review of the tests, they would be retesting hundreds of specimens for signs of the virus collected during the second half of last year.

A spokesperson for the lab clarified to ABC News that "calculation and formulation errors" led to officials stopping and reviewing the Zika tests.

In total, 409 specimens that originally tested negative, including 294 from pregnant women, have been sent for retesting. The specimens from pregnant women were sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and those from men and non-pregnant women were sent to public health labs approved by the CDC. It often takes two to three weeks to receive test results that could indicate a likely Zika infection. Currently, two of 62 samples that were sent to the CDC for additional testing, and then further confirmation testing, were positive for antibodies that would indicate a possible Zika infection.

The test looks for antibodies that indicate a current or past infection from a flavivirus, a family of viruses that includes Zika. The CDC is treating the patients who tested positive as though they tested positive for the Zika virus out of caution and for monitoring.

Currently, only specimens obtained between July 14, 2016 and December 14, 2016 will be reexamined, since those collected before that date were already tested by the CDC.

Dr. Christopher Zahn, vice president of practice activities for The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), called the testing issue a "very unfortunate situation" and said it is critical that patients get updated results quickly in case they need to get extra prenatal or post-partum care.

"The CDC has prioritized these lab retests and, as they are completed, it is critical that patients are informed of the updated results so they can follow-up appropriately based on current clinical recommendations," Zahn said in a statement. "ACOG and the CDC have been in contact and continue to consult and collaborate and will issue any additional necessary information."

The issue should serve as a reminder that "Zika is still a very serious public health crisis," he said, and that the public, as well as doctors and health officials, should remain vigilant.

"ACOG will continue to work closely with obstetric providers and offer the most up-to-date clinical guidance," he added.

Lab officials said they expect to have all retested sample results back in the next four weeks.

Zika infection in adults often has mild symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis, according to the CDC, and approximately one in five people infected with the virus shows symptoms. Severe complications from Zika that require hospitalization are rare, and most people are over the worst of the symptoms after a week, according to the CDC.

In pregnant women, the virus has been found to be associated with fetal development issues and can cause birth defects including microcephaly, which is characterized by an abnormally small head.Lawmakers in Miami-Dade County on Friday backed the mayor's controversial decision to cooperate with the federal government in detaining jailed immigrants slated for deportation.

Citing funding threats for sanctuary jurisdictions by President Donald Trump, Miami-Dade commissioners voted 9-to-3 in favor of Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s order, which declared that Miami-Dade "has never been a sanctuary community," according to a statement.

The commissioners stood behind Gimenez despite listening to scores of residents who spent the day at County Hall hoping to persuade them to help protect Miami-Dade’s immigrant identity.

Miami-Dade is the only U.S. county where a majority of residents were born abroad, according to the Associated Press. The county also has the largest population of Cuban-Americans in the country, according to the county’s website.

Protesters were heard shouting "shame on you" after the vote, according a reporter for ABC News affiliate WPLG.

The mayor, who himself is an immigrant, announced last month that the county would comply with Trump’s crackdown on so-called sanctuary communities.

Trump threatened in an executive order to cut federal funding from "sanctuary" cities that sheltered immigrants who are living in the country illegally.

Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, were first reported missing by their families on Feb. 13 after they did not return from a hike, according to authorities.

A widespread search was immediately launched for the girls. On Tuesday, a volunteer discovered the bodies of German and Williams in the woods by Deer Creek.

Based on "the way the bodies were found," state police believe the girls were murdered, Indiana State Police Sgt. Kim Riley told ABC News.

So far, no one has been arrested. However, authorities have released an image of a man they believe is a person of interest in the double-homicide case.

The man was photographed on a nature trail around the same time German and Williams were hiking before they disappeared, according to state police.

"We are asking help from the public to help identify him so he can be contacted regarding what he might have seen," state police said in a statement Wednesday.

Investigators also told ABC News that a search warrant was executed at a home in Delphi on Thursday night, but it did not yield anything of value to the investigation.

Meanwhile, the double-murder mystery has left the tight-knit community of Delphi heartbroken and fearful.

"Delphi is one of the safest places, and now, to think something could have happened here in our own town -- it's scary," resident Melissa Deal, a family friend of the two girls, told ABC News.

Another family friend, Kevin Kolonginsky, told ABC News he was shocked that such a "horrible" thing could happen in the nature trail near the town.

"We have a wonderful trail system here, that's one of the beautiful things about living here," Kolonginsky said. "And this is as horrible a thing that could happen to an asset like that for a town and to the children of our town."

A post shared by Wabash and Erie Canal (@wabasheriecanal) on Jun 9, 2016 at 4:29pm PDT

He said that "from now on, kids on trails will have their moms and dads with them."

Delphi's mayor, Shane Evans, told ABC News today that the loss of German and Williams has been "surreal" for the city's residents.

"This is difficult time for everyone," Evans said. "I think a double-homicide is rare anywhere, but it's extremely rare for the city of Delphi."

The 27-year-old mayor said the last homicide in the city he could remember happened when he was in middle school.

Delphi, with a population of roughly 2,800 residents, is known for its historic courthouse square and a restored section of the historic Wabash & Erie Canal, according to The Associated Press.

Evans said Delphi is a "generally very safe and friendly area" where "people wave when they see each other on the streets."

Despite the heartbreak, Evans said that the community has come closer together in "an outpouring of support" for each other, the girls and their families.

Hundreds of people in Delphi and other communities in Carroll County showed up on Tuesday to try and help find the two girls after they were reported missing, according to Indiana State Police Sgt. Kim Riley.

"You got to realize this is rural Indiana," Riley told ABC News. "Most of the people born and raised here stay here. People are family. Everyone knows everyone."

News that the girls were found murdered really hit the community hard, according to Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby.

"It's not like anything we've had in our past," Leazenby told ABC News. "This one has a different feel to it. These were wonderful girls ... this was their innocence taken away from them at a very young age."

The mayor said that the city's people will likely "continue to carry on, but with increased vigilance and more acute awareness of their surroundings in the interim."

"We all had hope we'd find the girls alive, but then that hope turned into sorrow when their bodies were found, and then that sorrow turned into frustration and anger for whoever did this," he said.

As law enforcement continue to work around-the-clock to find the girls' killer, the community has set up several public events in the coming days to honor the lives of German and Williams.

Brad Henry, a longtime friend of the Williams family, told WRTV that Williams was a wonderful young girl who was taken way too soon.

"It’s tragic, and there are really no words to describe it," Henry said. The lack of answers has the small community rattled the most, he noted.

"It impacts everybody, especially if you have children," Henry said. "People move away from the city to small towns to get away from this kind of thing, and you think it’s never going to happen and when it does it's total chaos and it's total shock."

ABC News' Enjoli Francis, Lindsey Griswold, Michael Edison Hayden and Jason Volack contributed to this report.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday that Russia must abide by a 2015 deal aimed at ending fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists as the Trump administration searches for ways to work cooperatively with Moscow.

The former Exxon Mobil CEO spoke after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for the first time, in the highest-level face-to-face contact between representatives from the two countries since Trump took office on Jan. 20.

Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and Russian-speaking separatists in Ukraine's began protests that escalated into a war, with thousands killed. A deal two years ago known as the Minsk agreement was intended to end the conflict, but skirmishes have continued.

"As we search for new common ground, we expect Russia to honor its commitments to the Minsk agreements and work to de-escalate the violence in the Ukraine," Tillerson said after talks with Lavrov.

Also Thursday, U.S. Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was set to meet with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. It was to be first meeting between the two countries' senior members of the military since Trump was sworn in.

Tillerson has taken a low-key and reserved approach in his first two weeks on the job and declined the opportunity to speak with reporters traveling with him aboard his plane to Germany. He did not respond to reporters' questions at his first three meetings in Bonn and, until Thursday, had yet to comment publicly on developments with Russia, its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or its actions in Syria and Ukraine.

"As I made clear in my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia where we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people," Tillerson said following the Lavrov meeting.

"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies."

The meeting, on the sidelines of a larger foreign ministers conference in Germany, came amid turmoil inside the Trump administration over Russia and the ouster of national security adviser Michael Flynn over misleading White House officials on his contacts with Moscow.

Asked whether the chaos in Washington was a concern to Russia, Lavrov replied: "You should know we do not interfere in the domestic matters of other countries."

In his opening remarks, Lavrov said he and Tillerson had "plenty of issues to discuss" and that they would "discuss and establish the parameters of our future work."

Trump chose Tillerson for the job in part because of his business experience and relationship with Russia while he was at Exxon. His meeting with Lavrov was seen as a first test of whether that business acumen — which led to great profits for the oil company and Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowing a friendship award upon him — can translate into success in a high-stakes diplomatic arena.

At his confirmation hearing last month, Tillerson voiced conventional concerns about Russia's behavior and said they should be addressed by projecting a forceful and united front. Like others in the administration, he hasn't been specific about how to repair damaged ties or whether doing so might involve lifting U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of the Crimea region.Southern California is bracing for torrential rain and powerful winds today in what could be the strongest storm to hit the region in years, if not decades.

Reporter: Ever since little 22-month-old cooper Harris lost his life, his mother Leanna has been replaying the events of that fateful hot summer day in her head, minute by minute. It begins with a mad dash getting ready for work. Do you remember your last moment with cooper that day? I'm not a morning person. And, of course, as usual, I didn't wake up when I wanted to or needed to. I was getting ready to walk out the door, and I came back and, you know, I told them both "Bye" and I kissed cooper. I kissed cooper good-bye. Not knowing that I was literally kissing him good-bye. Reporter: 8:30 A.M. Ross loads cooper into their small SUV. First, a quick stop for breakfast at this Chick-fil-A. Here, surveillance video from that morning shows Ross holding cooper while they order food. On any other day, Ross would leave the restaurant and turn left at this intersection to drop cooper off at daycare. But on this hot summer day, Ross drives straight at the intersection, towards his office, where he parks and, 30 seconds later, exits the car. See here as he walks across the parking lot, swipes into his building and leaves little cooper behind. More than six hours later, Ross leaves work at 4:15 P.M. Here he is swiping out of his building, casually crossing the parking lot. He gets in the car, seemingly unaware of his son mere inches from him in the back seat. He drives roughly a mile and a half before he pulls over and calls out frantically to onlookers. Tell me exactly what happened. The guy pulled in a parking lot, and the baby's not breathing, it doesn't look like. Reporter: At 4:24 P.M. Police rush to the strip mall parking lot where the former 911 dispatcher is in the throes of his own emergency. He kept saying, "What have I done?" Laid him on the ground, starting doing cpr, trying to resuscitate him. Apparently the child wasn't responding. Reporter: Despite Ross' apparent initial distress, the cops' antennas immediately go up. I think that's where police were suspicious so quickly, because of his behavior at the scene. Reporter: Christian Boone covered the story for the "Atlanta journal-constitution." When they arrived, someone else was doing cpr to cooper. He was talking on the phone to somebody. Officer came up. He yelled at her. I need your I.D. For what? Just hold on. Shut the Up and hold on. My son died. All right, all right, all right, all right. You need to watch your Mouth! Stop fighting. If you drop the cuffs, I'll calm down. You have to understand I'm really upset. Behavior was a little erratic. He was sitting in the back of the squad car alternately weeping or very distraught, and then, sort of looking around to see -- in their mind, they felt like he was putting on a performance, and not a very good one. One of the officers, the best she could describe it as was almost like will Ferrell. One minute he would be yelling, "My boy, my boy!" What have I done? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What have I done? My boy! Next minute, he's calm. Reporter: Cobb county assistant district attorney chuck boring says Ross' strange behavior continues in the back of that police car, complaining about everything from the cuffs -- They're really hurting me. Reporter: To, believe it or not, it being too hot in the back seat. Feels like I'm not getting any air back here. Within a minute or two of you allegedly discovering your son deceased in the back of your car, and you're in the patrol car, complaining about how hot it is in the back of the car. That struck police as well. Reporter: How would you expect a grieving father who had accidentally placed his child in the backseat and left him there, how would you expect someone in that situation to act? I think it's fair to say that there's a spectrum of reactions. You can't say one person is going to react a certain way. Reporter: And Ross Harris' behavior was out of that spectrum? It was absolutely outside the norm. Reporter: When word spreads of Ross' arrest, an outraged public quickly comes to his defense. The community thought it was just a horrific tragedy, that it was a horrible accident. I think a lot of people couldn't understand why the police were holding Ross Harris. Reporter: And there's a reason why so many came to Ross' defense. After all, it's not all that uncommon for children to die in hot cars. 3-year-old died. Reporter: It happened 39 times just last year. It even has a name -- forgotten baby syndrome. In a hot car. For five hours. For 16 hours. An unspeakable tragedy. Reporter: In many cases these deaths seem to be the cause of a parent in a morning fog, forgetting a daycare drop and that their child is still in the car when they park at work. Investigators say the mom forgot her daughter was in the car while she went to work. Reporter: But police think something more sinister is at play with Ross Harris. Police bring him to Cobb county police headquarters to be questioned by detectives, where his behavior continues raising eyebrows. In the interrogation room, I think I used the term "Huffing and puffing" in there, because you see the beginning of it. He starts, he'll yell. Oh, god! He'll start blowing really hard. And then he's just hanging around, looking around. Once the police come in, start talking to him, it's very, you know, matter of fact. I just watched news reports. There was a news report of a guy who did this, just like me. And now he's an advocate for when you park, you turn around and look again. And I've been doing that because the worst fear for me is to leave my son in a hot car. Reporter: After police tell Leanna what has happened, she heads to the station, and into the arms of her husband. They are both unaware police are listening, and watching this video. How will Leanna explain her behavior towards the man who cost their son his life? A lot would be made over your reaction. How are you not angry?

This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.In a Mexican cave system so beautiful and hot that it is called both Fairyland and hell, scientists have discovered life trapped in crystals that could be 50,000 years old.

The bizarre and ancient microbes were found dormant in caves in Naica, Mexico, and were able to exist by living on minerals such as iron and manganese, said Penelope Boston, head of NASA's Astrobiology Institute. .

"It's super life," said Boston, who presented the discovery Friday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Boston.

If confirmed, the find is yet another example of how microbes can survive in extremely punishing conditions on Earth.

Though it was presented at a science conference and was the result of nine years of work, the findings haven't yet been published in a scientific journal and haven't been peer reviewed. Boston planned more genetic tests for the microbes she revived both in the lab and on site.

The life forms — 40 different strains of microbes and even some viruses — are so weird that their nearest relatives are still 10 percent different genetically. That makes their closest relative still pretty far away, about as far away as humans are from mushrooms, Boston said.

The Naica caves — an abandoned lead and zinc mine — are half a mile (800 meters) deep. Before drilling occurred by a mine company, the mines had been completely cut off from the outside world. Some were as vast as cathedrals, with crystals lining the iron walls. They were also so hot that scientists had to don cheap versions of space suits — to prevent contamination with outside life — and had ice packs all over their bodies.

Boston said the team could only work about 20 minutes at a time before ducking to a "cool" room that was about 100 degrees (38 Celsius).

NASA wouldn't allow Boston to share her work for outside review before Friday's announcement so scientists couldn't say much. But University of South Florida biologist Norine Noonan, who wasn't part of the study but was on a panel where Boston presented her work, said it made sense.

"Why are we surprised?" Noonan said. "As a biologist I would say life on Earth is extremely tough and extremely versatile."

This isn't the oldest extreme life. Several years ago, a different group of scientists published studies about microbes that may be half a million years old and still alive. Those were trapped in ice and salt, which isn't quite the same as rock or crystal, Boston said.

The age of the Naica microbes was determined by outside experts who looked at where the microbes were located in the crystals and how fast those crystals grow.

It's not the only weird life Boston is examining. She is also studying microbes commonly found in caves in the United States, Ukraine and elsewhere that eat copper sulfate and seem to be close to indestructible.

"It's simply another illustration of just how completely tough Earth life is," Boston said.

It gets looser when you sit, tightens when you get up and even vibrates if you have been sitting for too long.Twentieth Century Fox apologized Thursday for using several fake news sites and made-up stories to promote its new movie, "A Cure for Wellness." The controversial promotional campaign was criticized on social media.

The studio said in a statement to ABC News, "In raising awareness for our films, we do our best to push the boundaries of traditional marketing in order to creatively express our message to consumers. In this case, we got it wrong."

It continued, "The digital campaign was inappropriate on every level, especially given the trust we work to build every day with our consumers. We have reviewed our internal approval process and made appropriate changes to ensure that every part of a campaign is elevated to and vetted by management in order to avoid this type of mistake in the future. We sincerely apologize."

The promoters of the film created websites with names like NY Morning Post, Salt Lake City Guardian, Houston Leader, Sacramento Dispatch and the Indianapolis Gazette, and they posted realistic-looking news stories about completely fictional events. One story featured President Trump holding a purported secret meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, while another said Trump was going to ban vaccinations.

The stories asked readers to post any complaints about the apparent news by using hashtags like #ACureForWellness. That had consumers posting the "A Cure for Wellness" taglines, apparently without knowing the stories they were commenting on were fake and that their posts were just a promotion for a film.

When legitimate news organizations exposed the campaign, Fox and Regency were slammed by critics on social media for disseminating fake news at a time when the news media is in conflict with the president over his labeling the reporting of prominent news organizations as untrustworthy.

"A Cure for Wellness" is out in theaters this weekend.Editor's note: This article originally appeared on Babble.com and has been reprinted here with permission. Disney is the parent company of both Babble and ABC News.

The look on a baby’s face when presented with his or her very own birthday cake to devour and, more important, smash is always priceless. It’s a mixture of pure joy and overwhelming excitement (that we get to experience vicariously).

But photographer Lyndsey Wright had been there, done that, many times over. So instead of opting for a traditional cake smash during a recent photo shoot, she got creative.

Wright suggested a taco smash to clients Ben and Jordan Ogden, who were prepping for their 1-year-old daughter Stella’s birthday. After all, who doesn’t love a good taco on their birthday?

It turned out to be the perfect fit, especially because Stella’s birthday was going to be fiesta-themed.

Lyndseys Photo Co.

Wright told Babble that despite the popularity of the cake smash trend, she wanted to make things more personal.

“I was doing a lot of cake smashes, and it was getting redundant,” Wright said. “I wanted to get outside the box a bit, so I started asking parents if their babies had a favorite table food and if they’d want to do a smash with that instead.”

So far, she has done everything from doughnuts to popsicles and even an entire barbecue meal. But one day, Wright said, an idea for tacos popped into her head and “I just had to find someone who wanted to do it.”

Luckily, she met her match with the Ogdens.

Lyndseys Photo Co.

“It just worked out perfectly that a longtime client turned friend was having her daughter’s first birthday fiesta-themed,” she told Babble.

And on top of that, Stella’s family chose the theme because of her love of Mexican food.

“One of Stella’s first foods was rice and beans,” her mom said. “We have eaten out at our local authentic Mexican restaurant [every] Wednesday since she was born.”

As you might have guessed by her adorable expressions, Stella loved every minute of the taco smash. (Though she “mostly ate the sides ... [and] gnawed on the shells,” Wright said.)

But she’s not the only one who loved it. Stella’s adorable photo shoot has gone viral in the past week on Facebook, with more than 42,000 likes.Katy Perry says the prospect of sharing her music with millions during the Super Bowl halftime show this Sunday is so profound, it borders on the spiritual."I'd like to dedicate this award and my performance to the transgender community," Tambor, "Thank you for letting us be part of the change."The NBA has warned that Texas could be overlooked for future events because of a proposed "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people.

The Texas legislation is similar to a North Carolina law that prompted the league to move the All-Star Game out of that state. It would require people to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate.

NBA spokesman Mike Bass says an environment where people are treated "fairly and equally" weighs heavily in deciding host locations. The NBA first made the statement last week, and the NFL has issued similar warnings.

Texas has hosted three All-Star Games since 2006.

Charlotte was originally supposed to host Sunday's All-Star Game. But the NBA moved the game to New Orleans after North Carolina adopted its "bathroom bill" last year.Hoping to shift attention from his troubled White House, President Donald Trump hit the road Friday to deliver a pep talk to American workers and the rest of the nation, resurrecting the jobs promises that powered his election victory and pledging in a campaign-style rally to "unleash the power of the American spirit."

But he was only a few hours away from the turmoil he has stirred in Washington when he swerved from that positive message to escalate his complaints about news coverage of his young administration.

"The FAKENEWS media ... is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" he exclaimed on Twitter, singling out The New York Times and TV networks. His latest outburst came a day after he forcefully defended his administration in a marathon White House news conference, brushing aside the tumult, infighting among senior staff and setbacks in courts and Congress.

He took a more upbeat tack in South Carolina.

"We love our workers and we are going to protect our workers," Trump declared at a Boeing plant where the company showed off its new 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft. "We are going to fight for jobs. We are going to fight for our families," he said in a reprise of the "America First" message from his campaign.

Trump is expected to stick to the theme Saturday when he holds a big rally in central Florida, a change of scenery that marks an effort to galvanize a month-old White House that has been buffeted by crisis and paralyzed by dysfunction.

The new president toured a 787-10 still under construction and, before leaving, sat in the pilot's seat of a completed airplane painted in contrasting shades of blue that formed the backdrop for his remarks. Some 5,000 employees and others inside a hangar greeted him with chants of "USA, USA."

The president, who owns an airplane but now travels exclusively on government aircraft, praised the Boeing jetliner as "an amazing piece of art." He noted that it's made of carbon fiber, seats 330 passengers, is 18 feet longer than the previous model and can fly for half a day before landing.

"The name says it all. Dreamliner, great name," Trump said. "Our country is all about making dreams come true."

"As your president I'm going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work," he said. "This is our mantra: Buy American and hire American."

Trump then departed South Carolina for his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he plans to spend the holiday weekend. He arrived late Friday afternoon.

In Washington on Thursday, he complained bitterly about news coverage — and "criminal" leaks from within the government that took down his top national security adviser and revived questions about his own ties to Russia.

Trump is still trying to stabilize his national security team. On Monday, he demanded the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn following revelations that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about Flynn's contacts with Russia. Trump's first choice to replace Flynn — retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward — turned down the offer.

FBI Director Jim Comey left a meeting with senators on the intelligence committee Friday afternoon. Neither Comey nor the senators would discuss the subject of the meeting, but it followed reports that the FBI had interviewed Flynn about his contacts in late December with Russian officials.

Trump tweeted Friday that retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, "who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA — as are three others." Kellogg, who is serving as the acting national security adviser, traveled to South Carolina with Trump aboard Air Force One.

Also along on the Florida trip were Trump's daughter Ivanka; her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump; White House chief of staff Reince Priebus; and strategist Steve Bannon. Ivanka Trump waved and blew kisses to the crowd as she exited the completed 787-10 Dreamliner before her father did.

The White House said Trump might interview national security candidates at his estate.

In South Carolina, Trump said, "America is going to start winning again, winning like never before," returning to a staple promise from last year's campaign speeches.

In his remarks, Trump also mentioned that he's been in talks with Boeing executives to reduce the cost to the government of building a future Air Force One presidential aircraft. He has denounced the costs as "out of control."

Asked by reporters for an update after Friday's speech, Trump said: "Price is too high. But we're negotiating."

Trump scheduled a campaign-style rally Saturday in Florida, his first as president. The event at an airport hangar in Melbourne will be 1,354 days before the 2020 election. Trump himself promoted his appearance on Twitter: "Looking forward to the Florida rally tomorrow. Big crowd expected!"

Big rallies were the hallmark of Trump's presidential campaign. He continued to do them, although with smaller crowds, throughout the early part of his transition, during what he called a "thank you" tour.

The Florida rally comes as he makes his third weekend trip this month to what he calls his "Winter White House," his Mar-a-Lago resort. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the rally was an example of how Trump plans to "continue taking his message directly to the American people."

ABC's INES DE LA CUETARA: Speaking to reporters after his rally in Andover, Minnesota, Marco Rubio said this might not be such a great night for Donald Trump.





"We’re gonna have a lot of delegates after tonight and you’re gonna see very clearly after tonight that Donald Trump has no chance of ever getting the delegates he needs to be the nominee," he said.









He also said it might also be a rough night for Cruz.





"This was supposed to be Ted Cruz’s day. This was the day where he said he was going to bring an end to the campaign, Super Tuesday, he was going to sweep the South. I don’t think that’s going to happen -- it’s pretty clear now, and so I think he has big problems as he faces that," he said.











"If you can’t sweep up Super Tuesday where else in this country are you going to get a big showing? Because it only gets worse from here for him. It only gets better for us and I feel good about it," he went on.

The event, which is listed on Trump’s campaign website, will take place at a hangar at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport, the site of a previous Trump campaign rally in September.

Trump repeatedly took aim at former President Barack Obama for his campaign efforts while in office.

Asked about the event Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer called the rally “a campaign event” and said it is “being run by the campaign.”

On the day of his inauguration, Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Committee indicating a possible re-election bid in 2020. Trump wrote that his filing, “does not constitute a formal announcement,” but as a result, he is able to collect donations.

President Barack Obama didn't file his re-election paperwork until April 2011, 19 months before the 2012 presidential election; President George W. Bush didn't file until May 2003, 18 months before the 2004 election.

"Many times in the past, what sitting presidents have done in the first two years is really suspend any fundraising activities for their campaign committees," former FEC chair Michael Toner told ABC News in January, adding that the move could help keep the dollars flowing. "It gives them flexibility to raise money for a potential re-election effort."

In 2011, Trump tweeted that the country was “blowing up” in 2011 while Obama was “out campaigning,” and asking, “Does @BarackObama ever work? He is constantly campaigning and fundraising--on both the taxpayer's dime and time---not fair!”

The White House confirmed Wednesday that Trump will fly aboard Air Force One to Florida this weekend for a previously scheduled trip to his home at Mar-a-Lago. It is not yet clear how he will travel from there to Orlando for Saturday's event.Dakota Access Pipeline protesters at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation in North Dakota met with state representatives on Thursday, after the governor issued an emergency evacuation order for the Oceti Sakowin protest camp.

John Bigelow, media director of the Oceti Sakowin camp, told ABC News that representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and one official from the Morton County Sheriff’s Department attended the meeting outside on the Cannonball River Bridge, along with officials from North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum’s office, including the executive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission, Scott Davis.

The meeting was scheduled, in part, to discuss the details of the emergency evacuation order, according to Bigelow.

A source at the camp told ABC News after Thursday's meeting that the federal deadline of Feb. 22 -- the same deadline set by the governor's order -- remains in effect for the camp to be vacated.

Burgum signed an emergency evacuation order on Wednesday night for the Oceti Sakowin protest camp “out of concern for the safety of people who are residing on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) land in southern Morton County and to avoid an ecological disaster to the Missouri River,” according to a statement from the Republican governor’s office.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began coordinating a cleanup in late January, but state officials say it isn't happening fast enough. Burgum’s emergency evacuation order cited increasing temperatures and the threat of flooding as the impetus in accelerating the camp's clean-up.

"Warm temperatures have accelerated snowmelt in the area of the Oceti Sakowin protest camp, and the National Weather Service reports that the Cannonball River should be on the watch for rising water levels and an increased risk of ice jams later this week," the statement from the governor’s office read.

"Due to these conditions, the governor’s emergency order addresses safety concerns to human life as anyone in the floodplain is at risk for possible injury or death. The order also addresses the need to protect the Missouri River from the waste that will flow into the Cannonball River and Lake Oahe if the camp is not cleared and the cleanup expedited," the statement added.

The Cannonball River is a tributary of the Missouri River.

The Army Corps, in a letter issued Feb. 3, ordered those camping on federal property to vacate to prevent injuries and significant environmental damage in the event of flooding in the area.

“The Oceti Sakowin camp needs to be evacuated no later than Feb. 22 in order to allow private contractors to accelerate the removal of waste from the camp,” the statement from the governor’s office read.

Gov. Burgum told ABC affiliate KSTP in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday that he plans to ask the federal government for more than $33 million for law enforcement and cleanup bills related to the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camps that has housed hundreds -- and, at times, thousands -- of protesters.

Bigelow, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe who has been at the Oceti Sakowin protest camp for the past six months, said law enforcement officials on Wednesday moved up the barricade separating protesters from the pipeline construction area to within a few hundred yards of the camp's north gate, the main entrance. But there was no law enforcement presence south of the barricade ahead of Thursday's meeting, Bigelow said.

Bigelow said there was some tension this morning when front-load tractors and roll-off trucks rolled in to begin removing garbage and waste from the campground, which is situated at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation.

“Most folks are concentrating on breaking down their camps to move out of Oceti Sakowin and either back home or to one of the other camps that’s been set up,” he told ABC News on Thursday, ahead of the scheduled meeting.

Federal officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs remained south of the barricade this morning and were expected to set up a road block to prevent vehicles from crossing the Cannonball River Bridge during the meeting, according to Bigelow.

The Army Corps granted an easement on Feb. 8 to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline, allowing it to install the final segment of the 1,172-mile pipeline. Part of this 1.25-mile section will run under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation.

“The safety of those located on Corps-managed land is our top priority, in addition to preventing contaminants from entering the waterway,” U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District Commander Col. John Henderson said in a statement at the time. “We appreciate the proactive efforts of the tribes to help clean the protest site ahead of potential flooding along the river, typical during the runoff season.”

The granting of the easement follows a decision on Feb. 7 by Robert Speer, the acting secretary of the Army, to terminate the notice of intent to perform an environmental impact statement and to notify Congress of the Army’s intent to grant permission for the crossing under Lake Oahe. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of available information.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said in a statement at the time that it will “challenge any easement decision” on the grounds that the environmental impact statement was “wrongfully terminated.” The tribe said it will also “demand a fair, accurate and lawful environmental impact statement to identify true risks to its treaty rights, including its water supply and sacred places.”

If the Dakota Access Pipeline is completed and begins operating, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said it will “seek to shut the pipeline operations down.”

While the Army Corps says this area is federally owned land, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe cites an 1851 treaty that it says designates the land for Native American tribes. The tribe, which claims its members were never meaningfully consulted before construction began, sued in July to block the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. That lawsuit is pending, and the Army Corps and the company behind the pipeline argued in court papers that they followed a standard review process.

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which is part of the Great Sioux Nation, has joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s lawsuit against the pipeline, filing a motion at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Feb. 9 seeking a temporary restraining order “to halt construction and drilling” under and on either side of the land surrounding Lake Oahe.

The tribe argued that the pipeline “will desecrate the waters upon which Cheyenne River Sioux tribal members rely for their most important religious practices and therefore substantially burden the free exercise of their religion,” according to a court document obtained by ABC News.

On Monday, the court denied that motion seeking a temporary restraining order.

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a separate motion seeking a preliminary injunction directing the Army Corps to withdraw the easement issued to the pipeline company on Feb. 8. The tribe alleges that the easement granted is “entirely unlawful," according to court documents.

“The government has granted the easement, and Dakota Access has begun to drill. This court cannot wait until the harm begins to issue equitable relief. When the free exercise of religion is at stake, a threat certain to that right is enough to constitute irreparable harm,” the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe stated in a court document.

“And in view of the threat to the tribe’s and its members’ constitutional right, this court may not wait until the oil is slithering under the tribe’s sacred waters. The law entitles the tribe to relief as soon as the government acts to threaten their rights," the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe added in the court document.

That motion seeking an preliminary injunction is expected to be heard in court later this month.

In addition, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion on Tuesday seeking “expedited summary judgment" on its claims that this easement decision as well as the Army Corps regulatory actions "are arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law."

After receiving the easement to build the pipeline across land on both sides of Lake Oahe, the Texas-based developer, Energy Transfer Partners, announced it would resume construction immediately, and indeed work has resumed.

The Dakota Access Pipeline, which would connect oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois, is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2017, according to the company.

“The drilling under Lake Oahe will take approximately 60 days," a company spokesperson told ABC News in a statement on Feb. 8 after the Army Corps granted the easement. "It will take an additional 23 days to fill the line to Patoka, Illinois, enabling Dakota Access to be in service in approximately 83 days."

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been at the forefront of massive and prolonged protests over the four-state crude oil pipeline. The demonstrations have drawn thousands of Native Americans, environmental activists and their allies to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. The protesters, who call themselves "water protectors," argue that the pipeline will threaten the reservation’s water supply and traverse culturally sacred sites.

Kelcy Warren, the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, has said that “concerns about the pipeline’s impact on local water supply are unfounded” and “multiple archaeological studies conducted with state historic preservation offices found no sacred items along the route.”

In the final days of President Barack Obama’s administration, Jo-Ellen Darcy, the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, announced on Dec. 4 that an easement would not be granted for the pipeline to cross under the large reservoir on the Missouri River.

She said at the time of the decision that the Army Corps would engage in additional review and analysis, including a “robust consideration and discussion of alternative locations for the pipeline crossing the Missouri River.” Darcy also encouraged the Corps to share company documents containing risk analyses and spill models that had not been made available to the tribes during the initial environmental review.

All these steps, Darcy determined, would best be accomplished by the Army Corps’ preparing a full environmental impact statement allowing for public input -- a process that could have take years. She is no longer in the position after the change in administrations.

The move to deny the easement was hailed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents as a major victory. But on his second weekday in office, President Trump signed a memorandum aimed at advancing the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as one directed at the Keystone XL pipeline.

At a news conference at the White House on Thursday, Trump told reporters his administration has “taken steps to begin construction” of the two pipelines.

Bernie Sanders said Monday that while his campaign wants to win in Iowa, the outcome of the caucus will not make or break his campaign.

“Of course we want to win here but if we end up getting two delegates less than Hillary Clinton - why is that the end?” he told reporters from the steps of his campaign bus after making a quick stop to talk to volunteers at his Iowa campaign head quarters in Des Moines. Sanders is neck and neck in the polls with Hillary Clinton in this first caucus state. He said regardless of the result in this first contest, he's in it for the long haul.

“This is a national campaign. We are in to win at the convention,” he continued. “We are taking this all the way.”

According to the Senator, his campaign has hosted over 100 town meetings in Iowa. He told fans Monday morning that as of yesterday over 70,000 people in the state have come to see him speak in person.



As for tonight? Sanders said it is all about voter turnout. “You got a tied ball game. We will win tonight if voter turnout is high. We will struggle tonight if voter turnout is low.”The White House and Department of Homeland Security said today that they are not planning to use the National Guard to apprehend and arrest undocumented immigrants, despite a "preliminary draft memo" that indicated doing so was a possibility.

"The President and the White House has never had that as part of any plan to use the National Guard in any capacity for that," White House Deputy Spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters aboard Air Force One today.

But a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security told ABC News there was in fact "a very early, preliminary draft memo” that included language to utilize the Guard to, as the memo put it, "perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, and detention of aliens in the United States."

The proposal would have covered 11 states -- those bordering Mexico as well as those adjacent to them.

This senior official confirmed that the memo, circulating online, appears to be an authentic version of that early draft, but that the latest version had removed any reference of using the National Guard as a law enforcement and immigration force.

DHS officials insist Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly never saw that version of the document and that his name appears on it only because he would be the person who ultimately signs off on it.

Kelly has seen the latest version and his name still appears on it, according to this official.

"The Department is not considering mobilizing the National Guard for immigration enforcement," a spokesman for DHS said.

Using the National Guard for the purpose of border protection is by no means unprecedented. There were two major border protection efforts that employed the Guard under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama: operations Jump Start in 2006 and Phalanx in 2010. But neither were along the scale of what this plan was proposing. The biggest difference being the proposal to allow Guardsmen to arrest people.

Operation Jump Start authorized National Guard to do border enforcement and construction of a fence, but they were there to observe and report and were not involved in law enforcement. Under Obama they were mainly doing overflight and surveillance, working with law enforcement on the ground. They weren’t arresting people.

Nevertheless, the DHS is adamant there is no longer any proposal to use the National Guard to arrest illegal immigrants and that this draft never made it to the secretary's desk for consideration.Judges:

This is the big one -- either Germany take home their fourth World Cup trophy and become the first European side to do so on South American soil, or Lionel Messi makes a date with destiny to join the likes of Pele and Diego Maradona in the beautiful game’s hall of fame.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made his debut on the world stage this week, traveling to Bonn, Germany, for the Group of 20 summit where he met with his counterparts from more than a dozen countries.

It was the first opportunity for the former Exxon Mobil CEO to show off the vaunted management skills and global experience that marked his time at the oil company and made him a marquee name for President Trump’s cabinet. But what the public saw was America’s top diplomat appearing hamstrung by a peremptory White House and hesitant to speak up.

Tillerson’s role as secretary of state has been scaled back.

The secretary of state is normally the spokesperson for American foreign policy. But Tillerson's State Department has been sidelined in many of the Trump administration’s key decisions. There was limited consultation with the State Department on the president's travel ban; most of State’s senior staff positions have been left vacant during his brief tenure; and there were reports that the department was caught off guard by the White House’s new stance on the prospect of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The G20 is where Tillerson would take his first steps. “He’ll be primarily in listening mode,” said a senior State Department official. “He wants to use this initial engagement to get a sense of where the parties stand” in the Syria conflict, for example.

When asked questions about key policy matters at the summit, the secretary was quiet. “I don’t have any comment,” he said when asked about the Syrian peace process in Kazakhstan. The response was one of only two answers he gave reporters during the whole trip.

There was also confusion over the current U.S. position on the Iran deal, which Trump has blasted as a “terrible deal” but Tillerson has said he wants to review. After meeting Tillerson, the French foreign minister told Reuters the two countries had a clear difference of opinion over the deal because the U.S. wanted to “review” the deal “from scratch.” But when Tillerson was asked about his French counterpart’s comments, he said, “I didn’t leave any such impression.” The French foreign minister also called U.S. policy on Israel and Palestine “confused and worrying.”

Earlier this week before the summit, Tillerson also seemed out of the loop, missing meetings in Washington, D.C., with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his team. A State Department official told ABC News, “The secretary was on previously scheduled private travel.” And although he had dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, he skipped meetings Wednesday with the Israeli delegation, choosing instead to fly to Germany that day and get a night of sleep before Thursday’s meetings.

Tillerson is hesitant to talk to the press.

The two-day G20 summit is the first we’re hearing of Tillerson since he arrived at State. But the secretary spoke very little, especially to reporters, instead posing for pictures and only twice answering shouted questions.

The one time he did address the media was for brief prepared remarks. He left without taking questions.

Compared to his predecessors, he took a significantly reduced group of press with him on this trip, and the State Department hasn’t held a press briefing since he was sworn in.

It’s not just that he was tight-lipped, but at times he seemed to not want reporters there at all. When the press were ushered in for a photo op with the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, they were quickly sent back out. Even Lavrov asked why the rush. And as the press pool was escorted from a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Tillerson quipped, “They never give up.”

The world is looking to American leadership, but nervous about what they’ll find.

After a tumultuous start to the Trump administration, part of Tillerson’s job in Bonn was to reassure allies as well as to flex some American muscle. He reaffirmed American support for NATO, issued a joint statement with Japan and South Korea to condemn North Korea’s recent missile test, and pressured China to “use all available tools to moderate North Korea’s destabilizing behavior.”

On Russia, he reiterated Trump’s line that America “will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation.” But he took a firmer stance than the president has on Russian aggression, especially in Ukraine.

“Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies,” he said. “We expect Russia to honor its commitment to the Minsk agreements and work to de-escalate the violence in Ukraine."

He participated in big meetings on Yemen and Syria, and foreign counterparts were eager to meet him and get to work. He met with more than a dozen of them.

“Met a lot of people, made a lot of new friends. Full schedule,” he said Friday as he prepared to leave the summit with what he said were “many” messages for the president.It was quite a night for a New York state college basketball fan who made a half-court shot to win a $500 gift card and received a marriage proposal seconds later.

Erin Tobin took part in a Dunkin' Donuts promotion during Thursday night's Manhattan-Siena game at the Times Union Center in Albany. As the company's mascot stood nearby, the 30-year-old Siena graduate and season ticket holder banked in her half-court, one-handed heave.

After celebrating, Tobin turned around to see the mascot's giant coffee cup costume being removed to reveal her boyfriend, 31-year-old Steve Duckett, on his knee and holding an engagement ring. A very surprised Tobin said yes as the crowd cheered.

Adding to an already big night, Siena beat Manhattan 94-71.Transcript for Why Leanna Taylor took the stand in ex-husband's defense

Reporter: Glynn county courthouse, Brunswick, Georgia. The Ross Harris murder trial is being held 300 miles from the scene of the crime. Defense attorneys argued for a change of venue to ensure a fair trial. I've described to a lot of people what happened to me was kind of like an earthquake. Losing cooper was the massive damage, and then everything else after that was like an aftershock. Reporter: Ross' lawyers now March out a cast of characters from Ross' brother. I think he loved cooper more than life itself. Reporter: To a bible study confidante. Cooper kind of became the center of Ross' attention whenever he was around. Reporter: To help paint a picture of Ross as a caring and committed father, not a cheating, cold-hearted killer. But the defense saved its best witness for last. The accused's ex-wife speaking in his defense. She took the stand in her ex-husband's murder trial. Reporter: The courtroom is aghast as the grieving mother turned spurned wife takes the stand. Now divorced from Ross, and now back to Leanna Taylor. She may be her ex-husband's last, great hope. Did Ross love this little boy? Yes, he did, very much. Reporter: You went on the stand and supported your husband. Why did you do that? This was never about me defending Ross. When you get on the stand and you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, that's what you're supposed to do. And that's what I did. I couldn't get up there and say that he was a bad father because it wasn't true. I couldn't get up there and say that he seemed bothered by having a child because it wasn't true. Reporter: But on cross-examination the prosecution zeroes in on Ross' so-called double life, confronting Leanna about Ross' affairs and other lewd behaviors. You would agree that that was somebody completely different than the person you married? I would agree that that was a part of his personality that he did not share with me. Reporter: But Leanna dislikes the description of a double life, saying she there were struggles in their marriage, revealing she knew her husband had at times sexted with other women and struggled with a porn addiction, that she says she believed was under control. She says they were in counseling when cooper died. Did he ever tell you that he'd gotten up at 5:43 A.M. Around there, was awake at that point, messaging strangers? No. Reporter: But Leanna remains steadfast that he would never have taken the life of their 22-month-old son. There was evidence in our relationship that would suggest that he would be capable of being unfaithful to me. There was no evidence in our relationship that suggested that he would harm anyone, much less his own son. Reporter: Was there ever any evidence presented at trial that made you question whether or not Ross was guilty of murder? Not guilty of intentionally murdering, not planning the murder. Reporter: Nothing about the two-minute drive? No. Reporter: The proximity of the car seat? The car seat would've been there whether cooper was there or not. Reporter: Him going back to the car? Nothing made you think, "Hmm"? The going back to the car part actually for me solidifies that it wasn't intentional. To me, it said the opposite. He didn't have a clue that cooper was in there. Reporter: What about Ross watching that video of an animal in a hot car in the days prior to cooper's death? We have a dog. Many, many other people viewed that same video. Reporter: Many, many people didn't then leave their son in a hot car. Right, you're right. Reporter: But despite Leanna's steadfast support for Ross, there was this. The most raw and emotional confession she would make. How do you feel about your ex-husband? He ruined my life. He destroyed my life. I'm humiliated. I may never trust anybody again the way that I did. If I never see him again after this day, that's fine. Reporter: After 26 days of trial, over 70 witnesses and roughly 1,200 pieces of evidence, it's judgment day. We find the defendant guilty this 14th day of November. Reporter: There's a hush in the courtroom as a jury of six men and six women find Ross Harris guilty of all eight counts, including felony murder. He is sentenced to life in prison plus 32 years. Found guilty for leaving his son in a hot Coar. The maximum sentence. Reporter: Leanna continues to believe that the jury got it wrong, but she's beginning to come to terms with why they would have convicted him. I think that most people believe that somebody needs to pay for the death of a little boy. That's the emotional response to that. His actions that day resulted in my son dying, and that's the truth. Reporter: Has Ross ever apologized to you? Mm-hmm. Reporter: What did he apologize for? For not protecting our son that day, for not being faithful to me, for taking his family for granted. Reporter: Do you accept his apology? I accept it. It's not going to change anything. Reporter: Do you feel like you have closure with him? No. I don't really know what the closure would be. I've never had the opportunity to express the anger that I've had towards him. Reporter: Have you imagined what you would say to him? Yes. I don't think it's appropriate for right now.

She was diagnosed with the disease at 12 years old, had a stroke at 21 and had multiple operations over the years to try to preserve her heart.

When her heart began to fail, her doctors decided she need a transplant. She was placed on the organ donor list in November. Earlier this month, Salberg was matched to a new heart and underwent the lifesaving transplant surgery.

But before she went into the operating room, she had an unusual request for her surgeon: Save the damaged heart.

Salberg has been an activist for heart disease research and started the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association after her sister died from the condition. At least five other family members have been diagnosed with the disease, in which the heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the ventricles to thicken, making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, 600,000 to 1.5 million people are afflicted with the disorder in the U.S., or about 1 in 500 people.

Salberg said she wanted her damaged heart to become a tool to raise awareness of the condition and educate others.

"We were friends for 48 years," she said about her heart.

Her transplant surgeon at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Dr. Margarita Camacho, said she was surprised by the request.

"I've never had anybody ask that. The first thing I thought was, 'How wonderful she wanted to do that,'" Camacho told ABC News.

Four days after her surgery, Salberg's husband and Camacho presented Salberg with her original heart, which had been frozen. After nearly a lifetime of hearing her heart beat extra-loudly in her chest, she said she was surprised when she held it.

"I was struck by the density and the weight to it," Salberg said. "It was really, really heavy."

Salberg said that although she greeted her damaged heart with a profanity, she also felt grateful that it was functional long enough to get her through until her transplant.

"I said, 'Thank you. You worked hard for 48 years,'" she told ABC News. "It [was] with me every moment of the day of my life. It was nice to be able to say goodbye."

Salberg said that after the transplant, she instantly felt a difference in her energy and overall well-being. The renewed energy has pushed her to focus on the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association and help others who are afflicted with her condition.

"The reality clicked in I have an entire community of people who feel badly," Salberg said. "I have an entire life ahead of me to find ways to improve their health, and I'm doubling down. You ain't seen nothing yet."A woman who suffered from severe acrophobia conquered her fear of heights by facing her anxieties head-on as part of a new "Good Morning America" campaign that launched today called "Face Your Fears."

Jane Fisher, 35, of Atlanta, climbed a 21-foot ladder live on “GMA” before anxiously stepping onto a trapeze platform to go flying high through the air.

“I’m ready to fly,” Fisher proudly said moments before taking the leap at Fearless Flyers Academy in Mystic, Connecticut.

And with that courageous attitude, she pulled it off.

Psychologist Ellen Koch, a professor at Eastern Michigan University who specializes in "one-session exposure therapy,” has been helping Fisher train to get to this point.

“For Jane, she was very motivated to overcome her fear and that was really helpful for her,” Koch said. “And it was really important for her to learn about the anxiety process and that it was important for her to confront her fear, and let the anxiety come down and that she’ll be fine with that, as opposed to trying to fight it or avoid it like she had done in the past.”

Once Fisher climbed down from the net that caught her brave jump, she told “GMA” that she was “feeling awesome.”

“I feel fearless,” she added. “Well, not fearless, but I just feel good.”

She said the hardest part of the entire ordeal was getting from the ladder to the platform 21-feet in the air, “and just trying to reassure yourself there’s a net underneath, and then from there it helps the anxiety go down,” she explained.

To help her build up to this experience, "GMA" sent Fisher to the Trapeze School New York to help her face her fears head-on by working with Koch.

"I freeze, I get sweaty palms," Fisher said at the time. "I'm getting sweaty palms thinking about it."

Koch’s "one-session exposure therapy” is based on the premise that if you repeatedly flee from your anxieties, you actually reinforce that fear. But if you stay put and face the fear a little at a time, the anxiety will eventually subside.

"We'll have her take one step at a time," Koch said of Fisher at the start of her treatment. "We'll let her sort of pace treatment and so when she's ready, she'll take the next step up the ladder and we'll go one step at a time until she gets to the top."

Koch added that she believes such therapy is so effective that Fisher’s lifelong fear of heights could be cured in three hours.

And today on “GMA,” Fisher proved to herself that it worked.Malaysia Airlines said today that it had lost contact with one of its planes over Ukraine.



Lady Gaga opening up about her emotional performance to come. Might be the moment of the night.The Islamic State group is hemorrhaging money with every piece of territory it loses, according to a new analysis that found that the group's "business model" is on the path to failure.

The analysis released Saturday by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence and the accounting firm EY found that the self-proclaimed caliphate's financial resources have been drained substantially since the days beginning in mid-2014 when it captured banks, oil wells and entire warehouses of weapons as it amassed land.

The report found that Islamic State revenue has declined from up to $1.9 billion in 2014 to at most $870 million in 2016.

"One of the mistakes that's been made in the past when we were talking about Islamic State was talking about it purely as a terrorist organization. It is a terrorist organization but it is more than that. It holds territory," said Peter Neumann, director of the center at King's College London. "That also means it has a lot more expenses. It needs to fix roads. It needs to pay teachers. It needs to run health services. It needs to pay for these things that al-Qaida never had to."

But less money may not make the group less dangerous, the report said.

"We know from the attacks in Paris and Brussels and Berlin that none of them was expensive," Neumann said.

Most of the recent attacks in Europe and the U.S. were self-financed by the people that carried them out, with little input or money from the IS leadership in the war zone of Syria and Iraq.

Among the top sources of revenue for the Islamic State group were taxes and fees, oil, ransoms, and looting or other extortion. All of those, Neumann said, required newly captured territory to be sustainable and to keep the group's promise of a caliphate.

A federal lawsuit filed in December was a prime example of Islamic State's revenues from a combination of seized land, taxes and extortion. According to the court filing, the group received at least 20 percent of the proceeds of items excavated from archaeological sites under its control and taxed antiquities sold in its territories. At one point, a child was kidnapped to force an antiquities merchant to pay, said the lawsuit, which sought the recovery of four ancient artifacts believed to have been put up for sale by the group.

But that income only flows when Islamic State can exert absolute control. According to an update Friday from the global coalition against Islamic State, the group has lost 62 percent of the territory it controlled in Iraq at its height in August 2014 and 30 percent of its territory in Syria.

"The business model was also to constantly expand and to plunder the areas that were becoming part of the caliphate. It was essentially a pyramid scheme which relied upon constant expansion," Neumann said.

A U.S. defense official said IS still has enough money to pay its bills, despite the fact that it has lost sources of income and has reduced what it pays foot soldiers. The official said the U.S. certainly has not seen IS' financial situation damaged to the point that it has degraded its ability to conduct external attacks. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss IS and spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Near-daily car bombings in Baghdad indicate that the group's ability to inflict carnage is undiminished in Iraq, even as it cedes ground it once controlled.

But Neumann said the fall of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul could be a lethal blow in the long term.

"The brand of Islamic State will suffer and the attractiveness of wanting to carry out terrorist attacks in the name of Islamic State will suffer because it is no longer projecting strength and utopia," Neumann said.

Deb Reichmann in Washington contributed.Ruth Negga is nominated for her first Oscar this year for her role in “Loving,” the true story of real-life couple Mildred and Richard Loving and their fight to invalidate laws prohibiting interracial marriage in the 1960s.

For Negga, a win for best actress would be both validation and a way to inform more people about the Lovings’ uplifting story, she said.

“To me, movies encourage a shift in consciousness. And ours seems to be having that response,” Negga, 34, said in an interview on ABC News’ “Popcorn with Peter Travers.”

Here are five things to know about the Oscar-nominated actress.

1. She’s Ethiopian, Irish and English.

While watching Negga portray Mildred Loving, you might not realize she has an accent in real life.

Negga was born in Addis Ababa to an Irish mother and an Ethiopian father. She lived there until she moved to England.

“Other people might think I’m quite exotic, but for me, that’s my normality,” Negga said. “I feel very much a part of all of these different worlds.”

2. She knew she wanted to be an actress even when she was a young girl.

One of Negga’s favorite activities as a child was renting movies on a Friday night.

“I’ve always had it in my brain that that was what I was going to do,” Negga said of wanting to be an actress. “Movies were my first love.”

3. One of her favorite films is "All About Eve."

Some of the movies Negga grew up watching were comedies like “Big Business” and “Outrageous Fortune,” and fantasies, such as “Legend” and “Labyrinth.”

But she told Travers that one of her favorite movies ever is “All About Eve.”

4. She hates when the word “strong” is used to describe people.

“There’s so much more to say than 'strong,'” Negga explained. “Strong can be everything. Strong doesn’t have to be necessarily physically tough.”

5. She’s on the small screen too.

You might recognize Negga on television as Raina on ABC’s “Agents of SHIELD” or Tulip on AMC’s “Preacher.”

“The great thing about playing Tulip is that she’s -- like Mildred -- you feel like you’re playing a full human being rather than someone’s idea of what a strong female character is,” she said of her role on “Preacher.”An Ivy League university informed more than 200 students that they'd been accepted earlier this week, but it turned out to be a mistake.

Columbia University said it accidentally sent acceptance emails to 277 prospective students on Wednesday and then recalled them.

The university said the notices "incorrectly implied" that they'd been admitted to its Mailman School of Public Health Master's program. Columbia said it sent a follow-up email within an hour saying the initial notice was sent erroneously.

Columbia attributed the mix-up to "human error" and said it is working to strengthen its procedures.

"We deeply apologize for this miscommunication. We value the energy and enthusiasm that our applicants bring to the admissions process, and regret the stress and confusion caused by this mistake," Julie Kornfeld, Vice Dean for Education at Columbia University, told ABC News in a statement on Friday.

"We are working assiduously to strengthen our internal procedures in order to ensure that this mistake does not happen in the future," the statement continued.

The university did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for additional information on what will happen to those students' applications.

Columbia is not the first university to make such a mistake.

In 2015, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh said it mistakenly informed 800 applicants that they were accepted into their master’s program in computer science, the university said on its website.

And just last year, the University of Buffalo sent out 5,109 acceptance letters in error, according to CNN.Welcome to our live blog of tonight’s New Hampshire Senate debate! The showdown between Democratic Sen.

Eastern.8 Presidents Who've Visited The Iowa State Fair

ABC’s LOUISE SIMPSON: The Iowa State Fair’s ties to politics goes all the way back to

the ‘50s. Eight presidents have visited the fair – either in office, as candidates, or having left office.

Herbert Hoover: Former President Hoover visited the fair in 1954 at its centennial with then-President Eisenhower. The Fair’s 100th anniversary celebration included a horse caravan with 509 people and 471 horses. A 20-foot time capsule called the Centurlon was created, and will be unearthed at the 2054 State Fair.

Dwight D. Eisenhower: Eisenhower attended the 1954 Fair with Hoover early into his presidency. He gave an address, in which he said, “I saw in a squib in the paper that there was some anxiety, if not irritation, because it was said I was not going to pay my fifty cents to get into the Fair. Now, on behalf of a former President of the United States and myself, I hereby tender to Governor Beardsley one dollar, and hope that he will pass it on to the proper authorities,” which was met with laughter.

Gerald Ford: Then-President Ford made an appearance at the Fair in 1975, themed, “The Colonizers.” The fair that year featured a British premier show with English singers, artists and folk dancers. There was a Machine Area, where one had the opportunity to pay for a slot to exhibit machinery in a large arena. Ford gave a speech to 10,000 in the Grandstand, saying, “First, I'd like to congratulate Ken [Falk, Secretary of the Fair] for the fine job that he has done with the arrangements for the fair. Since I don't qualify for kid's day, free admission, I will gladly give Ken my $2 to pay my way in.”

Richard Nixon: Nixon attended the Fair in 1960 as a presidential candidate against John F. Kennedy, and posed for a picture with two ears of corn.

Jimmy Carter: Then-candidate Jimmy Carter attended the Fair in 1976, and gave a speech on agriculture after the “Lemonade and Peanuts” gathering on the farm.

Ronald Reagan: Reagan attended the Fair long before he was president in the 1930s as a sports broadcaster for WHO Radio. He broadcasted baseball games and was named WHO’s sports director. The Fair recreated WHO Radio in 1987, and continues to broadcast live during the Fair.

George W. Bush: Bush attended the Fair as president in 2002. He was quoted as saying, “I came off my ranch today in Crawford. There are not many places that would kind of lure me away, but the Iowa State Fair is one.”



Barack Obama: Most recently, Obama attended the Fair in 2007 as a candidate and 2012 as the president running for re-election. In 2008, he brought the First Lady and their two daughters, where they rode the rides and ate caramel corn. Obama even won the endorsement of Norma Lyon, the Butter-Cow Lady. In 2012, he ate pork on a stick and bought 10 people beers as chants of “Four More Years!” turned to “Four More Beers!”One 7-year-old is planning ahead when it comes to her career.

Two weeks ago Chloe Bridgewater wrote a letter to Google, expressing her interest in working for the tech company when she gets older. To her father Andy's surprise, CEO Sundar Pichai responded.

Chloe started her letter with "Dear google boss."

"My name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with google [sic]," she wrote. "I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics."

The student said she likes computers "and have a tablet I play games on." She even bragged about a robot game that her dad gave her.

It wasn't long before Pichai replied with his own letter on Google stationary.

In a letter dated Feb. 3, Pichai wrote, "Dear Chloe, Thank you so much for your letter. I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology."

"I think if you keep working hard and [follow] your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to -- from working at Google to swimming in the Olympics," he continued. "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school!"

Bridgewater told ABC News he was "completely shocked" that his daughter received a response. But he wasn't surprised that she decided to write the letter in the first place.

"She's got determination. She doesn't see the obstacles that we face every day," he explained. "If she wants to do it, she will set out to do it and nothing will stop her."

The father of two remarked that his daughter began "jumping up and down" after receiving the letter.

Still, he's not in a rush to send his eldest daughter off to work.

"My wife and I want for her to be a 7-year-old first and foremost -- play games, laugh and run around," he said. "We'll always encourage her and help inspire her dreams."
