Audio From Trump’s Secret Golf Club Speeches Just Leaked, And It’s Disturbing

A secret audio recording has been unearthed that shows immediately after winning the 2016 presidential election in November President-elect Donald Trump invited members of his Bedminster, New Jersey “Trump Golf Club” to help him pick the individuals who would be running his government.

Did Trump know the backgrounds of the individuals in regards to their human resource capabilities in his audience beyond that they paid him a hefty sum of money to be there? Of course not.

Trump made the comments on the secret recording during a cocktail party where he was his usual bloviating aggrandizing self. Trump said:

We’re doing a lot of interviews tomorrow. Generals, dictators, we have everything. You may wanna come around. It’ll be fun. We’re really working tomorrow. We have meetings every 15, 20 minutes with different people that will form our government. We’re going to be interviewing everybody. Treasury, we’re going to be interviewing Secretary of State. We have everybody coming in — if you want to come around, it’s going to be unbelievable so you might want to come along.
Before he left office, former President Barack Obama dealt with the criticism of Trump at every turn, and one wonders how Trump is able to balance his stunning hypocrisy now that he sits in the Oval Office.

If Obama were to tell a group of his supporters that they were invited to help him pick his cabinet Trump would have sent out a flurry of misspelled and incoherent tweets accusing Obama of treason. Yet, when Trump does it — well that’s no problem.

Trump has an unshakeable affinity for individuals with money and he is not trepidatious about revealing that fact. After inviting the wealthy audience to help him pick his cabinet Trump further stated, “So, this is my real group. These are the people that came here in the beginning, when nobody knew what this monster was gonna turn out to be, right?” Trump cajoled and flattered the audience of around 100 individuals:

You are the special people.
By special Trump was saying that the audience is rich. Not as rich as him, mind you, but rich enough to be in his company. Trump has no tolerance for individuals of lower income status, or of individuals who do not look or think as he does. Given the trainwreck that has been the first three weeks of his presidency, the explanation as to why, beyond Trump’s own ineptitude, is that he literally allowed individuals with no governing experience to influence his decision on who to hire.
