The news organization confirmed the investigations through five current and former government officials with direct knowledge of the situation, shedding light on the scale of the investigation for the first time.

President Donald Trump has claimed numerous times the election was wrought with fraud, yet has insisted it came from the Democrats and illegal immigrant voters.

It seems the FBI does not agree. While their investigations are not centered around the final election results, they are each looking at what role Russia played in hacking the Democratic National Committee and just how much influence the Kremlin had over Trump’s and his campaign.


The White House has been quiet about the investigations, a spokesperson would only point to an earlier quote by Trump during the campaign in which he said, “As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.”

While it has been previously reported that the FBI was looking into the hacks, the number of independent investigations and just what they are looking for was previously unknown.

Of the three, the most damaging to Trump’s presidency could come from FBI counterintelligence agents based in Washington. According to Reuters, “This counterintelligence inquiry includes but is not limited to examination of financial transactions by Russian individuals and companies who are believed to have links to Trump associates.”

If agents find direct ties to Trump or his campaign, this could be grounds for impeachment if our Republican-strangled Congress chooses to act. Just how many ties to foreign corporations or governments Trump has are still unknown, as he still refuses to release his tax returns to the public.

Previous reports have indicated that Trump and some of his staff could be victims of Russian blackmail. Hopefully, these investigations can shed some light on just how serious this claim really is.

If the President of the United States was installed or was blackmailed by a hostile foreign government, the American people deserve to know.
