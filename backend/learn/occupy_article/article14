Alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos paid a visit this week to Real Time with Bill Maher, and former Comedy Central host, Larry Wilmore, took down the neo-nazi poster boy with one quick line.

When asked by guest Malcolm Nance how Yiannopoulos, a Jewish gay man can be the face of the alt-right, a racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, nationalistic movement, Yiannopoulos replied that it was all of those on the far-right and far-left that hated him.

Then, Wilmore replied with the perfect response that sent the audience into a fit of laughter and left the neo-nazi fascist humiliated.
